5000|$|The L 4500 is a {{truck with}} a long bonnet, U-shape ladder frame and both front and rear rigid axle. Each axle has leaf springs. The front axle has single wheels while the rear axle has double wheels. The tyres have the size 10.5—20. A pneumo-hydraulic brake-system is used, each wheel has a drum brake, the parking brake locks the rear wheels only. For {{steering}} a ZF Type 721 is used. From the engine, the torque is transmitted to a manual five-speed gearbox with a single disk dry <b>cluth.</b> The gearbox also has a reduction gear. Only the rear wheels are driven. Unlike the L 4500S, the L 4500 A has an offroad gear which automatically switches on the front-wheel-drive as well. The Mercedes-Benz OM 67/4 Diesel engine is used. It is a six-cylinder inline four-stroke precombustion-chamber-injected and water-cooled diesel engine with OHV-Valvetrain.|$|E

The study hypothesis cooperative learning methods type STAD (Student Team Acvhievement Division) can Improving learning achievement <b>cluth</b> system subject in students of class XI TKR Kalianda 2 Vocational Hight School of South Lampung. This research was conducted in Kalianda 2 Vocational Hight School on May 10 until June 10. This type of research is a classroom action research (CAR). The research subjects is students of class XI TKR totaling 32 students. The research object is cooperative learning methods type STAD (Student Team Acvhievement Division) Improving learning achievement <b>cluth</b> system subject. Data collection techniques with engineering tests, observation sheets, and documentation. Qualitative and quantitative approaches with 3 cycles. Each cycle consists of planning, implementation (interview, observation, documentation, and testing), observation and reflection. The validity of the formula obtained by product moment correlation. Reliability was obtained by the formula alpha cronbacht. The study found the following results: (1) cooperative learning methods type STAD (Student Team Acvhievement Division) can Improving learning achievement <b>cluth</b> system subject in students of class XI TKR Kalianda 2 Vocational Hight School of South Lampung [...] Student achievement in pre-test of 48. 12 is increased in the post-test first cycle to 60. 78, then increased in the post-test cycle II to 70. 31 and the last increase in the third cycle into 80. 78.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of grooves on cooling performance of wet clutch, a numerical analys{{is based on the}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT is presented in this study. This analysis is based on the numerical solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation, coupled with the energy equation in the flow and the heat conduction equations in the friction material and the core disk. The turbulence characteristics were predicted using RNGk − ε model. The flow field and temperature distributions in radial grooves are obtained. It is shown that radial grooves possess the highest heat exchange performance at the entrance and is not linear distribution in the radial direction and cooling oil flow has a little effect on the highest temperature of friction plate. With the developed analysis method, it is possible to easily and quickly investigate the heat transfer behaviour of wet <b>cluth</b> with groove patterns...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to the survival of the Africa Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) population that breeding at the nest site is successful and that large numbers of chicks are fledged into the breeding population. Nest distribution on Bird Island is not random and locality preferences for breeding exist. Although it seems that sufficient area exists on Bird Island for penguin nests, it can hardly be considered as suitable to optimise breeding. During prolonged heat conditions, breeders relocated to nest sites that were sheltered. Nests that were below ground in burrows was the only habitat that did not suffer nest desertion whilst all the other habitat types (including those that were sheltered) experienced 2 - 3 fold declines in nest numbers. Nests density and the selection of suitable nest sites are significantly influenced by the stage of breeding that the majority of birds are in, yet nests that are shaded, well-ventilated and protected seem to be the most preferred sites for breeding. Adults that attempt to breed are considered then to be in a healthy condition and will usually lay a double clutch (Randell 1983). The frequency of double clutches being laid during the peak breeding attempt was significantly higher compared to the replacement one. Breeding failure was fairly similar to breeding success during the incubation stage for nests with double clutches however, was substantially higher in single clutches. The growth rate of chicks was best fit to the von Bertalanffy growth curve in 90 percent of the cases. The overall growth rate of chicks from double broods was faster than from single broods, however was not significant. A-chicks maitain a high growth rate until they fledged. Yet, the sibling B-chick recorded the lowest growth rate of the successfully fledged chicks and up to until day 30 recorded a similar weight to those chicks that failed to fledge. Contrary to findings of Randall (1983), chicks from single broods delayed fledging, recorded lowest overall growth rates and experienced the greatest weight loss of all groups, yet fledged successfully. In order for chicks to fledge successfully, they needed to obtain a weight of 1060 g before day 30. 5 in their growth cycles to avoid death due to startvation later on. Single chicks that are raised from a double <b>cluth,</b> fledged more other than chicks raised from a single clutch. Unfit or ill-adapted breeders that are marginal in the capabilities of raising offspring, already manifest in a small clutch size and offspring unable to obtain adequate weights during the initial stages of growt...|$|E
