40|$|Expression of {{cathepsin}} (<b>cat)</b> <b>S,</b> a lysosomal cysteine protease, {{has recently}} been shown to cause an increase in production of amyloid beta-peptides in transfected human cells. In this study, we examined the presence and localization of <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> by immunocytochemistry in 21 control, 24 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 10 Down syndrome (DS) postmortem brains. An antiserum to a human <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> fusion protein was affinity purified and its specificity confirmed by abolition of immunoreactivity after adsorption with <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> but not <b>cat</b> L fusion protein. A small minority of control cases showed light, focal staining of scattered cortical neurons. Many control cases, {{as well as most}} AD and DS cases, showed prominent staining of vascular smooth muscle cells, particularly in leptomeningeal vessels. Both AD and DS brain tissue showed increased immunoreactivity in a subset of neocortical and hippocampal neurons and glia. <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> immunoreactivity occurred in a granular, cytoplasmic pattern in some neurons or in a more dense staining pattern in certain neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons. Cat S-positive neurons were also present in amygdala and basal forebrain in AD brains. A subset of astrocytes were immunoreactive with the <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> antibody in AD and DS but not in control brains. In rare AD cases, <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> immunostaining was observed in astrocytes in the periphery of amyloid-beta-containing plaques. These results suggest that <b>cat</b> <b>S</b> is up-regulated in AD and DS brain.

40|$|Smooth {{muscle cell}} (SMC) {{migration}} from the tunica media to the intima, a key event in neointimal formation, requires proteolytic degradation of elastin-rich extracellular matrix barriers. Although cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S)</b> is overexpressed in atherosclerotic and neointimal lesions, its exact role in SMC behavior remains primarily unresolved. We examined {{the involvement of}} <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> on SMC migration through an extracellular matrix barrier and its localization in SMCs. A selective <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> inhibitor and the endogenous inhibitor cystatin C significantly attenuated SMC invasion across elastin gel.

40|$|Nitrated {{fatty acids}} (NFAs), {{endogenous}} products of nonenzymatic reactions of NO-derived reactive nitrogen species with unsaturated fatty acids, exhibit substantial anti-inflammatory activities. They are both reversible electrophiles and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists, but the physiological implications of their electrophilic activity are poorly understood. We tested {{their effects on}} inflammatory and emphysema-related biomarkers in alveolar macrophages (AMs) of smoke-exposed mice. NFA (10 -nitro-oleic acid or 12 -nitrolinoleic acid) treatment downregulated expression and activity of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB while upregulating those of PPARγ. It also downregulated production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and of the protease cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S),</b> a key mediator of emphysematous septal destruction. <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> downregulation was accompanied by decreased AM elastolytic activity, a major mechanism of septal destruction. NFAs downregulated both <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> expression and activity in AMs of wild-type mice, but only inhibited its activity in AMs of PPARγ knockout mice, pointing to a PPARγ-independent mechanism of enzyme inhibition. We hypothesized that this mechanism was electrophilic S-alkylation of target <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> cysteines, and found that NFAs bind directly to <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> following treatment of intact AMs and, as suggested by in silico modeling and calculation of relevant parameters, elicit S-alkylation of Cys 25 when incubated with purified <b>Cat</b> <b>S.</b> These results demonstrate that NFAs' electrophilic activity, {{in addition to their}} role as PPARγ agonists, underlies their protective effects in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and support their therapeutic potential in this disease...|$|R

40|$|By {{regulating}} invariant (Ii) chain {{processing and}} MHC class II peptide loading, the endosomal protease cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S)</b> has a potential role in autoimmune susceptibility. Indeed, <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> null mice {{are resistant to}} I-Ab-restricted experimental myasthenia gravis due to inadequate peptide presentation. To explore the role of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in a Graves' disease model, I-Ad-restricted wild-type (WT) and Cat S–/– mice were immunized with adenovirus encoding the A subunit of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). TSHR adenovirus immunized mice develop Th 1 T cells, TSHR antibodies, and a proportion become overtly hyperthyroid. Although TSHR presentation in vitro was initially impaired in Cat S–/– mice, subsequent TSHR presentation in vitro and disease development were similar in both groups but with higher antibody responses in <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> null mice. WT and Cat S–/– mice recognized similar T cell epitopes from a panel of overlapping TSHR peptides.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S)</b> is overexpressed {{in human}} {{atherosclerotic}} and aneurysmal tissues and may contributes to degradation of extracellular matrix, especially elastin, in inflammatory diseases. We aimed {{to define the}} role of <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in cardiac inflammation and fibrosis induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cat S-knockout (Cat S(-/-)) and littermate wild-type (WT) C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were infused continuously with Ang II (750 ng/kg/min) or saline for 7 days. Cat S(-/-) mice showed severe cardiac fibrosis, including elevated expression of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), as compared with WT mice. Moreover, macrophage infiltration and expression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β and interleukin 1 β) were significantly greater in Cat S(-/-) than WT hearts. These Ang II-induced effects in Cat S(-/-) mouse hearts was associated with abnormal accumulation of autophagosomes and reduced clearance of damaged mitochondria, which led to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in macrophages. CONCLUSION: <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> in lysosomes is essential for mitophagy processing in macrophages, deficiency in <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> can increase damaged mitochondria and elevate ROS levels and NF-κB activity in hypertensive mice, so it regulates cardiac inflammation and fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Human {{atherosclerotic}} lesions overexpress the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin <b>S</b> (<b>Cat</b> <b>S),</b> one of {{the most}} potent mammalian elastases known. In contrast, atheromata have low levels of the endogenous <b>Cat</b> <b>S</b> inhibitor cystatin C compared with normal arteries, suggesting involvement of this protease in atherogenesis. The present study tested this hypothesis directly by crossing Cat S–deficient (CatS–/–) mice with LDL receptor–deficient (LDLR–/–) mice that develop atherosclerosis on a high-cholesterol diet. Compared with LDLR–/– mice, double-knockout mice (CatS–/–LDLR–/–) developed significantly less atherosclerosis, as indicated by plaque size (plaque area and intimal thickening) and stage of development. These mice also had markedly reduced content of intimal macrophages, lipids, smooth muscle cells, collagen, CD 4 + T lymphocytes, and levels of IFN-γ. CatS–/–LDLR–/– monocytes showed impaired subendothelial basement membrane transmigration, and aortas from CatS–/–LDLR–/– mice had preserved elastic laminae.

40|$|Human {{resources}} personnel may {{be surprised}} to learn that they are now vulnerable to a lawsuit when a plaintiff invokes the 2 ̆ 2 cat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paw</b> 2 ̆ 2 legal doctrine. In an issue of first impression, the Seventh Circuit found that, pursuant to a 42 U. S. C. § 1981 retaliation claim, an employee can be held individually liable for his or her actions that contributed to an adverse employment action against a fellow employee. Now, not only are employers held liable under 2 ̆ 2 cat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paw,</b> 2 ̆ 2 employees are too. The concept of 2 ̆ 2 cat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paw</b> 2 ̆ 2 applies to an employment discrimination action when a final decision-maker relies on a subordinate 2 ̆ 7 s recommendation that is motivated by discriminatory animus, and then that final decision-maker takes an adverse employment action against another employee. In 2012, in Smith v. Bray, the Seventh Circuit had the opportunity to rule on a case where a plaintiff brought an employment discrimination suit under § 1981 against an individual. The court correctly found that in certain circumstances, an employee can be liable for his or her actions that contribute to an adverse employment action against a fellow employee. First, expanding liability is proper because, similar to 42 U. S. C. § 1983 under which multiple circuits have approved of individual liability, § 1981 supports holding individuals accountable for the deprivation of another individual 2 ̆ 7 s civil rights. Additionally, fairness dictates that courts may hold a malicious individual, not just the employer, liable in a § 1981 action, especially if recovering from that individual is the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s only chance at being made whole. This Note discusses how the Supreme Court, the Seventh Circuit, and other federal circuits have interpreted the 2 ̆ 2 cat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paw</b> 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, and argues that it is appropriate in specific circumstances to expand the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s sphere of liability to include employees who intentionally cause an adverse employment action. This Note concludes that the Seventh Circuit is correct in its decision to create liability for an individual employee in a § 1981 retaliation action...|$|R

The cat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paw</b> doctrine holds employers vicariously liable when an employee involved in the decisionmaking process, other than the non-biased formal decisionmaker, possessed discriminatory intent. Currently, the circuits disagree about how much control the biased employee must possess over the decisionmaker to impose liability on the employer. In Staub, the Seventh Circuit held that liability should be imposed only when the biased employee possessed 2 ̆ 2 singular influence 2 ̆ 2 over the formal decisionmaker, aligning the court most closely with the Fourth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s stringent 2 ̆ 2 actual decisionmaker 2 ̆ 2 rule. In light of the current circuit split, this Note argues that a coherent and uniform standard needs to be adopted to decide these common cases. It analyzes {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the circuits 2 ̆ 7 various rules, concluding that no current approach provides a satisfying solution. Accordingly, this Note suggests that courts should adopt the 2 ̆ 2 motivating factor 2 ̆ 2 standard of causation, should more carefully scrutinize whether an independent investigation breaks the causal chain, and should apply agency principles as a proper limitation on liability...|$|R
