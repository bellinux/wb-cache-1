Firstly, we analyze the effects of transportation mode (including transportation costs and transportation-induced <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions),</b> initial <b>emissions</b> allowances, <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price and consumer sensitivity to <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> on the optimum decisions and profits of retailers. The results demonstrate that when consumers are less sensitive to price, the optimum retail price and the optimum order quantity of products are proportional to the transportation cost and transportation-induced <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> of retailers per unit product, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price as well as consumer sensitivity to <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> However, when consumers are highly sensitive to price, the optimum order quantity of products is inversely proportional to the transportation costs and transportation-induced <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> of retailers per unit product, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price and consumer sensitivity to <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> In addition, the optimum retail price of products is inversely proportional to consumer sensitivity to <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> We also find that retailers prefer a low-carbon transportation mode when the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price is high. Meanwhile, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price influences the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading volume of retailers.

Obama attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which drafted the non-binding Copenhagen Accord as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. The deal provided for the monitoring of carbon emissions among developing countries, but it did not include Obama's proposal to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050. In 2014, Obama reached an agreement with China in which China pledged to reach peak <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> levels by 2030, while the US pledged to cut its emissions by 26-28 percent compared to its 2005 levels. The deal provided momentum for a potential multilateral global warming agreement among the world's largest carbon emitters. Many Republicans criticized Obama's climate goals as a potential drain on the economy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly {{every country in the world}} agreed to a landmark climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement created a universal accounting system for emissions, required each country to monitor its emissions, and required each country to create a plan to reduce its emissions. Several climate negotiators noted that the US-China climate deal and the EPA's emission limits helped make the deal possible. In 2016, the international community agreed to the Kigali accord, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol which sought to reduce the use of HFCs, organic compounds that contribute to global warming.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{within the field}} of {{agriculture}} that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals. Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission.</b> Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels {{from the beginning of the}} process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors. The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E

40|$|Among {{studies of}} the factors that {{influence}} <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> and related regulations, economic aggregates, industrial structures, energy structures, population levels, and energy prices have been extensively explored, whereas studies from the perspective of fiscal leverage, particularly of local government investment (LGI), are rare. Of the limited number of studies on the effect of LGI on <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions,</b> most focus on its direct effect. Few studies consider regulatory effects, and {{there is a lack of}} emphasis on local areas. Using a cointegration test, a panel data model and clustering analysis based on Chinese data between 2000 and 2013, this study measures the direct role of LGI in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions reduction. First, overall, within the sample time period, a 1 % increase in LGI inhibits <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> by 0. 8906 % and 0. 5851 % through its influence on the industrial structure and energy efficiency, respectively, with the industrial structure path playing a greater role than the efficiency path. Second, <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> to some extent exhibit inertia. The previous year's <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> impact the following year's <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> by 0. 5375 %. Thus, if a reduction in <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> in the previous year has a positive effect, then the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> reduction effect generated by LGI in the following year will be magnified. Third, LGI can effectively reduce <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions,</b> but there are significant regional differences in its impact. For example, in some provinces, such as Sichuan and Anhui, economic growth has not been decoupled from <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> Fourth, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> reduction effect in the 30 provinces and municipalities sampled in this study can be classified into five categories-strong, relatively strong, medium, relatively weak and weak-based on the degree of local governments' regulation of <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> The <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> reduction effect of LGI is significant in the western and central regions of China but not in the eastern and northeast regions. This study helps overcome the limitations of previous studies on the regulatory effects of LGI on <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions,</b> and the constructed model may more closely reflect actual economic conditions. Moreover, the current study can benefit countries similar to China that aim to objectively identify the impacts of their LGI on <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions,</b> and such countries can use it as a reference in the formulation of investment policies based on their economic and industrial characteristics...|$|R
