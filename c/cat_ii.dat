Federal Aviation Administration's draft AC 20-167A further proposes a descent below 100ft if the required visual references can be observed using the EFVS, similar to <b>Cat</b> <b>II</b> and III approaches with limited instrument landing systems in many small airports.|$|E
25|$|The final {{flight in}} the Category II {{testing of the}} F-105B Thunderchief was flown {{by members of the}} 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Eglin AFB on 31 May 1960. Lt. Col. Robert R.

In <b>Cat</b> <b>II</b> testing, the aircraft, its subsystems and components are evaluated under closely simulated tactical conditions. The F-105B then moved into Category III testing under actual combat conditions by the Tactical Air Command. The 335th TFS remained at Eglin for similar testing of the F-105D.|$|E

25|$|The {{captain was}} 31-year-old Jordi Sola Lopez from Barcelona. The first officer was 27-year-old Andrew Cantle from Sunderland, England. Both were {{employed}} by Air Lada. The captain had logged 1,800 total hours, of which 1,600 {{were on the}} Fairchild Metro III("in type"), but of which just 25 were as pilot-in-command on the aircraft. The first officer had logged 539 total hours, of which 289 were on the aircraft type. Their pairing together on the flight was considered inappropriate and highly unusual, due to their shared lack of total experience. Both pilots were certified for Instrument landing system CAT I; neither pilot, however, was certified for <b>CAT</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E

2500|$|<b>CAT</b> <b>II</b> ILS became {{operational}} on 23 December 2011 {{and reduced}} the visibility requirement for an aircraft landing at Amritsar Airport on Runway 34 from the existing 650 metres to 350 metres benefiting airlines in terms of increased safety and avoiding diversions to other airports resulting in better operational and environmental efficiency. During 2016-17 runway upgrade, the flexible portion runway was strengthed and inset lighting installed for ILS CAT III {{at a cost of}} 150 crores.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010, the {{instrument}} landing system (ILS) was upgraded from Category I to Category II. This included the installation of 800 light emitting diodes (LED) on the runway and taxiway, making Rygge the first airport in Europe with such an installation. It decreased the requirement for visibility from [...] The upgrades cost NOK 65 million, and made Rygge the second airport with ILS <b>Cat</b> <b>II</b> in Norway, after Stavanger Airport, Sola (Gardermoen has Cat III). The same month, Ryanair started new routes to London, Liverpool, Rome, Tampere. At the same time, Norwegian terminated its service to Stavanger.|$|E
2500|$|KLIA {{has three}} {{parallel}} runways, 14L/32R, 14R/32L and 15/33, {{all three of}} which are over [...] long and [...] wide. The length of Runways 14R/32L and 15/33 is [...] while Runway 14L/32R is [...] long. Each runway also has 10 taxiways exit with the taxi time ranging from 2 minutes to 11 minutes. The two full-service runways can handle 120 movements per hour when one runway handles taking off and one runway handles landing. Each runway is also equipped with one completely parallel taxiway with a second parallel taxiway. Unlike airports in temperate countries which often have low visibility as low as [...] that requires higher Instrument Landing System category to guide landing of an aircraft, the airport has <b>CAT</b> <b>II</b> Precision Landing ILS to guide landing aircraft safely under all weather conditions with visibility as low as [...] The runways at KLIA are able to accommodate the Airbus A380.

2500|$|The runway is {{considered}} upgraded to ILS <b>Cat</b> <b>II</b> or III, {{which will allow}} for landing during less visibility. There {{are only a few}} minor investments needed for the upgrade. Avinor estimates {{that there will be a}} need for a second runway at about the mid-2030s. The runway can be located on the current military area and be entirely located north of the terminal area. This would allow a [...] runway, which would be sufficient for Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft. The master plan of 2011 includes plans for expanding the new terminal by placing gates on both sides of the pier and building a new pier to the north, by demolishing the current terminal. By Phase 3C, which is estimated to be carried out by 2060, the airport will have 32 gates and 14 additional apron stands. The last phases of the long-term plan involve demolishing the current terminal and the airport hotel. The Norwegian State Railways has looked at the possibility of building an mainland railway airport rail link from Bergen Station in the city center. The proposal is launched as a response to the idea that a new freight terminal be built at Flesland. If built, the line would run in a tunnel through Løvstakken and travel time would be twenty minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing {{problems}} with the forward-looking radar and other sensor systems (which were ultimately never resolved) on the Tropic Moon III B-57Gs after deployment to Thailand in the September 1970 meant that ADTC testing of the design continued at Eglin into 1971. Concurrently, the Air Force delivered the <b>Cat</b> <b>II</b> test airframe, 53-3906, to Westinghouse Electronic Systems in Maryland for modification under Project Pave Gat to house a special bomb bay installation of one Emerson TAT-161 turret with a single M61 20mm cannon as a gunship. After initial flight tests in the Baltimore area, the gun B-57G was flown to Eglin in January 1971. Delays occurred in testing at Eglin AFB, due to competition for mission time from the Tropic Moon III B-57Gs as the airframe was also used in the radar remedial program, coupled with a spare parts shortage for mandatory maintenance keeping it grounded from 9 April to 16 May. Three of four Pave Gat missions flown on 16 May were aborted due to equipment failures, causing loss of three more weeks of testing. Operational deployment was slipped to October 1971 on 13 May 1971. Once underway, Pave Gat tests proved [...] "that the B-57G could hit stationary or moving targets with its 20mm gun, day or night. Loaded with 4,000 rounds of ammunition, the Pave Gat B-57G could hit as many as 20 targets, {{three times as many}} as the bomb-carrying B-57G. The Pave Gat aircraft could avoid antiaircraft fire by firing from offset positions, while the bomb carrier had to pass directly over the [...] target." [...] Category II and III testing was completed 31 July 1971. Deployment to SEA was resisted, however, by the Seventh and Thirteenth Air Forces and others as the decision had been made in August 1971 to return the B-57G squadron to the U.S. in early 1972, leaving insufficient evaluation time. Project Pave Gat was terminated 21 December 1971.|$|E

40|$|The {{domestic}} cat is an {{invasive species}} that often causes great impacts where introduced {{due to its}} high predatory and reproductive potential, especially on islands. In this study, carried out on Ilha Grande (RJ, Brazil), we aimed to: i) estimate the population density of domestic <b>cats,</b> <b>ii)</b> calculate the number of animals preyed upon annually by domestic cats, and iii) evaluate the efficiency of methods to control the cat population. We used the Vortex program to project the population growth of domestic cats in fifty years, and simulated different scenarios of population control (without control, castration, spay and harvest). Population density of owned cats was 662 cats/km². The annual predation rate was 1. 97 prey animals/cat which is an average of 1497. 96 prey/year. The population would only be reduced if 70 % of females were spayed or removed annually. Measures to control the domestic cat population must be undertaken urgently, since uncontrolled growth of this predator {{has the potential to}} seriously impact the biodiversity of Ilha Grande...|$|R
