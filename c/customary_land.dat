Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people {{may have been a}} family subgroup (or clan) of a larger tribe whom Daisy Bates called Beelgar. According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the Swan and Canning rivers, as far south as Mangles Bay. The group had <b>customary</b> <b>land</b> usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as Lake Monger and northeast to the Helena River. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} years after {{independence}} in 1964, Banda and the governing Malawi Congress Party actively supported the smallholder farming sector, as few European-owned estates remained. Disappointing smallholder production {{and the development of}} a policy of growing Burley tobacco on estates caused the government to transfer land to the estate sector. In 1966, Banda argued that <b>customary</b> <b>land</b> tenure was insecure and inhibited investment. A <b>Customary</b> <b>Land</b> Development Act in 1967 allowed the creation of agricultural leases of up to 99 years over <b>Customary</b> <b>Land.</b> Many estates in the Central Region growing Burley tobacco were controlled by Banda and senior officials and politicians. Land alienation speeded up in the 1970s; however the process differed from that of the early colonial period as most new estates were medium-sized farms and not in the scale of former European-owned estates. This still represented the transfer of land from smallholders to a better off elite.|$|E

However, the dearth of <b>land</b> information on <b>customary</b> <b>lands</b> limits the development and application of land consolidation. This paper presents and discusses the results of an experiment carried out to test the potential of participatory land administration applied on <b>customary</b> <b>lands</b> in support of land consolidation. A brief overview of the evolution of crowdsourced, voluntary, and participatory approaches is provided alongside newly related insights into neogeography and neo-cadastre, and fit-for-purpose and pro-poor land administration. The concept of participatory land administration is then developed in this context. The area of the experiment is in Northern Ghana where the process was developed together with the local farming community. The study involved collecting land information relating to farms over a two-week period, using a mobile app and a satellite image, based on participatory land administration. The results show that Participatory Land Administration can potentially support land consolidation, though further investigation is needed on how it can be integrated into the formal land registration system, into an actual land consolidation project...|$|R

25|$|Papua New Guinea is richly {{endowed with}} natural resources, {{including}} mineral and renewable resources, such as forests, marine (including {{a large portion}} of the world's major tuna stocks), and in some parts agriculture. The rugged terrain — including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands — and high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including serious law and order problems in some centres and the system of <b>customary</b> <b>land</b> title) makes it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education, health, ICT and access to finance. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, oil, and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. Oil palm production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with palm oil now the main agricultural export. In households participating, coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the Highlands provinces), followed by cocoa and coconut oil/copra from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders and tea, produced on estates and rubber. The Iagifu/Hedinia Field was discovered in 1986 in the Papuan fold and thrust belt.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a matter}} of vital {{importance}} because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property — usually land — cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people. The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue {{in recent years has been}} a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of <b>customary</b> <b>land,</b> purportedly for agricultural projects, but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging — circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners approval). Following a national outcry, these SABLs have been subject to a Commission of Inquiry, established in mid-2011, for which the report is still awaited for initial presentation to the Prime Minister and Parliament.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} appointment, he {{announced}} his intention to reform land law, to enshrine customary ownership of lands, and ensure that lands could not be leased {{without the consent of}} their collective traditional owners. This would be achieved by drawing inspiration from the Australian Northern Territory’s Northern Land Council, which is designed to safeguard Aboriginal <b>customary</b> <b>land</b> ownership. Describing himself as a “notorious critic” of free trade and foreign ownership of lands, he added: [...] "New Zealand, Australia and the World Bank are saying that we need to get away from , but I totally disagree.

The bill based on his proposals was adopted as the <b>Customary</b> <b>Land</b> Management Act in December 2013.
