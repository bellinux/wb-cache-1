40|$|AbstractPurpose: Thrombosis {{associated}} with central venous catheters {{is a significant}} cause of device failure, morbidity, and loss of access sites. We hypothesized that central vein thrombosis is caused by catheter injury to the vein wall and {{that it can be}} reduced by stabilizing the catheter tip. To test these hypotheses, we studied central vein catheters in a porcine model. Test catheters had a silicone-encased stainless steel loop at the indwelling end that <b>contacted</b> the <b>vein</b> wall and stabilized the catheter tip {{in the center of the}} vessel. Methods: Sealed silicon elastic (Silastic) catheters (3. 2 mm outer diameter) with and without a stabilizing loop were inserted via the external jugular vein into the superior vena cava just above the right atrium. Animals were killed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and the vena cava was inspected for the presence of thrombus and entrapment of the catheter tip. Results: In control animals mural thrombus developed at the site of the catheter tip. This thrombus organized by invasion of macrophages and smooth muscle cells, eventually forming a lesion similar to intimal hyperplasia. Lesion cross-sectional area was significantly smaller in animals with loop catheters than in control animals at 2 weeks (1. 2 ± 1. 3 vs 34. 5 ± 23. 9 mm 2; p = 0. 05) and 4 weeks (2. 8 ± 0. 3 vs 13. 9 ± 5. 8 mm 2; p < 0. 05). By 8 weeks the vena cava was nearly occluded in most animals and the catheter tip was entrapped in this lesion in all cases. Test catheters eliminated the injury process for up to 8 weeks (p < 0. 01, χ 2 control vs loop catheter entrapment). Very little injury response was found where the loop <b>contacted</b> the <b>vein</b> wall, and the catheter tip was free of thrombus in all cases. Conclusions: Mural thrombosis at the tip of indwelling central catheters is caused by chronic mechanical venous wall injury. Vessel injury and the resulting thrombosis can be prevented by a catheter modification that stabilizes the tip. Such a catheter may significantly reduce catheter malfunction and morbidity {{associated with}} these devices. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 28 : 59 - 66. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of the}} formation of pseudotachylitic bodies in large impact structures by macro- to microscopic structural, petrographic and geochemical analysis of pseudotachylitic breccias and host rock of the Schurwedraai and Baviaan-Krantz Alkali Granite Complex. This complex is one of five ultramafic-mafic and felsic intrusions in the Late Archean to Paleoproterozoic, subvertical to overturned supracrustal collar rocks of the Vredefort Dome. The pluton intruded into the lower Witwatersrand Supergroup at ˜ 2. 05 Ga ago (Graham et al. 2005). Pre-impact lithological heterogeneities are absent in the complex, and pre-impact textural and structural features are scarce in contrast to the Archean granitic gneiss of the core of the dome and the metasedimentary collar strata. For the pre-impact metamorphism of the alkali granite a temperature of 300 - 400 ◦C is estimated (Gibson et al. 1995). The alkali granite is whitish to reddish, homogeneous, and massive, with hypideomorph minerals, mostly of medium to fine grain size. It consists of quartz, K-feldspar, albite, potassic amphibole, potassic pyroxene, and minor biotite. Veins of aplitic and pegmatitic nepheline syenite, quartz, K-feldspar with hornblende and aegerine are common. Pseudotachylitic breccia occurrence is widespread.

The Boucheville Basin formed during the Albian extensional regime and was filled by the so-called “Albian flysch”. The basin underwent a thermal overprint (the North Pyrenean Metamorphism) related to the exhumation of nearby mantle rocks that advected large amounts of heat to the upper crustal levels.

Skarn W–Mo ore bodies are hosted in the contact zone between the granodiorite and Cambrian limestone strata.

Automated classification of geologic / landscape features using radiance data aids in generation of distribution maps for particular features (i. e. alteration type) whereas analysis of reflectance data allows for abundance mapping.

The pericentral hepatocytes are the most distal hepatocytes with respect to acinar blood flow, whereas {{this is not necessarily}} the case for hepatocytes next to the large collecting hepatic veins. This result implies that it is contact with some hepatic venous element which signals positional expression. In an effort to induce conditions that change relationships between hepatocytes and blood vessels, regenerating liver was studied. After surgical removal of two-thirds or more of the liver, there was no noticeable change in GS or OAT expression in the remaining liver tissue during regeneration. However, treatment with carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4), which specifically kills pericentral hepatocytes, completely removed GS- and OAT-containing cells and promptly halted hepatic transcription of GS.

The catheter centres the laser fibre in the <b>vein</b> preventing direct <b>contact</b> with the <b>vein</b> wall. This study aims to establish whether prevention of direct contact between the fibre tip and the vein wall prevents ulceration and perforation of the vein wall and perivenous tissue destruction. Materials and MethodsTen lateral saphenous veins were treated, using the tulip catheter, in goats under general anaesthesia. Ten more veins were treated with a normal bare fibre. We used a 980 nm diode laser to provide the energy. Postoperatively the veins were removed immediately, at 10 days and after 3 weeks for histological examination. Destruction of the vessel wall was measured and perivenous tissue destruction was quantified using a graded scale. ResultsUlceration and perforation were prevented when using the tulip catheter. It also achieved more even vein wall necrosis. Tulip-catheter-treated veins show a transmural vein wall necrosis in, on average, 80 % of the total circumference compared to 64 % in bare-fibre treated veins. Less perivenous tissue destruction was seen with the new catheter (perivenous tissue destruction scale: tulip catheter: 1. 7 vs. bare fibre: 3. 8). Three weeks after treatment, we found regression of the perivenous tissue destruction as the healing process continued. ConclusionsEVLA using the tulip catheter avoids ulceration and perforation of the vein associated with treatment using a bare fibre.

40|$|Picrite basalt tuffs and lavas {{from the}} Miocene basalt plateau of Vitim (Trans Baikal, Russia) contain {{abundant}} megacrysts and varied pyroxenite and mantle lherzolite xenoliths (spinel facies and {{upper part of}} the garnet-facies) and crustal cumulates. Black pyroxenites and megacrysts show decreasing temperatures from 1350 to 900 oC, and range from high-T dark green websterites and clinopyroxenites, to low-T black megacrystalline garnet clinopyroxenites and phlogopite-ilmenite-bearing varieties. Garnet-bearing Cr-diopside veins and zoned veins with mica and rare amphiboles cross- cut peridotite xenoliths. Veins consisting of almost pure amphibole are more common in spinel lherzolite xenoliths. P-T calculations for pyroxenites yield pressure intervals at 3. 3 - 2. 3, 2. 2 - 2. 0, 1. 9 - 1. 5 and 1. 3 - 1. 0 GPa, probably corresponding to the locations of dense magmatic vein networks in mantle. Major and trace elements for clinopyroxenes from the black megacrystalline series can be modeled by fractional crystallization of a picrite-basalt melt. In contrast, green high-temperature pyroxenites and black giant-grained garnet pyroxenites with lower LREE-enrichment and variable LILE and HFSE concentrations probably result from AFC processes and mixing with partial melts derived from older pyroxenites and peridotites. Gray low-Cr garnet clinopyroxenites with highly fractionated and inflected trace element patterns may have been formed by remelting of metasomatic veins within peridotites. Multistage melting of metasomatic assemblages with selective removal of clinopyroxene in <b>vein</b> <b>contacts</b> produce the REE patterns with low MREE concentrations and usually with elevated HFSE contents. Cr-diopside veins were most probably formed by partial melting of phlogopite- and/or amphibole-bearing lherzolites.

Surface exploration revealed low but consistent gold values associated with the chalcedony veins. The veins are hosted by flat-lying Miocene dacites, and structurally juxtaposed fine-grained Ordovician sedimentary rocks of the Valmy Formation. Preliminary analyses of the relict hydrothermal system revealed sparse mineralogy. The system is dominated by quartz, pyrite, and clay minerals; base metal sulfides and fluid inclusions are absent. Analyses of precious metal data reveals that significant mineralization occurs in the wallrock despite sharp <b>vein</b> <b>contacts,</b> lack of brecciation, and apparent lack of alteration. Although elevated values of arsenic do occur, anomalous values of As, Sb, and Ti do not occur outside of mineralized zones, and are not useful as pathfinder elements. In 1983, Chevron drilled seven exploration holes, encountered only weak precious metals, and dropped the property. Analyses of drill cuttings reveal widespread advanced argillic alteration and secondary iron oxides. Xray analyses of clays indicate the system is dominated by kaolinite with subordinate montmorillonite and illite/sericite. Secondary potassic alteration {{takes the form of}} sericite rather than adularia. Higher Ag/Au ratios in the Valmy Formation are likely the result of residual silver in the sedimentary rocks rather than hydrothermal zoning. Base metals, although very weak, indicate zoning trends and are inversely correlative with gold. Major elements shifts are roughly conformable to the fluid mobility of those elements. Si and K are generally enriched; Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, and Mn generally depleted. These metasomatic reactions produced moderate increases in mass and volume ranging from 10 % to 30 %.

These adhesions not only occur at the lead tip but are commonly found anywhere along the whole length of the lead at sites where the lead is in <b>contact</b> with the <b>vein</b> or the myocardium 1, 2, 3, 4. These adhesions hamper lead removal as tight scar tissue can withhold the leads during traction. This not only occurs {{at the level of}} the flings and tines of passive fixation leads but at any level of the lead body, especially at sites of unequal diameter for example electrodes and defibrillator coils. Further the lead tip is often larger than the lead body due to the fixation mechanism and adhering scar tissue and can become impacted on withdrawal in the narrow canal provided by the fibrous envelope. Force applied to leads is limited by the tensile strength of the insulation and conductor coils of the leads. They may severe with forceful traction, and denuded indwelling lead fragments have a higher incidence of thrombo-fibrotic complications and may maintain infection 5, 6, 7, 8. Force is also limited by the impact of traction on the veins and myocardium. Unopposed traction can lead to invagination of the myocardium, myocardial rupture, arrhythmia, hypotension or avulsion of a tricuspid valve leaflet 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Therefore, additional tools have been developed to assist in freeing the lead body from the adhesions as well as the lead tip from the myocardium, to prevent laceration of the myocardium and to provide enough room for the lead to be withdrawn whilst preventing disintegration of the lead.

40|$|The Cruzeiro do Sul Granodiorite {{is located}} in the Eastern portion of the Sul-rio-grandense shield. It forms one ENE-WSW {{elongate}} body of approximately 4 km² within a sinistral strike slip shear zone. The rocks were originally considered as part of the Arroio dos Ratos Complex, but they were recently mapped as a separate unit because igneous textures are widely preserved and they are intrusive in the gneissis complex rocks. The Cruzeiro do Sul Granodiorite is thus a porphyritic horblende-biotite granodiorite in a mafic-rich (M’ ~ 20), medium-grained matrix. The magmatic foliation is marked by the shape alignment of feldspar megacrystals and mafic minerals. A solid-state, mylonitic structure is well-developed mainly near the <b>contacts.</b> Leucocratic <b>veins</b> are found both concordant and discordant to the main foliation, and they may give rise to a composite banding within high-strain zones, together with elongate mafic microgranular enclaves and synplutonic dykes of tonalitic to dioritic composition. The mylonitic foliation trends EW to ENE-WSW with medium to steep dip, and contains a shallow plunging stretching lineation, which indicates a transcurrent kinematic for this shear zone. Structural evidences, such as the parallelism and progressive evolution of mylonitic foliation relative to the magmatic one, as well as the elongated form of granodioritic bodies and the concordant character of planar structures with the ENE shear zone, are interpreted as an indication of syntectonic emplacement. Moreover, the absence of metamorphic foliation reworked by mylonitic shows that the Cruzeiro do Sul Granodiorite registers only one phase of deformation, which would have occurred during their emplacement. Thus, we have concluded that the Cruzeiro do Sul Granodiorite has no relation with the EW transversal event, and low dip angle responsible for the deformation of Arroio dos Ratos Complex, but is linked to the transcurrent event of Dorsal de Canguçu Shear Zone. The structural and compositional features of Cruzeiro do Sul Granodiorite magmatism are consistent with its post-collisional character, and the shoshonitic affinity is given by its high Sr contents, regular rare earth element chondrite-normalized patterns and the abundance of light rare earth regarding the heavy rare earth elements. Patterns of trace elements with enrichment in Ba and Rb, and impoverishment of High-Field Strength in relation to Large Ion Lithophile Elements is also an important feature of the rocks of shoshonitic affinity. Their medium- to high-K content, and metaluminous to slightly peraluminous characters are possibly indicative of some crustal contamination during their differentiation. The conditions of P and T, calculated with the geobarometer Alt-Hb and Plg-Hb thermobarometer were estimated at about 4. 3 to 5. 3 kbars and crystallization temperatures on the order of 720 to 760 °C.

40|$|The Koulekoun Gold {{project is}} the most {{important}} prospect of Avocet Mining plc. It is one of the projects within the TriK-block in Guinea (West Africa) for which an exploration permit has been granted. The Koulekoun deposit is located within the Siguiri basin of Birimian age in the Eastern Guinea region; where most Guinea’s gold mines are situated. The present study involves the investigation of structural elements (S₀, S₁, S₂, intrusive <b>contacts,</b> faults and <b>veins)</b> from selected drill cores from drill sections that intersect the Koulekoun orebody in four parts of the deposit; characterizes the principal orientations of measured structures and determines their relationships using stereonet; in order to predict important intersections to focus on in exploration programs within the TriK-block and suggests a possible structural model of the Koulekoun deposit. Raw data used for the present research was collected from half-core samples due to the absence of surface outcrop from which direct measurements could have been made. Measured data were interpreted using stereographic projection. Often no preferred orientations of structural elements exist in the area, suggesting a complex structural situation, particularly with regard to hydrothermal vein attitudes. Thus, it has been illustrated from structural data analysis and S₀ data 3 d interpolation of the four sub-structural domains (North-East, North-West, Central and South) that NE-SW structures (S₂, intrusive <b>contact,</b> fault and <b>vein)</b> have controlled the occurrency of gold mineralization in the Koulekoun deposit area. Geometrical relationships between structure main cluster orientation from stereonet analysis show the majority of S₀ moderately E-dipping; intrusive contacts dip at moderate angle to the SE in all zones, except in the North-East zone where they are sub-vertical and SE-dipping. Fault planes show variable orientation of NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W, and steeply SE-dipping. Vein planes correspond to fault systems and show high variability in their orientation with numerous orders of vein direction in each domain. The cross-cutting relationships suggest two principal generations of faults: the NE-SW fault (F 1) and the NW-SE fault (F 2). These two fault systems and their associated vein intersection areas preferably define the ore shoot zones within the Koulekoun deposit. The proposed structural model of the Koulekoun deposit suggests the intersection and interference of major NW-SE and minor NE-SW structures. The interference of folds formed basin-dome structures with oval shape geometries striking NW-SE and that dominantly occur in North-East, North-West and Central zones. The South Zone is characterized by NE-SW gently plunging and moderately inclined folds with NW-SE striking axial surface. Gold mineralization occurs at the edges of basin-dome structures in North-East, North-West and Central zones. Mineralized porphyry intrusions are likely located within the axial surface of the South zone folds and extend toward the Central zone. The proposed model is compliant with the earlier model of the Koulekoun deposit presented by Tenova (2013); Fahey et al. (2013) describing the Koulekoun deposit as an auriferous NE-SW trending fault zone, intersecting a major NW-striking and steeply E-dipping porphyry units. The model also fits within the regional structural context suggested by Lahondere et al.

Comparatively to the three industrial gold deposits (Siguiri, Lero, Kiniero) being currently mined in the Siguiri Basin, and defined as mesothermal vein and lode mineralization hosted in Birimian meta-sedimentary rocks (Lalande, 2005), the Koulekoun gold deposit appears to be a porphyry hosted orogenic disseminated style mineralization system (Fahey et al., 2013). Although, similarities between the Koulekoun gold deposit and these three industrial deposits (Siguiri, Lero, Kiniero) constitute of the intensive extends of the weathering profile and at some stages, by the existence of numerous ring-shaped and curved lineaments enhanced by drag folding (Lero deposit for instance). It is therefore recommended that targets selection around the Koulekoun deposit and within the TriK-block for further exploration programs be concentrated along NW-SE structures, in objective to determine possible intersection zones with NE-SW structures...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To compare foam bubble {{size and}} bubble size distribution, stability, and {{degradation}} rate (DR) of commercially available polidocanol endovenous microfoam (Varithena®) and physician compounded foams (PCFs) using {{a number of}} laboratory tests. METHODS Foam properties of polidocanol endovenous microfoam and PCFs were measured and compared using a glass plate method and a Sympatec QICPIC image analysis method to measure bubble size and bubble size distribution, Turbiscan™ LAB for foam half time and drainage, and a novel biomimetic vein model to measure foam stability. PCFs composed of polidocanol and room air (RA), CO 2, or mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (O 2 :CO 2) were generated by different methods. RESULTS Polidocanol endovenous microfoam {{was found to have}} a narrow bubble size distribution with no large (> 500 ?m) bubbles. PCFs made with the Tessari method had broader bubble size distribution and large bubbles, which have an impact on foam stability. Polidocanol endovenous microfoam had a lower degradation rate (DR) than any PCFs, including foams made using RA (p< 0. 035). The same result was obtained at different liquid to gas ratios (1 : 4 and 1 : 7) for PCFs. In all tests performed, CO 2 foams were the least stable and different O 2 :CO 2 mixtures had intermediate performance. In the biomimetic vein model, polidocanol endovenous microfoam had the slowest DR, and longest calculated dwell time, which represents the length of time the foam is in <b>contact</b> with the <b>vein,</b> almost twice that of PCFs using RA and eight times better than PCFs prepared using equivalent gas mixes. CONCLUSION Bubble size, bubble size distribution, and stability of various sclerosing foam formulations show that polidocanol endovenous microfoam results in better overall performance compared with PCFs. Polidocanol endovenous microfoam offers better stability and cohesive properties in a biomimetic vein model compared to PCFs. Polidocanol endovenous microfoam, which is indicated in the United States for treatment of great saphenous vein system incompetence, provides clinicians with a consistent product with enhanced handling properties...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 An {{important}} aspect in device {{technology is the}} processing of GaAs to produce highly-resolved etch patterns on the substrate. This is done typically on the GaAs(100) surface. Recently, a number of methods, all using chlorinated vapor reactants, have been applied to fabrication of GaAs devices. In spite of these technological advances, {{the understanding of the}} chemistry of the surface reaction on a fundamental level is still rudimentary. Practical etching involves a combination of chemical phenomenon and physical sputtering, {{in the presence of a}} mixture of chlorine containing gases to achieve material removal. The complexity of these processes precludes them as experiments for understanding the mechanisms responsible for etching. A simpler approach, used here, involves thermal etching and electron-induced desorption processes to study the material removed after a GaAs(100) surface is exposed to molecular chlorine. Another {{important aspect}} of device technology involves the atomic level interactions between metals and semiconductors as they are brought into <b>contact.</b> In this <b>vein</b> it has been found that sulfur containing compounds tend to lower the Schottky barrier height at the GaAs(100) surface, and thereby produce ohmic contacts at the metal-semiconductor interface. As with the GaAs/chlorine system, information on the GaAs/sulfur system is by no means conclusive. Molecular sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, as well as alkaline sulfides have all been used to deposit sulfur on the surface. This study concentrates on molecular sulfur and H₂S and the very different behavior between the two upon adsorption and subsequent desorption from the GaAs(100) surface. These experiments on clean, chlorine and sulfur covered surfaces were all performed on well characterized GaAs(100) substrates either cleaned in situ by ion bombardment and annealing (IBA) techniques or grown in situ by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The information was gathered using standard surface science techniques under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. These techniques allow investigation of structure, composition and reaction present at the surface of materials...|$|R
40|$|The Navachab {{gold mine}} in the Damara belt of central Namibia is {{characterized}} by a polymetallic Au-Bi-As-Cu-Ag ore assemblage, including pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, bismuth, gold, bismuthinite, and bismuth tellurides. Gold is hosted by quartz sulfide veins and semimassive sulfide lenses that are developed in a near-vertical sequence of shelf-type metasedimentary rocks, including marble, calcsilicate rock, and biotite schist. The sequence has been intruded by abundant syntectonic lamprophyre, aplite, and pegmatite dikes, documenting widespread igneous activity coeval with mineralization. The majority of quartz from the veins has delta(18) O values of 14 to 15 per mil (V-SMOW). The total variations in delta(18) O values of the biotite schist and calcsilicate rock are relatively small (12 - 14 parts per thousand), whereas the marble records steep gradients in delta(18) O values (17 - 21 parts per thousand), the lowest values being recorded at the vein margins. Despite this, there is no correlation between delta(18) O and delta(13) C values and the carbonate content of the rocks, indicating that fluid-rock interaction alone cannot explain the isotopic gradients. In addition, the marble records increased delta(13) C values at the <b>contact</b> to the <b>veins,</b> possibly related to a change in the physicochemical conditions during fluid-rock interaction. Gold is interpreted to have precipitated in equilibrium with metamorphic find (delta(18) O 12 - 14 parts per thousand; delta D = - 40 to - 60 parts per thousand) at peak metamorphic conditions of ca. 550 degrees C and 2 kbars, consistent with isotopic fractionations between coexisting calcite, garnet, and clinopyroxene in the alteration halos. The most likely source of the mineralizing fluid was a midcrustal fluid in equilibrium with the Damaran metapelites that underwent prograde metamorphism at amphibolite- to granulite-facies grades. Although there is no isotopic evidence for the contribution of magmatic fluids, they may have been important in contributing to the overall hydraulic regime and high apparent geothermal gradients (ca. 80 degrees C/km(- 1)) in the mine area...|$|R
40|$|The Comstock lode, a {{world-class}} precious metal vein deposit in the Comstock district 15 mi (24 km) southeast of Reno, Nevada, formed 13. 7 Ma in Miocene eruptive rocks of the Alta and Kate Peak Formations and in pre-Tertiary metavolcanic and intrusive rocks. Production of 8. 25 million oz (311, 850 kg) {{in gold and}} 192 million oz (7. 26 million kg) in silver came largely from bonanzas, or vein segments containing hundreds of thousands to millions of tons and grading> 0. 4 oz/ton ('-• 14 g/ton) gold and> 10 oz/ton ( [...] • 340 g/ton) silver. Within the 8 -mi-(12. 9 km) -long Comstock fault bonanza ores are distributed 3 mi (4. 8 km) along strike and persist from the present surface to 3, 300 ft (1, 007 m) below the surface. During the middle Miocene andesitic to rhyodacitic Alta and Kate Peak rocks formed a stratovolcano that exceeded 7, 000 ft (2, 134 m) in elevation. Bonanza ores were deposited within this volcano from a + 200 øC hydrothermal system that affected more than 37 mi 3 (150 km 3) of rock. At least one Cretaceous and several Miocene hydrothermal events were imposed on Com-stock district rocks. The Comstock lode vein assemblage, which resulted from the youngest and only economically important event, consists of quartz, electrum, silver minerals (mainly acanthite), pyrite, base metal sulfides, and minor amounts of calcite, sericite, chlorite, K feldspar, and albite. Andesitc adjacent to veins is altered to quartz, sericite, and pyrite at <b>vein</b> <b>contacts</b> and quartz, sericite, montmorillonite, chlorite, and pyrite distally. Kaolinitc is present in wall rocks adjacent o vein segments in which boiling occurred. Addition of the external components water, CO 2, and sulfur gases sufficed to produce all Comstock vein alteration assemblages. Based on paragenetic and fluid inclusion studies, multiple generations of hydrothermal fluid formed Comstock district veins, but the earliest and highest temperature fluid deposited ore minerals.

40|$|The Ianapera emerald deposit {{is located}} in the Neoproterozoic Vohibory Block of {{southern}} Madagascar. The local geology consists of intercalated migmatitic gneissic units and calcareous metasedimentary rocks, containing boudinaged metamorphosed mafic/ultramafic lenses, all intruded by pegmatite veins. These units occur near the hinge of the tightly folded Ianapera antiform, within a few kilometers of the Ampanihy shear zone. Emerald mineralization is hosted by metasomatic phlogopite veins, and bodies developed within the mafic/ultramafic rocks. Based on field and textural relationships, we distinguish proximal and distal styles of mineralization. Proximal mineralization occurs at the <b>contact</b> of pegmatite <b>veins</b> with mafic/ultramafic units; in the distal style, pegmatites are not observed. Three types of emeralds could be distinguished, mainly on the basis of color and mineral zoning. Some of these emeralds have the most Al-depleted and Cr-rich composition ever recorded. Another characteristic feature to the Ianapera deposit and, to our knowledge, yet unreported, is the association of some emeralds with scapolite in metasomatised mafic rocks. Mineral inclusions are common in most emeralds and include phlogopite, carbonates, barite, K-feldspar, quartz, pyrite, zircon, monazite, bastnaesite, phenakite, plus Fe and Cr oxides. However, feldspar and rare earth element-bearing minerals occur predominantly in proximal emeralds, which also have a more incompatible trace-element signature than distal emeralds. We propose a model related to syn- to post-tectonic magmatic-hydrothermal activity. Pegmatitic bodies intruded units of the Ianapera antiform probably during tectonic relaxation. Exsolution of fluids rich in halogens and incompatible elements from the cooling pegmatites caused hydrothermal metasomatism of Cr-bearing mafic/ultramafic rocks in direct contact with the pegmatites. Local fracturing favored fluid infiltration, permitting the formation of distal mineralization. Emerald composition was controlled by the chemistry of the host rock. The presence of carbonate mineral inclusions in the emeralds and the high F-activity indicated by elevated F-contents in newly formed minerals suggest transport of Be as a fluoride-carbonate complex. It seems likely that beryl formation was triggered by precipitation of F-rich phlogopite, which removed the complexing ligand from the fluid...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of a decellularised scaffold and its re-endothelialisation in vitro in order to create human vascular substitutes containing venous valves. This research is clinically relevant particularly with regard to the development of venous (valve containing) transplants to replace a diseased femoral vein valve and/or obstructed veins. This technique may enable causal treatment of venous reflux and obstructions. Materials and methodsValve-bearing segments of human allogeneic great saphenous veins (GSVs) were decellularised using sodium deoxycholic acid (SD) and treated with DNase I. Human venous endothelial cells (ECs) were enzymatically harvested from the GSV, expanded up to the 3 rd passage using FCS (n= 20) or human AB serum (hABS; n= 8) supplemented media before used for re-seeding. In special bioreactors, 3 D re-seeding of 28 decellularised GSV was performed with constant perfusion (A; n= 8), bidirectional perfusion (B; n= 8), bidirectional perfusion/reduced flow (C; n= 2), static conditions (D; n= 2), and bidirectional perfusion/reduced flow using hABS (E; n= 8) instead of FCS. Decellularised GSV, scaled-up EC and 3 D-seeded tissue-engineered valve containing neo-veins underwent immunohistochemical and PCR characterisation. ResultsIntact collagen and elastin networks as well as complete acellularity were shown after GSV decellularisation. In EC culture, supplementation with hABS led to a significantly higher expression of vWF compared to FCS (p= 0. 025). Additional EC markers such as CD 31, FLK- 1 and VE-Cadherin were not altered. EC re-seeding using hABS supplemented medium (E) led to a confluent monolayer of cells that were immunohistochemically positive for FLK- 1, CD 31, vWF and VE-Cadherin and by means of PCR after RNA preparation in 7 of 8 cases but was unsuccessful if FCS was used (A–D). In A–D cells presented as conglomerates positive for CD 31 and VE-Cadherin, suggesting sufficient intercellular contact but not cell–matrix contact. ConclusionsTreatment with SD and DNase enables complete decellularisation of human valve containing veins whereas 3 D matrix components such as collagen and elastin remain preserved. The lumen of the scaffold including the valves can be successfully re-seeded with a human EC monolayer in a 3 D bioreactor. There is substantial evidence that hABS and not FCS is essential for the completion of cell–matrix <b>contacts</b> in human <b>veins...</b>|$|R
40|$|BackgroundVaricose {{veins and}} other {{vascular}} abnormalities are common clinical entities. Treatment options include vein stripping, sclerotherapy, and endovenous laser treatment, but all involve {{some degree of}} invasive intervention. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine ex vivo the effectiveness of a novel hand-held, battery-operated, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device for transcutaneous venous ablation. MethodsThe ultrasound device is 14 × 9 × 4 cm, weighs 650 g, and is powered by 4 lithium ion battery packs. An ex vivo testing platform consisting of two different models comprised of sequentially layered skin-muscle-vein or skin-fat-vein was developed, and specimens were treated with HIFU. The tissues were then disassembled, imaged, and processed for histology. The luminal cross-sectional area of vein that had been treated with HIFU and nontreated controls were measured, and the values presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The values were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and statistical significance was set at P <. 05. ResultsOn gross and histologic examination, veins that had been treated with HIFU showed evidence of coagulation necrosis. The surface of the muscle in direct <b>contact</b> with the <b>vein</b> had a pinpoint area of coagulation, whereas the adjacent fat appeared undisturbed; the skin, fat, and the surface of the muscle in contact with the transducer remained completely unaffected. The cross-sectional area was 3. 79 mm 2 (IQR, 3. 38 - 4. 22) of the control vein lumen and 0. 16 mm 2 (IQR, 0. 04 - 0. 39) in those that had been treated with HIFU (P =. 0304). ConclusionThis inexpensive, portable HIFU device has the potential to allow clinicians to easily perform venous ablation in a manner that is entirely noninvasive and without the expense or inconvenience of large, complicated devices. This device represents a significant step forward in the development of new applications for HIFU technology. Clinical RelevanceAlthough sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and endovenous laser treatment are less invasive than previous surgical treatments for varicose veins, they are still invasive procedures and have concomitant risks, complications, and expenses. The development of a transcutaneous, noninvasive treatment modality holds significant promise for the treatment of varicose veins and venous malformations...|$|R
40|$|The above {{statements}} may {{be summarized}} as follows:- a. During the consolidation of magma, various magmatic emanations are exuded, by the petrification of which ore-deposits are formed. b. A definite process of deposition of emanations determines the order of petrification, as stated in Section 3, p. 4. c. The ore-deposits of igneous origin may be classified into five divisions; magmatic segregations, <b>contacts,</b> replacements, mineral <b>veins</b> and impregnations. d. There are several kinds of igneous rocks called ore-bringers, which produced the ore-deposits by their "eruptive after-action. " e. The Japanese empire is divided from the metallogenetic point of view into five provinces, according to the difference of the ore-bringers. They are as follows:- (Table) f. The minerals in the ore-deposits in the different provinces are distributed {{in the order of}} petrification as in the following table: - (Table) As the reader will see, in the pertrification order all the minerals except calcite are found in the Provinces of Korea and Kitakami. This is because they all belong to the older veins, which means that the formation of the minerals took place in the deep, where the temperature of the emanations was very high, the petrification continuing until the emanations got entirely cool. The pyrite beds in the Besshi Province are supposed to have been emitted from the most basic rocks such as serpentine or gabbro, and therefore only the minerals of the lower position in the pertrification order are deposited there. The scantiness of quartz in the pyritic beds is explained by the basic character of the supposed ore-bringers. In the Provinces of Kosaka and Satsuma only the ore-deposits of younger formation are distributed and therefore such minerals as iron oxides or ferromagnesian silicates are never found there. Sulphides are more abundant in the Kosaka, Province than in the Satsuma Province, for the fusing point of quartz-trachyte is higher than that of andesite. In the gold veins in the Satsuma Province, sulphides are very scanty, but if we go deep down we shall find much more of the sulphides which are of a higher pertrification order than quartz and calcite, the two predominating vein-stuffs of the Satsuma Province...|$|R
40|$|The {{epigenetic}} lead-zinc-barium-strontium mineralisation of the Loch Sunart area of Argyllshire {{has taken}} place along channels provided by dykes and faults. Dolerite and lamprophyre dykes of Permo-Carboniferous age constitute the most important structural controls. These were intruded along lines of displacement {{some of which were}} initiated before and some after the intrusion of the Strontian Caledonian Granitic Complex. The re-opening of certain faults after dyke intrusion and prior to mineralisation was connected with movements of probable Permian age. The dykes are strongly altered at mineral <b>vein</b> <b>contacts</b> Mafic minerals have been replaced by chlorites, serpentines and carbonates, plagioclases severely albitised, magnetite-ilmenite grains converted to leucoxene and rock textures disintegrated. In rare cases, potash feldspar and iron-magnesian carbonates have been formed. During mineralisation, iron, magnesium and sodium have been lost to the mineralising fluids and carbon-dioxide, potassium, sulphur and sometimes calcium, bariurn and water gained by the dyke-rocks. Comparative data for mineralised dykes from Lanarkshire, Linlithgowshire and Shropshire have been collected. The important Blackcraig Vein dyke (Kircudbrightshire) is not significantly mineralised. In the geological history of the Loch Sunart area, numerous lamprophyre sheets, hornblendic schist bands and amphibolites were formed within the Moine Basement Complex before the emplacement of the strontian Granite. Small numbers of minette, spessartite vogesite, kersantite and. felsite dykes are of post-Granite, (probably Devonian) age. Later abundant W. N. W. trending dykes, often mineralised, are considered to be connected with Carboniferous and Permian volcancity. Among them are broad quartz-dolerite intrusives which have thermally altered the adjacent country-rocks to a marked degree. Narrow dykes of normal dolerite, olivine- dolerite and hornblende-bearing olivine-dolerite display a complete petrographical gradation into camptonite through camptonitic dolerite. They are, however, of an earlier age than members of the W. Highland camptonite-monchiquite swarm. The differentiation of camptonite from olivine-basalt magma is suggested. The classification of the lamprophyres is also discussed, A detailed study of harmotome from the Strontian Mines has been made. North-south trending dykes of quartz-dolerlte, normal dolerite and olivine-dolerite cut through the mineral veins. They are believed to be connected with the W. Scottish Tertiary Volcanic Centres.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDamage to the sural nerve (SuN) {{may arise}} from {{surgical}} stripping or thermal ablation of the small saphenous vein (SSV). ObjectiveThis study aims to demonstrate that visualisation of the SuN and its point of contact with the SSV (‘risk point’) using ultrasound imaging can be achieved in routine clinical practice. Type of studyThis is a cohort study. PatientsFifteen normal subjects and five patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) (two with a dilated, incompetent SSV). MethodThe SuN was identified using high-resolution ultrasound imaging using 14 - and 18 -MHz probes. Two manoeuvres were found to improve visualisation: (1) the contrast of the nerve was increased compared with the other tissues by varying the angle of insonation; and (2) the transducer was moved {{up and down the}} limb for a short distance during transverse imaging of the calf. The muscles and other soft tissues appeared ‘out of focus’, whereas the SuN retained both shape and echogenicity. Once the nerve has been identified, proceeding proximally, the point of separation of the two components is often detectable. It is then possible to follow the two different nerves observing the medial sural cutaneous nerve (MSCN) inside the ‘triangle’ of connective tissue below the SSV joining the tibial nerve and the lateral sural cutaneous nerve (LCSN) joining the common peroneal nerve, which runs inside a tiny fascial duplication. The extent of nerves, which were identified, was recorded in each limb as well as their anatomical distribution. ResultsThe SuN and the point at which it might be at risk were identified on ultrasound images in 39 of 40 limbs (97 %) studied. In transverse section, it was readily identified within the saphenous compartment. It lies in close proximity to the SSV only in the distal third of the limb, where the two components of the nerve: MSCN, a branch of the tibial nerve; and LSCN, a branch of the common peroneal nerve join together. The relationship between the SuN and the SSV is very variable, with the nerve running separately or in close <b>contact</b> with the <b>vein</b> for variable distances, in many different combinations. ConclusionsThe SuN and ‘risk point’ can be identified by ultrasonography (US). We propose that this technique could be used to prevent damage to the SuN during surgical or thermal ablation of the SSV and during Achilles tendon surgery...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} the first quantitative geochemical, petrological, and mineralogical data on major rock types and minerals in the Kafubu area. Highly magnesian talc-chlorite ± actinolite ± magnetite metabasites hosting emerald mineralization {{are identified as}} metamorphosed komatiites. These rocks contain 3000 - 4000 ppm Cr, and provided the amount of this element necessary for the crystallization of emeralds. Associated amphibolites of andesitic and basaltic-andesitic composition are low in chromium. The estimated equilibration temperatures during regional metamorphism, using amphibole-plagioclase thermometry on several amphibolite samples, gave a narrow interval of 590 - 630 °C, assuming a pressure of 400 - 600 MPa. This metamorphic event pre-dates the emerald mineralization and the emplacement of pegmatite dikes. Emerald-bearing phlogopite schists are confined to the <b>contacts</b> of quartz-tourmaline <b>veins</b> and quartz-feldspar pegmatites with magnesian metabasites. The quartz-tourmaline veins and pegmatite dikes are genetically related to a hidden fertile granite pluton. The formation of phlogopite schists from metabasite {{was associated with the}} introduction of ca. 8 - 10 wt. % K 2 O, 3 - 4 wt. % fluorine, 0. 12 - 0. 74 wt. % Li 2 O, 1700 - 2900 ppm Rb, and spikes of beryllium. Quartz-feldspar pegmatites of the Kafubu area, often evolved as albite-dominated types, belong to the rare-element pegmatites of the LCT family (i. e., Li-Cs-Ta), with common beryllium enrichment. The identification of several Nb-Ta minerals (manganocolumbite-manganotantalite, niobian rutile, tantalian rutile, and plumbomicrolite) underlines the geochemical typology of pegmatites. High activities of fluorine (up to 4 wt. % F in phlogopite schists) and boron (in exceptionally abundant tourmaline) probably functioned as solidus/liquidus depressants during evolution of mineralizing fluids and their separation from the parent granite. These fluids deposited quartz-tourmaline veins, and altered the adjacent metabasites into emerald-bearing phlogopite schists. Thus, {{in the case of the}} Kafubu emerald area, the classical explanation for the origin of emeralds in schist-related deposits still stands. Data on pegmatite occurrences in active mines and exploration pits, and their extrapolation into the surrounding area, point to the existence of a single, major Kafubu pegmatite field that overlaps the extensive horizons of Cr-rich metabasite. 40 K/ 40 Ar dating of muscovite from a muscovite pegmatite and a quartz-tourmaline-muscovite vein accompanying the Be-mineralization records closure of the system within the interval of 452 - 447 Ma. ...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 – Optimizing {{navigation}} for cardiac {{regenerative therapy}} In {{the first part}} of this thesis we focus on improving navigation strategies for cardiac regenerative therapies. The key point in this part is getting the therapy exactly to the position in the heart where the expected effects are maximal, with the use of a catheter suitable for intramyocardial injections. In Chapter 2 we describe a method to enable the fusion of MRI images and NOGA maps to optimize intramyocardial injections. Subsequently, in Chapter 3 we use the same approach to retrospectively compare late gadolinium enhanced MRI images with electro-anatomical mapping to find the optimal NOGA parameters to define the infarct border zone. Respiratory induced cardiac motion is an important cause of registration mismatches when fusing two or more imaging modalities. In Chapter 4 we describe a technical solution that enables real-time correction of electro anatomical maps during mapping procedures, in order to reduce mapping errors and subsequent registration mismatches. Since electro anatomical mapping systems are expensive and the procedures with these devices are laborious, we have developed a software tool that facilitates intramyocardial injections based on late gadolinium enhancement MRI images. This tool, CARTBox 2, enables the fusion of target defined on pre-procedural MRI images with live fluoroscopy during the injection procedure. In Chapter 5, we compare CARTBox 2 with the clinical standard for intramyocardial injections, the NOGA® XP system. Identifying the target area for cardiac regenerative therapy is imperative. In Chapter 6, we describe a systematical approach to systematically analyze histological fibrosis in transverse heart slices. In Chapter 7, we use the same histological analysis method and systematically compare histology with MRI to find the optimal MRI parameters to identify the target area on MRI images. Part 2 – Optimizing irreversible electroporation catheter ablation The second part of this thesis focuses on the improvement of catheter-based irreversible electroporation ablation. Electrode-tissue contact is an important factor for irreversible electroporation to be effective. In Chapter 8, we describe an electrical method to assess electrode-tissue contact that can be applied to multi-electrode catheters. In a subsequent study (Chapter 9), we directly compared this method with the standard clinical protocol for determining electrode-tissue <b>contact</b> for pulmonary <b>vein</b> isolation in a porcine study with long-term follow-up. The safety aspects of irreversible electroporation need to be clear before its introduction into clinical practice. With radio-frequency ablation, the formation of atrio-esophageal fistula is a rare but lethal complication. In Chapter 10, we describe a study in which we directly targeted the esophagus with irreversible electroporation. The short and long-term effects on the esophagus were studied endoscopically and histologically...|$|R
