During the 1960s, when some Virginia counties closed their public schools to avoid racial integration, compensatory private schooling was available only for Caucasian children.

High BMI can identify a possible weight problem, but does not differentiate between fat or lean tissue. Additionally, BMI may mistakenly rule out some <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> have excess adipose tissue. It is therefore beneficial to supplement the reliability of a BMI diagnosis with additional screening tools such as adipose tissue or skin fold measurements.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effectiveness of using an early childhood language intervention program with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had been determined to be language delayed at the ages of 3, 4 and 5 and to determine how the early childhood langauge intervention program was associated with changes in language, specifically in the areas of syntax and morphology at the primary grade level K- 3 (ages 5 - 9). A comparison of 57 children, both male and female, in the primary grades of two separate but comparable school districts who were receiving langauge therapy from state licensed speech and language pathologists was made. One school district provided early language intervention programs at the preschool level. The standardized test instrument, "Oral Language Sentence Imitation Screening Test" (OLSIST) by Azchman, Huisingn, Joregnsen and Barrett (1978) was administered to the children in the sample. A survey of sociological demographic variables was also analyzed. Four hypotheses were formulated which compared differences in mean scores of morphology and syntax development between <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive early childhood language intervention and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not. Also compared were pretest, post-test scores for those <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive early childhood language intervention. The analysis of the data revealed that there was statistically sound significant difference (. 05) between those <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive early childhood language intervention and those <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not with respect to syntactical development. Statistically sound significant differences (. 05) were also found in the comparison of the pre and post test scores for both syntax and morphology for the <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had received early childhood language intervention.

25|$|Tinnitus is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} a symptom of adulthood, and is often overlooked in children. Children with hearing loss have a high incidence of tinnitus, even though they do not express the condition or its effect on their lives. Children do not generally report tinnitus spontaneously and their complaints may not be taken seriously. Among those <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> complain of tinnitus, there is an increased likelihood of associated otological or neurological pathology such as migraine, juvenile Meniere’s disease or chronic suppurative otitis media. Its reported prevalence varies from 12% to 36% in children with normal hearing thresholds and up to 66% in children with a hearing loss and approximately 310% of children have been reported to be troubled by tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{nutrition}} {{is important}} for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea. It is especially important to young <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have a fully developed immune system. Zinc deficiency, a condition often found in children in developing countries can, even in mild cases, {{have a significant impact}} on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system. Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency and reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes. However, there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency. Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.|$|E
25|$|Several claimants have {{attempted}} to bypass the VICP process with claims that thimerosal in vaccines had caused autism, but these were ultimately not successful. They have demanded medical monitoring for vaccinated <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not show signs of autism and have filed class-action suits on behalf of parents. In March 2006, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiffs suing three manufacturers of thiomersal could bypass the vaccine court and litigate in either state or federal court using the ordinary channels for recovery in tort. This is the first instance where {{a federal appeals court}} has held that a suit of this nature may bypass the vaccine court. The argument was that thiomersal is a preservative, not a vaccine, so it does not fall under the provisions of the vaccine act. The claims that vaccines (or thimerosal in vaccines) caused autism eventually had to be filed in the vaccine court as part of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. Some of these attempts to bypass the VICP process lost on their own merits or were stayed pending the outcome of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding, which did not find a causal link.|$|E

Each of the ten regions in the sorority had the opportunity to choose a child's story to be published in a two volume anthology entitled, The Spirit Within: Voices of Young Authors. In 2004, twenty children were honored in the first anthology. [...] The authors were recognized and performed book signings in the 2004 and 2006 Boulés. At the 2004 Boulé in Nashville, Tennessee, former Department of Education Secretary Rod Paige attended. On July 15, 2004, First Lady Laura Bush spoke on the Ivy AKAdemy's dedication to reading initiatives, [...] "Teaching our children to read is the most critical educational priority facing our country. <b>Children</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not learn to read by third grade continue to find reading a challenge throughout their lives.

A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, looking into it, and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a fishing net. Next, Senegalese talibes, Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not meet their quotas are beaten. Many of these children suffer from skin and stomach diseases because of their diet of spoiled food—one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally sorting through hazardous waste in Ghazipur and New Delhi landfills. Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes.

As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|Divorce is {{difficult}} on all parties {{involved in the}} process, including the children. Due to the stressful nature of divorce, along with inherent issues {{on the amount of}} time the children can spend with each parent, the process can have a long and lasting impact on the children. Unless the children's parents are often involved in intense conflict, or one of the parents is abusive and/or mentally ill, the children tend to fare better if the custody arrangement is a joint custody arrangement. Numerous studies have found that in joint custody arrangements, the children tend to exhibit better relationships with their families, better performance in their schools, higher levels of self-esteem, and fewer conduct and emotional issues. Further, it has been found that children that have a sole custody arrangement tend to have poorer outcomes when compared to average children (or rather <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have divorced parents), where children that have a joint custody arrangement tend to fare as well as average children. However, joint physical custody with an even division of time is not always necessary. These effects are generally seen simply when the children spend a substantial amount of time with both parents. According to Robert Emery, a divorce mediation expert, [...] "In many ways, joint physical custody is the ideal arrangement for children because they still have two parents very much involved in their lives." [...] This statement has been supported by psychological data. [...] Speculation that parental conflict erases the benefits of joint physical custody have not been supported by empirical research. A 2017 paper appearing in a journal published by the American Psychological Association analyzed every study that included measures and controls for conflict when comparing joint and sole physical custody families. Conflict was neither more nor less damaging for children in joint physical custody than those in sole custody. Of 16 studies that controlled for conflict when measuring children’s adjustment, only one reported worse adjustment in joint physical custody. One study found that boys did better and girls worse. Fourteen studies reported either better outcomes in joint physical custody or no differences, even after taking conflict into account.|$|E
