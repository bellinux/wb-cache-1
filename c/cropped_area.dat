5|$|Tripura is an agrarian {{state with}} {{more than half of the}} {{population}} dependent on agriculture and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and forest cover, only 27 per cent of the land is available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is cultivated in 91 per cent of the <b>cropped</b> <b>area.</b> According to the Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, sugarcane, mesta, pulses and jute were the other major crops cultivated in the state. Jackfruit and pineapple top the list of horticultural products. Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised jhum method (a type of slash-and-burn) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on jhum has declined over the years.|$|E
5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} {{occupation}} {{of the people in}} rural parts of the region. Cotton, soyabean and jawar (sorghum) are the essential crops grown in the district. Other important crops of the region are wheat, sunflower, canola, peanut, Bajra (pearl millet), Harbara (chick peas), Toor (pigeon peas), Urad and Moong (green gram). Most crops are dependent on the monsoon. Only 15% of Maharashtra's gross <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> is irrigated, compared with the national average of 32.9% in 1989–90.

25|$|The year 1953 {{was a major}} {{turning point}} for {{agriculture}} in the district. Prior to 1953, cultivation was monsoon-dependent. In 1953, the irrigation projects of Damodar Valley Corporation were implemented. Irrigation and intensive cropping pattern provided the real momentum to agriculture. The undivided Bardhaman district topped the state with maximum irrigated land. The district utilises both surface water and groundwater for irrigation.

25|$|Alwar has an {{important}} place in Agriculture production in Rajasthan. Total geographical area of the district is 7,83,281 hectares which is about 2.5 per cent of the State. In 2010–2011 the net cultivated area is 5,07,171 hecters from which about 83 per cent area viz. – 4,51,546 is irrigated and remaining 17 per cent area viz. – 82,903 is unirrigated. Double <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> is 252 hectares of which 32,230 hecter (12%) area is irrigated and remaining 2,19,819 hecter (88%) area is unirrigated. Thus, the total <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> of the district is 8,12,873 hecters. In Kharif season Bajra, Maize, Jowar, Kharif pulses, Arhar, Sesamum, Cotton, Guar etc. are sown in about 3,29,088 hectare (42%) and in Rabi season Wheat, Barley, Gram, Mustard, Taramira, Rabi pulses etc. are sown in about 4,52,527 hectare (58%). The main source of irrigation are wells and Tube Wells. By 26064 Tube Wells about 192861 hectare area is being irrigated and by 57196 Wells about 265169 hectares area is irrigated. By other sources like canals, tanks about 404 hectares area is irrigated. About 35470 electric motors and 66502 Diesel pump sets are being used for Irrigation purposes. The normal rainfall for the district is 657.3mm. The average rainfall in last ten years in the district is 724mm. The rainfall distribution in the district is uneven and scattered which resulted some times flood problems and some time draught position which affect the Agriculture production as well as cropping pattern in Kharif & Rabi season. Thus, the Agriculture in the district by and large depends on rainfall distribution. The average rainfall in 2016 up to September is 217mm.|$|E

40|$|The {{crops that}} we grow for food need {{specific}} climatic conditions to show better performance {{in view of}} economic yield. A changing climate could have both beneficial and harmful effects on crops. Keeping the above view in mind, this study is undertaken to investigate the impacts of climate change (viz. changes in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, humidity and sunshine) on the yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of four major food crops (viz. Aus rice, Aman rice, Boro rice and wheat) in Bangladesh. Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard error (HAC) and feasible generalized least square (FGLS) methods {{were used to determine}} the climate-crop interrelations using national level time series data for the period of 1972 – 2010. Findings revealed that the effects of all the climate variables have had significant contributions to the yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of major food crops with distinct variation among them. Maximum temperature statistically significantly affected all the food crops’ yield except Aus rice. Maximum temperature also insignificantly affected <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of all the crops. Minimum temperature insignificantly affected Aman rice but benefited other three crops’ yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area.</b> Rainfall significantly benefitted <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of Aus rice, but significantly affected both yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of Aman rice. Humidity statistically positively contributed to the yield of Aus and Aman rice but, statistically, negatively influenced the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of Aus rice. Sunshine statistically significantly benefitted only Boro rice yield. Overall, maximum temperature adversely affected yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of all the major food crops and rainfall severely affected Aman rice only. Concerning the issue of climate change and ensuring food security, the respective authorities thus should give considerable attention to the generation, development and extension of drought (all major food crops) and flood (particularly Aman rice) tolerant varieties...|$|R
25|$|In Chhattisgarh region, about 22% of net <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> {{was under}} {{irrigation}} {{as compared to}} 36.5% in Madhya Pradesh in 1998–99, whereas the average national irrigation was about 40%. The irrigation is characterised by a high order of variability ranging from 1.6% in Bastar to 75.0% in Dhamtari. Based on an average growth trend in the irrigated area, about 0.43% additional area is brought under irrigation every year as compared to 1.89% in Madhya Pradesh and 1.0% in {{the country as a}} whole. Thus, irrigation has been growing at a very low rate in Chhattisgarh and the pace of irrigation is so slow, it would take about 122 years to reach the 75% level of net irrigated area in Chhattisgarh at the present rate of growth.|$|E
25|$|Plantation {{crops such as}} premium coffee, cardamom, and tea {{are grown}} in hilly areas in small {{quantities}} with a large growth potential.

Oilseeds is another, higher income crop gaining ground in Nagaland. The farm productivity for all crops is low, compared to other Indian states, suggesting significant opportunity for farmer income increase. Currently the Jhum to Terraced cultivation ratio is 4:3; where Jhum is local name for cut-and-burn shift farming. Jhum farming is ancient, causes a lot of pollution and soil damage, yet accounts for majority of farmed area.
