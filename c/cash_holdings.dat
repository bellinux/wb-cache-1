The company received commissions from the fund for steering customers. In September 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, {{as a result of its}} holdings in securities of Lehman Brothers, the fund was forced to break the buck and $1 billion in cash equivalents of TD Ameritrade clients were frozen. The company was accused of having a conflict of interest as a result of commissions that it received, for having poor marketing ethics, and for misrepresenting the safety of the investment. Fredric Tomczyk, President of the company, argued that the contract with the Reserve Fund was a standard contract and that [...] "an investment firm has to make money in some way." [...] The company was named in class action lawsuits by its customers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its marketing practices. In 2008, the company agreed to reimburse its customers for up to a 3% loss in the Reserve Primary Fund, or up to $50 million. In 2011, the company settled the SEC case and agreed to pay 1.2¢ per share of the Reserve Yield Plus Fund that was held by its customers, or $10 million in total. The Reserve Yield Plus made its final distribution in 2016 and investors received 97 to 98 cents on the dollar in addition to compensation from TD Ameritrade.|$|E

Thus, an adverse shock to a firm’s net worth (say an initial decline in the asset prices) deteriorates its balance sheet through limiting its borrowing and triggers a series of falling asset prices, falling net worth, deteriorating balance sheets, falling borrowing (thus investment) and falling output. Decreased economic activity feeds back to a fall in asset demand and asset prices further, causing a vicious cycle.|$|E

50|$|Interest is an {{operating}} flow. Since it adjusts for liabilities, receivables, and depreciation, {{operating cash flow}} is a more accurate measure of how much cash a company has generated (or used) than traditional measures of profitability such as net income or EBIT. For example, a company with numerous fixed assets on its books (e.g. factories, machinery, etc.) would likely have decreased net income due to depreciation; however, as depreciation is a non-cash expense the operating cash flow would provide a more accurate picture of the company's current <b>cash</b> <b>holdings</b> than the artificially low net income.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} demand for money by firms and the {{existence}} of economies of scales in order to evaluate the efficiency in the cash management of the Italian manufacturing industry. We estimate a money demand for cash elaborated by Fujiki and Mulligan (1996). Estimates differ from the previous literature firstly, because we use a choice dynamic model to overcome endogeneity problems in cash holdings; secondly, because we use an iterative procedure based on backward exclusion of firms from model estimation with which we point out the high heterogeneity of Italian companies in money demand. Our estimates show that the Italian Manufacturing industry, considered as whole, does not enjoy scale economies in money demand. Our iterative procedure points out that the cause of this result is to be ascribed to small firms which are characterized by thin <b>cash</b> money <b>holdings</b> and a consequently very modest opportunity cost. Once small size firms are removed from our data set our estimates reveal that money demand of medium and large size firms is different for high scale economies. This result, together with the fact that small firms’ cash balances are thin, implies the efficiency of Italian manufacturing industry. ...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{the common}} {{characteristics}} of firms in financial distress into bankruptcy or recovery This paper uses the Cox regression model in survival analysis to investigate whether factors that affect the financial distress among listed and OTC (over-the-counter) firms in the emerging Taiwan market will continue to influence the probability of bankruptcy/delisting or recovery. The {{results show that the}} variables of liquidity, profitability, capital structure and corporate governance have significant differences in their level of influences among the three models. When cash and <b>cash</b> equivalent <b>holdings</b> are lower, the ratio of independent directors is lower, the control rights deviation level is smaller, the company is not a family-owned business, and then the probability of financial distress is higher. A high debt level increases the chance of bankruptcy/delisting. In the case of higher outsider shareholdings or more control rights deviation, the probability of bankruptcy/delisting or recovery is lower. More excess cash does not necessarily help the firm resume operations. The average stock returns of recovered firms significantly outperform the market index in the following two years. Industry classification and being a family-owned business have no influence on the chance of bankruptcy/delisting or on that of recovery. Moreover, the period from the occurrence of financial distress to the bankruptcy/delisting (to recovery) is about 18 (23) months...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{theoretically}} correct model {{we examine}} the value the market assigns to different components of the cash flow to equity including “potential” dividends. We study publicly traded firms from five Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru during the period 1991 - 2007. The model includes the following variables: market value of equity, dividends paid, change in equity investment and change in cash and <b>cash</b> equivalent <b>holdings</b> (“potential” dividends). These variables are regressed with actual equity value as dependent variable and the other variables as independent variables (including equity value for next period). We tested the data applying Ordinary Least Squares OLS, and Data Panel. Both tests give consistent results. The contribution of this work is double: First, against current findings, {{we find that the}} market assigns less than one dollar to a future dollar for any of the variables studied as expected when we interpret the coefficient of the variables as discount factors. Second, in particular, we found that “potential” dividends (change in liquid assets) destroy value. This means that the value today of a dollar in t+ 1 is negative. This conclusion confirms the problem of agency costs of keeping undistributed cash flows and that they should not be included in the cash flows while listed in the Balance Sheet. The {{solution to the problem of}} destroying value is not inflating the cash flows, but making decisions to effectively distribute the excess cash. ...|$|R

40|$|In-kind price {{subsidies}} {{are a new}} and important feature of U. S. agricultural policy. Yet the market effects of such subsidies have not been widely discussed in the professional literature even through they differ importantly from similar cash subsidies. This paper examines in-kind subsidies with simple, static demand and supply functions. In-kind price subsidies push down prices to favored buyers and increase total sales relative to no subsidy or to an equivalent <b>cash</b> subsidy. Inventory <b>holdings</b> by the subsidizing authority are diminished. However, the effects of an in-kind subsidy upon prices received by sellers and commercial sales volume (net of stock disposals) are problematic, depending upon the price elasticity of demand in the subsidized market. If the demand, including retaliation by other sellers, is price elastic, then an in-kind subsidy will increase prices received by sellers and commercial sales volume. But if the demand is inelastic, then sellers' prices and commercial sales volume will drop relative to a no-subsidy situation or to an equivalent cash subsidy. These conclusions do not depend upon the methods by which the scheme is administered. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
