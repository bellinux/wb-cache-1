40|$|This thesis {{describes}} two {{applications of}} functional programming to process formal and natural languages. The techniques {{described in this}} thesis are closely connected to compiler construction, which is obvious in the work on BNF Converter. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the BNFC (the BNF Converter) application, a multi-lingual compiler tool. BNFC takes as its input a grammar written in Labelled BNF (LBNF) notation, and generates a compiler front-end (an abstract syntax, a lexer, and a parser). Furthermore, it generates a <b>case</b> <b>skeleton</b> usable as the starting point of back-end construction, a pretty printer, a test bench, and a Latex document usable as a language specification. The program components can be generated in Haskell, Java, C and C++, and their standard parser and lexer tools. BNFC itself was written in Haskell. The methodology used for the generated front-end is based on Appel's books on compiler construction. BNFC {{has been used as a}} teaching tool in compiler construction courses at Chalmers. It has also beenapplied to research-related programming language development, and in an industrial application producing a compiler for a telecommunications protocol description language. The second part of the thesis describes Functional Morphology, a toolkit for implementing natural language morphology in the functional language Haskell. The main idea behind is simple: instead of working with untyped regular expressions, which is the state of the art of morphology in computational linguistics, we use finite functions over hereditarily finite algebraic data types. The definitions of these data types and functions are the language-dependent part of the morphology. The language-independent part consists of an untyped dictionary format which is used for translation to other morphology formats and synthesis of word forms, and to generate a decorated trie, which is used for analysis. Functional Morphology builds on ideas introduced by Huet in his computational linguistics toolkit Zen, which he has used to implement the morphology of Sanskrit. The goal has been to make it easy for linguists who are not trained as functional programmers, to apply the ideas to new languages. As a proof of the productivity of the method, morphologies for Swedish, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and Latin have already been implemented...|$|E

To date, the remains of two chapels as well as 78 skeletons have been excavated, dated to between the 11 th and 15 th century. A skeleton was excavated {{in the summer of}} 2003 which showed pathological changes indicative of a malignant disease. Palaeopathological cases of malignancies are very rare, and it is therefore important to report on each <b>case.</b> <b>Skeleton</b> HST- 027 was a female, aged 45 - 50 years at the time of death. Standard osteological methods were used to determine the sex, age and stature. Macroscopic analysis was carried out on the skeleton and all pathological changes on each bone described. The cranium, ribs, left os coxa and all left long bones were then radiographed to aid in the diagnosis. The analysis showed lytic lesions in all the flat bones, as well as the vertebrae, ribs and the proximal end of the left femur, all changes indicative of multiple myeloma. Palaeopathologically myeloma and metastatic cancer (then usually due to breast cancer in the case of women) are often difficult to distinguish. However there is no new bone formation surrounding the lesions, which means that metastatic cancer is unlikely to be the cause. Skeleton HST- 027 from Hofstadir is the first published case of malignant disease in Iceland, and one of the clearer cases of myeloma in an archaeological specimen, but to date, approximately twenty cases have been reported world-wide. Fornleifauppgröftur hefur staðið yfir í kirkjugarðinum á Hofstöðum í Mývatnssveit frá því sumarið 1999. Nú þegar hafa leifar tveggja bænhúsa og 78 beinagrindur frá 11. - 15. öld verið grafnar upp. Sumarið 2003 fannst beinagrind í kirkjugarðinum með meinafræðilegar breytingar sem bentu til illkynja meins. Slík fornleifafræðileg tilfelli eru mjög sjaldséð og þykir því vert að birta hvert einasta tilfelli. Beinagrindin sem um ræðir, HST- 027, var úr konu sem hefur verið á aldrinum 45 - 50 ára þegar hún lést. Staðlaðar beinafræðilegar aðferðir voru notaðar til að greina kyn, lífaldur og líkamshæð. Fornmeinafræðileg rannsókn var gerð þar sem öllum sýnilegum breytingum á hverju einasta beini var lýst. Því næst voru höfuðkúpa, rifbein, vinstri mjaðmarspaði, og öll vinstri leggjarbein röntgenmynduð til að aðstoða við sjúkdómsgreiningu. Rannsókn leiddi í ljós beineyður í nánast öllum flötu beinum líkamans, auk hryggjarliða, rifbeina og efri hluta vinstri lærleggs, einkennandi fyrir mergæxli.

40|$|The {{problem of}} Büchi determinization is a {{fundamental}} problem with important applications in reactive synthesis, multi-agent systems and probabilistic verification. The first asymptotically optimal Büchi determinization (a. k. a the Safra construction), was published in 1988. While asymptotically optimal, the Safra construction is notorious for its technical complexity and opaqueness in terms of intuition. While some improvements were published since the Safra construction, notably Kähler and Wilkes construction, understanding the constructions remains a non-trivial task. In this paper we present a modular approach to Büchi determinization, where the difficulties are addressed one at a time, rather than simultaneously, making the solutions natural and easy to understand.

40|$|The silica {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{elements}} in the Earth's crust. During erosion it is released in soluble form to the environment, where some organisms can accumulate the silica and incorporate it to their bodies by biosilicification process. The organsims possessing this ability are widespread either when considering their position in eukaryotic tree of life, or their abundance in natural ecosystems. As a result, the whole global biogeochemical cycle of silica is controlled by biosilicificated organisms. In Chromista microorganisms, the silica is loaded to so-called "silica deposition vesicles" - membrane surrounded compartments, in which the silica is polymerated and formed into the final shape of silica structures during an ingeniously controlled in vivo process. Apparent differences in the process of silica deposition among Chromista microorganisms imply that this ability has developed independenty and repeatedly within the group. The most common silica structures are scales, bristles, <b>cases,</b> <b>skeletons</b> and cysts. The analogical structures often originated independently in unrelated lines of Chromista by means of convergent evolution.

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of physical anthropology is to estimate a person’s sex and ethnicity in the forensic or anthropology context (Slaus et al. 2003). Most of the postcranial bones {{have been used to}} determine the sex of human remains through various statistical models (Kim et al. 2013). The femur is the longest bone and it is often well preserved (King et al. 1998). But anthropologists must have different algorithms in their diagnostic arsenal for <b>cases</b> where the <b>skeletons</b> are fragmented or when specific populations are analyzed (Iscan & Shihai 1995). The large number of subjects (n[*]=[*] 482) included in our study provides osteometric references related to sexual dimorphism in a modern population. Determining ethnicity based on a bone fragment could improve identification of a specimen, particularly when it is not fully intact. This method made it possible to correctly assign ethnicity in 82 % of subjects (original CVA) (Table  4). But this is not sufficient to allow the ethnic origin of a specimen to be determined without a doubt. Anthropologists have different algorithms in their diagnostic arsenal for <b>cases</b> where the <b>skeletons</b> are fragmented or when specific populations are analyzed (Mall et al. 2000; Ozer & Katayama 2008; Purkait & Chandra 2004; Slaus et al. 2003; Srivastava et al. 2012; Trancho et al. 1997).

I dyed internal fluid of a large gastropod larva with fluorescein to show that fluid supporting the extended velar lobes is expelled from discrete release sites during defensive withdrawals. Scanning electron microscopy suggested that release sites are distinctive papillae on the upper velar epidermis. Ultrathin sections revealed that branched tracks of microvilli-free membrane {{on the surface of}} these papillae were formed by very thin epithelial cells, which may rupture and re-anneal during and after defensive withdrawals.

40|$|Although {{the concept}} of race has been {{thoroughly}} criticised in biological anthropology, forensic anthropology still uses a number of methods to determine the ‘race’ of a skeleton. The methods must be evaluated to see how effective they are given large individual variation. This study used 20 <b>cases</b> of <b>skeletons</b> of varied provenance to test whether the nine published methods of ‘race’ determination, using a range of various approaches, were able to consistently identify the ethnic origin. No one individual was identified as belonging to just one ‘major racial class’, e. g. European, meaning that complete consistency across all nine methods was not observed. In 14 cases (70 %), various methods identified the same individual as belonging to all three racial classes. This suggests that the existing methods for the determination of ‘race’ are compromised. The very concept of ‘race’ is inapplicable to variation that occurs between populations only in small ways and the methods are limited by the geographic population from which their discriminant functions or observations of morphological traits were derived. Methods of multivariate linear discriminant analysis, e. g. CRANID, are supposed to allocate an individual skull to a specific population rather than a ‘major race’. In our analysis CRANID did not produce convincing allocations of individual skeletons to specific populations. The {{findings of this study}} show that great caution must be taken when attempting to ascertain the ‘race’ of a skeleton, as the outcome is not only dependent on which skeletal sites are available for assessment, but also {{the degree to which the}} unknown skeleton’s population of origin has been investigated.

The parts most commonly showcased by a skeleton design are those exhibiting either the most movement or the most attractive design. These may include, but are not limited to the escapement, balance wheel and balance spring, mainspring, and tourbillon.

In the <b>case</b> of <b>skeleton</b> wristwatches, the back will usually be made of sapphire crystal or another clear material that affords easy examination of the parts protected within both from the front and from behind.In addition, several authors have published construction manuals on skeleton clocks in clockmaking and model engineering journals in the UK and USA, several of which (UK) have ceased operations. However, the best known of these authors had the manuals reprinted in comb bound format and these are still available (2012). John Wilding in the UK wrote manuals on Large Wheel, Elegant Scroll Frame, Chrystal Wheel and Scissors. Bill Smith in the US wrote on Lyre, Grasshopper and Epicyclic skeleton clocks.|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} hand fractures managed with mini-external fixators (MEFs) {{in order to assess}} their usefulness in different fracture types and to make recommendations regarding potential applications. Methods Fifty-one patients with 59 metacarpal and phalangeal fractures were treated with MEFs. Fixators were used to reduce the fracture or to achieve volar plate arthroplasty when anatomical joint reconstruction was impossible. The mean period from injury to MEF application was 4. 5 days. Results The procedure was performed using regional anesthesia and fluoroscopic control, and it lasted 20 to 45 minutes. MEFs were removed in a mean period of 6 weeks, and follow-up was 18 to 55 months. Forty-nine patients with 57 fractures remained in the follow-up group. In all <b>cases</b> the <b>skeleton</b> was successfully reconstructed, whereas the clinical outcome varied according to the type of the original injury: intra-articular fractures had worse outcome than extra-articular (p=. 035 for grip strength and p=. 0005 for total active motion), and open fractures had worse outcome than closed (p=. 06 for grip strength and p=. 001 for total active motion). In all cases, patients' satisfaction was high; the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score was < 7. 9 and the visual analog scale score was < 0. 5. Conclusions The findings of this series demonstrate the efficacy of versatile MEFs to establish union and correct alignment of hand skeleton with minimal tissue trauma while retaining a good clinical outcome even in the most complex injuries. MEFs can be considered for all hand fractures requiring surgical treatment, and especially for the intra-articular and comminuted fractures. (J Hand Surg 2009; 34 A: 630 - 636.
