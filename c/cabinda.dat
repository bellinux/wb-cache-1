5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Cabindan rebels {{kidnapped and}} ransomed off foreign oil workers to in turn finance further {{attacks against the}} {{national}} government. FLEC militants stopped buses, forcing Chevron Oil workers out, and setting fire to the buses on 27 March and 23 April 1992. A large-scale battle took place between FLEC and police in Malongo on 14 May in which 25 mortar rounds accidentally hit a nearby Chevron compound. The government, fearing {{the loss of their}} prime source of revenue, began to negotiate with representatives from Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Renewal (FLEC-R), Armed Forces of <b>Cabinda</b> (FLEC-FAC), and the Democratic Front of <b>Cabinda</b> (FDC) in 1995. Patronage and bribery failed to assuage the anger of FLEC-R and FLEC-FAC and negotiations ended. In February 1997, FLEC-FAC kidnapped two Inwangsa SDN-timber company employees, killing one and releasing the other after receiving a $400,000 ransom. FLEC-FLAC kidnapped eleven people in April 1998, nine Angolans and two Portuguese, released for a $500,000 ransom. FLEC-R kidnapped five Byansol-oil engineering employees, two Frenchman, two Portuguese, and an Angolan, in March 1999. While militants released the Angolan, the government complicated the situation by promising the rebel leadership $12.5million for the hostages. When António Bento Bembe, the President of FLEC-R, showed up, the Angolan army arrested him and his bodyguards. The Angolan army later forcibly freed the other hostages on 7 July. By {{the end of the year}} the government had arrested the leadership of all three rebel organizations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the war for}} independence, the {{division}} of assimilados versus indigenas peoples masked the inter-ethnic conflict between the various native tribes, a division {{that emerged in the}} early 1970s. The Union of Peoples of Angola, the predecessor to the FNLA, only controlled 15% of Angola's territory during the independence war, excluding MPLA-controlled <b>Cabinda.</b> The People's Republic of China openly backed UNITA upon independence despite the mutual support from its adversary South Africa and UNITA's pro-Western tilt. The PRC's support for Savimbi came in 1965, a year after he left the FNLA. China saw Holden Roberto and the FNLA as the stooge of the West and the MPLA as the Soviet Union's proxy. With the Sino-Soviet split, South Africa presented the least odious of allies to the PRC.|$|E
5|$|After the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon {{and the end}} of the Angolan War of Independence, {{the parties}} of the {{conflict}} signed the Alvor Accords on 15 January 1975. In July 1975, the MPLA violently forced the FNLA out of Luanda, and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. By August, the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including <b>Cabinda</b> and Luanda. South Africa intervened on 23 October, sending between 1,500 and 2,000 troops from Namibia into southern Angola in order to support the FNLA and UNITA. Zaire, in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government and thwart the MPLA's drive for power, deployed armored cars, paratroopers, and three infantry battalions to Angola in support of the FNLA. Within three weeks, South African and UNITA forces had captured five provincial capitals, including Novo Redondo and Benguela. In response to the South African intervention, Cuba sent 18,000 soldiers as part of a large-scale military intervention nicknamed Operation Carlota in support of the MPLA. Cuba had initially provided the MPLA with 230 military advisers prior to the South African intervention. The Cuban intervention proved decisive in repelling the South African-UNITA advance. The FNLA were likewise routed at the Battle of Quifangondo and forced to retreat towards Zaire. The defeat of the FNLA allowed the MPLA to consolidate power over the capital Luanda.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, oil {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the region, by 1966 Gulf Oil Company began commercial exploitation.

By 1970 oil revenues amounted to 16 million $, and were expected to rise to 32–50 million $ by 1972. Oil continued to play an important role, by 2011 it represented approximately 86% of the Angolan state’s total earnings.

25|$|Under Portuguese rule, <b>Cabinda</b> {{developed}} {{as an important}} agricultural and forestry center, and in 1967 it discovered huge offshore oil fields. Oil, timber, and cocoa were its main exports by then. The town of <b>Cabinda,</b> {{the capital of the}} territory, was a Portuguese administrative and services center with a port and airfield. The beaches of <b>Cabinda</b> were popular with Portuguese Angolans.|$|E
25|$|The first Cabindan separatist {{movement}} {{known as}} Associaco dos Indigenas do Enclave de <b>Cabinda</b> (AlEC) {{was formed in}} 1956, AIEC advocated {{the creation of a}} union between <b>Cabinda</b> and Belgian Congo or French Congo. Associacao dos Ressortissants do Enclave de <b>Cabinda</b> (AREC) was founded in 1959 as humanitarian organisation, AREC was renamed into Freedom Movement for the State of <b>Cabinda</b> (MLEC), shifting its role into a political movement promoting self-determination. The National Action Committee of the Cabindan People (CAUNC) and the Mayombé Alliance (ALLIAMA) joined the growing political scene in the same year. In 1963, MLEC, ALLIAMA and CAUNC merged into the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of <b>Cabinda</b> (FLEC), which had since been the largest self-determination movement in the region.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Heritage Foundation, a {{conservative}} American think tank, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China's biggest supplier of oil. “China has extended three multibillion dollar {{lines of credit}} to the Angolan government; two loans of $2 billion from China Exim Bank, one in 2004, the second in 2007, {{as well as one}} loan in 2005 of $2.9 billion from China International Fund Ltd.” Growing oil revenues have also created opportunities for corruption: according to a recent Human Rights Watch report, 32billion US dollars disappeared from government accounts from 2007 to 2010. Furthermore, Sonangol, the state run oil company, has control of 51% of <b>Cabinda’s</b> oil. Due to this market control the company ends up determining the profit given to the government and the taxes paid. The council of foreign affairs states that the World Bank mentioned that Sonangol [...] " [...] is a taxpayer, it carries out quasi-fiscal activities, it invests public funds, and, as concessionaire, it is a sector regulator. This multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between Sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1885, the Treaty of Simulambuco {{established}} <b>Cabinda</b> as a protectorate of the Portuguese Empire, and the Cabindan independence movements {{consider the}} occupation of the territory by Angola illegal. While the Angolan Civil War largely ended in 2002, an armed struggle persists in the exclave of <b>Cabinda.</b> Some of the factions have proclaimed an independent Republic of <b>Cabinda,</b> with offices in Paris.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} year, the Organisation of African Unity {{declared}} that <b>Cabinda</b> is an independently governed state {{with its own}} independence movement. On 10 January 1967, FLEC formed a government in exile based {{in the town of}} Tshela, Zaire.

6000|$|With {{respect to}} the {{exploration}} of the upper stream, these pages, compared with the records of the [...] "First Congo Expedition," [...] will show the many changes which time has brought with it, and will suggest the steps most likely to forward the traveller's views. At some period to come explorers will follow the line chosen by the unfortunate Tuckey; but the effects of the slave-trade must have passed away before that march can be made without much obstruction. When Lieutenant Grandy did me the honour of asking my advice, I suggested that he might avoid great delay and excessive outlay by [...] "turning" [...] the obstacle and by engaging [...] "Cabindas" [...] instead of Sierra Leone men. At the Royal Geographical Society (Dec. 14th, 1874) he thus recorded his decision: [...] "For the guidance of future travellers in the Congo country, I would suggest that all the carriers be engaged at Sierra Leone, where any number can be obtained for 1s. 3d. a day. From my experience of them I can safely say they will be found to answer every requirement, and the employment of them would render an expedition entirely independent of the natives, who, by their cowardice and constant desertion, entailed upon us such heavy expenses and serious delays. My conviction, after nearly four years of travel upon the West African coast, is this: if Sierra Leone men be used, they must be mixed with <b>Cabindas</b> and with Congoese [...] "carregadores," [...] registered in presence of the Portuguese authorities at S. Paulo de Loanda.|$|R

25|$|In January 1975 under {{pressure}} from Angolan liberation movements, Portugal accepted <b>Cabinda</b> as part of Angola in the Alvor Agreement where the 3 Angolan independence movements (MPLA, UNITA and FNLA) were present, denying <b>Cabinda</b> the right to self-determination previously granted by the U.N. Chart/Right to Self-determination and the Treaty of Simulambuco. On 1 August 1975, FLEC president Luis Ranque Franque announced {{the formation of the}} Republic of <b>Cabinda,</b> an independent state. The MPLA troops controlling the region at the time ignored the statement. In November 1975, Angola gained independence from Portugal, claiming <b>Cabinda</b> as part of its territory. The provisional Cabindan government, led by the FLEC, was overturned. On 8 November 1975, FLEC responded by initiating armed struggle, aiming at creating a separate Cabindan state.|$|E
25|$|The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of <b>Cabinda</b> (FLEC) {{was founded}} in 1963, by the merging of the Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of <b>Cabinda</b> (MLEC), the Action Committee of the <b>Cabinda</b> National Union (CAUNC) and the Mayombe National Alliance (ALLIAMA). On the {{contrary}} of the remaining three movements, FLEC did not fought for the independente of the whole Angola, but only for the independence of <b>Cabinda,</b> which it considered a separate country. Although its activities started still before the withdrawal of Portugal from Angola, the military actions of FLEC occurred mainly after, being aimed against the Angolan armed and security forces. FLEC is the only of the nationalist and separatist movements that still maintains a guerrilla warfare until today.|$|E
25|$|An ad-hoc United Nations {{commission}} {{for human rights}} in <b>Cabinda</b> reported in 2003 that many atrocities had been perpetrated by the MPLA.

25|$|The area of modern-day <b>Cabinda</b> {{was first}} {{explored}} by navigator Diogo Cão in 1483, later falling under Portuguese influence. In 1853 {{a delegation of}} Cabindan chiefs unsuccessfully requested the extension of Portuguese administration from the colony of Angola to <b>Cabinda.</b> Local chiefs continued their attempts at cooperating with Portugal until the 1884 Berlin Conference and the 1885 Treaty of Simulambuco, following which the Cabindan enclave became a Portuguese protectorate. Despite the fact that <b>Cabinda</b> held a semi independent status, a new Portuguese government elected in 1956 transferred the region's administration to Angolan without a prior agreement with Cabinda's local leadership.|$|E
25|$|Angola has {{a serious}} {{humanitarian}} crisis; {{the result of the}} prolonged war, of the abundance of minefields, of the continued political (and to a much lesser degree) military activities in favour of the independence of the exclave of <b>Cabinda</b> (carried out {{in the context of the}} protracted <b>Cabinda</b> Conflict by the Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de <b>Cabinda,</b> (FLEC)), but most of all, by the depredation of the country's rich mineral resources by the régime. While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital, in the so-called s, the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.|$|E
25|$|Ever since Portugal {{handed over}} {{sovereignty}} {{of its former}} overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA and FNLA), the territory of <b>Cabinda</b> has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the Government of Angola (which has employed its armed forces, the FAA—Forças Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Armed Forces of <b>Cabinda</b> (FLEC-FAC) announced a virtual Federal Republic of <b>Cabinda</b> under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago. One {{of the characteristics of}} the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions.|$|E
25|$|FLEC {{formed a}} {{provisional}} government, led by Henriques Tiago. Luiz Branque Franque was elected president. Following {{the declaration of}} Angolan independence in November 1975, <b>Cabinda</b> was invaded by forces of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), {{with the support of}} Cuban troops. The MPLA overthrew the provisional FLEC government and incorporated <b>Cabinda</b> into Angola.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cabinda</b> was {{incorporated}} into the Portuguese colonial Empire, separately from its large neighbour of southern Angola. Indeed, already {{at that time the}} two territories were separated by the Congo River.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, several {{movements}} advocating a separate status for <b>Cabinda</b> came into being. The Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of <b>Cabinda</b> (MLEC) {{was formed in}} 1960 {{under the leadership of}} Luis Ranque Franque. Resulting from the merger of various émigré associations in Brazzaville, the MLEC rapidly became the most prominent of the separatist movements. A further group was the Alliama (Alliance of the Mayombe), representing the Mayombe, a small minority of the population. In an important development, these movements united in August 1963 to form a united front. They called themselves the FLEC, and the leadership role was taken by the MLEC’s Ranque Franque.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Portuguese, Dutch, and English {{established}} trading posts, logging {{camps and}} small palm oil processing factories in <b>Cabinda.</b> Trade continued and the European presence grew, resulting in {{conflicts between the}} rival colonial powers.|$|E
