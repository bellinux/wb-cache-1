5|$|If the {{resulting}} short-circuit current is {{high enough to}} trip the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> then disruption of service will occur. Ash-induced flashover across transformer insulation (bushings) can burn, etch or crack the insulation irreparably and will likely result in the disruption of power supply.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 2009 an {{overhead}} power line dropped on to a Class 373 train arriving at St Pancras station, activating a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> and delaying eleven other trains. Two days later, on 25 September 2009, electrical power via the overhead lines was lost on a section of high-speed line outside Lille, delaying passengers on two evening Eurostar-operated services.|$|E
30|$|Currently, the {{research}} on DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> consists of traditional DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> solid-state DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and hybrid DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> These three types of DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> each have their own applications.|$|R
30|$|With the {{development}} of power electronic technologies, solid state <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> based on fully controlled devices [13] have been well researched [14], as well as hybrid DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> that combine solid state <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and traditional mechanical switches. However, both solid state <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and hybrid DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> require devices that are fully controlled. Not only it is expensive, but also the operating complexity is currently far from that required for industrial applications [15].|$|R
2500|$|Miniature <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> used {{to protect}} control {{circuits}} or small appliances may not have sufficient interrupting capacity to use at a panel board; these <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are called [...] "supplemental circuit protectors" [...] to distinguish them from distribution-type <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b>|$|R
5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> that would arm the main engine for lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a {{mechanical}} {{failure of the}} landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b>|$|E
5|$|Washington {{passed through}} the area still {{occupied}} by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow Washington towards {{the western side of}} Savo Island until 23:35, when Washington changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. South Dakota tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid Benham, which resulted in the ship's being silhouetted by the fires of the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{contribution}} of SF 6 losses {{to the impact of}} high-voltage SF 6 <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> on global warming is evaluated. Two air-insulated <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and two gas-insulated <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are studied over 20 years. SF 6 losses due to leakage in service, plus losses during manufacturing and commissioning, are taken into account. For these <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> it can be seen in this study that SF 6 losses due to leakage in service or during manufacture and commissioning are not the major contribution of <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> to global warming. In fact, reducing the SF 6 emissions of these <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> may focus on the reduction of losses occurring during maintenance. It may be possible to reduce the global impact of <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> on global warming by reducing energy losses during the life of the apparatus...|$|R

5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft's canopy, a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was manually unlocked, the ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to eject from the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|All <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> {{systems have}} common {{features}} in their operation, but details vary substantially {{depending on the}} voltage class, current rating and type of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{ground fault}} circuit {{interrupter}} <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> (GFCI breaker in USA and Canada) and residual-current breaker with overload (RCBO in Europe) are devices that combine {{the functions of}} a residual-current device with a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> They detect both supply imbalance and overload current.|$|E
25|$|Medium-voltage <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> rated between 1 and 72 kV may be {{assembled}} into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high voltage <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> nearly always use separate current sensors and protective relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.|$|R
50|$|Officials {{announced}} that new trading curbs, {{also known as}} <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> would be tested during a six-month trial period ending on December 10, 2010. These <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> would halt trading for five minutes on any S&P 500 stock that rises or falls more than 10 percent in a five-minute period. The <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> would only be installed to the 404 New York Stock Exchange listed S&P 500 stocks. The first <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> were installed to only 5 of the S&P 500 companies on Friday, June 11, to experiment with the <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> The five stocks were EOG Resources, Genuine Parts, Harley Davidson, Ryder System and Zimmer Holdings. By Monday, June 14, 44 had them. By Tuesday, June 15, the number had grown to 223, and by Wednesday, June 16, all 404 companies had <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> installed. On June 16, 2010, trading in the Washington Post Company's shares were halted for five minutes after it became the first stock to trigger the new <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> Three erroneous NYSE Arca trades {{were said to have}} been the cause of the share price jump.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} {{electronic}} systems almost in every new device. They are emitting and receiving electromagnetic interferences. The safety levels for <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are also increasing. Because {{of these issues}} the <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> must work properly also in areas filled by electromagnetic interference. This thesis describes the issues of electromagnetic susceptibility of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers...</b>|$|R
25|$|Charging times vary {{depending}} on the ESS's state-of-charge, the available voltage, and the available <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> amp rating (current). In a best case scenario using a 240 V charger on a 90 A <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> Tesla documents a recharging rate of -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require just under 4 hours. The slowest charging rate using a 120V outlet on a 15 A <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> would add -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{magnetic}} circuit breakers, {{which are the}} type found in most distribution boards, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> provides a time response feature, that trips the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> sooner for larger overcurrents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> with no intentional additional delay.|$|E

40|$|In various stock markets, {{there is}} a system called “circuit {{breakers}} ” that interrupts dealing of stocks for a certain period when stock price changes greatly. In this paper, we consider {{the influence of the}} <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> on a stock market using an agent-based artificial market simulator called “U-Mart”, by controlling the period of interruption and the criterion to invoke the <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> From experiments, we found the following: <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> {{play an important role in}} the control of price fluctuations and the stabilization of the settlement system, while the <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> reduce the stock trading volume. We also suggest that the period of interruption is important parameter in an institutional design of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> since the stock trading volume and the volatility are sensitive to the period. ...|$|R

25|$|A <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is an {{automatically}} operated {{electrical switch}} {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Northwest Airlines Flight 255, which {{happened}} 21 years earlier than flight 5022, also an MD-82, the crew had similarly been disrupted from routine operation before the fatal takeoff, and the alarm similarly had not sounded.

25|$|On 13 October 2015, {{train service}} was {{disrupted}} between Farrer Park and Hougang {{for more than}} half an hour due to a power fault. It was triggered by a malfunction of a component in the electrical switchgear at a substation which caused the main <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> to trip. As an interim measure, SBS Transit has increased the protection setting of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> to cater for the projected maximum load of the network.|$|E
