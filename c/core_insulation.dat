50|$|Flexible {{plate is}} used in {{electric}} motor and generator armatures, field coil insulation, and magnet and commutator <b>core</b> <b>insulation.</b> Mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. Heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears {{at the same rate}} as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).|$|E

The experimental air preheater has been designed and built to study {{the problems associated with}} the use of air preheaters in magnetohydrodynamic power generation. The model simulates the experimental preheater core, where the gas to ceramic heat transfer occurs, by the use of finite-difference equations. The insulation layers surrounding the core are thermally coupled with the core using a second set of finite-difference equations. The core finite-difference equations describe the heat transfer and the temperature distribution in nineteen elements which comprise a thirty-degree segment of the core cross section. The finite-difference equations modeling the insulation include the vertical expansion gaps between insulation layers which provide additional resistance to the heat transfer.

The standard protection relays are unable to detect the faults and so the faults pose a risk for individuals in the vicinity of the conductor as well as it compromises the overall safety and reliability of the MV distribution system. In this article, we continue with our previous work aimed at the method enabling detection of the faults and we introduce a method enabling a classification of the fault type. Such a classification is especially important for an operator of an MV distribution system to plan the optimal maintenance or repair the faulty conductors since the fall of a tree branch can be solved later whereas the breakdown of a conductor means an immediate action of the operator...|$|E

Electrical testing of oven-aged cable samples was performed in order to relate the electrical functionality during a high-energy line break (HELB) to the mechanical properties and to establish a lifetime criterion. The mechanical data taken at room temperature after ageing could be superimposed with regard to ageing time and temperature. The ageingetemperature shift factor showed an Arrhenius temperature dependence. The jacketing material showed an immediate increase in stiffness (indenter modulus and Young’s modulus) {{and a decrease in}} the strain at break on ageing; these changes were dominated by loss of plasticizer by migration which was confirmed by IR spectroscopy and DSC. The <b>core</b> <b>insulation</b> showed smaller changes in these mechanical parameters; the loss of plasticizer by migration was greatly retarded by the closed environment, according to data obtained by IR spectroscopy and DSC, and the changes in the mechanical parameters were due to chemical degradation (de-hydrochlorination).

40|$|The {{distribution}} of Helium in the intracluster medium (ICM) permeating galaxy clusters {{is not well}} constrained due to the very high plasma temperature. Therefore, the plasma is often assumed to be homogeneous. A non-uniform Helium distribution can however lead to biases when measuring key cluster parameters. This has motivated one-dimensional models that evolve the ICM composition assuming {{that the effects of}} magnetic fields can be parameterized or ignored. Such models for non-isothermal clusters show that Helium can sediment in the cluster core leading to a peak in concentration offset from the cluster center. The resulting profiles have recently been shown to be linearly unstable when the weakly-collisional character of the magnetized plasma is considered. In this paper, we present {{a modified version of the}} MHD code Athena, which makes it possible to evolve a weakly-collisional plasma subject to a gravitational field and stratified in both temperature and composition. We thoroughly test our implementation and confirm excellent agreement against several analytical results. In order to isolate the effects of composition, in this initial study we focus our attention on isothermal plasmas. We show that plasma instabilities, feeding off gradients in composition, can induce turbulent mixing and saturate by re-arranging magnetic field lines and alleviating the composition gradient. Composition profiles that increase with radius lead to instabilities that saturate by driving the average magnetic field inclination to roughly 45 ^∘. We speculate that this effect may alleviate the <b>core</b> <b>insulation</b> observed in homogeneous settings, with potential consequences for the associated cooling flow problem.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{substantial}} {{efforts have been}} devoted to understanding the stability properties, transport phenomena, and long-term evolution of weakly-collisional, magnetized plasmas which are stratified in temperature. These studies have improved {{our understanding of the}} physics governing the intra-cluster medium (ICM), but assumed that ICM is a homogeneous. This, however, might not be a good approximation if heavy elements sediment in the inner region of the galaxy cluster. In this paper, we analyze the stability of a weakly-collisional, magnetized plane-parallel atmosphere which is stratified in both temperature and composition. This allows us to discuss {{for the first time the}} dynamics of weakly-collisional environments where heat conduction, momentum transport, and ion-diffusion are anisotropic with respect to the direction of the magnetic field. We show that, depending on the relative signs and magnitudes of the gradients in the temperature and the mean molecular weight, the plasma can be subject to a wide variety of unstable modes which include modifications to the magnetothermal instability (MTI), the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), and overstable gravity modes previously studied in homogeneous media. We discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings for a representative galaxy cluster where helium has sedimented. Our findings suggest that the <b>core</b> <b>insulation</b> that results from the magnetic field configurations that arise as a natural consequence of the HBI, which would be MTI stable in a homogeneous medium, could be alleviated if the mean molecular weight gradient is steep enough, i. e., (∇μ) /μ > (∇ T) /T.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{present the results}} on a {{reliability}} study on SMD components mounted on an organic power electronics substrate. The substrate technology has been developed {{to meet the needs}} of high ampacity and thermal conductivity with an organic substrate material. Therefore a thick structured copper core was introduced throughout the entire substrate size (see fig. 1). On top of the copper core common FR 4 multilayer structures are realised to create a typical SMD PCB surface. The bottom of the copper core was covered with one prepreg with a high thermal conductivity and one copper layer to be able to connect to a heat sink. The copper core becomes structured to enable the use as the layer for conducting high currents. Therefore insulation trenches were manufactured and plugged with a polymer. Introducing a copper core as described changes the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the substrate. Hence, due to the higher stiffness of the copper core PCB, the thermo-mechanical reliability of SMD components can be affected as well. Thermal cycling and shock tests were conducted to reveal the life time of ceramic chip resistors with a size of 0603, 0805 and 1206 in the case of mounting position entirely over the copper core or FR 4, over the copper core/FR 4 interface or over the copper <b>core</b> <b>insulation</b> trenches (see fig. 2).

40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{concrete}} sandwich panel originated in the United States in 1906 where a building was constructed with sandwich tilt-up wall panels. Since then sandwich panels have developed gradually and have continued to improve. [...] There {{are two types of}} concrete sandwich wall panels: (1) Architectural wall panels (non-composite type), and (2) Load bearing wall panels (composite and non-composite type). [...] In general, the non-composite type of load bearing panel is used more commonly because there are less limitations compared with the composite types. This thesis deals with the structural design and analysis of the non-composite type of load bearing wall panel. [...] In the past, certain problems besetted architects, engineers, and contractors working with concrete sandwich panels. These problems are associated with: [...] (1) Bonding between concrete and insulation [...] (2) Joints in panel [...] (3) Panel connections [...] (4) Control of cracking. [...] This study has been undertaken with the aim of solving some of these problems. Three experiments were conducted accordingly to determine the behavior of concrete sandwich panels. The first experiment was to investigate the effects of heating and cooling on sandwich panels and to compare the experimental results with theoretical calculations. The principal results of this experiment demonstrated the effects on concrete sandwich panels under varying thermal conditions. These results should serve as a guideline for the design of joints in sandwich panels. The second and third experiments were initiated to investigate and compare the bending stresses, deflections and shear strength in concrete sandwich panels either with or without shear connectors. The panels were subjected to a simulated uniformly distributed load under simply supported conditions. It can be concluded from the experimental results that a well designed anchor system joining the concrete sandwich panel faces through the <b>core</b> <b>insulation</b> is a fundamental requirement in the future production of sandwich wall panels in order to obtain full shear transfer between the faces. Without these shear connectors, a concrete structural sandwich panel will usually fail by shear of the bond between the core and faces or by shear failure of the core itself. [...] The deflection on a sandwich panel is the sum of ordinary bending deflection and an additional deflection associated with shear deformation of the core. Experimental results showed that deflections were mainly associated with shear deformation of the core for panels without shear connectors. [...] Deflections measured were less for panels containing shear connectors. For both panels, from theoretical calculations, {{it was found that the}} deflections were mainly associated with shear deformation, with less than 1 % due to bending. [...] A proper shear connector system transfers all lateral loads including wind forces from the exterior face to the interior structural face of the panel. Hence the sleeve anchor, torsion anchors and connector pins play a very important part in the performance of concrete sandwich panels. Prestressing techniques can also improve the design of such panels and have been widely used in recent developments of sandwich panels. [...] For this study, a typical non-composite type of concrete sandwich panel was selected as a design example. For the design of such concrete sandwich panels, the following factors were carefully considered: [...] (1) The thickness of both faces of the panel [...] (2) The loading conditions [...] (3) The fire resistance of the sandwich panel [...] (4) The temperature gradient between the faces, and [...] (5) The panel anchor system...|$|E
