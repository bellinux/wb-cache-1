40|$|The LEP Q-meter {{allows the}} {{excitation}} and observation of transverse beam oscillations. The instrument {{is used for}} <b>continuous</b> <b>tune</b> measurements but also for single shot precision measurements of spectra which contain all resonances. As the repetition rate of signals at LEP is low the Q-meter has been conceived around two fast processors treating the beam data on-line at {{the pace of the}} LEP revolution frequency. The continuotis tune measurement is based on a phase-locked loop, implemented as an algorithm on the fast processors. The beam is excited sinusoidally and the frequency of the excitation is forced to follow the tunes by a phase lock. The measured tunes are stored into tables at fixed time intervals and are available for further analysis. The principal application of this mode is the monitoring of the machine tunes during critical procedures uch as energy ramping or beta squeezing. In order to keep the tunes constant deviations of the measured tunes from reference values are used to compute online corrections for the currents of the main quadrupole chains. Further applications of the <b>continuous</b> <b>tune</b> measurement are the observation of magnetic coupling between the CERN SPS and LEP and a dynamic measurement of chromaticity by using a RF modulation and calculating the chromaticity from the observed tune changes. 1...|$|R

5000|$|DBR lasers {{are often}} {{confused}} with DFB lasers. [...] Both exhibit narrow linewidth and stable single frequency operation. However, {{the location of}} the feedback element (the grating) causes the DBR and the DFB to have distinct operational characteristics. Because the grating is distributed all along the gain region in the DFB, the grating and gain region experience similar conditions as the device is tuned with current and temperature. The DFB can exhibit a <b>continuous</b> <b>tuning</b> range of 2 nm or more. However, over a sufficiently long current or temperature range, the emitted wavelength will suddenly jump to a longer wavelength (red shift), leaving a gap in the tuning range.|$|E

40|$|Phase locked loop (PLL) {{systems are}} being used on several {{machines}} for <b>continuous</b> <b>tune</b> measurements. All these implementations {{are based on a}} continuous sinusoidal beam excitation and a monitoring of the resulting beam oscillation. The key element determining the dynamic performance of such a PLL is the phase detector between the beam oscillation and the internal oscillation. Most circuits use a quadrature phase detector, for which the high frequency carrier at twice the excitation frequency is attenuated by a low-pass circuit. The remaining ripple of this component contributes to the bandwidth/noise performance of the PLL. In this paper we propose an alternative solution for the filter, notably an adaptive notch filter. We explain in detail design considerations and the resulting improvements in PLL bandwidth and/or noise figure. The phase difference could be extracted from the input sine function in a way similar to a Fourier integral, which is a very good filter.
