50|$|In 1950, this sole Class 20 {{locomotive}} {{was modified}} to an experimental <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive,</b> {{equipped with a}} condensing tender that was ordered from Henschel in Germany in 1948. Beginning in 1951, tests with the condensing Class 20 were conducted in the Eastern Transvaal and the Karoo. The positive results of the condensing trials proved the viability of condensing locomotives in South Africa {{and led to the}} introduction of the Class 25 4-8-4 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive</b> fleet in 1953.|$|E
50|$|The {{pictures}} {{illustrate the}} Class 20 locomotive as built with a Type MP1 tender, then {{fitted with a}} larger capacity Type MT2 tender, and finally after modification to an experimental <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive</b> with a Type CL tender.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> were a rarity, but no novelty to South Africa, {{since the}} first <b>condensing</b> steam <b>locomotives</b> had already entered service in the Cape of Good Hope {{in the late nineteenth}} century. Between 1886 and 1888, three well-tank <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> with a 0-4-0 wheel {{arrangement}} were placed in service by the Cape Copper Mining Company on its Namaqualand Railway, a [...] gauge line between Port Nolloth and O'okiep.|$|R
50|$|Ninety Class 25 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{introduced}} simultaneously, acquired {{as a means}} to deal with the shortage of adequate supplies of suitable locomotive water in the arid Karoo. The design work on the engine’s condensing apparatus and the enormous condensing tender was carried out by Henschel, who built one locomotive complete with tender as well as sixty of the condensing tenders, to which they held the patent. The other 89 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> and thirty tenders were built by NBL.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1886 and 1888, three well-tank <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were placed}} in service by the Cape Copper Mining Company on its [...] Namaqualand Railway between Port Nolloth and O'okiep in the Cape Colony. They were the first <b>condensing</b> steam <b>locomotives</b> to enter service in South Africa. They were later rebuilt as {{conventional}} well-tank locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, the South African Railways placed one Class 20 steam {{locomotive}} with a 2-10-2 Santa Fe type wheel arrangement in service, {{designed and built}} at its Pretoria Mechanical Shops. In 1950, it was modified to an experimental <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Type CL tender {{was built}} by Henschel and Son with works number T28388. In 1950, the South African Railways (SAR) {{modified}} its sole Class 20 locomotive to an experimental <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive</b> equipped with this condensing tender which had been ordered from Henschel in 1948.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1951, the {{locomotive}} was relocated to Touws River where it was used for further condensing tests and occasionally put to work in regular service. The positive results of the condensing trials led {{to the introduction of}} the Class 25 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive</b> fleet in 1953.|$|E
50|$|Between 1886 and 1888, three well-tank <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> with a 0-4-0 wheel {{arrangement}} {{were placed}} in service by the Cape Copper Mining Company on its two foot six inch gauge Namaqualand Railway between Port Nolloth and O'okiep in the Cape of Good Hope. They were the first <b>condensing</b> steam <b>locomotives</b> to enter service in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|They were followed, between 1886 and 1888, {{by three}} 0-4-0WT <b>condensing</b> <b>{{locomotive}}s</b> and, between 1890 and 1904, by eight 0-6-2 Clara Class and Scotia Class Mountain type tender locomotives. A single 0-4-2IST locomotive named Caledonia entered shunting service in 1904.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} Class 25NC, ninety Class 25 <b>{{condensing}}</b> <b>locomotives</b> were built {{as part of}} the same order, one by Henschel and the rest by NBL. The condensing apparatus for these engines and their condensing tenders were designed and patented by Henschel.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, the Class 20 was {{modified}} to an experimental <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive</b> in the Pretoria workshops, fitted with German Witte-style smoke deflectors, an extension to the chimney and a Type CL condensing tender {{which had been}} ordered from Henschel in 1948. This condensing tender, with Henschel works no. T28388, was designed for a Deutsche Reichsbahn Class 52 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive.</b> It {{was modified}} slightly and was equipped {{with a pair of}} Buckeye three-axle bogies instead of the German arrangement of one six-wheeled and one four-wheeled bogie. It had an 11 lt t coal capacity, a 3900 imp gal water capacity and a 13 lt 17 lcwt 3 qtr kg axle load. The total weight of the modified engine and Type CL tender in full working order was 158 lt 3 lcwt kg.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive,</b> no. 1, named John Taylor after a {{director}} of the Cape Copper Mining Company, was built in 1886 with Kitson works number T198. It was delivered in mid-1886 and commenced trial runs in July 1886 before entering service on the 22 mi section from Port Nolloth to Abbevlaack in August 1886.|$|E
50|$|On the <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive,</b> spent steam was {{recycled}} and condensed back {{to water}} for repeated use. Since the steam wasn't expelled up the chimney, the Class 25's smokebox contained a steam turbine-driven fan beneath the chimney {{to keep the}} draught going, with deflector plates {{that were supposed to}} prevent char from causing excessive wear on the fan blades.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the problem}} could {{probably}} be ascribed {{to the fact that}} the exhaust steam from the rear power unit contributed nothing to the smokebox draught, the same phenomenon which would, half a century later, necessitate the installation of induced draught equipment on South Africa’s Class 25 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 15 May 1893, {{with the}} upper section {{upgraded}} for locomotive operation {{and the first}} three Mountain locomotives in service, {{it was possible to}} introduce a through steam-hauled service from the coast to O'okiep. The older <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> were then relegated to lesser duties, mostly restricted to the lower section near the coast.|$|R
50|$|The South African type CL tender was a <b>condensing</b> steam <b>locomotive</b> tender.|$|R
50|$|The South African Railways (SAR) placed fifty Class 25NC {{locomotives}} {{in service}} between 1953 and 1955. The locomotive and tender {{were designed by}} L.C. Grubb, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1949 to 1954. It was the non-condensing version of the Class 25 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive,</b> of which ninety were placed in service at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Between 1951 and 1953, 21 4-8-2 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for RR by Henschel and Son {{to the design}} of the South African Class 19D, as their 19th class and 19C class. Their tenders were similar to the South African version’s Torpedo type, but with plate frame instead of Buckeye bogies. One of these, the sole RR 19C class, was built as a <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Between 1953 and 1955, the South African Railways placed fifty Class 25NC steam {{locomotives}} with a 4-8-4 Northern {{type wheel}} arrangement in service. The Class 25NC was the non-condensing {{version of the}} Class 25 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive,</b> of which ninety were placed in service at the same time. Between 1973 and 1980, all but three of the condensing locomotives were converted to non-condensing and also designated Class 25NC.|$|E
5|$|When {{the line}} reopened in 1907 just one {{locomotive}} was used. This was a Beyer Peacock 4-4-0T built in 1879 for the Metropolitan Railway in London, it was number 37 of their A Class <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives.</b> It {{arrived on the}} railway on 30 June 1907 {{by way of a}} temporary connection from the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Kentsford.|$|R
50|$|Between 1886 and 1888, three 0-4-0 well-tank <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{acquired}} from Kitson and Company. They were named John Taylor, Juanita and Jackal respectively and, like the earlier 0-6-0T locomotives, they were operated with tenders {{due to the}} scarcity of water along the line. The tenders {{for the first two}} locomotives seem to have been acquired separately.|$|R
50|$|The {{total of}} 859 units {{had a number}} of {{improvements}} to the driving and running gear. Originally it was intended to build very large numbers of these engines, but the end of the Second World War put paid to that. A <b>condenser</b> <b>locomotive,</b> based on the Class 42 was also planned, but did not come to fruition.|$|R
50|$|On the SAR, it {{was only}} after the Second World War that {{extensive}} condensing tests were carried out with the modified Class 20 locomotive. The approximately 90% water and 10% coal savings which were achieved during the tests with the Class 20 in the Eastern Transvaal and the Karoo in 1950 and 1951 led to the decision to proceed with the design of a new <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|During trials, a saving {{of between}} 88% and 93% on water {{as well as}} a lower coal {{consumption}} were attained, the latter brought about by the higher temperature of the feedwater condensate. Depending on the operating conditions, a water range of between 400 and 680 mi was achieved. The positive results of the condensing trials led to the introduction of the Class 25 4-8-4 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive</b> fleet between 1953 and 1955.|$|E
50|$|A single RR 19C class, no. 336, {{was built}} by Henschel in 1953 as a <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive.</b> After a {{collision}} in 1956, it was rebuilt into a non-condensing 19th Class and re-entered service in 1958. The condensing tender was rebuilt to a Torpedo tender by mounting a tank and coal bunker, supplied locally in Bulawayo, on the frame. This rebuilt tender is the one paired with no. 330 which is preserved in the Bulawayo Railway Museum.|$|E
50|$|When {{the line}} reopened in 1907 just one {{locomotive}} was used. This was a Beyer Peacock 4-4-0T built in 1879 for the Metropolitan Railway in London, it was number 37 of their A Class <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives.</b> It {{arrived on the}} railway on 30 June 1907 {{by way of a}} temporary connection from the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Kentsford.|$|R
50|$|The South African Railways Class 25 4-8-4 of 1953 was a <b>condensing</b> steam <b>locomotive.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the arrival}} of their {{successor}} tender locomotives beginning in 1890, {{it was possible to}} introduce a through steam-hauled service from the coast to O'okiep from 15 May 1893. The <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> were then relegated to lesser duties, mainly ballast, sand clearing and other work trains. They also served as standby power to cover breakdowns and overhauls of the new mainline locomotives.|$|R
50|$|On the Class 25 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive,</b> spent steam was {{fed through}} a thick pipe on the engine's left side {{back to the}} tender, to be {{condensed}} back to water for repeated use. The Type CZ tender was built on a one-piece cast-steel water-bottom frame, supplied by General Steel Castings in the United States of America, and rode on three-axle bogies with Timken roller bearings. It had four 21 in diameter vacuum brake cylinders and the brake riggings of its bogies were independent of each other. Only the front bogie was equipped with a hand brake.|$|E
50|$|The arid {{nature of}} {{a large part of}} South Africa and the {{consequent}} difficulty to ensure adequate and suitable water supplies for steam locomotives led to a decision to experiment with condensing locomotives. Such locomotives had by then already been built by Henschel and Son for use in Argentina, 240 Kriegsloks for the Eastern Front in Germany in the 1930s and more than 4,000 units of the Russian SOK class, mainly for use in Turkestan and other arid regions of the Soviet Union. In the pre-war years, the SAR considered modifying a Class 12A into a <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive,</b> but this never happened.|$|E
50|$|The tender was {{designed}} for a Deutsche Reichsbahn Class 52 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotive.</b> It was modified slightly and was equipped {{with a pair of}} Buckeye three-axle bogies instead of the German arrangement of one six-wheeled and one four-wheeled bogie. It had an 11 lt t coal capacity, a 3900 imp gal water capacity which included the underbelly condensate tank, and a 13 lt 17 lcwt 3 qtr kg maximum axle load. The tender was capable of condensing 27000 lb of exhaust steam per hour in maximum operating temperatures of between 100 and 110 F. The tender had six large radiators on each side, cooled by three exhaust steam-driven roof-mounted fans which drew air from outside through the radiators.|$|E
50|$|Like their {{predecessor}} <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives,</b> these tender locomotives were {{equipped with}} sheet-metal casing {{above and below}} the running boards. This was to protect the motion and bearings as well as working parts of the J. Hawthorn-Kitson valve gear above the running boards from wind-blown sand. The bottom encasement was hinged to allow easy access to the motion. The engines all had copper boilers.|$|R
50|$|Between 1973 and 1980, {{after serving}} {{for twenty years}} and {{partially}} accelerated {{by the introduction of}} electric and diesel-electric traction over routes which were previously served exclusively by the Class 25, all but three of the Class 25 <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives,</b> numbers 3451, 3511 and 3540, were converted to free-exhausting and non-condensing locomotives as they went through the workshops for major overhauls. The converted locomotives were reclassified to Class 25NC.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1951, {{tests with}} the {{condensing}} Class 20, named Pretoria, {{were conducted in}} the Eastern Transvaal and the Karoo. It proved the viability of <b>condensing</b> <b>locomotives</b> in South Africa by attaining a saving of between 88% and 93% on water {{as well as a}} lower coal consumption, the latter brought about by the higher temperature of the condensed feedwater. Depending on the operating conditions, a water range of between 400 and 680 mi was achieved.|$|R
