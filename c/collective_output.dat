Distributed cognition has attracted interest in several fields ranging from sociology and law to computer science and the philosophy of science. In this paper, I discuss distributed cognition from a social-choice-theoretic perspective. Drawing on models of judgment aggregation, I address two questions. First, how can we model a group of individuals as a distributed cognitive system? Second, can a group acting as a distributed cognitive system be ‘rational’ and ‘track the truth’ in the outputs it produces? I argue that a group’s performance as a distributed cognitive system depends on its ‘aggregation procedure’ – its mechanism for aggregating the group members’ inputs into <b>collective</b> <b>outputs</b> – and I investigate the properties of an aggregation procedure that matter...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{modular product}} unit neural network {{architecture}} {{is presented to}} model singly constrained spatial interaction flows. Modularity is seen as decomposition on the computational level. The network is composed of two processing layers. The first layer is implemented as a layer of functionally independent modules with identical topologies. Each module is a feedforward network with two inputs, H hidden product units and terminates with a single summation unit. The <b>collective</b> <b>outputs</b> of these modules constitute the input to the second processing layer consisting of output units that perform the flow prediction. The efficacy of the model approach is demonstrated for the origin constrained case of spatial interaction using Austrian interregional telecommunication traffic data. The model requires a global search procedure for parameter estimation, such as the Alopex procedure. A benchmark comparison against the standard origin constrained gravity model and the two-stage neural network approach, suggested by Openshaw (1998), illustrates {{the superiority of the}} proposed model in terms of generalisation performance measured by ARV and SRMSE...|$|R

40|$|Cortical and hippocampal EEG show {{differences}} 2 Several {{lines of}} evidence have challenged {{the assumption that}} sleep is a whole brain phenomenon. The idea of covert rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) processes (Nielsen, 2000) suggests that activity in {{different areas of the}} brain participate in different behavioral states at once. Posited covert REMS processes are consistent with a model of brain organization that begins at a local, neuronal group level and eventually leads to sleep as defined on macroscopic levels through <b>collective</b> <b>outputs</b> (Krueger & Obál, 1993). Furthermore, the assumption of brain state homogeneity is methodologically convenient, but may lead to inconsistencies in observations of sleep states underlying learning processes. We found that that a hippocampal-dependent learning condition elicits heterogeneity in rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and transition-to-REMS (TREMS) states in the hippocampus and cortex. These results depict that the states of these local structures differ when scored from respective EEG. Consequently, placement of electrodes influences the characterization of sleep states. Measuring sleep from the structures predicted to be affected by experimental manipulation may be a first step in reconciling inconsistencies in the extant literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{creative}} class approach (Florida, 2002 b) {{has led to}} many developments. Therefore, {{measurement of}} creativity (Chantelot, 2010), economic influence of creative people in urban (Marlet & Van Woerkens, 2007) and rural (McGranahan & Wojan, 2007) environments, or creative people geography (Chantelot & al., 2010) and factors that shape it (Boshma & Fritsch, 2009) have been investigated. Increasingly, these works tend to substitute static considerations (who and where are creative people?) to dynamic approaches (what do the creative people?). Creativity mainly comes from talent (Florida, 2002 a) but creative production is generated through collective process where social interactions, learning and diffusion of ideas predominate (Cohendet & Simon, 2008). The transition from individual to collective process particularly appears {{to be driven by}} cities, defined as privileged theaters of creativity (Hall, 1998). Hence, cities managing to convert micro or individuals ideas to macro or <b>collective</b> <b>outputs</b> can be defined as "creative cities". It sheds light on the determinant role of cities in attracting, organizing and producing creative people in order to experience virtuous path of economic competitiveness (Lucas, 1988). This communication aims to give a conceptual framework to characterize creative cities. At the urban level, it formalizes the micro / macro transition: micro level consists in talent, which includes both individuals with a creative profession directly involved in the production of innovations, new knowledge and ideas - both related to the industrial or scientific sphere (the 'creative core') and arts (the Bohemians) - or in its implementation and management on the market (the 'creative professionals' - ibid.). Therefore, the aim is to connect creative or innovative clusters of firms (where creative pro and core mainly work) with creative urban districts characterized by intense cultural and artistic, driven by Bohemians, and places of socialization and urban regeneration. This connection can be ensured by a meso level characterized by the presence of communities that facilitate the micro/macro-ideas transition to the market. The definition of these three different levels, the construction of their measure, and the way to identify their respective roles and interactions that shape the creative city structure the dynamic conceptual model we propose here...|$|R

40|$|We assess {{supernova}} (SN) -driven pregalactic outflows as {{a mechanism}} for distributing the product of stellar nucleosynthesis over large cosmological volumes prior to the reionization epoch. SN ejecta will escape the grasp of halos with virial temperatures T_vir> 10 ^{ 4. 3 } K (corresponding to masses M> 10 ^ 8 h^{- 1 } M_sun at redshift z= 9 when they collapse from 2 -sigma fluctuations) if rapid cooling can take place, and a significant fraction of their baryonic mass is converted into stars over a dynamical timescale. We study the evolution of SN-driven bubbles as they blow out from subgalactic halos and propagate into the intergalactic medium (IGM), and show that to lift the halo gas out of the potential well the energy injection must continue at least until blow-away occurs. The <b>collective</b> explosive <b>output</b> of about ten thousands SNe per halo at these early epochs could pollute vast regions of intergalactic space to a mean metallicity =Omega_Z/Omega_b> 0. 003 (comparable to the levels observed in the Lyman-alpha forest at z= 3) without much perturbing the IGM hydrodynamically, i. e. producing large variations of the baryons relative to the dark matter. The volume filling factor of the ejecta is higher than 20 % if the star formation efficiency is of order 10 %.
