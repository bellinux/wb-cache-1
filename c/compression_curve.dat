5000|$|It {{was common}} {{to use the}} 1176 in 'all-button mode' or 'British mode'. This was when {{all four of the}} ratio buttons are pressed simultaneously."The way the 1176 sounds, and specifically, the way All-Button mode sounds, is {{partially}} due to its being a program dependent compressor. The attack and release are program dependent, as is the ratio.The 1176 will faithfully compress or limit at the selected ratio for transients, but the ratio will always increase a bit after the transient. To what degree is once again material dependent. This is true for any of the 1176’s ratio settings, and is part of the 1176’s sound.But in All-Button Mode, a few more things are happening; the ratio goes to somewhere between 12:1 and 20:1, and the bias points change all over the circuit. As a result, the attack and release times change. This change in attack and release times and the <b>compression</b> <b>curve</b> that results is the main contributor to the All-Button sound. This is what gives way to the trademark overdriven tone. The shape of the <b>compression</b> <b>curve</b> changes dramatically in All-Button. Where 4:1 is a gentle slope, All-Button is more like severe plateau! Furthermore, in All-Button mode there is a lag time on the attack of initial transients. This strange phenomenon might be described as a [...] "reverse look-ahead".|$|E

Identification of characteristic limiting water contents for any fine grained soil system, along with the unique mechanisms controlling them, helps obtain the limiting compression curves.

In the present work, uniaxial confined compression tests were performed on four soils having various textures and different plasticity.

40|$|International audienceOedometer tests {{starting}} {{from a very}} small effective vertical stress of 0. 5 kPa were performed on three reconstituted clays with different liquid limits. The soils were prepared at various initial water contents, ranging from 0. 7 to 2. 0 times their corresponding liquid limits. It is observed that the e-logσv´ <b>compression</b> <b>curves</b> show an inverse “S” shape due to suction pressure resisting deformation, {{similar to that of}} soft natural clays caused by consolidation yield stress. The suction pressure σs´ of the reconstituted clays can be correlated with the ratio of initial void ratio to void ratio at liquid limit e 0 /eL. The suction pressure curve (SPC) defined by a unique relationship between suction pressure σs´ and the normalised void ratio at suction pressure es/eL is also proposed to distinguish between the pre-suction and the post-suction states. In addition, Burland's concept of intrinsic compression line (ICL) is adopted for correlating the <b>compression</b> <b>curves</b> of various reconstituted clays at high initial water contents. It has been found that the void index is a powerful parameter for normalising the <b>compression</b> <b>curves</b> in the post-suction state. Nevertheless, it seems that Burland's ICL slightly underestimates the void index at the low stresses considered in this study.

This paper incorporates soil structure by simulating cemented sand, and the effects of inter-particle bonding (including bond strength and strength distributions) on the one-dimensional compression behaviour and evolving particle size distributions are investigated.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} the description of structureless clay behaviour is proposed in this paper. It {{is based on the}} observation that there exists a biunique relationship between the radial stress path direction and the <b>compression</b> <b>curve</b> on the specific volume (v = 1 + e) -mean effective stress (σ or p) plane. The projection on the v - σ plane defines the Intrinsic <b>Compression</b> <b>Curve</b> (ICC) of the corresponding radial stress path, which results in infinite possible ICC curves. Following a normalization procedure, a general methodology is presented, which can be applied to any mathematical formulation of the ICC curve. The constants included in this description are called intrinsic properties. This procedure can be easily implemented to anisotropic constitutive models. Its importance is {{based on the fact that}} modern constitutive models require a definition of the structureless state, as this state is the limiting reference state of the fully destructured material. In addition, the paper presents a set of correlations for the estimation of the intrinsic properties from the index properties, which helps on the preliminary selection of the material constants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Currently in Brazil, as {{in other}} parts of the world, the concern is great with the {{increase}} of degraded agricultural soil, which is mostly related to the occurrence of soil compaction. Although soil texture is recognized as a very important component in the soil compressive behaviors, there are few studies that quantify its influence on the structural changes of Latosols in the Brazilian Cerrado region. This study aimed to evaluate structural changes and the compressive behavior of Latosols in Rio Verde, Goiás, through the modeling of additional soil compaction. The study was carried out using five Latosols with very different textures, under different soil compaction levels.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the accuracy and the relationship among seven of these methods by computational simulation of soil compression curves under nine scenarios. The following methods were used: Casagrande, Pacheco Silva, intersection of the initial void ratio with the virgin compression line (VCLzero), and the regression methods based on 2 (reg 1), 3 (reg 2), 4 (reg 3), and 5 (reg 4) points for modeling the elastic curve. Under each scenario, created by combining the swelling and the compression indices, 1, 000 compression curves were computationally simulated via the Monte Carlo method. Subsequently, 95 % percentile confidence intervals were built using the 1, 000 estimates of &# 963;p from each method under each scenario. Most of the differences among the methods were detected under scenarios consisting of high swelling and low compression indices.
