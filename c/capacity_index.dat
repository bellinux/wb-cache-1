A linear regression model was used to analyse {{the relationship between the}} Bp of the muscle oxygenation index (OI) and the systemic aerobic <b>capacity</b> <b>indices.</b> The Bp of the muscle OI in both the VL (BpVL) and GL (BpGL) were significantly correlated with the aerobic <b>capacity</b> <b>indices.</b> Additionally, the BpVL had a better goodness-of-fit [higher coefficient of determination (R 2, p < 0. 001) and lower root mean squared error (RMSE, p < 0. 03) ] in the linear regressions and occurred earlier than the BpGL.

The phosphate capacity has {{a close relationship with}} the phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index,</b> whereas the logarithm of phosphate capacity is 12. 724 greater than that of phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> at 1873 K (1600 degrees C). The developed phosphate capacity prediction model can be also used to predict the phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> with reliable accuracy compared with the measured and the predicted phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> of the slags by other models in literatures. The results from the IMCT phosphate capacity prediction model show that the comprehensive effects of iron oxides and basic components control the dephosphorization reaction with an optimal ratio of (pct FeO) /(pct Fe 2 O 3) as 0. 62.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{association}} between fat-free mass (FFM), quadriceps strength and sarcopenia with aerobic fitness indexes of elderly women. A total of 189 volunteers (66. 7 ± 5. 46 years) underwent aerobic capacity measurement through a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine their individual ventilatory thresholds (VT) and peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak). Quadriceps muscle strength was assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer. Also, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to assess FFM and cutoff values were used to classify subjects as sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic. Correlations, student t-test and analysis of variance were used to examine the data. Both FFM and quadriceps strength variables were positively and significantly correlated with the measured aerobic <b>capacity</b> <b>indexes.</b> These results were observed for peak exercise as well as for ventilatory thresholds. Individuals classified as sarcopenic presented significantly lower muscle strength and (VO 2 peak) when compared to nonsarcopenic.

Procedures: Forty Saudi male subjects were selected. Their ages ranged from 18 - 25 years old. They were divided into two groups. In experimental group there were 20 subjects who were smoking water pipe (21. 8 ± 2. 6) years while in the control group there were 20 subjects (20. 6 ± 1. 9) years.

Rest calf blood flow and femoral occlusion induced calf blood flow changes were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography before and after intravenous infusion of 10 % L-arginine solution (5  ml/kg for 30  minutes) or placebo. Postexercise calf blood flow was also measured after the experimental infusion. During both postinfusion periods, several exercise <b>capacity</b> <b>indices</b> were determined by a symptom limited cardiopulmonary exercise test using a bicycle ergometer.  RESULTS—Baseline calf blood flow, systemic blood pressure, and heart rate showed no significant changes in either of the two experimental conditions. However, the occlusion induced blood flow response was significantly enhanced by L-arginine infusion (mean (SEM) peak flow, 19. 6  (1. 5) v 28. 9  (3. 1) ml/min/dl calf tissue; p < 0. 01), but not by placebo (peak flow, 19. 1  (1. 4) v 20. 9  (1. 8) ml/min/dl calf tissue; NS). Calf blood flow response after exercise was also higher after L-arginine infusion than after placebo (peak flow, 4. 8  (0. 4) v 6. 0  (0. 8) ml/min/dl calf tissue; p <  0. 05).

We designed a prospective study {{to investigate the}} predictive value of BNP in comparison with established clinical risk scores for the outcome of major orthopedic surgery. Methods: Overall 242 elderly patients [80 (74 - 85) years] undergoing orthopedic surgery were included. Inhospital cardiovascular events and 1 -year mortality were the main endpoints. Results: In total 20 (8. 3 %) patients had major cardiovascular events (MACE) and 41 (21. 1 %) died in 1 year. Logistic regression analysis for prediction of cardiac events and 1 -year mortality, respectively, revealed a significant prognostic value for the BNP (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 041), Goldman (P = 0. 013 and P = 0. 003), Lee (P = 0. 022 and P = 0. 200), Detsky (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 001), and functional <b>capacity</b> <b>indices</b> (P = 0. 034 and P = 0. 001). BNP cutoff 149 ng/ml improved discrimination of all scores to predict MACE, and BNP cutoff 89 ng/ml improved discrimination of all scores to predict 1 -year mortality (Net Reclassification Improvement, P values < 0. 05 in all cases). Age [hazard ratio (HR) : 1. 100, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 039 - 1. 166, P = 0. 001] and BNP (HR: 1. 002, 95 % CI: 1. 000 - 1. 003, P = 0. 041) were independent associates of 1 -year mortality.
