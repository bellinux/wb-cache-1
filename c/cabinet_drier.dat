40|$|There {{are several}} underutilised and {{neglected}} species used as {{food in the}} world. These food sources are under threat of disappearing and their knowledge base being forgotten. One such plant is the Cordia africana. Though it grows all over Africa and the Middle East, focus on its use has been limited to its wood value. In addition to the wood value, this study has showed {{that it has a}} great potential in contributing to the overall nutrition of our society, especially as it is a tree and is known to be able to produce fruits even in drought years. This is a fruit that is locally available, cheap and easy to use, and its use value is well known by the local communities. With the climate change and the increasing human population, it is wise to conserve and promote such food sources, and make them available for a wider range of our population through improved processing and marketing. Nutritionally Cordia africana was found to be a good source of total phenols. It is also a good partial source for nutritionally important vitamin A and Iron, as well as for protein, vitamin C, calcium, copper, potassium, magnesium, manganese, and phosphorus. Additionally, it was found to contain very little zinc and sodium. The physical characteristics and nutritional composition was found to vary across land use and agroecology, showing that there is a high potential for further improvement, and need for studying and selecting materials to be used for propagation. The fruit processing study showed that the fresh fruit processing needs improvment, while fruit marketing needs further study and improvement. With the dried fruits, the <b>cabinet</b> <b>drier</b> substantially reduced the time needed for drying from 63 to 5 days, and the dried fruit processing has great potential and needs further study. The jam was also possible to make, and needs further study on processing, packaging, shelf life and marketing potential. The fruit as a whole and the processed products need promotion and marketing. The traditional medicinal value assessment showed that the fruit is used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms, and the anthelmintic and constipation treatment claims show potential and need further study. As the fruit has been used as food for a long time, if through research it is found to be effective as an anthelmintic and constipation treatment, the use of it will not only help with mitigating the illnesses but also improve nutrition. In conclusion, the fruit was found to be a nutritious fruit, which needs further attention in assessing its processing options, marketing and promotion. As there was great variation in the tested properties, {{there is a need for}} the screening and selection of appropriate seed sources for the promotion and wide scale planting. It also merits further investigation into its medicinal use...|$|E

Despite the {{recent advances in}} science and technology the bulk of dried fruit production throughout the world, over 1 1 / 2 billion tons (dry basis), is prepared by the energy of the sun (Copley and Van Arsdel, 1964), However, other techniques and processes for food dehydration and preservation are occupying more prominent positions in the overall production of dehydrated foods, particularly in the more advanced countries. Economics notwithstanding, it is readily apparent that dehydration as compared to sun-drying offers at least two main advantages.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the effect of various dehydration techniques on the nutritional quality of mango (Mangifera indica L.) products. In {{the first phase of the}} study, nutritional characteristics of fresh immature mango of different varieties were determined. The results revealed that maximum TSS, protein, non-reducing sugar, K and Cu were recorded in variety Langra. Whereas, maximum moisture, ash, fat, total sugar, reducing sugar and Mn were observed in variety Sindhri, however, variety Chaunsa showed higher vitamin C, Mg and Cr content. It was further observed that variety Desi was rich in minerals such as Na, Ca, Zn and Fe with maximum acidity. In the second phase of the study mango powder was prepared from different mango varieties using different drying techniques. The results of mango powder prepared with-peel showed that variety Chaunsa had significantly higher moisture and vitamin C content, whereas TSS, total sugar, reducing sugar, Ca, K, Mg, Cu were higher in without peel powder in variety Chaunsa than other varieties. Among the drying methods, maximum moisture was retained in wooden glass drying method (12. 88 %), whereas, maximum TSS, ash, protein, vitamin C and non-reducing sugar were observed in mango powder <b>dried</b> under <b>cabinet</b> <b>drying</b> method. Moreover, the majority of the minerals were found in maximum quantity in mango powder dried under wooden glass drying method. During the third phase of the study the unripe and ripened mangoes of different varieties were picked from various tree positions viz. top, middle and bottom. The results revealed that during ripening period the TSS was increased in all the varieties. It was further observed that maximum moisture (85. 28 %) and total sugar (29. 36 %) was observed in ripened Chaunsa mangoes. The higher Vitamin C content (26. 34 mg 100 g- 1) was found in ripened Langra mangoes than other varieties. The unripe variety Desi had the highest acidity (0. 47 %) as compared to other unripe and ripened mango varieties. It was also observed that minerals were significantly higher in unripe than ripened mangoes, Na, Ca and Zn were higher in variety Desi, Mg, Fe, Cr and Mn were maximum in variety Chaunsa, whereas, variety Sindhri and Langra were rich in K and Cu, respectively. Among the mangoes picked from different tree positions, moisture, TSS, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar, ash, acidity, vitamin C, Na, Ca, Fe, Mg, Cr and Mn were higher in mangoes picked from top tree position as compared to middle and bottom positions. In the last phase of the study, the slices were prepared from mangoes of different varieties obtained from top, middle and bottom tree positions using different drying methods. It was reflected that the mango slices of variety Chaunsa prepared from top tree position mangoes, had the highest pH, ash, TSS and vitamin C content. It was further observed that moisture content was highest (12. 88 %) in slices of mangoes of variety Sindhri obtained from top tree position and dried under wooden glass drying method. However, total sugar, reducing and non reducing sugars were significantly higher in slices of variety Chaunsa obtained from top tree position, whereas, Ca content of variety Desi was higher in <b>cabinet</b> <b>drying</b> method in slices prepared from top tree position than all other varieties. <b>Cabinet</b> <b>drying</b> method resulted in higher quantities of K (819. 60 mg kg- 1), Mg (78. 64 mg kg- 1), Zn (2. 62 mg kg- 1), Fe (6. 86 mg kg- 1), Cu (5. 92 mg kg- 1), Cr (1. 02 mg kg- 1) and Mn (3. 22 mg kg- 1) as compared to open sun drying and wooden glass drying methods.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, construction and performance {{evaluation of a}} mixed-mode solar dryer for food preservation. In the dryer, the heated air from a separate solar collector is passed through a grain bed, {{and at the same}} time, the <b>drying</b> <b>cabinet</b> absorbs solar energy directly through the transparent walls and roof. The results obtained during the test period revealed that the temperatures inside the dryer and solar collector were much higher than the ambient temperature during most hours of the day-light. The temperature rise inside the <b>drying</b> <b>cabinet</b> was up to 74 % for about three hours immediately after 12. 00 h (noon). The drying rate and system efficiency were 0. 62 kg/h and 57. 5 % respectively. The rapid rate of drying in the dryer reveals its ability to dry food items reasonably rapidly to a safe moisture level...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{providing}} a comparative evaluation of tomato processing by-products, i. e., seeds and peel. A pilot scale {{process has been}} demonstrated for extraction and drying (both freeze and <b>cabinet</b> <b>drying)</b> of tomato seeds and peel. Various aspects of dried tomato seeds such as its protein content, amino acid profile, calculated protein efficiency ratio (PER), presence of antinutritional factors, polyphenol contents and antioxidant activities were evaluated. In this study, the total polyphenol content in the hydrophilic extract as well as antioxidant activities of tomato peel {{were found to be}} 66. 5 and 38. 2 % higher, respectively, than that of the tomato seed meal showing importance of the former from a functional point of view. Tomato seed protein isolate (92 %) prepared from tomato seed meal had a calculated PER of 2. 66. The protein isolate contained all essential amino acids (including lysine), meeting the minimum requirements of reference protein for preschool children aged 1 – 2 years (WHO/FAO/UNU). The tomato seed protein isolate showed negligible levels of phytate (3. 48 [*]μg/g) and trypsin inhibitory activity (2. 655 [*]TIU/mg). This study clearly highlights that tomato seed, a by-product of tomato processing industry, is a rich source of high-quality plant protein together with intrinsic polyphenols and antioxidant activities, although the functional properties being less dominant than the peel counterpart. Therefore, tomato seed meal with unique protein quality could be regarded as a potential source of protein-rich adjunct in various food formulations...|$|R
