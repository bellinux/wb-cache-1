5|$|C. Norwegian equestrian athlete Tony André Hansen's horse tested {{positive}} for the pain relieving medication <b>capsaicin,</b> a banned substance. Hansen, who won a bronze medal in the team jumping event, was disqualified. In the team jumping system, the top three scores garnered by the four riders are counted. Hansen had the best score on his team, and it was removed from the total. Without Hansen's score, his team was below the bronze medal threshold so the medal was awarded to the team from Switzerland on December 22, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., <b>capsaicin),</b> and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
25|$|For {{external}} exposure, bathing the {{mucous membrane}} surfaces that have contacted <b>capsaicin</b> with oily compounds such as vegetable oil, paraffin oil, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), creams, or polyethylene glycol {{is the most}} effective way to attenuate the associated discomfort; since oil and <b>capsaicin</b> are both hydrophobic hydrocarbons the <b>capsaicin</b> that has not already been absorbed into tissues will be picked up into solution and easily removed. <b>Capsaicin</b> can also be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents. Plain water is ineffective at removing <b>capsaicin,</b> as are bleach, sodium metabisulfite and topical antacid suspensions. <b>Capsaicin</b> is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.|$|E
25|$|<b>Capsaicin</b> {{is present}} in large {{quantities}} in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes, {{and to a lesser}} extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in this genus. The seeds themselves do not produce any <b>capsaicin,</b> although the highest concentration of <b>capsaicin</b> {{can be found in the}} white pith around the seeds.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>capsaicin</b> creams {{have been}} used to treat {{psoriasis}} for reduction of itching, a review of six clinical trials involving topical <b>capsaicin</b> for treatment of pruritus concluded there was insufficient evidence of effect.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} showing that weight loss is directly correlated with ingesting <b>capsaicin.</b> Well-designed clinical studies have not been performed because the pungency of <b>capsaicin</b> in prescribed doses under research prevents subject compliance.|$|E
25|$|The {{burning and}} painful sensations {{associated}} with <b>capsaicin</b> result from its chemical interaction with sensory neurons. <b>Capsaicin,</b> {{as a member}} of the vanilloid family, binds to a receptor called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1). First cloned in 1997, TRPV1 is an ion channel-type receptor. TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to signal the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the <b>capsaicin</b> molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of <b>capsaicin</b> is described as a burning sensation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Capsaicin</b> is also {{an active}} {{ingredient}} in riot control and personal defense pepper spray agents. When the spray comes in contact with skin, especially eyes or mucous membranes, it produces pain and breathing difficulty, discouraging assailants. Refer to the Scoville scale for a comparison of pepper spray to other sources of <b>capsaicin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Topical analgesics like <b>capsaicin</b> {{may also}} relieve minor {{aches and pains}} of muscles and joints.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit of}} most species of Capsicum {{contains}} <b>capsaicin</b> (methyl-n-vanillyl nonenamide), a lipophilic chemical {{that can produce}} a strong burning sensation (pungency or spiciness) {{in the mouth of}} the unaccustomed eater. Most mammals find this unpleasant, whereas birds are unaffected. The secretion of <b>capsaicin</b> protects the fruit from consumption by insects and mammals, while the bright colors attract birds that will disperse the seeds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Capsaicin</b> is {{the most}} {{abundant}} capsaicinoid found in the Capsicum genus, but at least ten other capsaicinoid variants exist. Phenylalanine supplies the precursor to the phenylpropanoid pathway while leucine or valine provide the precursor for the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. To produce <b>capsaicin,</b> 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA is produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway and condensed with vanillamine. Other capsaicinoids are produced by the condensation of vanillamine with various acyl-CoA products from the branched-chain fatty acid pathway, which is capable of producing a variety of acyl-CoA moieties of different chain length and degrees of unsaturation. All condensation reactions between {{the products of the}} phenylpropanoid and branched-chain fatty acid pathway are mediated by <b>capsaicin</b> synthase to produce the final capsacinoid product.|$|E
25|$|The first {{pesticide}} product using solely <b>capsaicin</b> as {{the active}} ingredient was registered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Damage {{or injury}} to nerve fibers causes neuropathic pain. <b>Capsaicin</b> {{activates}} C fibers Vanilloid receptors, giving chili peppers a hot sensation.|$|E
25|$|The vanilloid {{receptor}} (VR-1, TRPV1) is a receptor that {{is found}} on the free nerve endings of both C and Aδ fibers that responds to elevated levels of heat (>43nbsp&°C) and the chemical <b>capsaicin.</b> <b>Capsaicin</b> activates C fibers by opening a ligand-gated ion channel and causing an action potential to occur. Because this receptor responds to both <b>capsaicin</b> and heat, chili peppers are sensed as hot. VR-1 is also {{able to respond to}} extracellular acidification and can integrate simultaneous exposure to all three sensory stimuli. VR1 is essential for the inflammatory sensitization to noxious thermal stimuli. A second type of receptor, a vanilloid-like receptor (TRPV2,VRL-1), has a higher threshold of activation regarding heat of about 52nbsp&°C and also responds to <b>capsaicin</b> and low pH. Both types of receptors are transmembrane receptors that are closed during resting conditions. When open, these receptors allow for an influx of sodium and calcium which initiates an action potential across the fibers. Both receptors are part of a larger family of receptors called transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors. If damage to these heat transducer receptors occurs, the result can be chronic neuropathic pain caused by lowering the heat pain threshold for their phosphorylation.|$|E
25|$|There is {{insufficient}} clinical evidence {{to determine the}} role of ingested <b>capsaicin</b> {{on a variety of}} human disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases.|$|E
25|$|Chemical nociceptors have TRP {{channels}} that {{respond to a}} wide variety of spices. The one that sees the most response and is very widely tested is <b>capsaicin.</b> Other chemical stimulants are environmental irritants like acrolein, a World War I chemical weapon and a component of cigarette smoke. Apart from these external stimulants, chemical nociceptors have the capacity to detect endogenous ligands, and certain fatty acid amines that arise from changes in internal tissues. Like in thermal nociceptors, TRPV1 can detect chemicals like <b>capsaicin</b> and spider toxins.|$|E
25|$|In {{a certain}} genetic {{background}} in mice {{it has been}} reported that animals lacking MC1R had increased tolerance to <b>capsaicin</b> acting through the TRPV1 receptor and decreased response to chemically induced inflammatory pain.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthesis of the capsaicinoids {{occurs in}} the glands of the pepper fruit where <b>capsaicin</b> synthase {{condenses}} vanillylamine from the phenylpropanoid pathway with an acyl-CoA moiety produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Capsaicin</b> is a banned {{substance}} in equestrian sports {{because of its}} hypersensitizing and pain-relieving properties. At the show jumping events of the 2008 Summer Olympics, four horses {{tested positive for the}} substance, which resulted in disqualification.|$|E
25|$|The skin {{of naked}} mole-rats lacks a key {{neurotransmitter}} called substance P {{that is responsible}} in mammals for sending pain signals to the central nervous system. As a result, the naked mole-rats feel no pain, {{even when they are}} exposed to acid or <b>capsaicin.</b> When they are injected with substance P, however, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals, but only with <b>capsaicin</b> and not with acids. This is proposed to be an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces, which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} <b>capsaicin</b> in hot peppers varies {{significantly}} among varieties, and {{is measured in}} Scoville heat units (SHU). The world's current hottest known pepper as rated in SHU is the 'Carolina Reaper,' which had been measured at over 2,200,000 SHU.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} is {{used to determine the}} pungency. The older method is a subjective measurement dependent on the <b>capsaicin</b> sensitivity of testers and so is not a precise or accurate method to measure capsaicinoid concentration.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, spice heat {{has been}} more {{precisely}} measured by a method that uses high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This method measures the concentration of heat-producing chemicals. The measurements uses a mathematical formula that weights them according to their relative capacity to produce perceived heat (pungency). This method yields results, not in Scoville units, but in American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) pungency units. ASTA pungency units are then multiplied by 16 {{in order to be}} reported as Scoville units, as according to the published method, a measurement of one part <b>capsaicin</b> per million corresponds to about 16 Scoville units. Scoville units are a measure for <b>capsaicin</b> content per unit of dry mass.|$|E
25|$|Nociception {{has been}} {{documented}} in non-mammalian animals, including fish and {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including leeches, nematode worms, sea slugs, and fruit flies. As in mammals, nociceptive neurons in these species are typically characterized by responding preferentially to high temperature (40° Celsius or more), low pH, <b>capsaicin,</b> and tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|The general biosynthetic pathway of <b>capsaicin</b> {{and other}} capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden. Radiolabeling studies {{identified}} phenylalanine and valine as the precursors to <b>capsaicin.</b> Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. {{are responsible for}} identifying leucine as another precursor to the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency of chili peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase. Similar studies showed high transcription levels in the placenta of chili peppers with high pungency of genes responsible for branched-chain fatty acid pathway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Capsaicin</b> {{is used as}} an {{analgesic}} in topical ointments, nasal sprays (Sinol-M), and dermal patches {{to relieve}} pain, typically in concentrations between 0.025% and 0.1%. It may be applied in cream form for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with arthritis, backache, strains and sprains, often in compounds with other rubefacients.|$|E
25|$|As {{a topical}} analgesic, {{it is used}} to relieve minor aches and pains, such as muscle cramps, sprains, {{headaches}} and similar conditions, alone or combined with chemicals such as camphor, eucalyptus oil or <b>capsaicin.</b> In Europe, it tends to appear as a gel or a cream, while in the U.S., patches and body sleeves are very frequently used.|$|E
25|$|Menthol's {{ability to}} {{chemically}} trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors {{in the skin}} {{is responsible for the}} well-known cooling sensation it provokes when inhaled, eaten, or applied to the skin. In this sense, it is similar to <b>capsaicin,</b> the chemical responsible for the spiciness of hot chilis (which stimulates heat sensors, also without causing an actual change in temperature).|$|E
25|$|It is {{also used}} to reduce the {{symptoms}} of peripheral neuropathy such as post-herpetic neuralgia caused by shingles. <b>Capsaicin</b> transdermal patch (Qutenza) for the management of this particular therapeutic indication (pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia) was approved as a therapeutic by the U.S. FDA, but a subsequent application for Qutenza to be used as an analgesic in HIV neuralgia was refused.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} NSAIDs {{available}} for topical use, including diclofenac. A Cochrane review from 2016 concluded that reasonably reliable evidence {{is available only}} for use of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis. Transdermal opioid pain medications are not typically recommended {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis. The use of topical <b>capsaicin</b> to treat osteoarthritis is controversial, as some reviews found benefit while others did not.|$|E
25|$|Dried {{ground pepper}} {{has been used}} since antiquity for both its flavour and as a {{traditional}} medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice. It {{is one of the}} most common spices added to cuisines around the world. The spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine, not to be confused with the <b>capsaicin</b> characteristic of chili peppers. Black pepper is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning and is often paired with salt.|$|E
25|$|Several foods can {{naturally}} contain toxins, many {{of which}} are not produced by bacteria. Plants in particular may be toxic; animals which are naturally poisonous to eat are rare. In evolutionary terms, animals can escape being eaten by fleeing; plants can use only passive defenses such as poisons and distasteful substances, for example <b>capsaicin</b> in chili peppers and pungent sulfur compounds in garlic and onions. Most animal poisons are not synthesised by the animal, but acquired by eating poisonous plants to which the animal is immune, or by bacterial action.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} several {{different}} chemicals {{have been used}} to induce referred pain including bradykinin, substance P, <b>capsaicin,</b> and serotonin. However, before any of these substances became widespread in their use a solution of hypertonic saline was used instead. Through various experiments it was determined that there were multiple factors that correlated with saline administration such as infusion rate, saline concentration, pressure, and amount of saline used. The mechanism by which the saline induces a local and referred pain pair is unknown. Some researchers have commented that it could be due to osmotic differences, however that is not verified.|$|E
25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the <b>capsaicin</b> found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E
