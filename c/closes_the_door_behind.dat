5000|$|The episode {{begins with}} a revived Optimus thanking the Quintesson for {{bringing}} him back to life. Optimus then asks what happened and who is left. Sky Lynx informs him that the Autobots that escaped infection {{are in need of}} repairs by the Quintesson. Soon the uninfected are restored, but Bumblebee was too injured to be restored to himself and had to be rebuilt into a new body. Optimus gives him his new name: Goldbug. Optimus informs them that without the Matrix, all is lost and since it's inside Rodimus, he will need the heat resistant alloy. They set off leaving the Quintesson, Wheelie and Steeljaw at Metroplex. On Chaar, Galvatron is fighting his crazed minions and the Autobots save him. Galvatron then guides them to the alloy. Galvatron agrees to show them the room with the alloy. However, they find the way perilous. They make it in by avoiding a giant spider, energy sucking leeches and Galvatron's crazed minions. During the trip, Optimus' last wave of Autobots are infected by the crazed Transformers leaving only him, Galvatron, Jessica and Sky Lynx. After finding and loading the alloy, Cyclonus secretly infects Jessica who in turn infects Galvatron as he realizes why Optimus wants the alloy. Now everyone on Chaar is infected but Optimus and Sky Lynx who are forced to flee the planet leaving behind friends and foes alike. Back at Metroplex, they coat Optimus with the alloy, as they discover where Rodimus is. Sky Lynx drops Optimus off at a junkyard, where Rodimus is racing with the other infected Transformers. Optimus battles him for the Matrix but is nearly killed until the intervention of Sky Lynx in the battle, with the unfortunate result of Rodimus infecting Sky Lynx. Optimus knocks Rodimus unconscious on a conveyor belt, and retrieves the Matrix. At Metroplex, Optimus goes into the Matrix to seek a cure. Meanwhile, the crazed Transformers arrive as the Quintesson <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> them to protect Optimus. Optimus finds the essence of Alpha Trion within the Matrix and he asks for the cure but Trion does not know it, so Optimus travels further back into the knowledge of the Matrix. An early Autobot leader reveals that they had encountered the spores, but could not find a cure. One of their old wise men was able to contain the spores and he injected himself into the sun - the same sun that these spores came out of. Optimus then realizes that wisdom is the cure and awakens just in time to use the wisdom of the Matrix to wipe out the plague, making everyone safe and sane again. In the aftermath, both Dr. Swofford and Dr. Morgan apologize for their actions, realizing their unfounded hate for the Autobots began a pandemic of hate. Also, in a surprising show of admiration, Galvatron orders a cease-fire (at least temporarily), his inherent madness apparently also cured by the Matrix's wisdom. Speaking of the Matrix, Rodimus, who becomes Hot Rod again, notes that the wisdom of the ancients is gone; Optimus disagrees, though, noting how they have all grown a little wiser from the experience, and must now fill the Matrix again with all their accumulated knowledge and experience from then on. The restored leader of the Autobots, Optimus orders them to [...] "Transform and roll out (for home)".|$|E
