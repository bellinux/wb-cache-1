25|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that three more stores would open at Tuggerah on the New South Wales Central Coast, Woden in Canberra and Robina on the Gold Coast, Queensland. In total, at the time of launching its prospectus, Myer stated it had signed <b>conditional</b> <b>lease</b> agreements for 12 locations to open progressively from 2010 to 2013 with a plan to reach 80 stores by 2014. Myer has since announced that not all of the proposed store openings will occur. The proposed Myer store at East Maitland, west of Newcastle, New South Wales, will no longer open, nor will the store at Woden. It has been rumoured that stores at Tuggerah and Coomera, Queensland will no longer proceed, both of these locations are already served by nearby Myer stores.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{attempt was}} in June 1976, when Diplomat Hotel owner Irving Cowan {{obtained}} {{an option to}} purchase the Buffalo Braves of the NBA for $6.1 million, and planned {{to bring them to}} South Florida and the Sportatorium. [...] Pledges of more than 8,000 season tickets were received. [...] However, the city of Buffalo sued the Braves for breach of contract and sought a restraining order preventing the move. Although Cowan claimed the move would still take place, the effort nonetheless failed due to the lawsuit. The Braves signed a new, <b>conditional</b> <b>lease</b> with the city of Buffalo, and ended up moving to San Diego two years later, where they became the San Diego (now Los Angeles) Clippers.|$|E

5000|$|The Crown Land Acts 1884 (NSW) {{created a}} new structure, {{introducing}} various new tenures of holding real property not previously in existence in Australia. These new tenures included grazing licences, homestead <b>leases,</b> <b>conditional</b> <b>leases,</b> and pastoral leases. There were also annual leases for pastoral purposes, and leases of scrub land. Lessees acquired the right to convert portions of land held under pastoral or homestead leases into scrub leases. There were leases for wharfs and jetties and leases for special purposes, such as dams, irrigation works, sawmills, and quarries and permits for wharfs and jetties.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 Edinburgh City Council {{announced}} {{a plan to}} use the building as a hotel and public art gallery, described as an [...] "arts hotel". The cost was estimated at £35 million, and Duddingston House Properties (DHP) were awarded the project to prepare a design. DHP were awarded a <b>conditional</b> 125-year <b>lease</b> with the City Council retaining ownership of the building.|$|R
500|$|Because of a {{potential}} liability for £10,000 of renovation work upon the expiry of the lease, Betjeman considered the house too costly to maintain, and subsequently vacated it. From 1962 to 1966, the house stood empty and suffered vandalism and neglect. [...] A survey undertaken in January 1965 revealed that the exterior stonework was badly decayed, dry rot had eaten through the roof and the structural floor timbers, and the attics were infested with pigeons. Vandals had stripped the lead from the water tanks and had damaged the mirrors, fireplaces and carving work. The most notable loss was the theft of the carved figure of Fame from the Dining Room chimneypiece. Betjeman suggested that the owner's agents had deliberately refused to let the house, and allowed it to decline, intending to demolish it and redevelop the site. Writing in Country Life in 1966, Charles Handley-Read took a different view saying that [...] "the Ilchester Estate, upon which the house is situated, are anxious {{that it should be}} preserved and [...] entered into a long <b>lease</b> <b>conditional</b> upon the house being put into a state of good repair." [...] In March 1965, the Historic Buildings Council obtained a preservation order on the house, enabling the purchaser of the lease, Lady Jane Turnbull, daughter of William Grey, 9th Earl of Stamford, to initiate a programme of restoration the following July. These renovations were supported by grants of £4,000 from the Historic Buildings Council and £3,000 from the Greater London Council. [...] The lease was sold in 1969.|$|R
50|$|In October 1874, Doherty {{selected}} portion 21, parish of Pimpama (158 {{acres of}} second class pastoral land on Hotham Creek, on which Laurel Hill Farmhouse was later built). The block already contained some improvements, including a slab barn {{and a small}} humpy and about 12 acres of scrub cleared and partly under cultivation, for which Doherty paid £20, and was issued with a <b>conditional</b> <b>lease</b> on the property for 10 years from 1 January 1875. At {{the same time he}} selected the adjoining portion 31 with 135 acres, on which existing improvements comprised a bark-roofed barn, a small slab house, some cleared scrub and a small stockyard. It appears that the Dohertys resided on portion 31 from October 1874 until mid-1879, when they moved to portion 21. In 1879, Doherty also acquired the lease to portion 151, an 84-acre block which abutted the eastern boundary of portion 21.|$|E
40|$|Silvofisheries {{is a form}} of {{integrated}} mangrove tree culture with brackishwater aquaculture. It {{is a form of}} low input sustainable aquaculture. This integrated approach to conservation and utilization of the mangrove resource allows for maintaining a relatively high level of integrity in the mangrove area while capitalizing on the economic benefits of brackishwater aquaculture. Silvofisheries is being promoted in Indonesia as part of a mangrove rehabilitation, conservation and management program. Pond-based silvofisheries follow three design models: (1) the basic â€œempang paritâ€� model that is essentially identical to an extensive aquaculture pond with maintenance of mangrove trees on the central platform; (2) modification of the basic model to include a dike constructed around the treed central platform so that the water level within the mangrove area and the open water perimeter culture area can be controlled separately; and (3) further modification of the second model to completely separate the open water culture area from the mangrove area by a gated dike with the pond culture area consolidated to a square or rectangular shape {{at the end of the}} enclosed diked area. The ratio of mangrove tree to open water culture area is 8 : 2 to 6 : 4. In addition, various methods of minimizing the costs associated with pond construction are being considered. This includes the cultivation of mangrove crabs (Scylla sp.) in pens. The State Forestry Company in Indonesia has successfully developed and implemented silvofisheries sites (e. g., 6, 000 ha in West Java-Cikiong with 1, 508 farmers; 5, 300 ha in Blanakan with 2, 060 farmers). A <b>conditional</b> <b>lease</b> program with non-government organizations providing technical assistance to farmers has been successful. This program exemplifies what can be accomplished in mangrove rehabilitation and management within a controlled and enforced program. Production and financial return from silvofishery varies with the system, site characteristics, the level of energy input (mainly from mangrove litter - green manure) and utilization by cultured species, among other factors. Annual profit of up to $ 2, 000 /ha/yr for a milkfish and shrimp polyculture silvofisheries system has been reported. There is a need to refine data and analysis, since all costs are often not included, and revenue projections are often based on expected production rather than actual production. Farm interviews in West Java showed a range in gross income from $ 313 to $ 946 /ha/yr while net profit per individual farm (1. 5 - 10 ha farm size) ranged from $ 943 to $ 1, 558 /farm/yr. There was greater production effort per unit area by farmers with smaller farms. Individual silvofishery farmers often combine incomes from multiple sources. The application of silvofisheries practices requires reasonable measures of caution as with any activity in an environmentally sensitive area as the mangroves. Additional important considerations in the development of silvofisheries as part of an activity within the mangrove ecosystem include the issues of land ownership, integrated coastal zone planning and development, comparative economic assessment, systems models, optimizing use of inputs, selection of mangrove tree and aquaculture species, better understanding of trophic production and food web utilization, and improvement of economic return...|$|E
