Canonical discrimination analysis showed no clear differences in relative abundance of specific microbial groups among ECa classes or between row and furrow position, except for enhanced mycorrhizal biomass in the row. Microbial biomass responded strongly to changes in C redistribution, but was not accompanied by {{a significant change in}} the abundance of specific microbial groups. Labile <b>C</b> <b>fractions</b> (coarse and fine particulate organic matter) and crop residues in diverse stages of decomposition are associated with diverse microbial groups. Thus, row cultivation for weed control creates a biologically enhanced root zone that may improve early season performance of corn...|$|R
40|$|Reduction of the <b>C</b> 2 <b>fraction</b> of complement: {{a family}} study Background: Familial {{hereditary}} angioedema due to genetic changes affecting {{the synthesis of}} complement components other than C 1 inhibitor is an infrequent phenomenon; its association to urticaria is even less frequent. After the detection of low C 2 and C 4 levels in a 22 -year-old woman consulting because of facial angioedema, erythrodermia and urticaria, a familial study was indicated. Methods: The complement fractions were analysed in {{all members of the}} family unit. The C 1 inhibitor, C 3 and <b>C</b> 4 <b>fractions</b> were quantified by nephelometry, and the <b>C</b> 2 <b>fraction</b> by radial immunodiffusion. The functional C 1 inhibitor activity (chromogenic substrate technique) and the CH 50 were assessed by spectrophotometry. Results: Low C 2 levels were detected in {{all the members of the}} family unit. In both parents, the change was selective for that fraction. The consulting patient (index case) evidenced a partial deficiency of the C 2 and <b>C</b> 4 <b>fractions,</b> and her three sisters had low levels of C 2, C 3 and C 4. No quantitativ...|$|R

50|$|This {{occurs because}} {{increasing}} the number of seats increases the fair share faster for the large states than for the small states. In particular, large A and B had their fair share increase faster than small C. Therefore, the fractional parts for A and B increased faster than those for C. In fact, they overtook <b>C's</b> <b>fraction,</b> causing <b>C</b> to lose its seat, since the Hamilton method examines which states have the largest remaining fraction.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{management}} practices, such as tillage method or straw return, could alter soil {{organic carbon}} (C) contents. However, {{the effects of}} tillage method or straw return on soil organic C (SOC) have showed inconsistent results in different soil/ climate/cropping systems. The Yangtze River Delta of China is the main production region of rice and wheat, and rice-wheat rotation {{is the most important}} cropping system in this region. However, few studies in this region have been conducted to assess the effects of different tillage methods combined with straw return on soil labile <b>C</b> <b>fractions</b> in the rice-wheat rotation system. In this study, a field experiment was used to evaluate the effects of different tillage methods, straw return and their interaction on soil total organic C (TOC) and labile organic <b>C</b> <b>fractions</b> at three soil depths (0 – 7, 7 – 14 and 14 – 21 cm) for a rice-wheat rotation in Yangzhong of the Yangtze River Delta of China. Soil TOC, easily oxidizable C (EOC), dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC) contents were measured in this study. Soil TOC and labile organic <b>C</b> <b>fractions</b> contents were significantly affected by straw returns, and were higher under straw return treatments than non-straw return at three depths. At 0 – 7 cm depth, soil MBC was significantly higher under plowing tillage than rotary tillage, but EOC was just opposite. Rotary tillage had significantly higher soil TOC than plowing tillage at 7 – 14 cm depth. However, at 14 – 21 cm depth, TOC, DOC and MBC were significantly higher under plowing tillage than rotary tillage except for EOC. Consequently, under short-term condition, rice and wheat straw both return in rice-wheat rotation system could increase SOC content an...|$|R
40|$|Not all elastoidin {{samples from}} {{different}} species of sharks show a high content of tryptophan in contrast to one specimen from an unidentified species examined in our earlier study. There may be considerable species-dependent variation in tryptophan content and analytical artefacts may have occurred. Available analyses for tyrosine in different specimens of fibres also suggest {{the possibility that the}} variation in tyrosine content is also species-dependent. Elastoidin, from Galeoscerdo cuveir (Tiger Shark) and another unidentified species, on treatment with formic acid yielded three <b>fractions</b> A,B and <b>C.</b> On the basis of analytical data it appears that specimens of elastoidin containing no (or little) tryptophan may yield fraction B through the solubilization of fraction A by formic acid. <b>C</b> <b>fractions</b> from two specimens of fibres were collagenous in nature. <b>C</b> <b>fractions</b> have been further purified in this study by charcoal treatment which removes a tyrosine-rich contaminant, to yield collagens with only approx. 2 – 4 residues of tyrosine per assumed mol. wt. of 360000. In the collagen from the unidentified species glucose and galactose were present in the ratio of 2 : 5; some glucosamine was also present...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} characterizes and quantifies carbohydrate {{and protein}} fractions of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) cultivars at different nitrogen (N) rates and 2 sowing dates in Ceres, Goiás, Brazil. A randomized block design using 3 cultivars (ADR- 7010, ADR- 500 and BRS- 1501), 4 N rates (0, 50, 100 and 200 kg N/ha) and 2 sowing dates (December 2010 and February 2011) was employed. Two harvests were undertaken for each sowing date, when plants were 0. 70 m high. There {{were no significant}} differences among cultivars in either total carbohydrates or A+B 1, B 2 and <b>C</b> <b>fractions</b> of the carbohydrates. Total carbohydrates and their fractions were not affected by N rate nor sowing date. When protein fractionation was investigated, differences in fraction A were observed among cultivars but not in the B 1, B 2, B 3 and <b>C</b> <b>fractions.</b> Nitrogen rate did not affect protein fractions, but sowing date did affect fractions B 2 and B 3. The significance of these findings in feeding animals is discussed. Keywords: Chemical composition, Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System, forage, nitrogen fertilization.

40|$|Summary: 1. From {{pooled serum}} {{containing}} genetically homogeneous transferrin Q, transferrin was purified and separated in three fractions (tri-tri-, bi-tri- and bi-bi-antennary transferrin CO, using Concanavalin A-Sepharose. 2. Each of these fractions was separated into its sialic acid-dependent subfractions by preparative isoelectric focus-ing. Sixteen iso-transferrin <b>C</b> <b>fractions</b> were obtained, which differed in {{their degree of}} glycan branching and/or their sialic acid content. 3.
