25|$|It is {{also argued}} that {{compulsory}} funding of campus services removes the incentive to provide more desirable or more useful services, or in some instances prohibits them from operating on campus altogether. VSU proponents argue that the brief experience of VSU in Western Australia and at Waikato University in New Zealand demonstrates that student organisations realign their priorities and emphasise commercial activities and student welfare and advocacy when they no longer receive a compulsory fee – in other words, seek to provide value to students. It is argued that compulsory services funding encourages inefficient service provision and reduces competition, ultimately disadvantaging student consumers.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{automated}} web service composition by applying Linear Logic (LL) theorem proving. We distinguish value-added web <b>services</b> and <b>core</b> <b>service</b> by assuming that the <b>core</b> <b>service</b> is already selected by the user, but its functionality does not completely match the user’s requirement. Our method enables automation for combining the <b>core</b> <b>service</b> together {{with a set of}} value-added services to solve the problem. The method uses web service languages for external presentation of atomic web services (WSDL) or composite web services (BPEL 4 WS), while the services are internally presented by extralogical axioms and proofs in LL. In this paper, we are focused on the internal presentation and proof. LL, as the internal representation language, enables us to define some issues required by web service composition formally, such as qualitative and quantitative constraints plus subsumption reasoning on concepts. In addition, LL guarantees the correctness and completeness of service composition process...|$|R
