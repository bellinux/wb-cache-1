5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|Later Hurley brings Jack and Charlie water, {{he notes}} Charlie doesn't look well but Jack covers for him {{saying that he}} has the flu. Hurley tells him to get better and Charlie looks thankful to Jack. He sees Locke and asks him for his heroin and Locke gives it back. Charlie looks at it for a moment before tossing it into the fire, smiling. Locke tells Charlie he's proud of him and that he always knew he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Charlie and Locke see a moth flying away.|$|E
5|$|The Governor didn't {{have the}} right to make or suspend any laws, unless in cases of urgent necessity, he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with the consent of the Governor-General of India. He didn't have the power of {{creating}} a new office, or granting any salary, gratuity, or allowance, without the sanction of the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General had full power to superintend and control the Governor in all points relating to the civil or military administration of the Presidency, and the Governor had to obey the orders and instructions of the Governor-General in all cases. The Governors could propose to the Governor-General drafts of any laws which they thought expedient, together with their reasons for the same; and the Governor-General communicated the resolutions to the Governor, after considering the reasons. The Governors regularly transmitted to the Governor-General true copies of all orders and acts of their governments, and also advice of all matters which they felt to be communicated to the Governor-General. The powers of the Governors were not suspended when the Governor-General visited the Presidency. The departure of the Governor from India with intent to return to Europe was deemed to be a resignation from his office. Alternately, the Governor could resign by declaring it in writing and delivering it to the secretary for the public department of the Presidency.|$|E

25|$|Hayes was a {{computer}} hobbyist, {{and felt that}} modems would be highly compelling to users of the new 8-bit computers that would soon be known as home computers. However, existing modems were simply too expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users. What was needed was a single modem that <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all; connect directly to the phone, answer incoming calls, dial numbers to initiate outgoing calls, and hang up when the call was complete.|$|E
25|$|Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann {{were able}} to do this by {{exceptionally}} good chemistry, fantastically good chemistry, which was way ahead of what any one else was capable of at that time. The Americans learned to do it later. But at that time, Hahn and Strassmann were really the only ones who <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> And that was because they were such good chemists. Somehow they really succeeded in using chemistry to demonstrate and prove a physical process.|$|E
25|$|It {{became a}} burden. Some {{people say it}} helped me invent {{the kind of music}} I play, but I don’t know whether it did. It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn to live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and I did.|$|E

25|$|Knuth had a {{difficult}} time choosing physics over music as his major at Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve University). He also joined Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity. While studying physics at the Case Institute of Technology, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, one of the early mainframes. After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> better.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Scotus {{said that}} Mary was {{redeemed}} {{in anticipation of}} Christ's death on the cross. This {{was similar to the}} way that the Church explained the Last Supper, since Roman Catholic theology teaches that the Mass is the sacrifice of Calvary made present on the altar, and Christ did not die before the Last Supper. Scotus' defence of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as potuit, decuit ergo fecit – God <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> it was fitting that He did it, and so He did it.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants {{are likely}} to move to and live in areas {{populated}} by people with similar backgrounds. This phenomenon has held true {{throughout the history of}} immigration to the United States. Seven out of ten immigrants surveyed by Public Agenda in 2009 said they intended to make the U.S. their permanent home, and 71% said if they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over again they would still come to the US. In the same study, 76% of immigrants say the government has become stricter on enforcing immigration laws since the September 11, 2001 attacks ("9/11"), and 24% report that they personally have experienced some or a great deal of discrimination.|$|E

25|$|Fred Astaire {{performed}} {{dance in}} four ways. He performed romantic ballroom duets, tap duets, solos, and solos with props. He also usually danced with a partner, for example Ginger Rogers. A {{very well known}} duet with Rogers that he did was “Cheek to Cheek” which is a beautiful dance that looks almost like they are gliding across the dance floor together. He didn’t just perform romantic duets with Rogers. He also did many tap duet numbers with her, like the dance “Let Yourself Go” in Follow the Fleet. Astaire’s tap solos, however, {{seemed to be the}} most popular. People were amazed at the things he could dance with while performing. From coat trees to drum sets, Astaire <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all.|$|E
25|$|Warwickshire {{survived a}} scare as a virtual second XI still beat the Cambridge {{students}} by 18 runs. The {{first day at}} Fenner's was ruined by rain, with only 6 overs possible. Warwickshire batted first, losing three wickets for no runs to collapse to 48 for 4, but Jonathan Trott's three-hour 150 not out lifted the visitors to 296 for 6 declared. In reply, Zohail Sharif made an unbeaten fifty as the students {{made their way to}} 109 for 1 in just 24 overs. An overnight declaration from the students was followed by an equalling blazing accumulation of runs from Warwickshire led them to 127 for 1. In the reply, Cambridge came too close for comfort, though, and at 281 for 6 with 34 runs left to hit it looked like they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> - but opening batsman and off spinner Alex Loudon came to the rescue with three wickets for 48, as Cambridge collapsed to 296 all out and lost the match by 18 runs.|$|E
25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

25|$|It is {{probable}} that Hesiod wrote his poems down, or dictated them, rather than passed them on orally, as rhapsodes did—otherwise the pronounced personality that now emerges from the poems would surely have been diluted through oral transmission from one rhapsode to another. Pausanias asserted that Boeotians showed him an old tablet made of lead on which the Works were engraved. If he did write or dictate, it was perhaps {{as an aid to}} memory or because he lacked confidence in his ability to produce poems extempore, as trained rhapsodes <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> certainly wasn't in a quest for immortal fame since poets in his era had probably no such notions for themselves. However, some scholars suspect the presence of large-scale changes in the text and attribute this to oral transmission. Possibly he composed his verses during idle times on the farm, in the spring before the May harvest or the dead of winter.|$|E

500|$|Stargate {{producers}} {{were not}} sure actor Richard Dean Anderson would return for the episode, so they devised many scenes where Anderson was [...] "in" [...] the episode but not actually shown. [...] However, Anderson was willing to return and appeared in several scenes. In the DVD special Stargate SG-1: Behind the 200th Cooper said, [...] "it {{was a big deal}} for us to have [...] back for the 200th episode.

South African stage actor Vosloo understood the approach that Sommers was going for in his screenplay, but only agreed {{to take on the}} role of Imhotep [...] "if I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> absolutely straight.

He could drop the ball on a sixpence and he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> every time". Webb, who developed the modern rugby ball, believes that John can not be compared to modern kickers because [...] "the modern ball is coated in a laminate, has dimpled surfaces, unobtrusive lacing and multi panels. In the seventies the balls soaked up water, swerved all over the place and were placed in the mud and slime when kicking for goal".|$|E
500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{not having a}} studio {{attached}} before was Atchison's desire to direct it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned. Several studios wanted to turn Larabee's character into a white character but Atchison felt [...] "it was important that Akeelah's mentor be someone that comes from her neighborhood, that looks like her." [...] Lionsgate's President of Production Michael Paseornek agreed that Atchison should direct the script, claiming {{that he was the}} only person who <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because the story [...] "was in his heart and in his mind".|$|E
