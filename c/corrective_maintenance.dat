40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present a general {{framework}} for the modelling {{of the process of}} corrective and condition-based preventive maintenance actions for complex repairable systems, which takes into account any kind of assumption for the efficiency of maintenance. On the one hand, the proposed model generalizes Kijima's virtual age models to the case where both preventive and <b>corrective</b> <b>maintenances</b> are present. On the other hand, it generalizes the classical competing risk model to maintenance actions which do not necessarily renew the system. A generalized virtual age model is defined by a sequence of effective ages which characterizes the effects of both types of maintenances, and a classical competing risk model which characterizes the dependency between both types of maintenances. Several particular cases of the general model are derived...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{imperfect}} maintenance {{model for}} repairable systems is considered. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Maintenances</b> (CM) {{are assumed to}} be minimal, i. e. As Bad As Old (ABAO). They are considered to be left and right censored. Preventive Maintenances (PM) {{are assumed to be}} done at predetermined planned times and to follow a Brown-Proschan (BP) model, i. e. they renew (As Good As New, AGAN) the system with probability p, and they are minimal (ABAO) with probability 1 -p. BP PM effects (AGAN or ABAO) are assumed to be not observed. In this context, different methods (maximum likelihood, moment estimation, and expectation-maximization algorithm) are considered in order to estimate jointly the PM efficiency parameter p and the parameters of the first time to failure distribution corresponding to the new unmaintained system. A method to individually assess the effect of each PM is also proposed. Finally, some reliability characteristics are computed: failure and cumulative failure intensities, reliability and expected cumulative number of failures. All the corresponding algorithms are detailed and applied to a real maintenance data set from an electricity power plant...|$|R

30|$|Plan the {{maintenance}} for each track. Maintenance planning {{is done by}} the Trafikverket contractor. The car inspection records the faults, as shown in Fig.  4, and equates risk level to required <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Corrective</b> tamping <b>maintenance</b> is governed by regulations in the SS-EN 13848 standard and preventive tamping should be planned in advance. There are two main aspects to consider in maintenance planning: applying for track possession time and decreasing {{the maintenance}} cost by predicting the required tamping. For instance, predicting tamping for nine months is enough time to consider the maintenance plan and budget. However, the costs depend on the distance of the track needing maintenance and the location needing maintenance. Another person claimed setting up a maintenance plan for a certain part of the track will help estimate the cost required to order the tamping machine. At the same time, it will decrease the cost and improve the track quality and performance.|$|R
