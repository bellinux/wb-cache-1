40|$|The Bischoff Blast Furnace Top Gas Process {{for high}} {{pressure}} blast furnaces {{is presented as}} an example of a modern gas treatment process in the iron and steel industry: the work potential of the high pressure top gas is utilized in a plant comprising a gas cleaning unit for dust removal and a turbine for converting the recoverable thermal energy into mechanical and electrical energy. The adjustable annular gap scrubber for separating fine dust also serves as an element for regulating the gas pressure at the blast furnace top so that pressure control by the turbine and its control gear is no longer necessary. Moreover, in the event of a turbine outage the annular gap scrubber can be used as a low noise, pressure-throttling element. The economic use of a turbine for recovering energy from top gas depends on many parameters, such as top pressure, top gas rate, clean gas temperature, local cost of electric power, etc. A profitability analysis for a specific installation shows a remarkably short payback period. The process incorporates a new concept in blast air compression. Mechanical energy from the turbine is transferred directly to the axial flow compressor so that the prior conversion of energy via the power generating cycle is dispensed with. Coupled to the turbine is the compressor motor which, while rated to cover the full power requirement, uses about 40 % less electrical power from the power supply system. Finally, {{as an example of}} the future potential of this process, a new <b>continuous</b> <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process</b> is presented which employs a closed top converter. The gas, held under pressure during refining, is subsequently cleaned and expanded as the blast furnace process described above. This gas is cleaned without any entrainment of air to furnish a gaseous fuel of high calorific value. Since the steelmaking process is continuous, the gas is constantly available and can be fed into the distribution system without any intermediate storage...|$|E
40|$|Thickness of {{tundish cover}} flux (TCF) plays an {{important}} role in <b>continuous</b> casting (CC) <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process.</b> Traditional measurement method of TCF thickness is single/double wire methods, which have several problems such as personal security, easily affected by operators, and poor repeatability. To solve all these problems, in this paper, we specifically designed and built an instrumentation and presented a novel method to measure the TCF thickness. The instrumentation was composed of a measurement bar, a mechanical device, a high-definition industrial camera, a Siemens S 7 - 200 programmable logic controller (PLC), and a computer. Our measurement method was based on the computer vision algorithms, including image denoising method, monocular range measurement method, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and image gray gradient detection method. Using the present instrumentation and method, images in the CC tundish can be collected by camera and transferred to computer to do imaging processing. Experiments showed that our instrumentation and method worked well at scene of steel plants, can accurately measure the thickness of TCF, and overcome the disadvantages of traditional measurement methods, or even replace the traditional ones...|$|R

40|$|A novel slag carbon {{arrestor}} process (SCAP) {{was proposed}} to improve the heat recovery in energy-intensive <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process,</b> which typically has a low heat recovery. The proposed SCAP process introduces a tar reformer to utilise the slag - a by-product from <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process</b> - as the catalyst to convert coke oven gas and tar into hydrogen-enriched fuel gas. This is achieved by making use of the valuable carbon and/or energy contained in the coke oven gas, which otherwise being wasted, to assist in tar reforming and produce hydrogen-enriched gas. Such concept is expected to reduce the undesired tar formation in <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process</b> along with improved heat recovery efficiency and higher quality coke oven gas production. Both simulation and experimental studies on the slag carbon arrestor process were performed. The preliminary thermodynamic analysis carried out using Aspen Plus v 8. 4 indicates that with the tar reformer the energy content of coke oven gas was found increased from ~ 34. 6 MJ/kg to ~ 37. 7 MJ/kg (or by 9 %). Also, with the utilisation of carbon deposition on the slag, a reduction of up to 12. 8 % coke usage in the <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process</b> can be achieved. This corresponds to an energy saving of 4 % and a carbon emission reduction of 5. 7 % compared with the conventional <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process.</b> Preliminary experimental TGA-FTIR investigations revealed {{a reduction in the}} aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and an increase in the production of CO 2 and CO, attributed to the tar cracking abilities of slag...|$|R

The essential fact of the new EAF <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process</b> was to charge hot metal in two portions or steps: firstly, 35 wt%- 40 wt% hot metal was pretreated by blowing oxygen in a specially designed reactor for decarburization and improving hot metal temperature and melting premelted slag; secondly, 30 wt% hot metal was charged into EAF with high basicity refining slags from ladle furnace (LF) -vacuum degassing furnace (VD) refining process. The results show that the hot metal charging ratio can reach to about 65 wt%- 70 wt% for the new EAF steelmaking process; meanwhile, the tap-to-tap time of a 50 1 EAF can shorten by 5 - 10 min, the electricity consumption can decrease by 35 - 50 kW-h/t, the lime consumption can reduce by 10. 5 kg/t of molten steel, and the content of harmful heavy metals in molten steel can be easily controlled to less than the upper limits of aimed steel specification or grade compared with the traditional EAF <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, the dephosphorization ability shows a slight strengthening, however, a small degree of lessening for desulphurization ability is observed for the new EAF <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process,</b> but the weakness of desulphurization ability cannot become an obstacle to its further application since a stronger desulphurization ability can be achieved during secondary refining of LF coupled with VD after EAF <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sulphur removal in the {{ironmaking}} {{and oxygen}} <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process</b> is reviewed. A sulphur balance {{is made for}} the <b>steelmaking</b> <b>process</b> of Tata Steel IJmuiden, the Netherlands. There are four stages where sulphur can be removed: in the blast furnace (BF), during hot metal (HM) pretreatment, in the converter and during the secondary metallurgy (SM) treatment. For sulphur removal a low oxygen activity and a basic slag are required. In the BF typically 90 % of the sulphur is removed; still, the HM contains about 0. 03 % of sulphur. Different HM desulphurisation processes are used worldwide. With co-injection or the Kanbara reactor, sulphur concentrations below 0. 001 % are reached. Basic slag helps desulphurisation in the converter. However, sulphur increase is not uncommon in the converter due to high oxygen activity and sulphur input via scrap and additions. For low sulphur concentrations SM desulphurisation, with a decreased oxygen activity and a basic slag, is always required. </p...|$|R
