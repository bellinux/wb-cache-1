40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{with an interest}} in the fact that boat building materials and manufacturing processes have been improving over the years, however recently there has been a definite decrease in the amount of new technology being used in production boat building. The aim then was to determine the reasons for this, and namely, to investigate why <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> are not being used more widely throughout the production boat building industry. Attention was drawn firstly to the design of composite structures using these reinforcements, followed by the manufacturing processes used to apply them. Consideration was given to any barriers to new technology, including any health and safety drawbacks and structural issues. Test panels were then constructed, one of each reinforcement type, Chopped Strand Mat and Woven Roving, Double Bias <b>stitched</b> <b>fabric,</b> and Quadriaxial <b>stitched</b> <b>fabric.</b> These panels were then cut into samples and tested for flexural properties and fibre content at the Southampton Solent University Test Labs. Using the obtained mechanical properties a case study was then carried out using Lloyds Register Special Service Craft software, investigating design with both in plane and flexural properties, which then lead onto discussion as to stiffness, thickness, mass and cost. From the investigation it was concluded that <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> are not used more widely in the production boat building industry because the budget does not allow for the amount of design work required to use the reinforcements to their full potential, or the cost of the reinforcement itself. Furthermore, CSM / WR produces a laminate almost as stiff as the stitched equivalent, builds up thickness more quickly due to the lower fibre content, and requires much less design work as it is so established. Classification societies require a certain thickness, however this is governed by robustness, and therefore the ability to build up thickness is desirable. <b>Stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> increase mechanical properties, however the thickness required to pass criteria requires several more layers than CSM / WR, and the stresses in a hull structure are relatively low...|$|R

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{modelling}} the deformation kinematics of both woven and <b>stitched</b> dry <b>fabrics</b> from a micro and mesoscopic perspective with {{the ultimate goal of}} developing constitutive models. The method behind the current approach is to analyse individually, distinct mechanisms of energy storage and dissipation for the deformation of dry fabrics and sum the resulting predictions to determine the overall force versus shear angle behaviour of the fabric. Certain energy dissipation mechanisms have been found to apply both to woven and <b>stitched</b> dry <b>fabrics.</b> One such mechanism can be identified as ‘crossover shear’. This mechanism was first treated in relation to the deformation of viscous woven textile composites. The crossover shear energy dissipation can be shown to be {{a direct result of the}} heterogeneous shear strain profile typically observed across the surface of sheared fabrics. In the first part of this paper, this crossover shear mechanism is adapted to dry fabrics, from viscous composites. Initially, the simpler case of a woven dry fabric is treated and discussed. Following this, the possibility of extending the model to the case of <b>stitched</b> dry <b>fabrics</b> is addressed. The second part of this paper focuses on the deformation kinematics of <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics.</b> A meso-mechanical unit cell, based on the <b>fabric’s</b> <b>stitch</b> geometry is proposed and is used to model the shear behaviour of warp-knit non-crimp fabrics (NCFs). In particular, the model predicts the asymmetric draping behaviour observed in certain NCFs that is directly attributable to the <b>fabric</b> <b>stitching.</b> Finally, predictions from the crossover shear model, the unit cell stitch model and a compaction model are combined and the results are compared with experimental measurements...|$|R

Monte-Carlo modelling of the random nesting generated data on the influence these parameters on the average laminate thickness and fibre volume fraction and distributions of these characteristics of the laminate. The {{results show that the}} nesting effect becomes more pronounced with the decrease of the fabric tightness and the decrease of the float length in the weave.

It was found that in general the mechanical properties of the composites made with 0 / 90 woven fabrics are higher than those of the composites made with multiaxial non-crimp <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Moreover, the composite plates with and without aluminum plates and alumina tiles were subjected to ballistic impact by AP (armor piercing), FSP (fragment simulating projectile) and ball (B) type projectiles with initial velocities in the range of 420 - 1173 m/s. The ballistic test results exhibit that the polymer composites have ballistic resistance against 7. 62 mm fragment simulating projectiles (FSP) up to 1001 m/s projectile velocities. However, the composites without any support layer are not sufficient to stop AP projectiles. The sandwich panels containing ceramic tiles subjected to the ballistic impact by AP and FSP projectiles exhibited only partial penetrations at all the velocities applied within the study (446 - 1020 m/s with AP and 435 - 1173 m/s with FSP). The extensions of damages in the composites were evaluated after impact. It is concluded that the multilayered composite structures have capacity against the ballistic threats and potential to be used as lightweight armor materials...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Internal {{geometry}} of textile reinforcement {{is an important}} factor of the reinforcement performance during the composite manufacturing and in the service life of the composite material. When a 3 D shaped composite part is concerned, the reinforced is locally deformed (compressed, stretched and sheared), and the geometrical model should account for this deformation. The software package WiseTex implements a generalised description of internal structure of textile reinforcement on the unit cell level, integrated with mechanical models of relaxed and deformed state of 2 D and 3 D woven, two- and three-axial braided, weft-knitted and non-crimp warp-knit <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> and laminates.
