40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{simulation}} algorithms for <b>contact</b> <b>drying</b> of agitated particulate materials {{under vacuum}} and at atmospheric pressure were developed. The implementation of algorithms gives a predictive estimation of drying rate curves and bulk bed temperature during <b>contact</b> <b>drying.</b> The calculations {{are based on}} the penetration model to describe the drying process, where all process parameters such as heat and mass transfer coefficients, effective bed properties, gas and liquid phase properties are estimated with proper correlations. Simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature. In both cases, simulation results were in good agreement with experimental data. Few deviations were identified and the limitations of the predictive capabilities of the models are discussed. The programs give a good insight of the drying behaviour of the analysed powders...|$|E

After a description of the model and of the software used to run the simulations (COMSOL Multiphysics), a sensitivity study has been done to define the importance of the various parameters and choose the validation strategy for drying under static drying conditions. Experiments on lab-scale for selected compounds have been carried out to obtain the drying curve. All the parameters have been measured and obtained and then simulations have been run. Experimental results have been compared with the simulated ones. Some successful predictions on large scale have been done.

40|$|The {{conventional}} way of {{scaling up}} a <b>contact</b> <b>drying</b> process includes a pilot-scale step. Scaling up from lab scale to production scale {{without the use}} of a pilot plant saves time and money. A method has been developed to perform a scale-up from a 200 -g bench-scale Rotavap drying process to production scale (approximately 1000 kg). A mathematical model, an improvement on the so-called Schlünder model, has been developed to simulate bench-scale drying processes. This simulation is used to determine the unknown mixing parameters by regression analysis. Besides the heat transfer resistances predicted by Schlünder an additional resistance term was found which is product dependent and can also be determined by regression. Ultimately the model can be used to predict the drying curve on production scale. In five out of eight cases the developed method accurately predicted drying behaviour. In three remaining cases the model did not apply due to extreme stickiness or aggregation during drying...|$|E
40|$|A new {{substrate}} containing cellulose nanofibrils and {{inorganic pigment}} particles {{has been developed}} for printed electronics applications. The studied composite structure contains 80 % fillers and is mechanically stable and flexible. Before drying, the solids content can be as low as 20 % due to the high water binding capacity of the cellulose nanofibrils. We have studied several drying methods and their effects on the substrate properties. The aim is to achieve a tight, smooth surface keeping the drying efficiency simultaneously at a high level. The methods studied include: (1) drying on a hot metal surface; (2) air impingement drying; and (3) hot pressing. Somewhat surprisingly, drying rates measured for the pigment-cellulose nanofibril substrates were quite similar to those for the reference board sheets. Very high dewatering rates were observed for the hot pressing at high moisture contents. The drying method had significant effects on the final substrate properties, especially on short-range surface smoothness. The best smoothness was obtained {{with a combination of}} impingement and <b>contact</b> <b>drying.</b> The mechanical properties of the sheets were also affected by the drying method and associated temperature...|$|E
40|$|The drying of {{pharmaceutical}} powders following their isolation via crystallization and filtration is examined using a laboratory-scale agitated filter dryer (AFD). Vacuum contact and through-circulation convective drying {{with and without}} agitation of aspirin powders with pure and mixed solvents are studied through an integrated experimental and modelling approach. Experiments were carried out under different operating conditions by using aspirin particles and water/water-ethanol as typical solid-solvent systems. Two approaches were used to study the drying behaviour of aspirin: 100 µL small-scale drying using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and 5 L medium-scale drying in a laboratory AFD. While the TGA tests provided {{a better understanding of}} drying kinetics as functions of temperature, vacuum level, solvent type and particle size, the AFD study revealed the effects of industry-relevant operating parameters (such as the heating rate, vacuum level, agitation speed and regime, gas flow rate, and initial solvent content) on the drying of aspirin particles. In the TGA experiments, the constant and falling rate periods are observed for drying with pure water, while only the falling rate period is observed for pure ethanol and water-ethanol mixed solvents. In the laboratory-scale AFD experiments, drying cycle time is found to decrease with increasing agitation speed, vacuum level, heating power supplied and gas flow. The critical solvent content is determined by identifying the transition point on the temperature-time and the torque-time plots during the drying process. Particle size distribution and morphology analysis of aspirin particles before and after drying with agitation indicate that the particles tend to agglomeration at lower stirring speeds while they are prone to attrition at higher speeds. An increase of the circularity of the particles with the increase of the agitation speed is observed due to attrition effect. Drying models based on a lumped-parameter (LPM) approach are developed for the static and agitated bed vacuum <b>contact</b> <b>drying</b> and combined LMP and distributed-parameter model (DPM) for the convective drying. Within this modelling approach, only one parameter that is the critical solvent content needs to be estimated from experimental results compared to other LPMs which greatly reduced the degree of parameter estimation. These computationally expedient models can be used for the prediction of drying time in a fast and reliable way. The model equations are implemented in gPROMS software and the models are applied to simulate the experiments carried out in the 5 L AFD. The vacuum <b>contact</b> <b>drying</b> experiments were also simulated using a DPM embedded in the gPROMS software. The modelling results of LPM were compared with that obtained using the DPM. Overall, a good agreement between the calculated and measured drying curves is obtained and the measured drying times are well predicted at varied drying conditions. This research presented the following improvements over the current studies on powder bed drying with limited research on organic crystalline materials and mixed solvent: holistic studies on drying behaviour with varied external drying conditions as well as internal material properties using different scale apparatus: TGA and AFD. Over the previous LPMs on powder bed drying, the modelling approach presented the following improvements: the models developed in this work need less parameter estimation. Three consistent approaches to measure the required parameter at the laboratory scale have been described in this work. The models provide a potential for industrial application on AFD drying...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{a study of}} the delectability of <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> kissing bonds in adhesive joints using three ultrasonic inspection techniques. Conventional normal incidence longitudinal and shear wave inspection were conducted on <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> kissing bonds using a standard damped ultrasonic transducer and an electro-magnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) respectively. The delectability of the <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> kissing bonds was assessed by calculating the reflection coefficient of the imperfect interface at varying loads for a number of surface roughnesses. A high power ultrasonic method was also employed to determine the non-linear behavior of the adhesive interface. The non-linearity of the interface was determined by the ratio of the amplitudes of the first harmonic and fundamental frequencies of the transmitted waveform. It was found that the high power technique showed the greatest sensitivity to these kissing bonds at low contact pressures, however at high loads conventional longitudinal wave testing was more sensitive. It was also noted that a combination of two or more techniques could provide enhanced information about the kissing bond compared to a single technique alone. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Dry {{paper is}} {{composed}} of ribbon-shaped paper fibers randomly oriented in the plane of the sheet. Paper fiber cross-sections transform from elliptical in the pulp slurry to ribbon-like on drying due to capillary pressure of water contained in the lumen of the paper fiber. On <b>contacting</b> a <b>dry</b> paper with water or simply exposing the paper to high humidity, paper fibers tend to regain their initial elliptical cross-sectional shape due to breakage of hydrogen bonds and relaxation of drying stresses. Fiber expansion is the resultant of swelling of the fiber wall and opening of the collapsed lumen. A single-fiber model is presented to predict the fiber cross-sectional shapes at various stages during drying and/or moisturization. Swelling of paper fibers affects the physical and transport properties of paper. Predicted cross-sectional shapes of paper fibers are mapped onto an idealized unit cell model of paper structure to predict the effective diffusion coefficient and permeability of paper as function of fiber swelling. The model predicts that the effective diffusion coefficient drops as relative humidity decreases {{and that there is a}} sudden drop in effective diffusion coefficient as the fibers collapse from elliptical to ribbon-like cross-sections.
