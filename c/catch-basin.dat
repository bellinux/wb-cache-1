50|$|The {{roundabout}} {{has been}} plagued with flooding problems {{during the rainy season}} due to its location as a <b>catch-basin</b> for the surrounding areas as well as the capacity of the original 1980's flood control system underneath which is only rated at 6 cubic meters per second. As a result, in 2015 the DPWH had a new flood control project in the area which aims to raise the capacity to 36 cubic meters per second. The project became infamous for corruption and slow progress as it took more than a year to complete the project and it has caused severe flooding even without the rains.|$|E

Gale saw many waterholes, mostly dry, some containing water, {{all of them}} <b>catch-basins,</b> full only after rainy season. Little ugly bunched bushes, that Gale scarcely recognized as mesquites, grew near these holes; also stunted greasewood and prickly pear. There was no grass, and the choya alone flourished in that hard soil.|$|R

The characteristics of some springs with a scarse flow have been also investigated. The data obtained allow us to frame the various source areas as gravity springs. The interception of the underground flows operated by some draining trenches has permitted, in a further moment, a considerable increase of flow, compared with the natural one. In consideration of this result, the catch basins consisting of surficial detrital sheet coming from the alteration of granites, assume a certain significance as subsidiary water reserve in some areas lacking in good aquifers as the granitic domains...|$|R

US missionaries visiting in 1957 encouraged the inhabitants to raise sheep and grow coffee plants. The 1,000 metre elevation proved to be ideal for the cultivation of Arabica coffee. The king and queen visited the village in 1970 and expressed concern over the level of deforestation and generally low quality of life. In 1978, on a follow-up visit, the king was shown a small stream called Huai Ba Khi. The king suggested the digging of three <b>catch-basins</b> to store water. The villagers spent the next 10 years digging the reservoirs with hoes and shovels. [...] they are still in use providing drinking water to the village. The Mae La Noi Royal Project Development Centre was founded in 1980 to introduce highland crops. The queen helped improve the quality of sheep fleeces by importing breeds better suited to the environment.|$|R

50|$|United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) {{guidelines}} {{require that}} facilities that store {{large quantities of}} petroleum (products) must have a plan in place to contain a spill. The purpose of the SPCC rule is to establish requirements for facilities to prevent a discharge of oil into navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. Within the electric utility industry, oil-filled transformers are often in need of secondary containment. Outdated secondary containment techniques such as concrete catch-basins are quickly losing ground to solutions that offer more cost-effective cleanup {{in case of a}} spill or leak. One example of a more cost-effective method involves placing a geotextile boom filled with oil solidifying polymers around a transformer. These geotextile barriers allow for flow of water, but completely solidify oil {{in the event of a}} leak and effectively seal the spill. Many electrical utility companies are switching to this method because it saves them significant amounts of money when a spill occurs, because there is no need to employ vac-trucks afterwards to clean up a spill inside a <b>catch-basin.</b>|$|E
40|$|WSDOT is {{considering}} {{the use of}} Polyacrylamide (PAM) flocculent to reduce stormwater runoff turbidity at highway construction sites. This research project conducted a testing program to determine the dissolution rates of PAM introduced to simulated stormwater flow by using an experimental geotextile “tea-bag ” dosing system. The testing program simulated “tea-bags ” placed in 2 configurations: 1) suspended in a pipe culvert, and 2) placed in a standard <b>catch-basin</b> insert. The flume in the Saint Martin’s College School of Engineering Hydraulics Laboratory was used to conduct a full-scale simulation of flow regimes for these 2 configurations. Five types of geotextile fabric, five types of PAM flocculent, and ten configurations of tea-bag placement were tested. Empirical relationships between the dissolution rate and flow were found by regressing the test results. PAM dissolution rate was found to vary as an inverse power function with flow rate, and directly {{with the amount of}} PAM introduced into the flow stream.

40|$|A {{modelling}} tool called STORM/SEWSYS {{has been proposed}} {{that makes it possible}} to simulate different scenarios of stormwater source control practices. Source control is an important method to reduce runoff volumes and peak flows, {{and at the same time}} improving the stormwater quality. The modelling concepts of two previously developed models, STORM and SEWSYS, have been combined and integrated to make it possible to use the new tool to simulate different stormwater source control practices. Various structural measures such as detention and re-use, swales and soakaways, <b>catch-basins,</b> wetlands, ponds, porous paving, and non-structural methods like public regulations or street sweeping are source control techniques that have been incorporated in the modelling framework of the tool. The STORM/SEWSYS model provides simulation techniques to evaluate changes to the hydrological cycle and hydrological risks in urban catchments. A detailed pollutant transport module where pollutants from different activities in the urban area are separated in their respective origin; material corrosion, brake wear, tyre wear etc. is included in the model and facilitates quality source control. This paper describes the new integrated sources and flux model STORM/SEWSYS and discusses the new possibilities the modelling approach will bring forward...|$|R

40|$|To protect {{groundwater}} {{and urban}} ecological environment, much more sponge cities {{have been built}} in China. The sponge road {{is an important part}} of a sponge city. In recent years, Shijiazhuang Municipal Design Institute proposes a new sponge road structure, namely planting soil and crushed stone green belt, and it has been extensively used in Shijiazhuang City. In the design of the road structure, it is a key issue whether the infiltration rainwater quality pollutes the groundwater. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the pollution of road rainwater runoff in Shijiazhuang City for the design of sponge road and the construction of sponge city. To obtain the characteristics of rainwater runoff pollution in Shijiazhuang City, four investigation points are chosen at the intersection of the Nanerhuan Road and Yuxiang Street, the east gate of Hebei University of Science and Technology, the site under the Xierhuan Road and Zhongshan Road overpass, and the <b>catch-basin</b> along the roadside in Shijiazhuang City. The investigating points are located in the main road of Shijiazhuang urban area, which covers Shijiazhuang City, and can represent the pollution characteristics of road runoff in Shijiazhuang City. Six rainfalls are collected from March to June in 2017. The rainfall on 3, May is viewed as typical middle and light one which is studied in this paper. The concentration of COD, TP, TN, NH 3 -N and SS in road runoff is tested by potassium dichromate method, ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry, potassium persulfate digestion-UV spectrophotometry and Nessler’s reagent spectrophotometry and filter paper filtration, respectively. The concentrations of Zn ions and Pb ions are tested by inductively coupled plasma method. According to the test results, the concentration evolutions of COD, TP, TN, NH 3 -N, SS, Zn and Pb ion in runoff during rainfall are studied. The results show that the contaminant concentration approximately decreases during the rainfall, and then maintain stable for 90 min. The relation between contaminant concentration and rainfall time follows the form of negative exponential function. Based on the investigation results, the design values of pollutant concentrations at the initial runoff and the long runoff of rainwater in Shijiazhuang are proposed by time-weighted average method and rainfall-weighted average method, respectively. The recommended values by former method for initial runoff in Shijiazhuang are as follows: TN, NH 3 -N, TP, SS and COD are 14. 49 mg/L, 10. 93 mg/L, 0. 45 mg/L, 651. 00 mg/L and 437. 73 mg/L. The recommended values by former method for long runoff of water in Shijiazhuang are as follows: in 90 min TN, NH 3 -N, TP, SS and COD are 8. 05 mg/L, 5. 60 mg/L, 0. 59 mg/L, 559. 22 mg/L, and 237. 96 mg/L, respectively. After 90 min they are 5. 13 mg/L, 4. 11 mg/L, 0. 58 mg/L, 422. 67 mg/L and 97. 35 mg/L. The recommended values by later method for initial runoff in Shijiazhuang are as follows: TN, NH 3 -N, TP, SS and COD are 14. 40 mg/L, 10. 86 mg/L, 0. 50 mg/L, 684. 10 mg/L and 440. 08 mg/L. The recommended values by later method for long runoff of water in Shijiazhuang are as follows: in 90 min TN, NH 3 -N, TP, SS and COD are 12. 46 mg/L, 9. 19 mg/L, 0. 52 mg/L, 642. 80 mg/L and 363. 92 mg/L. After 90 min they are 5. 13 mg/L, 4. 11 mg/L, 0. 58 mg/L, 423. 30 mg/L and 97. 35 mg/L. Overall the proposed concentration values by the rainfall weighted average method are slightly larger than those by the time weighted average method. For hardly degradable Zn and Pb ions in the soil, the 30 min time-weighted concentration at the initial runoff and the long runoff of rainwater is proposed as the design values of runoff rainwater. The recommended design values of Zn and Pb ions are 0. 67 mg/L and 0. 11 mg/L, respectively...|$|E
40|$|If the spleen {{be removed}} from rabbits and {{tubercle}} bacilli be injected intravenously, {{it is found that}} the lesions produced differ materially from those observed in control animals; the lungs present the most marked contrast, the liver also shows a definite difference in the distribution of the tubercles, and the kidney lesions also differ in the two instances. In discussing these facts we must answer, if possible, the four questions formulated above. It appears that the pulmonary lesions in Group S are small and discrete because of some inhibitory factor that prevents the diffusion of the products of dead tubercle bacilli. The organisms, far from being killed, are more numerous and better preserved in this group, but their destructive action is localized. This seems to be connected with the presence of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, for these cells are more numerous in the lesions and more plentiful in the lumina of the pulmonary capillaries of Group S than they are in the controls. The conclusion to be drawn from this covers the answer to the second question. It is not the tubercle bacillus itself that produces the destructive changes, but the toxins liberated by the breaking down of its substance. The well known experiments of Hodenpyl and Armand-Delille, already referred to in this series of papers, show this to be true; dead tubercle bacilli, or even extracts of these organisms, will produce typical tubercles. Removing the spleen stimulates the production of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, as shown by Johnstone (1922). These cells may prevent the diffusion of split products from the bacilli by removing or neutralizing them. The third question, as to why the liver is more affected after splenectomy than in normal controls, is more readily answered. Probably the spleen acts as a <b>catch-basin</b> for the bacteria; once removed it can no longer withhold them from the portal circulation and the liver receives a larger number than it would were this bacterial filter still operative. On the other hand, there may be an increase in the phagocytic activity of the endothelium of the sinusoids which might take up more bacteria under these changed conditions. Several investigators have claimed, recently, that there is an increased activity of the liver endothelium following splenectomy, their experiments being directed chiefly toward determining the fate of the erythrocytes. Pearce (1918) in reporting the effects of experimental splenectomy in dogs, states that there are definite compensatory changes in the lymph nodes, {{in the form of an}} increased proliferation of endothelial phagocytes, and that the stellate cells of the liver sinusoids often show a similar compensatory increase in number. In both cases the cells are, apparently, formed in situ rather than transported to the organs. He says: ‘Such findings suggest the development of a compensatory function on the part of the lymph-nodes and possibly the liver,’ and suggests that, in times of stress ‘the stellate cells of the liver thus assume, in part at least, the function of destroying red blood-corpuscles by phagocytosis. ’ Incidentally, he presents an excellent discussion of the history and subject of splenectomy. Motohashi (1922) reports a great increase in the hemophagic power of the hepatic endothelium and an increase in the number of endothelial elements, after some 45 days following splenectomy in rabbits. Nishikawa and Takagi (1922) have observed similar phenomena with white rats, the Kupffer cells taking up erythrocytes in large numbers in splenectomized animals, whereas controls never show similar propensities on the part of these cells. It may be that different substances cause different reactions on the part of the hepatic endothelium. Contributory Experiment. —A side experiment was performed with five rabbits, two splenectomized and three controls, into which uniform doses of pneumococci were injected intravenously. They all died of septicemia after a few days. The results of this experiment strengthen the foregoing conclusions materially. It was found that there were many polymorphonuclear amphophils in the pulmonary capillaries of the splenectomized animals and that there were numerous focal necroses in the livers. The controls showed much fewer polymorphonuclear cells in the lungs and no focal necroses in the livers, while the spleens were actively congested and inflamed. Otherwise the experiment was not of sufficient importance to warrant a separate report. The question as to why the endothelium of the pulmonary capillaries shows no stimulation similar to that observed in the carbon experiment, but rather less activity than that of the controls, must be answered hypothetically for the present. With the carbon, comparatively huge amounts of foreign matter were injected repeatedly; here but one injection of a much smaller amount of suspended tubercle bacilli was administered. The resulting stimulus to the pulmonary endothelium would, therefore, differ materially in the two instances. In one there would be succeeding waves of stimulation following each injection of irritating foreign substance. In the other an entirely different sort of stimulus would result; the bacteria would be withdrawn from the circulation within an hour or two, judging by past experience, and would then multiply, to be cast off into the circulation in driblets, as the lesions containing them broke down. At least it can be said that there is a good theoretical reason for the difference in the endothelial reaction in the lungs of the two groups of animals...|$|E
