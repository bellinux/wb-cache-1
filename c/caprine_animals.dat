INFORMATION ABOUT A MODIFICATION TO THE BIO-RAD PLATELIA BSE TEST The Commission informed the Member States about the development of a second version of the “Bio-Rad Platelia ” test, which has been approved for TSE monitoring of bovine, ovine and <b>caprine</b> <b>animals.</b> The change of the test’s name into “Bio-Rad TeSeE ” was also announced...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The {{rationale}} for motion preservation by disc replacement after anterior cervical discectomy is to diminish long-term morbidity secondary to adjacent segment degeneration. However, these disc prostheses {{will be subject}} to wear and its possible adverse consequences. PURPOSE: Assess the in vitro and in vivo wear properties of the Bryan Cervical Disc and the early clinical results. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro mechanical testing, <b>caprine</b> <b>animal</b> model and prospective European human trial. OUTCOME MEASURE: In vitro mechanical testing used American Society for Testing and Materials standards to measure wear rates and debris. Caprine results were analyzed by histopathologic analysis by a blinded veterinary pathologist. Clinical outcomes were measured by Odoms's criteria, independent radiologic analysis and Short Form- 36. METHODS: In vitro wear testing in cervical spine simulator for up to 40 M cycles. Wear rates were determined and particles analyzed microscopically. The in vivo inflammatory response was studied in goats that had discectomy at C 4 -C 5. They were sacrificed between 3 and 12 months and histopathologically were compared with controls who had fusions with titanium plates. A prospective clinical trial of 136 patients with minimum 1 -year follow-up was analyzed using validated questionnaires and radiographs. RESULTS: In vitro wear averaged approximately 1. 76 % by weight at 10 M cycles and 18 % at 40 M cycles. Wear debris were present in the periprosthetic tissues in 4 of 11 animals without inflammatory response. The early clinical results were satisfactory in over 90 % of patients. CONCLUSION: The in vivo and in vitro wear properties are satisfactory for the expected duration of life of the prosthesis. The early clinical results are satisfactory and equal to fusion. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Animal chlamydiosis, {{caused by}} {{different}} chlamydial species, {{is characterized by}} clinical or subclinical disease manifestations in cattle, buffalo, ovine, <b>caprine</b> and wild <b>animal</b> species. Animal chlamydiosis often remains underdiagnosed or undiagnosed, and its status {{in many parts of}} India is still unknown. Hence, the present study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of animal chlamydiosis amongst ruminant livestock species of five states of India. Materials and Methods: Totally, 2127 randomly selected serum samples collected from ruminant livestock species viz. cattle (n= 430), buffaloes (n= 429), sheep (906) and goats (n= 362), were tested by agar gel precipitation test for chlamydiosis between 2002 and 2011. Precipitating antigen was prepared from locally isolated strain of Chlamydia psittaci after treatment with sodium deoxycholate. Results: The chlamydial seroprevalence detected amongst ruminants in five states of India was: Himachal Pradesh: Cattle- 10. 90...|$|R

40|$|The {{colonisation}} of the neonate {{gastrointestinal tract}} by health-promoting microbiota {{is likely to}} improve the overall health of the infant and may also have health benefits in later life. Initial development and maturation of the foetal/neonatal gastrointestinal tract is heavily influenced by the in utero environment which itself, may be altered by the maternal diet and gastrointestinal tract microbiota composition. The maternal gastrointestinal tract microbiota can be altered by supplementation with synthetic oligosaccharides; however, positive effects on {{the health and well-being}} of the offspring have not been adequately established. Human milk contains natural oligosaccharides known to improve the gastrointestinal tract colonisation and the development and maturation of the infant gastrointestinal tract. Among domestic farm <b>animals,</b> <b>caprine</b> milk has oligosaccharides structurally similar to human milk and potentially similar beneficial effects for the infant. We hypothesised that feeding caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product to pregnant and lactating mice would induce changes in the maternal large intestine microbiota and milk composition, accelerating the development and maturation of the offspring’s large intestine tissue and altering the gastrointestinal tract microbiota composition. The aim of this project was to obtain bifidobacteria from the faeces of breast-fed human infants and determine which were of capable fermenting caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product. Subsequently, the effects of the best strains on the morphology and metabolic pathways of the colonic mucosa of germ-free and conventionally raised mice, supplemented with dietary caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product. The present study is the first to report New Zealand Saanen caprine colostrum, milk and whey. An enrichment method previously described was used to produce a caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product for in vitro and in vivo assessment of its health effects. Caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product was shown to differentially stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria, commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of breast-fed infants. Among the bifidobacterial species tested, Bifidobacterium bifidum utilised caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product most efficiently when compared to Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum. B. bifidum (AGR 2166) was shown to ferment the sialyloligosaccharides, 3 ’- and 6 ’-sialyl-lactose present in caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product through cell-associated sialidase expression. Augmented microbial biomass associated with enhanced growth and in vitro fermentation of caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product, increased the production of microbial fermentation end products such as acetate and lactate. These findings indicate that in vivo caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product may stimulate the growth and fermentation of bifidobacteria within the gastrointestinal tract. Germ-free mice or mice mono-associated with B. bifidum (AGR 2166) were used to test the in vivo effects of maternal caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product consumption during pregnancy and the effects on the foetus. Caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product diet showed no effects on maternal gastrointestinal tract or foetal growth regardless of microbial status. Mice inoculated with B. bifidum (AGR 2166) and fed caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product diet, however, showed an increased bacterial translocation from maternal gastrointestinal tract to organs and placenta (inferred by the presence of the bifidobacteria 16 S rRNA gene in the maternal organs). Increased translocation of commensal bacteria from maternal gastrointestinal tract to the foetus may have important effects on foetal immunological programming. The consumption of caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product, during gestation and lactation were also tested in conventional rodents and it had no effects on maternal gastrointestinal tract microbiota and morphology. Changes on maternal lipid metabolism and increased maternal milk protein, however, were observed. These modifications may have positively affected the development of the pups, relative abundance of gastrointestinal tract bifidobacteria and butyric acid production at weaning. Important changes in the plasma and urine metabolites involved in bile acid and fatty acid metabolism were also observed in the pups as a consequence of maternal caprine milk oligosaccharide-enriched diet. The effects of maternal caprine milk oligosaccharide enriched product diet on pups, were no longer apparent after 30 days of consuming a control diet post-weaning, however, detrimental physiological characteristics such as an increased body fat were observed. Further studies, are needed to understand the physiological effects of caprine milk oligosaccharides on the maternal/infant pair...|$|R
