40|$|Objective: To {{assess and}} compare the {{efficacy}} of cold cabbage leaves and hot and <b>cold</b> <b>compresses</b> {{in the treatment of}} breast engorgement. Material and Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study conducted in the postnatal ward of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. The study comprised a total of 60 mothers; 30 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group. The control group received alternate hot and <b>cold</b> <b>compresses</b> and the experimental group received cold cabbage leaf treatment for relieving breast engorgement. The pre- and posttreatment scores of breast engorgement and pain were recorded. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods using the statistical software STRATA. Results: Both the treatments, i. e., hot and <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> and cabbage leaves were effective in decreasing breast engorgement and pain in postnatal mothers (P &# 8804; 0. 001). Cold cabbage leaves and hot and <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> were both equally effective in decreasing breast engorgement (P = 0. 07), whereas hot and <b>cold</b> <b>compresses</b> were found to be more effective than cold cabbage leaves in relieving pain due to breast engorgement (P &# 8804; 0. 001) in postnatal mothers. Conclusion: Cold cabbage leaves as well as alternate hot and <b>cold</b> <b>compresses</b> both can be used in the treatment of breast engorgement.

Objective: To examine the effect of abdominal stretching exercise and <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> therapy on decreasing intensity of menstrual pain in teenage girls at SMK Bakti Indonesia Medika. Design: A Quasy Experimental Study with two group comparison pretest-postest design. There were 46 respondents selected in this study by consecutive sampling that consisted of 23 samples in the abdominal stretching exercise group and 23 samples in the <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> group. The menstrual pain was measured using VAS (visual analog scale). Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney, Chi-Square, and Wilcoxon test. Results: Findings showed that the mean of menstrual pain before intervention in the abdominal stretching exercise was 7. 04 and in the <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> therapy was 6. 74 with p-value 0. 211 (< 0. 05), which indicated that there was no mean difference of pain between both groups. However, after intervention, the menstrual pain was reduced from 7. 04 to 1. 91 (5. 09 difference) in the abdominal stretching exercise group; and from 6. 74 to 5. 52 (1. 22 difference) in the <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> group with p-value 0. 000 (< 0. 05), which indicated that there was statistically significant difference of menstrual pain before and after intervention, both abdominal stretching exercise and <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> therapy. Conclusion: There were statistically significant effects of abdominal stretching exercise and <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> therapy on menstrual pain in teenage girls. The abdominal stretching exercise is more effective than <b>cold</b> <b>compress</b> therapy in reducing menstrual pain intensity. Thus, it is suggested that abdominal stretching exercise can be an alternative choice of management of dysmenorrhea in teenage girls, and can be a part of subject in the education as non-pharmacological medicine...|$|R

The X-ray diffraction of the sample annealed at elevated temperatures indicates that intergrowths may exist in the compound at equilibrium when 0. 6 < y < 1. 4. Its low-temperature equilibrium diamagnetization M-s varies linearly with y, but is insensitive to the intergrowth, indicative of quasi- 2 D superconductivity. The T-c-onset, especially, shifts only slightly with y. Our data from <b>cold</b> <b>compressed</b> samples, on the other hand, show that the water loss non-proportionally suppresses the diamagnetization, which is suggestive of weak links.
