40|$|In several {{applications}} in modern communication systems periodic binary sequences are employed {{that must be}} difficult for an adversary to determine when a short subsequence is known, and must be easy to generate given a secret key.

A {{precision}} time reference occupied the bottom, three key generators (<b>stream</b> <b>cyphers</b> in civilian parlance) occupied {{the middle and}} an alarm panel occupied the top position. The outputs of the three key generators were combined in a voting circuit. If one of the units' output did not match the other two, an alarm was sounded and the output from the two units that did agree continued to be used.|$|R
50|$|SciEngines GmbH is {{a privately}} owned company founded 2007 as a {{spin-off}} of the COPACOBANA project by the Universities of Bochum and Kiel, both in Germany. The project intended {{to create a}} platform for an affordable Custom hardware attack. COPACOBANA is a massively-parallel reconfigurable computer. It can be utilized to perform a so-called Brute force attack to recover DES encrypted data. It consists of 120 commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits (FPGAs). These Xilinx Spartan3-1000 run in parallel, and create a massively parallel system. Since 2007, SciEngines GmbH has enhanced and developed successors of COPACOBANA. Furthermore the COPACOBANA has become a well known reference platform for cryptanalysis and custom hardware based attacks to symmetric, asymmetric <b>cyphers</b> and <b>stream</b> ciphers. 2008 attacks against A5/1 stream cipher an encryption system been used to encrypt voice streams in GSM have been published as the first known real world attack utilizing off-the-shelf custom hardware.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{increasingly}} {{widespread use}} of electronic devices necessitates efficient stream ciphers providing high-throughput encryption with minimal resource usage. MICKEY- 128 2. 0 is a recent hardware-oriented synchronous <b>stream</b> <b>cypher</b> with a 128 -bit key, proposed to the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project. Using a novel mathematical interpretation of the algorithm, we present a method of parallelizing the stream cipher to produce an n-bit keystream output. We demonstrate a high-throughput (560 Mbps), area-efficient (392 slices) two-way parallelized implementation on the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA.

40|$|The {{automaton}} {{transformation of}} infinite words over alphabet F_p={ 0, 1, [...] .,p- 1 }, where p {{is a prime}} number, coincide with the continuous transformation (with respect to the p-adic metric) of a ring Z_p of p-adic integers. The objects of the study are non-Archimedean dynamical systems generated by automata mappings on the space Z_p. Measure-preservation (with the respect to the Haar measure) and ergodicity of such dynamical systems {{plays an important role}} in cryptography (e. g. for pseudorandom generators and <b>stream</b> <b>cyphers</b> design). The possibility to use p-adic methods and geometrical images of automata allows to characterize of a transitive (or, ergodic) automata. We investigate a measure-preserving and ergodic mappings associated with synchronous and asynchronous automata. We have got criterion of measure-preservation for an n-unit delay mappings associated with asynchronous automata. Moreover, we have got a sufficient condition of ergodicity of such mappings...|$|R
