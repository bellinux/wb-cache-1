This procedure ensured the permanent presence {{of at least two}} men on the lighthouse, which was essential not only to service but to ensure accurate recordkeeping.|$|E

It was seen close to Mende, once at Pailhou and between Rieutort-de-Randon and Chastel-Nouvel but remained primarily in Margeride. At this time the quarrel between the consul and the bishop was brought up to date by the edict on municipal organizations. The burghers and nobles opposed, but the bishop finally retained power in 1771.|$|E
500|$|Four {{months after}} Min took the position, The Hollywood Reporter was re-launched as a weekly, glossy magazine. She focused the publication's {{editorial}} on in-depth feature stories and visuals. [...] According to The New York Times, [...] "she published 3,000-word profiles of and about Hollywood, plus plenty of juicy photo galleries and lighter items" [...] {{as opposed to}} [...] "quick blurbs about <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> goings". She avoided the re-written press releases and industry jargon that were common in prior issues. Some of the subjects upon which she focused included box office numbers, controversies, fashion and personal celebrity news. Min created art and photography departments and hired more journalists. The publication also began hosting Oscar and Emmy award parties for nominees.|$|E
500|$|Nancy is also {{treated with}} respect: her {{decisions}} are rarely questioned {{and she is}} trusted by those around her.

[...] Nancy's father not only imposes no restrictions on his daughter, but trusts her both with her own car and his gun (in the original version of The Hidden Staircase [...] ), asks her advice on a frequent basis, and accedes to all her requests. Some critics, such as Betsy Caprio and Ilana Nash, argue that Nancy's relationship with her continually approving father is satisfying to girl readers because {{it allows them to}} vicariously experience a fulfilled Electra complex.|$|E

London-based Eaton, who sculpted the piece after being introduced to Winehouse's father Mitch, said the statue was meant to capture her [...] "attitude and strength, but also give subtle hints of insecurity." [...] Her father Mitch said of the statue: [...] "Now Amy will oversee the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> goings of her home town forever...

500|$|In the {{traditional}} Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as [...] "Group B" [...] infants {{and they are}} further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4. Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviors led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively 'loose' terminology for these subgroups. B1's have {{been referred to as}} 'secure-reserved', B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as 'secure-balanced', and B4's as 'secure-reactive'. In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply [...] "B1" [...] or [...] "B2" [...] although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology.|$|E
500|$|Khrushchev {{was granted}} a pension of 500 rubles per month and was assured that his house and dacha were his for life. Following his removal from power, he fell into deep depression. He {{received}} few visitors, especially since his security guards kept track of all guests and reported their <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> goings. In the fall of 1965, {{he and his wife}} were ordered to leave their house and dacha to move to an apartment and to a smaller dacha. His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards. The depression continued, and his doctor prescribed sleeping pills and tranquilizers. [...] One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, [...] "Grandfather cries." [...] He was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume Great Soviet Encyclopedia omitted his name from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War.|$|E

500|$|As a {{condition}} of his release at Leipzig, he agreed {{not to participate in}} combat against France. [...] Subsequent to his release, Merveldt was appointed commanding general of Moravia, and lived in Brno, where he received in January 1814 the instructions to proceed to London as an envoy extraordinaire to the Court of St. James's, replacing Baron Wessembourg. He arrived in London in early March, and met the Prince Regent at Carlton House on 7March 1814, where he ceremoniously presented his ambassadorial credentials. He was well-received in Britain, and became a notable personage, invited to many social events; he told good stories about the wars and the various people he had encountered, which made him popular in social circles. [...] His <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> goings were widely reported in the society columns: For example, on 4July 1814, he attended a lecture by the Abbé Secard, and was listed among the distinguished persons present. When he died in 1815, the British government proposed to bury him at Westminster Abbey. However, his widow took into account his last wishes and had the remains sent to Germany. He was buried in the crypt of the Michaelis chappel in Lembeck Castle where his grave still exists.|$|E
500|$|Executives {{suggested}} to Walden that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to [...] "acclimate" [...] {{them to the}} industry. [...] "They wanted us to act 'like a rock band' and we just told them to fuck themselves," [...] remembered Trucks. For their part, {{the members of the}} band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South. [...] "Everyone told us we'd fall by the wayside down there," [...] said Gregg Allman, but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records [...] "transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers". The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> goings at which reminded them of New York City's Idlewild Airport. Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was [...] "where the brotherhood came to pass," [...] according to roadie Kim Payne; [...] "There was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [...] 100 percent." [...] Much of the material presented on the band's second album, Idlewild South, originated at the cabin. Oakley's wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed [...] "the Big House" [...] in March 1970.|$|E
500|$|The site of Köllnischer Park {{was just}} outside Cölln in the Middle Ages. Until the mid-17th century, it was undeveloped low-lying, swampy land prone to {{flooding}} by the Spree. Following the decision by Frederick William, the 'Great Elector' to encircle Berlin with fortifications, this became the location of Bastion VII, which was known {{at the time as}} [...] "the bulwerk in the morass'. The work required the creation of large embankments and lasted until 1683; the swampland around the bastion was not fully drained until 1687. After such lengthy construction, the works were already out of date militarily, and after 1700 served only to control the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> goings of visitors and residents, prevent desertion, and enable the collection of tolls on those entering the city. By 1700, Mulberry trees had been planted on the walls, but only 'persons of rank' were permitted to promenade along them. After Berlin had grown considerably and the Customs Wall had been built around it, King Frederick William I (16881740) ordered the defensive walls to be demolished. Civilian buildings had already grown up on the bastions; a windmill and a house for the miller were built on Bastion VII, and these caused the eastern portion to be left standing longer than other parts of the fortifications. Some of the rubble from the demolished fortifications was used to build up Wilhelmstraße; the rest was thrown into the defensive ditch outside the walls.|$|E

[...] One part of this plan was the establishment of small rural manufacturing plants knows as [...] "village industries." [...] The village industries reflected Ford's vision of decentralization: not merely locating factories in different cities or regions of the country, but taking specific production tasks out of the larger factories and moving them to small rural factories.|$|E

2500|$|Described as [...] "the Terrible Turk", Haluk Bilginer {{was one of}} {{the more}} popular male cast members on EastEnders during the 1980s, and he {{reportedly}} received sackfuls of fan mail, [...] "despite playing a villain and a womanising snake". Hilary Kingsley has said that what made the character so popular was Bilginer's Omar Sharif-style good looks and charm. Following the departure of Holland and Smith, Mehmet was eventually written out of the serial in May 1989, in a storyline that signified the disbandment of the Osman family. On-screen, Mehmet returns to his native Cyprus after a fight with Guizin regarding her suspicions about Mehmet's fabricated affair with Sue. The Osman family were among many characters to leave the serial that year. Writer Colin Brake has commented, [...] "the pace of <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> going was fast and furious during 1989, as the programme tried to find a new direction."
