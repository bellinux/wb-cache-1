50|$|Callosobruchus maculatus is {{a species}} of beetles known {{commonly}} as the <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil</b> or cowpea seed beetle. It {{is a member of}} the leaf beetle family, Chrysomelidae, and not a true weevil. This common pest of stored legumes has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The beetle most likely originated in West Africa and moved around the globe with the trade of legumes and other crops. As only a small number of individuals were likely present in legumes carried by people to distant places, the populations that have invaded various parts of the globe have likely gone through multiple bottlenecks. Despite these bottlenecks and the subsequent rounds of inbreeding, these populations persist. This ability to withstand a high degree of inbreeding has likely contributed to this species’ prevalence as a pest.|$|E

In sharp contrast to the observations made in the hermetically stored grains, there was a continuous rise in the population of live insects in the non-hermetic container.

Analysis of digitized flight tracks indicates that C. maculatus males respond similarly to moths tested at several wind speeds. Beetles’ mean net upwind speeds and speeds along their track are similar (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) across wind speeds, whereas airspeeds increase (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with increasing wind speed.

40|$|Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp, is an {{important}} crop in West Africa and in north-east South America where {{it is a major}} source of dietary protein. Upon storage, severe damage to the seeds often occurs due to the infestation by the larvae of the bruchid beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.). As a result, these seeds can no longer be used for planting and for human consumption. Fumigants are used to control the bruchid beetle (cowpea weevils), but their use is limited due to costs. Furthermore, chemical control in general causes environmental damage and may evoke a producer and consumer risk. An alternative to chemical control is to use a biotechnological approach, which involves the transformation of genes encoding proteins that have toxicity to <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil.</b> This approach first requires the isolation of novel proteins that show in vitro activity against <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil.</b> We collected various seeds from different non-host plant species from several locations worldwide. Crude extracts of these seeds were screened for insecticidal activity toward <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil.</b> This screening resulted in the isolation and identification of two insecticidal proteins from Albizzia procera seeds. The corresponding cDNAs were cloned and subsequently analyzed. One cDNA clone encodes a cysteine proteinase-like protein, while the other cDNA clone encodes a Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor. Incorporation of recombinant Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor into an artificial seed diet caused a delay in the growth and development of cowpea weevils. From this we can conclude {{that at least one of}} the two cDNAs isolated has a very high potential to be used successfully in the production of cowpea plants that are resistant to <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil.</b> We also are interested in the possibility of using multiple insecticidal proteins that exhibit synergistic (multiple mechanisms) anti-insect activities because of the risk of selection pressure resulting in resistant insect population.

40|$|In {{experimental}} {{populations of}} the <b>cowpea</b> bean <b>weevil</b> Callosobruchus maculatus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) and a parasitic wasp Heterospilus prosopidis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), large changes in the abundances and the fluctuations of both species occurred after approximately 20 generations. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that this observed change in the dynamics may {{have been caused by}} an evolutionary shift in the mode of competition among the bean weevils. A Nicholson-Bailey type model is developed using parameters measured from the experiments. The host larvae can dier in the type of competitive behaviour that they exhibit, which can be either of a contest type or of a scramble type. If a bean contains one or more larvae of the contest type, only one of these will survive and any scramble-type larvae in the bean will be killed. If no contest-type larvae are present within a bean, multiple individuals of the scramble type can emerge from a single bean. The model assumes many genotypes, diering in the fraction of ospring of the two types. If a high per capita resource availability is maintained, then the scramble type is selected for, but if resources are limited, then the contest type is selected for. The host population {{at the start of the}} experiment, taken from a stock culture, was composed mostly of the scramble type. The model is successful in explaining the initial quick increase in the host’s abundance, followed by the evolutionary increase in the fraction of the contest type among hosts, resulting in the more stable population dynamics of the host–parasitoid system, as observed in the experiments. However, it predicts a parasitoid abundance much higher than that observed. We discuss alternative hypotheses to explain the observed evolutionary shift in the population dynamics. We also examine the eect of the dierence in size of the beans in the stock culture and those used in the experiments...|$|R
40|$|Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is a {{valuable}} forage crop grown throughout the World. While the crop is resistant to attack by many insect pests, it is subject to potentially severe losses through the action of several specific pests, which are adapted to alfalfa as a host. The most economically damaging of these pests is the alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica. This thesis investigates the endogenous defences of alfalfa against insects, which are responsible for its resistance to non-pest species, and develops a strategy for increasing the resistance of alfalfa towards pest species, specifically alfalfa weevil. The role of saponins in the resistance of alfalfa towards non-pest species has been investigated by using successive insect bioassays, carried out with extracts, mixtures of compounds, and purified compounds, to identify which compounds present in alfalfa tissues are responsible for toxicity towards insects. Crude saponin extracts, in 80 % methanol, from alfalfa seedling tissues were bioassayed against the <b>cowpea</b> seed <b>weevil,</b> Callosobruchus maculatus. Both extracts from shoot and root tissues caused larval mortality and delayed development when incorporated into an artificial diet at levels comparable {{to those found in}} alfalfa, but lower levels of root saponin extracts showed probiotic effects, whereas lower levels of shoot saponins were still toxic. Hydrolysis of the saponins present in these extracts decreased their toxicity. Purified saponin mixtures were prepared by butanol partition and ether precipitation, and were bioassayed against potato aphid (Aulacorthum solani) in a liquid artificial diet, which allowed quantitative effects to be accurately assayed. Shoot saponins showed a concentration-dependent toxic effect, decreasing survival over an initial 5 day period, decreasing growth, and inhibiting fecundity (measured by nymph production) in these insects. Alfalfa root saponins showed no deleterious effects below a threshold level, but caused complete mortality above this level. The alfalfa saponin mixtures were separated into fractions by chromatography on a reverse phase column. Bioassays showed that the toxicity towards potato was associated only with fractions containing saponins, and that fractions containing a component identified as soyasaponin I were more toxic to the aphids than others. Finally, two saponins purified from alfalfa, soyasaponin I and medicoside A, were assayed. These assays showed that soyasaponin was consistently more toxic in effects on mortality, growth and fecundity. It was concluded that alfalfa saponins, and in particular soyasaponin I, were major factors in the resistance of alfalfa towards potato aphid, and other insects. A saponin mixture from another species, sugar beet {Beta vulgaris) was also toxic to aphids, supporting the view that saponins have a general role in resistance to insects. Inhibition of insect digestive proteolysis by expression of a foreign protein protease inhibitor was selected as a strategy to protect transgenic alfalfa against alfalfa weevil. The major protease activity in larvae of this msect was shown to be due to cysteine proteases, which could be inhibited by cystatins. Rice cystatin was produced in large quantity using a recombinant protein expression system in E. coli for use in a "proving" experiment. Incorporation of the rice cystatin into an alfalfa weevil larvae artificial diet decreased survival, showing that this approach was feasible...|$|R

40|$|Dried legumes (chickpeas, {{green peas}} or lentils) are {{valuable}} export commodities in the US Pacific Northwest.

40|$|Vicilins (7 S storage globulins) {{isolated}} from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) seeds which were susceptible (S) and resistant (R) to the <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil</b> (Callosobruchus maculatus F., Coleoptera: Bruchidae) were denatured by urea and fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography. Isolated fractions were incorporated in artificial seeds for {{assessment of their}} toxicity to C. maculatus. The most acidic fractions of both susceptible (CE- 31 cultivar) and resistant (IT 81 D- 1045 line) seeds were shown to affect development and survival of the bruchid. Results indicated that vicilin polypeptides of toxic nature were expressed in both types of storage globulins although at different levels...|$|E
40|$|Cowpea {{crops are}} {{severely}} attacked by Callosobruchus maculatus, a Coleopteran {{that at the}} larval stage penetrates into stored seeds and feeds on cotyledons. <b>Cowpea</b> <b>weevil</b> control could be based in utilization of bacteria and fungi to reduce pest development. Entomopathogenic fungi, such as Metarhizium anisopliae, are able to control insect-pests and are widely applied in biological control. This report evaluated ten M. anisopliae isolates according to their virulence, correlating chitinolytic, proteolytic and α-amylolytic activities, as well proteomic analysis by two dimensional gels of fungal secretions {{in response to an}} induced medium containing C. maculatus shells, indicating novel biotechnological tools capable of improving cowpea crop resistance...|$|E
40|$|The bio-insecticidal {{and grain}} {{protectant}} activities of mixed powder of Ocimum gratissimum and Vernonia amygdalina upon Callosobruchus maculatus {{was carried out}} in Calabar, Nigeria during the dry season (August to November) of 2015. The mortality rate of <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil</b> treated V. amygdalina: O. gratissimum at 100 : 0 concentrations were 17. 0 %, 27. 0 %, and 47. 0 % for a period of 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs, respectively. Concentrations 0 : 100 gave a percentage mortality of 47. 0 %, 67. 0 % and 73. 0 % at 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs, respectively. 80 : 20 and 20 : 80 concentrations gave 33. 3 % and 47. 0 % at 24 hrs and 48 hrs, but 80 : 20 gave 47. 0 % while 20 : 80 gave 57. 0 % mortality rate at 72 hrs. 50 : 50 concentrations gave 73. 0 %, 77. 0 %, and 80. 0 % mortality rate at 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs, respectively. The 0 : 0 concentrations gave 0. 0 %, 3. 3 %, and 7. 0 % mortality rate at 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs, respectively. The effect on the oviposition of <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil</b> revealed that the mean value of eggs laid on seeds were 5. 0, 2. 3, 3. 3, 2. 8, 1. 0 and 7. 0 for 100 : 0; 0 : 100; 80 : 20; 20 : 80; 50 : 50 and 0 : 0 concentrations, respectively. The effects of mixture of V. amygdalina: O. gratissimum powder on the emergence of <b>cowpea</b> <b>weevil</b> gave a mean value of adult weevil emergence as 5. 3, 3. 0, 5. 0, 3. 3, 1. 3 and 8. 0 for 100 : 0, 0 : 100, 80 : 20, 20 : 80, 50 : 50 and 0 : 0 concentrations respectively. Mixed powder of V. amygdalina: O. grattisimun with 50 : 50 % concentrations conferred the highest bio-insecticidal potency against C. macullatus during the experimental investigation. This was evident from the fact that treatment with V. amygdalina: O. grattisimum (50 : 50 %) concentration attained 80. 0 % mortality at 72 hrs of exposure, which was followed by V. amygdalina: O. grattisimum (0 : 100 %) concentration with 73. 0 % mortality...|$|E
