5|$|The {{presence}} of {{large quantities of}} hydrogen and helium on Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, and Kepler-11f suggest that these planets formed within the first few million years of the system's existence, when gas <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> captured from the forming protoplanetary disc.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the 9th Company of the 28th Regiment (9/28) {{displayed}} what <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> {{achieved by the}} Bosnians under determined leadership when Leutnant Hans König ambushed the Partisan 17th Majevica Brigade near Vukosavci, killing at least 67 and capturing orders for future operations. König was awarded the German Cross in Gold for his fanatical leadership.|$|E

50|$|The tie was contested {{over one}} leg, {{just like the}} last edition. If the teams <b>could</b> <b>still</b> not <b>be</b> separated, then extra time would have been played with a penalty shootout (taking place if the teams <b>were</b> <b>still</b> level after that).|$|R
5|$|A {{party of}} 40 senior German {{officers}} and civilians {{who were on}} a tour of Campbeltown were killed. In total, the explosion killed about 360 men. The wreck of Campbeltown <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> seen inside the dry dock months later when RAF photo reconnaissance planes were sent to photograph the port.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Trotsky and his {{supporters}} believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which {{was intended to be}} a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters within the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{congregation}} <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> assured {{of the required}} quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the morning and evening prayers before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary had become too expensive to maintain.|$|E
50|$|Had {{the merger}} gone ahead, these {{arrangements}} <b>could</b> <b>still</b> have <b>been</b> amended, as {{they needed to}} be approved by a vote of the remaining clubs; but when the merger was averted, the vote never went ahead.|$|R
50|$|The final {{was played}} in one leg basis. If they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> not <b>be</b> {{separated}} then extra time {{would have been}} played with a penalty shootout, if the teams still level after that then taking place.|$|R
50|$|Relative {{decoupling}} {{refers to}} a decline in the ecological intensity per unit of economic output. In this situation, resource impacts decline relative to the GDP, which <b>could</b> itself <b>still</b> <b>be</b> rising.|$|R
5|$|Manchu shamans {{typically}} wore an apron, a feathered cap denoting {{their ability}} to fly to the spirit world, and a belt with dangling bells, and carried a knife, two wooden sticks with bells affixed to the top, and a drum they used during ceremonies. These attributes <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> observed among shamans from Manchuria and Mongolia {{in the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} largely one {{of peace and}} declining {{industrial}} prosperity in Somerset. The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries. However, farming continued to flourish, with the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society being founded in 1777 to improve methods. John Billingsley conducted {{a survey of the}} county's agriculture in 1795 but found that methods <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> improved.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{also had}} {{significant}} political repercussions, shaking the British Army's confidence. The {{fact that the}} siege had taken so long exposed the British forces' vulnerabilities and encouraged the native Indian states– in particular the old Maratha Confederacy in central India– to continue their resistance against British imperialism {{in the hope that}} they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> defeated.|$|E
50|$|On Tuesday, further {{landslides}} {{were able}} to be stopped {{with the help of}} Czech hedgehogs. Nevertheless, numerous buildings <b>could</b> <b>still</b> not <b>be</b> cleared as habitable. Due to scattered storms in Graz-Umgebung District, there were also frequent lightning strikes.|$|R
50|$|However this {{moratorium}} {{does not}} apply to cases of absence without leave or desertion. In other words, although conscription is not enforced, those who deserted under the apartheid system or who failed to respond to call-ups <b>could</b> <b>still,</b> technically, <b>be</b> prosecuted.|$|R
5000|$|They <b>Could</b> <b>Still</b> Serve <b>is</b> a {{painting}} by Ellen Gallagher. It is {{in the collection of}} the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, New York in the United States. They <b>Could</b> <b>Still</b> Serve represents Gallagher's biggest focused body of work: large scale pieces that explore racial stereotypes of African Americans, specifically those seen in minstral shows.|$|R
5|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention from}} film critics. The Morning Telegraph praised {{it as the}} best work from the new Thanhouser Company. The The New York Dramatic Mirror found it to have good acting which <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> more expressive, but was more indifferent {{to the use of}} unnecessary connecting scenes. The Moving Picture World stated, in a brief review, that the acting and photography was good.|$|E
5|$|As the 1960s {{came to a}} close, folk rock {{changed and}} evolved away from the jangly {{template}} pioneered by The Byrds, but, Unterberger argues, the band's influence <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> heard in the music of Fairport Convention. Since the 1960s, The Byrds' jangly, folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music {{up to the present}} day, with authors Chris Smith, Johnny Rogan, Mark Deming, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine all noting the band's influence on such acts as Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., The Long Ryders, The Smiths, The Bangles, The Stone Roses, Teenage Fanclub, and The La's.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the results}} of the operation, the SOE and Combined Operations Headquarters {{believed}} that the SSRF <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> of use, and ensured that it was not dissolved. Command of the unit was given to the newly promoted Major Appleyard. At the end of 1942, most of SSRF were moved to Algeria and absorbed into the 2nd Special Air Service Regiment. Appleyard did not survive the war. He was returning from a Special Air Service mission when his plane was reported missing. It was the same day that Captain Hayes was executed in Paris.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a local}} legend that a piper named Dic, and two fiddlers named Twm and Ned, {{were once}} lured into a nearby cave by fairies. They were not seen again, but their music <b>could</b> <b>still</b> {{occasionally}} <b>been</b> heard coming from the cave.|$|R
50|$|He {{added that}} it would be enough to go by {{ordinary}} interpretation principles, that the footnote was an exclusion. But even if an ingenious draftsman had said that ‘no representation is being made by our representations’ or something, s 3 <b>could</b> <b>still</b> not <b>be</b> circumvented.|$|R
50|$|If {{the scores}} <b>were</b> <b>still</b> level {{after the initial}} 15 minutes of extra time play would {{continue}} for a further 15 minutes. If the teams <b>could</b> <b>still</b> not <b>be</b> separated {{there would be a}} penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.|$|R
5|$|Four {{wins and}} a draw {{at home to}} Basel placed Barcelona {{on top of their}} group with a game to spare, and despite defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Matchday 6, they still had the third-best record amongst the qualifiers for the first {{knockout}} round. As group winners, Barcelona would avoid being drawn with other group winners, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich, but they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> drawn against runners-up such as Chelsea, Internazionale and Arsenal. The draw eventually paired them with Olympique Lyonnais and, as group winners, they were given the right to play the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|Of the 252 {{officers}} tried, 76 {{per cent}} were found guilty, {{the most common}} offence (52 per cent of cases) being drunkenness. Although three officers were executed, an officer was most likely to receive a severe reprimand (60 per cent of cases– a severe blow to his career) or be cashiered (30 per cent of cases– stripped of his commission, which brought total social disgrace and barred him from any employment under the Crown, even working for the local council– but a cashiered officer <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> conscripted as a private to a different unit).|$|E
5|$|On 14 June {{the court}} acquitted nine medics and {{downgraded}} sentences against nine others. Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did not appeal their sentences of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the verdict is final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> pardoned by the king.|$|E
50|$|The Campeonisimo {{name title}} <b>could</b> <b>still</b> hypothetically <b>be</b> given {{due to the}} {{participation}} of Mexican clubs in the revived Copa MX, FIFA Club World Cup and CONCACAF Champions League.

50|$|After {{the plant}} closed, many {{wondered}} {{what became of}} the old cow. It is rumored that it was sold to a local used car dealer {{on the west side}} of Indianapolis. So it <b>could</b> perhaps <b>still</b> <b>be</b> hanging around yet today.|$|R
5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|The John Bull had {{remained}} on static display for another 15 years, but the locomotive's significance {{as one of}} the oldest locomotives in existence, or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey, was not very plainly noted in the display's literature. As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> so much more than that.|$|E
50|$|The 1950 season saw {{the club}} win {{the first five}} games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. The 1950s brought {{improvement}} of sorts, at least {{when compared to the}} 1940s, but St Kilda <b>could</b> <b>still</b> hardly <b>be</b> regarded as a glamorous club.|$|R

50|$|In Sri Lanka the {{modernization}} <b>could</b> not <b>still</b> <b>be</b> able {{to destroy the}} major part of forests and mountains.
