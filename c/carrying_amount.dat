40|$|This study investigates {{several of}} the {{mandatory}} disclosures for investments in associates. An important investigation {{of this study is}} whether or not the information content in disclosed fair values for investments in associated companies subsumes their equity accounted <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts.</b> The study modifies existing value-relevance models for its purposes and compares alternative measurement bases for investments in associates by investigating the significance of changes in error terms. Differences across time and between countries are investigated utiling various statistical approaches as well as an indicator variable approach. Findings suggest that equity accounted <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts</b> and disclosed fair values of listed associates are incrementally value-relevant. This implies that investors utilise fundamental information of the associate to develop their own intrinsic valuation of listed associates, which is not equal to current market values. However, this does not equally apply in the case of unlisted associates, where disclosed fair values are not incrementally value-relevant to equity accounted <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts.</b> Other findings suggest that the value-relevance of the equity accounted <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts</b> and disclosed fair values of associates differ significantly across time and between countries for both listed and unlisted associates. In addition, findings confirm that an exceptional economic event, such as the global financial crisis of 2007 â€“ 2008, impacts significantly on the overall value-relevance of accounting information. Lastly, findings of this study imply that the disclosed summarised financial information of associates, although not individually value-relevant, is incrementally value-relevant when considered as a group.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the accounting treatment for property, plant and equipment, in according with the IAS 16, including: timing of the recognition of assets, determination of asset <b>carrying</b> <b>amounts</b> using both the cost model and a reevaluation model, depreciation charges and impairment losses to be recognized in relation to these values. ...|$|R
50|$|Events {{or changes}} in {{circumstances}} {{indicate that the}} company {{may not be able}} recover the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset. In which case, companies use the recoverability test to determine whether impairment has occurred. The steps to determine are:1. Estimate the future cash flow of asset. (from the use of the asset to disposition)2. If the sum of the expected cash flow is less than the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset, the asset is considered impaired.|$|E

50|$|International Accounting Standard 16 Property, Plant and Equipment or IAS 16 is an {{international}} financial reporting standard adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

5000|$|Under {{the cost}} model, the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset is {{measured}} at cost less accumulated depreciation and eventual impairment (similar to the inventory's Lower of cost or market prudent principle). Under the cost model, the impairment is always recognised (debited) as expense.|$|E
50|$|If a {{receivable}} {{has been}} impaired its <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> is written {{down to its}} recoverable amount, being the higher of value in use and its fair value (less costs to sell). 'Value in use' is {{the present value of}} cash flows expected to be derived from the receivable (IAS36.9 and 59).|$|E
50|$|Items of property, {{plant and}} {{equipment}} are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefit is expected from its use. An entity should recognise any gain or loss on disposal in its income statement. The gain or loss on disposal {{is the difference between}} the proceeds received in exchange for the asset disposed and the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> at the time of disposal.|$|E

5000|$|A {{change in}} {{accounting}} estimate is [...] "an adjustment of the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of an asset or liability, or {{the amount of}} the periodic consumption of an asset, that results from the assessment of the present status of, and expected future benefits and obligations associated with, assets and liabilities. Changes in accounting estimates result from new information or new developments and, accordingly, are not correction of errors." ...|$|E
50|$|If the {{accountant}} believes that an entity {{may no longer}} be a going concern, then this brings up the issue of whether its assets are impaired, which may call for the write-down of their <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> to their liquidation value, and/or the recognition of liabilities that arise on account of the entity's imminent closure (which may not arise otherwise). Thus, the value of an entity that is assumed to be a going concern is higher than its breakup value, since a going concern can potentially continue to earn profits.|$|E
50|$|Changes in {{accounting}} estimates are reflected prospectively (that is, {{from the date}} of change) by including it in the income statement {{for the period of}} the change (if the change affects that period only), or the period of the change and future periods (if the change affects both). However, to the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, or relates to an item of equity, it is recognised by adjusting the <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the related asset, liability, or equity item in the period of the change.|$|E

50|$|Revaluation {{does not}} mean only an upward {{revision}} in the book values of the asset. It can also mean a downward revision (also called impairment) in the book values of the assets. However, any downward revision in the book values of the assets is immediately written off to the Profit & Loss account. Under IFRS, an asset {{is considered to be}} impaired (and is thus written down) if its <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> is greater than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset's value in use (present value of future values) or net realizable value.|$|E
5000|$|An asset {{should also}} be {{impaired}} in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets if its recoverable amount falls below its <b>carrying</b> <b>amount.</b> Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (estimate of future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset). An impairment cost under the revaluation model is treated as a revaluation decrease (decrease of other comprehensive income) {{to the extent of}} previous revaluation surpluses. Any loss that takes the asset below historical depreciated cost is recognised in the income statement.|$|E
5000|$|Accounting rules {{also require}} that an {{impairment}} charge or expense be recognized if {{the value of}} assets declines unexpectedly. [...] Such charges are usually nonrecurring, and may relate to any type of asset.Many companies consider write-offs {{of some of their}} long-lived assets because some property, plant, and equipment have suffered partial obsolescence. Accountants reduce the asset's <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> by its fair value. For example, if a company continues to incur losses because prices of a particular product or service are higher than the operating costs, companies consider write-offs of the particular asset. These write-offs are referred to as impairments. There are events and changes in circumstances might lead to impairment. Some examples are: ...|$|E

5000|$|Depreciation {{is charged}} {{to write off}} the cost or {{valuation}} of the asset over its estimated useful life down to the recoverable amount (IAS16.50). The cost of depreciation is recognised as an expense in the income statement, unless it {{is included in the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of another asset (IAS16.48); for example depreciation of PPE used for development activities may be included in the cost of an intangible asset (IAS16.49). The depreciation method and recoverable amount is reviewed at least annually (IAS16.61). In most cases the method is [...] "straight line," [...] with the same depreciation charge from the date when an asset is brought into use until it is expected to be sold or no further economic benefits obtained from it, but other patterns of depreciation are used if assets are used proportionately more in some periods than others (IAS16.56).|$|E
50|$|Most lessor {{accounting}} is not substantially changed between ASC 840 and ASC 842. The {{change from}} executory costs to nonlease components, discussed above, applies equally to lessors. Leveraged leasing is discontinued, though leveraged leases entered into before the effective date of ASC 842 {{can continue to}} be accounted for under ASC 840 unless they are modified. The distinction between sales-type and direct financing leases has changed: whereas in ASC 840 the test was whether the fair value of the leased asset {{was different from the}} lessor's cost or <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> (if so, the lease is a sales-type lease), in ASC 842, any lessor lease that meets the lessee finance lease tests (based on rents and guaranteed residuals due from the lessee) is a sales-type lease; direct financing treatment applies if the lease is capital only because a third-party residual guarantee causes the present value test to be met.|$|E
50|$|Under {{a capital}} lease, the lessor credits owned assets and debits a lease {{receivable}} {{account for the}} present value of the rents (an asset, which is broken out between current and long-term, the latter being {{the present value of}} rents due more than 12 months in the future). With each payment, cash is debited, the receivable is credited, and unearned (interest) income is credited. If the cost or <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset being leased is different from its fair value at inception, then the difference is recognized as a profit and the lease is called a sales-type lease. This most commonly applies when a manufacturer is using leasing as a method of selling its product. Other capital lessor leases, where the cost and fair value are the same, are called direct financing leases. A third type of lessor capital lease, called a leveraged lease, is used to recognize leases where the acquisition of the leased asset is substantially financed by debt.|$|E
