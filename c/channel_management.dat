40|$|Abstract: Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial(DVB-T) is {{an ideal}} carrier for {{services}} requiring both high data rate and high mobility. Combined with other media as a return channel for user requests and acknowledgement signaling, DVB-T can supply interactive data services. With the exploitation of all available DVB channels, huge Internet access bandwidth can be provided, {{and it can be}} a highly recommendable candidate of future 4 G/ 5 G communications. In order to fully employ all channels, the Profit Oriented Bandwidth Allocation Method(POBAM) with linear complexity is given for real-time joint <b>channel</b> bandwidth <b>management.</b> Simulation results powerfully show that POBAM can effectively exploit the multichannel resources for near global maximization of profit, and can effectively provide QoS differentiation. Besides, the joint <b>channel</b> bandwidth <b>management</b> outperforms the separate <b>channel</b> bandwidth <b>management</b> greatly. The complexity of POBAM is low enough for real time multichannel bandwidth management even when there’re dozens of joint channels and hundreds of active users...|$|R
