50|$|The vast {{majority}} of AS-Interface installations utilize the AS-Interface flat cable, defined {{as part of the}} AS-Interface specifications. A relatively small number of industries (e.g. valve control in process automation) use a round cable, mostly because it is easier to pull through conduit. While the shape of the cable does not matter (any other cable can be used) the electrical characteristics of the selected cable matters greatly. To prevent problems due to improper cable, most professionals suggest the AS-Interface flat cable. This cable is designed to make use of a cable piercing technology. When an AS-Interface module is installed on the network, piercing needles penetrate the cable jacket and displace the internal <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> without cutting them. This allows AS-Interface modules to be installed anywhere on the network without cutting and preparing (i.e. removing cable jacket, stripping insulation and possibly applying a ferule) the cable first. The result is a faster installation without the chance of inadvertent shorts between the leads.|$|E
50|$|Skin {{effect in}} audio cables is the {{tendency}} for high frequency signals to travel more on the surface than {{in the center of}} the conductor, as if the conductor were a hollow metal pipe. This tendency, caused by self-inductance, makes the cable more resistant at higher frequencies, diminishing its ability to transmit high frequencies with as much power as low frequencies. As cable conductors increase in diameter they have less overall resistance but increased skin effect. The choice of metals in the conductor makes a difference, too: silver has a greater skin effect than copper; aluminum has less effect. Skin effect is a significant problem at radio frequencies or over long distances such as miles and kilometers worth of high-tension electrical transmission lines, but not at audio frequencies carried over short distances measured in feet and meters. Speaker cables are normally made with stranded conductors but bare metal strands in contact with each other do not mitigate skin effect; the bundle of strands acts as one conductor at audio frequencies. Litz wire - individually insulated strands held in a particular pattern - is a type of high-end speaker wire intended to reduce skin effect. Another solution that has been tried is to plate the <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> with silver which has less resistance.|$|E

In case of a quench, the currents in these circuits will decay very fast (with time constants of about 200 ms) such that relatively small copper cross sections are sufficient for these busbars. Quench propagation experiments on a prototype cable and corresponding simulations led to a detailed understanding of the quench behavior of these busbars and to recommendations for the design and application of the cable. Simulations of the quench process in a multi-strand conductor led to a detailed understanding of the way current crosses from superconducting to pure <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> and how this affects the quench propagation velocity. At nominal current (6 kA), the quench propagation velocities are high (10 m/s) and the hot spot temperature increases rapidly.

50|$|Coaxial cable conducts {{electrical}} signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid <b>copper,</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>copper</b> or copper plated steel wire) {{surrounded by an}} insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic tape. The cable is protected by an outer insulating jacket. Normally, the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage {{is applied to the}} center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the dielectric with little leakage outside the shield. Conversely, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the cable. Larger diameter cables and cables with multiple shields have less leakage. This property makes coaxial cable a good choice for carrying weak signals that cannot tolerate interference from the environment or for stronger {{electrical signal}}s that must not be allowed to radiate or couple into adjacent structures or circuits.|$|R

40|$|The China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) {{is a new}} tokamak device whose magnet system {{includes}} toroidal field, central solenoid (CS) and poloidal field coils. The {{main goal}} {{is to build a}} fusion engineering tokamak reactor with about 1 GW fusion power and self-sufficiency by blanket. In order to reach this high performance, the magnet field target is 15 T. However, the huge electromagnetic load caused by high field and current is a threat for conductor degradation under cycling. The conductor with a short-twist-pitch (STP) design has large stiffness, which enables a significant performance improvement in view of load and thermal cycling. But the conductor with STP design has a remarkable disadvantage: it can easily cause severe strand indentation during cabling. The indentation can reduce the strand performance, especially under high load cycling. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a new design is proposed. The main characteristic of this new design is an updated layout in the triplet. The triplet is made of two Nb 3 Sn strands and one soft <b>copper</b> <b>strand.</b> The twist pitch of the two Nb 3 Sn strands is large and cabled first. The <b>copper</b> <b>strand</b> is then wound around the two superconducting strands (CWS) with a shorter twist pitch. The following cable stages layout and twist pitches are similar to the ITER CS conductor with STP design. One short conductor sample with a similar scale to the ITER CS was manufactured and tested with the Twente Cable Press to investigate the mechanical properties, AC loss and internal inspection by destructive examination. The results are compared to the STP conductor (ITER CS and CFETR CSMC) tests. The results show that the new conductor design has similar stiffness, but much lower strand indentation than the STP design. The new design shows potential for application in future fusion reactors...|$|R

A description of the models is given, together with a parametric analysis of different boundary conditions and cable discretizations.

Understanding the twist pitch variation is very important; in particular, the twist pitch of a cable inside a CICC strongly affects properties such as ac loss. In this paper, we present {{the results of a}} Chinese TF conductor during manufacture. A rotation sensor and a straight line on the cable surface were used to measure the rotation during insertion and compaction. X-ray was used to check the changed twist pitch during compaction.

40|$|A {{thermal model}} of a single Ultralight Fabric Reflux Tube (UFRT) was {{constructed}} and tested against data for an array of such tubes tested in the NASA-JSC facility. Modifications to the single fin model were necessary to accommodate the change in radiation shape factors due to adjacent tubes. There was good agreement between the test data and data generated for the same cases by the thermal model. The thermal model was also used to generate single and linear array data for the lunar environment (the primary difference between the test and lunar data was due to lunar gravity). The model was also used to optimize the linear spacing of the reflux tubes in an array. The optimal spacing of the tubes was recommended to be about 5 tube diameters based on maximizing the heat transfer per unit mass. The model also showed that the thermal conductivity of the Nextel fabric was the major limitation to the heat transfer.

40|$|Besides the {{temperature}} and magnetic field, the strain and stress state of the superconducting Nb 3 Sn wires in multi-stage twisted cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs), as applied in ITER or high field magnets, strongly influence their transport properties. For an accurate quantitative prediction of the performance and a proper understanding of the underlying phenomena, {{a detailed analysis of}} the strain distribution along all individual wires is required. For this, the thermal contraction of the different components and the huge electromagnetic forces imposing bending and contact deformation must be taken into account, following the complex strand pattern and mutual interaction by contacts from surrounding strands. In this paper, we describe a numerical model for a superconducting cable, which can simulate the strain and stress states of all single wires including interstrand contact force and associated deformation. The strands in the cable can be all similar (Nb 3 Sn/Cu) or with the inclusion of different strand materials for protection (Cu, Glidcop). The simulation results are essential for the analysis and conductor design optimization from cabling to final magnet operation conditions. Comparisons are presented concerning the influence of the sequential cable twist pitches and the inclusion of <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> on the mechanical properties and thus on the eventual strain distribution in the Nb 3 Sn filaments when subjected to electromagnetic forces, axial force and twist moment.

40|$|A {{powerful}} computational tool, called MagRad, {{has been}} developed which optimizes magnet design for operation in radiation fields. Specifically, MagRad {{has been used for}} the analysis and design modification of the cable-in-conduit conductors of the TF magnet systems in fusion reactor designs. Since the TF magnets must operate in a radiation environment which damages the material components of the conductor and degrades their performance, the optimization of conductor design must account not only for start-up magnet performance, but also shut-down performance. The degradation in performance consists primarily of three effects: reduced stability margin of the conductor; a transition out of the well-cooled operating regime; and an increased maximum quench temperature attained in the conductor. Full analysis of the magnet performance over the lifetime of the reactor includes: radiation damage to the conductor, stability, protection, steady state heat removal, shielding effectiveness, optimal annealing schedules, and finally costing of the magnet and reactor. Free variables include primary and secondary conductor geometric and compositional parameters, as well as fusion reactor parameters. A means of dealing with the radiation damage to the conductor, namely high temperature superconductor anneals, is proposed, examined, and demonstrated to be both technically feasible and cost effective. Additionally, two relevant reactor designs (ITER CDA and ARIES-II/IV) have been analyzed. Upon addition of pure <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> to the cable, the ITER CDA TF magnet design was found to be marginally acceptable, although much room for both performance improvement and cost reduction exists. A cost reduction of 10 - 15 % of the capital cost of the reactor can be achieved by adopting a suitable superconductor annealing schedule. In both of these reactor analyses, the performance predictive capability of MagRad and its associated costing techniques have been demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|International audienceElectrical contact {{crimping}} is {{a process}} commonly used in aeronautical and aero spatial applications. One require-ment to perform a resistant assembly is to master crimping parameters. Numerical simulation is then an efficient tool to limit tedious experimental test campaigns. Nevertheless, the numerical model accuracy depends on input data determina-tion, such as material behaviour law parameters. This paper deals with study done to determine material behaviour law parameters of component involved on electri-cal crimping process. The two samples, a strand and an electrical contact, have both small dimensions and specific shapes. For that reason, normalised tensile or compression tests could not be perform. Indeed, inverse analysis is a powerful tool to determine the behaviour laws parameters. The goal is to precisely model the sample mechanical solicitation. A series of computations is launched with various rheological parameters. By comparing experimental and simulated results, {{the goal is to}} minimize a cost function. Thus, the first step of the study has been to determine experimental tests to perform in order to gather the force/displacement experimental data. The <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> have been studied in compression, with a micro indentation de-vice. A 60 N force sensor has been used to acquire force data, whereas an inductive displacement sensor has been used for displacement acquisition data. The 60 N force sensor is too weak to crush completely a copper contact. For that sample, we decided to use an instrumented crimping plier. A series of crimping tests has been performed on empty barrel, and the equivalent simulation has been done. With the best copper strand material parameters set, relative errors between experimental and simulated copper strand data finally amount to 6. 9 % (lower than the 8 % experimental data scattering). On the other side, with the best cop-per contact material parameters set, the cost function amounts to 4 % (lower than the 7 % experimental data scattering). This study allows to determine material parameters sets which are use to simulate efficiently the crimping process...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In the ToMPAW arm (1) we {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} a digital network in a modular prosthesis. The network was built of a number of Neuron™ microcontrollers communicating through the LONWORKS protocol (Echelon Corp.). The hand in the demonstration prototype was based on the Southampton hand. The wrist and elbow used Edinburgh Modular Arm components, with carbon fibre tubes housing geared d. c. motors. Although this was a field prototype and not a fully engineered version, it stayed in regular service for ten years, from 2001 to 2011. Method The user possessed a short humerus following traumatic amputation 20 years previously. Initial training developed muscle bulk and control of two EMG signals. Control of the two channels was not fully independent, so a ‘winner takes all’ algorithm was adopted, with the larger signal assuming control. The joints were controlled sequentially, using scapular abduction to select them with a switch built into the harness; hand, wrist rotation, elbow flexion/extension, returning to hand, and defaulting to hand after a fixed period of inactivity. The hand had sensors for touch and slip and was capable of automatically selecting precision and power grip patterns. Results The user soon mastered control of the prosthesis despite long term lack of use of the relevant muscles, and was a keen participant in the arm’s development. One observation that he made was that control appeared to be improved when the metal and carbon fibre structure of the prosthesis was touched. This suggested that electrical interference was involved, leading to further study into electromagnetic compatibility, as reported in (2). Adding a conductive plastic earth {{to the inside of the}} prosthesis socket resolved this issue without affecting safety. No problems were encountered with the network operation, which proved to be highly reliable, though occasional maintenance was needed to remedy mechanical faults. A common problem was wires breaking where they crossed joints. This was ameliorated by using an extra flexible type of cable with a large number of <b>copper</b> <b>strands</b> and silicone rubber insulation, as used for items such as test meter leads. There was also a failure of the wrist due to gearbox seizure and consequent burning out of the motor. The supply voltage to the wrist was reduced to help avoid a recurrence. Maintenance on the hand was mostly limited to changing FSR force sensors as they wore with age. The elbow was entirely reliable, needing no maintenance over the ten year period. Initially a stack of 10 NiCd cells was used, giving 12 V for the wrist and elbow motors, with a tap at 6 V, later moved to 7. 2 V, for the control electronics. The Neuron devices required 5 V and this was supplied by regulators on the controller circuit boards. Later, the cells were changed to NiMH types, with a smaller size for similar capacity. This reduced the weight of the battery pack from 550 g to 350 g. Conclusion The concept of a modular prosthesis with digital networking was demonstrated in a ten year trial. References (1) Kyberd, P.

In present study, a layer of CVD diamond film is deposited on the interior-hole surface of compacting dies using the hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method, following by a surface polish process, aiming at further elongating the lifetime of compacting dies and improving the surface quality of produced wires. The characterization of both as-deposited and polished CVD diamond films is employed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface profiler, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. Furthermore, the performance of as-fabricated CVD diamond coated compacting dies is examined in the real production process. The results exhibit that the as-deposited CVD diamond films are homogeneous and their surface finish is significantly smoothened after the surface polish process.
