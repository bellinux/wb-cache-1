This research was conducted in the laboratory Concrete Technology Department of Civil Engineering Faculty of University of Muhammadiyah Malang, traditional ceramic manufacturing plant in the area of Malang Regency Mbetek and ceramics company in Mbetek Malang. Implementation of this research involves several stages namely: examination of the building blocks of concrete, concrete <b>casting</b> <b>cylinder</b> 15 x 30 cm, burning concrete / testing specimens of concrete compressive strength, modulus of elasticity of concrete testing and testing of concrete cover is damaged at 28 days, treatment of samples was done by soaking the concrete cylinder starting the day after printing samapai 28 days old. This study used conventional concrete that is not burned with room temperature 25 º C. With the test object the same, compared with that burned with a temperature of 300 º C, 600 º C, 900 º C, and 1000 º C and then the specimens were burned for 30 Minutes, 60 Minutes, and 90 minutes, from each of the temperature and duration of time given 5 test object consisting of 3 specimens for compressive strength of concrete and 2 specimens for modulus of elasticity of concrete.

Five samples each of (1) plastic <b>cylinder</b> <b>cast</b> in cobalt-chromium alloy, (2) plastic <b>cylinder</b> <b>cast</b> in nickel-chromium alloy, and (3) silver-palladium pre-made cylinder (control) were examined for marginal accuracy according to: (A) vertical gap; (B) horizontal gap and (C) horizontal gap depth at the abutment/cylinder interface.

40|$|Cutting tools get {{worn out}} due to wear and are ground {{in order to}} use them again. This wear may be due to {{abrasive}} wear, diffusion wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear. Wear of tool steels leads to shortening of the length, so small that the tool bits are no more usable. These waste and thrown away tool bits were collected which may include steel waste, pig iron, molybdenum iron, chromium iron, vanadium iron, tungsten iron and other waste material. This mixture was melted in induction furnace at temperature about 1600 o C to 1700 o C. After that the casting of the melt was done through the centrifugal route at speeds of 200 rpm and 250 rpm. The cast obtained is in the shape of tool steel cylinder. Then the samples were prepared for the hardness test, machinability test and SEM analysis. The hardness was measured across the radius of the <b>cast</b> <b>cylinder</b> by using Rockwell hardness test machine in C-scale. The machinability test specimens were taken from the outer zone of the <b>cast</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the test was carried out in Lathe by keeping the variables such as rotation speed (420 rpm), feed rate (0. 15 KM), rack angle (10 0) material to be machined (mild steel) and time of machining (5 minutes 40 seconds) constant. The machinability of the centrifugally cast samples were compared with the as-cast samples. SEM micrographs were taken for the outer region of the <b>cast</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a comparative study was made with the as-cast samples. We found that there is an increase in hardness values with the distance from the centre to the outer periphery of the cast samples also the hardness values are higher for speed 250 rpm than 200 rpm. The Machinability of the centrifugally cast samples was better than generally used tool steels...|$|R

The present investigation is on processing of SiC particles reinforced functionally graded aluminium matrix composite cylinders and non-reinforced aluminium <b>cylinders</b> by centrifugal <b>casting</b> to obtain the microstructure and mechanical properties for evaluation. Aluminium alloy (Al 356 /LM 25) is used as matrix and SiC as reinforcement.

The segregation of SiC particles towards the outer periphery of the <b>cast</b> <b>cylinder</b> has resulted in higher hardness towards this region.
