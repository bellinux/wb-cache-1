Deprogrammer Rick Ross had been referred to Scott's mother by a local volunteer for CAN, and Moxon represented Scott in a lawsuit against Ross and CAN. Moxon took on Jason Scott's case pro bono. According to a 60 Minutes report on Scientology's actions against the Cult Awareness Network, two affidavits used by Moxon in the case were false. Scott won a jury judgment of US$5 million including $1.8 million against <b>CAN,</b> <b>and</b> <b>CAN</b> later declared bankruptcy. After the CAN organization was purchased in bankruptcy court by a Scientology attorney, Scott fired Moxon and hired Graham Berry, a Los Angeles lawyer who had previously represented clients in suits against the Church of Scientology. Scott and Ross settled in 1996 for $5,000 and 200 hours of time from Ross for his intervention services.|$|E

[...] Daughtry, with the [...] "no can" [...] still in force, would leave the stateroom, and, though he remained away half an hour or half a dozen hours, on his return he would find the food untouched and Michael, perhaps, asleep in the corner at the head of the bunk which had been allotted him for a bed. Early in this trick once when the steward had left the room and Michael's eager nose was within an inch of the prohibited morsel, Kwaque, playfully inclined, reached for the morsel himself and received a lacerated hand from the quick flash and clip of Michael's jaws.|$|E

Then there is another very terrible man against whom all American lecturers in England should be warned--the man who is leaving on the 9 P.M. train. English {{railways}} running into suburbs and near-by towns have a schedule which is expressly arranged to have the principal train leave before the lecture ends. Hence the 9-P.M.-train man. He sits right near the front, and at ten minutes to nine he gathers up his hat, coat, and umbrella very deliberately, rises with great calm, and walks firmly away. His air {{is that of a}} man who has stood all that he <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> bear no more. Till one knows about this man, and the others who rise after him, it is very disconcerting; at first I thought I must have said something to reflect upon the royal family. But presently the lecturer gets to understand that it is only the nine-o'clock train and that all the audience know about it. Then it's all right. It's just like the people rising and stretching themselves after the seventh innings in baseball.|$|E

50|$|Once INM:chromatin {{interactions}} {{have been}} established following formation of the nuclear envelope, soluble nuclear proteins may bind to exposed chromosomal segments. Such proteins could include enzymes that modify histones—such as methylases and acetylases—which act to alter the three-dimensional conformation of chromatin, as well as DNA binding proteins—such as helicases, gyrases, and transcription factors—that are involved in unwinding/looping DNA and/or recruiting RNAP holoenzyme. This will promote the transcription of some genes and down-regulate or prevent transcription of others. Thus, the nuclear scaffold places limits on what genes <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not be expressed within a given cell and, hence, may serve a basis for cell identity.|$|E

50|$|The person instigating a proxy murder <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not {{be legally}} {{guilty of the}} crime of murder. This legal {{distinction}} varies where in the world the murder takes place. The person who instigated the murder is usually guilty as well. They may be charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and may also be charged with accessory to murder. An example of this is Charles Manson and the Manson Family Murders. Manson was the leader of the Manson Family cult that resided in California in the late 1960s. In 1969, the Manson Family committed nine murders across a five-week span. One of the more notable people murdered was actress Sharon Tate. Charles Manson did not commit any of the murders himself, but instructed the members of the Manson Family to do it instead. In 1971, Manson was convicted on the charge of conspiracy. The court ruled that Manson had as much guilt tied to him with that of his followers. Manson is currently serving 9 concurrent life sentences at the Corcoran State prison in California.|$|E

5000|$|Food {{preserved}} in tin cans was in {{use by the}} Dutch Navy from at least 1772. Before 1800, there was already a small industry of canned salmon in the Netherlands. Freshly caught salmon were cleaned, boiled in brine, smoked and placed in tin-plated iron boxes. This canned salmon was known outside the Netherlands, and in 1797 a British company supplied one of their clients with 13 cans. Preservation of food in tin cans was patented by Peter Durand in 1810. The patent was acquired in 1812 by Bryan Donkin, who had later set up the world's first canning factory in London in 1813. By 1820, canned food was a recognized article in Britain and France and by 1822 in the United States. The first cans were robust containers, which weighed more than the food they contained and required ingenuity to open, using whatever tools available. The instruction on those cans read [...] "Cut round the top near the outer edge with a chisel and hammer." [...] The gap of decades between {{the invention of the}} <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> opener may be attributed to the functionality of existing tools versus the cost and effort of a new tool.|$|E
5000|$|Food-storing ravens cache (hoard) {{their food}} and pilfer (steal) from other ravens' caches. They protect their caches from being pilfered by conspeciﬁcs using aggression, {{dominance}} and re-caching. Potential pilferers rarely approach caches until the storing birds {{have left the}} cache vicinity. When storers are experimentally prevented from leaving {{the vicinity of the}} cache, pilferers ﬁrst search at places other than the cache sites. When ravens (Corvus corax) witness a conspeciﬁc making caches, to pilfer those caches they (1) delay approaching the cache only when {{in the presence of the}} storer, and (2) quickly engage in searching away from the caches when together with dominant storers. These behaviours raise the possibility that ravens are capable of withholding their intentions, and also providing false information to avoid provoking the storer's aggression to protect its cache. Ravens adjust their pilfering behaviour according to when the storers are likely to defend the caches. This supports the suggestion that they are deceptively manipulating the other's behaviour. [...] Other studies indicate that ravens recall whom was watching them during caching, but also know the effects of visual barriers on what competitors <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not see, and how this affects their pilfering.|$|E
50|$|Secrecy and {{censorship}} {{can involve}} norms about {{the control of}} information. This idea was integrated by saying that Censorship of communication in the modern sense is associated with large, complex urban societies {{with a degree of}} centralized control and technical means of effectively reaching a mass audience. It involves a determination of what <b>can,</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> not (or in the case of non-governmental efforts should and should not) be expressed in light of given political, religious, cultural, and artistic standards. The appearance of new communications (e.g., the printing press or the Internet) technologies invariably create demands from conflicting groups for greater openness and freedom of communication and demands for greater control. Authorities try (often in vain) to control new techniques of mass communication. Three major means of direct censorship (pre-publication review, licensing and registration, and government monopolization) are preventive in nature. Among democracies there is considerable variation in censorship by content, media of communication, place, time period and across societies. There are degrees of censorship and individual interests are balanced against those of the community, however hard the latter is to define. More common than outright prohibition, is the segmentation of material involving time, place and person restrictions. Direct government means of censorship must be considered separately from the availability of resources to create and distribute information, the activities of private groups and from informal censorship, including exclusion from sources of information and self-censorship. In a democratic society secrecy and openness exist in a continual dynamic tension.|$|E
