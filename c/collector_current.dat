50|$|With no signal applied, due to {{the current}} mirrors Q3/Q4 & Q5/Q6, the <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> of Q4 and Q6 will be equal in {{magnitude}} if the <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> of Q1 and Q2 are also equal in magnitude. Thus, no current will flow into the buffer's input (or equivalently no voltage will be present at the buffer's input). In practice, due to device mismatches the <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> are unequal and this results in the difference flowing into the buffer's input resulting in an offset at its output. This is corrected by adjusting the input bias or adding offset nulling circuitry.|$|R

25|$|Charge flow in a BJT {{is due to}} {{diffusion}} of charge carriers across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations. The regions of a BJT are called emitter, collector, and base. A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped {{compared to the other}} two layers, whereas the majority charge carrier concentrations in base and collector layers are about the same.

2500|$|In {{analog circuit}} design, the current-control view is {{sometimes}} used {{because it is}} approximately linear.

Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the emitter–base voltage is approximately constant, and that <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> is beta times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, Ebers–Moll) model is required. The voltage-control model requires an exponential function {{to be taken into}} account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the Ebers–Moll model, design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, in which the exponential I–V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose transconductance is proportional to their <b>collector</b> <b>current.</b> In general, transistor-level circuit design is performed using SPICE or a comparable analog circuit simulator, so model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer.|$|E
