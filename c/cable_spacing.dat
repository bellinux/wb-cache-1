40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to achieve a basic {{understanding}} of cable-stayed systems. Issues to be treated are the diachronic evolution of cable-stayed bridges, including the advantages, the limitations and the basic design concepts of these indeterminate systems. During this project, the design of typical cable-stayed bridges is optimized with computer-based simulation capabilities contained within the SAP 2000 computer software system. The analysis strategy starts with the analyses of ten different 3 D models under earthquake loading. The numerical results of the analyses form the basis for the optimization of the bridges' designs. This study has indicated that for the specific design examined, the optimum <b>cable</b> <b>spacing</b> is: 13. 2 m and 12. 39 m for equivalent steel decks with bending rigidities of IEequiv= 3. 25 * 105 kN*m 2 and IEequiv= 2. 25 * 105 kN*m 2 respectively. The procedure also identified the advantage of using bracing on {{the top half of the}} towers. The final part of this thesis concerns a case-study of the Rion-Antirion cable-stayed bridge.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{complexity}} of underground cable systems, cable crossings are inevitably found {{in urban areas}} in power distribution systems or sometimes even in transmission systems. It is critical to accurately rate such cables because dangerously high temperatures can occur at crossing points, resulting in premature aging of cable insulation and potentially cable failures. The only existing explicit method for rating cable crossings is IEC 60287 [1], which is analytical and makes a number of simplifying assumptions like constant surrounding ambient conditions. With improvements in computational power, 3 D models based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) become viable for rating crossing cables. This provides an alternative method to assess these problems using a more detailed cable representation and realistic environmental modelling. In addition, it allows {{the accuracy of the}} existing analytical method to be assessed. With the eventual aim of examining the accuracy of IEC 60287 for rating cable crossings, FEA models have been developed to allow a detailed comparison to the analytical calculation. Due to the complexity of the crossing structure, firstly two 400 kV single XLPE cables crossing at right angles have been modelled. A sensitivity analysis on model parameters (for instance buried depth, <b>cable</b> <b>spacing,</b> crossing angle and cable length) has been conducted and compared against IEC 60287 to gain confidence of the modelling process. By extension of the modelling techniques developed for the single cables crossing case, a 3 D FEA model of two directly buried three-phase cable circuits crossing has been created. Each circuit is horizontal in flat formation and the model is solved for various crossing angles and vertical spacings. The results of IEC 60287 is are compared against 3 D FEA model with various ground boundary conditions and temperature-dependent ac conductor resistance, both of which have been suggested in previous work as main reasons accounting for the conservatism of the analytical method [2][3]...|$|E

40|$|Vertical cable seismic {{methods are}} {{becoming}} more relevant as we require high quality and high resolution seismic data in both land and marine environments. Our goal in this thesis is to demonstrate the impacts of vertical cable surveying in these areas. Vertical cable methods have been applied to the marine environment with encouraging results. Data quality {{is similar to that}} of traditional towed-streamer data, without the long, cumbersome towed-streamers which are difficult to maneuver in congested areas. The current marine vertical cable processing schemes tend to use primaries and receiver ghosts of primaries for imaging. Therefore, we demonstrate the ability of the current multiple attenuation algorithms developed by Ikelle (2001) to preserve either primaries or the receiver ghosts of primaries. As we focus on land acquisition, we discover that vertical cable surveying can overcome many of the traditional problems of land seismics. In fact, our investigations lead us to believe that problems such as ground roll, guided waves and statics can be avoided almost entirely using vertical cable acquisition methods. Furthermore, land vertical surveying is naturally suited for multi-component acquisition and time-lapse surveying. To fully analyze the applicability of vertical cable surveys in marine and land environments, we also investigate the problem of <b>cable</b> <b>spacing</b> and sampling within each cable. We compare the resolution of vertical cable data and horizontal data by calculating the maximum angular coverage of each acquisition geometry and measuring the occurrence of each angle within this coverage, such that more occurrences means better resolution. From our investigations, we find that by using vertical cables of no more than 500 m in length at 500 m intervals, we can acquire higher resolution seismic data relative to horizontal surface methods for an image point, horizontal reflector or a dipping reflector. The key tool used in these investigations is fully elastic finite-difference modeling. We chose this technique based on its ability to properly and accurately model the full wavefield through complex models, all the while preserving amplitudes and the phase of reflected, diffracted and converted wavefields...|$|E
40|$|Existe una creciente {{necesidad}} de hacer el mejor uso del agua para regadío. Una alternativa eficiente consiste en la monitorización del contenido volumétrico de agua (θ), utilizando sensores de humedad. A pesar de existir una gran diversidad de sensores y tecnologías disponibles, actualmente ninguna de ellas permite obtener medidas distribuidas en perfiles verticales de un metro y en escalas laterales de 0. 1 - 1, 000 m. En este sentido, es necesario buscar tecnologías alternativas que sirvan de puente entre las medidas puntuales y las escalas intermedias. Esta tesis doctoral se basa en el uso de Fibra Óptica (FO) con sistema de medida de temperatura distribuida (DTS), una tecnología alternativa de reciente creación que ha levantado gran expectación en las últimas dos décadas. Específicamente utilizamos el método de fibra calentada, en inglés Actively Heated Fiber Optic (AHFO), en la cual los cables de Fibra Óptica se utilizan como sondas de calor mediante la aplicación de corriente eléctrica a través de la camisa de acero inoxidable, o de un conductor eléctrico simétricamente posicionado, envuelto, alrededor del haz de fibra óptica. El uso de fibra calentada se basa en la utilización de la teoría de los pulsos de calor, en inglés Heated Pulsed Theory (HPP), por la cual el conductor se aproxima a una fuente de calor lineal e infinitesimal que introduce calor en el suelo. Mediante el análisis del tiempo de ocurrencia y magnitud de la respuesta térmica ante un pulso de calor, es posible estimar algunas propiedades específicas del suelo, tales como el contenido de humedad, calor específico (C) y conductividad térmica. Estos parámetros pueden ser estimados utilizando un sensor de temperatura adyacente a la sonda de calor [método simple, en inglés single heated pulsed probes (SHPP) ], ó a una distancia radial r [método doble, en inglés dual heated pulsed probes (DHPP) ]. Esta tesis doctoral pretende probar la idoneidad de los sistemas de fibra óptica calentada para la aplicación de la teoría clásica de sondas calentadas. Para ello, se desarrollarán dos sistemas FO-DTS. El primero se sitúa en un campo agrícola de La Nava de Arévalo (Ávila, España), en el cual se aplica la teoría SHPP para estimar θ. El segundo sistema se desarrolla en laboratorio y emplea la teoría DHPP para medir tanto θ como C. La teoría SHPP {{puede ser}} implementada con fibra óptica calentada para obtener medidas distribuidas de θ, mediante la utilización de sistemas FO-DTS y el uso de curvas de calibración específicas para cada suelo. Sin embargo, la mayoría de aplicaciones AHFO se han desarrollado exclusivamente en laboratorio utilizando medios porosos homogéneos. En esta tesis se utiliza el programa Hydrus 2 D/ 3 D para definir tales curvas de calibración. El modelo propuesto es validado en un segmento de cable enterrado en una instalación de fibra óptica y es capaz de predecir la respuesta térmica del suelo en puntos concretos de la instalación una vez que las propiedades físicas y térmicas de éste son definidas. La exactitud de la metodología para predecir θ frente a medidas puntuales tomadas con sensores de humedad comerciales fue de 0. 001 a 0. 022 m 3 m- 3 La implementación de la teoría DHPP con AHFO para medir C y θ suponen una oportunidad sin precedentes para aplicaciones medioambientales. En esta tesis se emplean diferentes combinaciones de cables y fuentes emisoras de calor, que se colocan en paralelo y utilizan un rango variado de espaciamientos, todo ello en el laboratorio. La amplitud de la señal y el tiempo de llegada se han observado como funciones del calor específico del suelo. Medidas de C, utilizando esta metodología y ante un rango variado de contenidos de humedad, sugirieron la idoneidad del método, aunque también se observaron importantes errores en contenidos bajos de humedad de hasta un 22 %. La mejora del método requerirá otros modelos más precisos que tengan en cuenta el diámetro del cable, así como la posible influencia térmica del mismo. ABSTRACT There {{is an increasing}} {{need to make the}} most efficient use of water for irrigation. A good approach to make irrigation as efficient as possible is to monitor soil water content (θ) using soil moisture sensors. Although, there is a broad range of different sensors and technologies, currently, none of them can practically and accurately provide vertical and lateral moisture profiles spanning 0 - 1 m depth and 0. 1 - 1, 000 m lateral scales. In this regard, further research to fulfill the intermediate scale and to bridge single-point measurement with the broaden scales is still needed. This dissertation is based on the use of Fiber Optics with Distributed Temperature Sensing (FO-DTS), a novel approach which has been receiving growing interest in the last two decades. Specifically, we employ the so called Actively Heated Fiber Optic (AHFO) method, in which FO cables are employed as heat probe conductors by applying electricity to the stainless steel armoring jacket or an added conductor symmetrically positioned (wrapped) about the FO cable. AHFO is based on the classic Heated Pulsed Theory (HPP) which usually employs a heat probe conductor that approximates to an infinite line heat source which injects heat into the soil. Observation of the timing and magnitude of the thermal response to the energy input provide enough information to derive certain specific soil thermal characteristics such as the soil heat capacity, soil thermal conductivity or soil water content. These parameters can be estimated by capturing the soil thermal response (using a thermal sensor) adjacent to the heat source (the heating and the thermal sources are mounted together in the so called single heated pulsed probe (SHPP)), or separated at a certain distance, r (dual heated pulsed method (DHPP) This dissertation aims to test the feasibility of heated fiber optics to implement the HPP theory. Specifically, we focus on measuring soil water content (θ) and soil heat capacity (C) by employing two types of FO-DTS systems. The first one is located in an agricultural field in La Nava de Arévalo (Ávila, Spain) and employ the SHPP theory to estimate θ. The second one is developed in the laboratory using the procedures described in the DHPP theory, and focuses on estimating both C and θ. The SHPP theory can be implemented with actively heated fiber optics (AHFO) to obtain distributed measurements of soil water content (θ) by using reported soil thermal responses in Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and with a soil-specific calibration relationship. However, most reported AHFO applications have been calibrated under laboratory homogeneous soil conditions, while inexpensive efficient calibration procedures useful in heterogeneous soils are lacking. In this PhD thesis, we employ the Hydrus 2 D/ 3 D code to define these soil-specific calibration curves. The model is then validated at a selected FO transect of the DTS installation. The model was able to predict the soil thermal response at specific locations of the fiber optic cable once the surrounding soil hydraulic and thermal properties were known. Results using electromagnetic moisture sensors at the same specific locations demonstrate the feasibility of the model to detect θ within an accuracy of 0. 001 to 0. 022 m 3 m- 3. Implementation of the Dual Heated Pulsed Probe (DPHP) theory for measurement of volumetric heat capacity (C) and water content (θ) with Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) heated fiber optic (FO) systems presents an unprecedented opportunity for environmental monitoring. We test the method using different combinations of FO cables and heat sources at a range of spacings in a laboratory setting. The amplitude and phase-shift in the heat signal with distance was found to be a function of the soil volumetric heat capacity (referred, here, to as Cs). Estimations of Cs at a range of θ suggest feasibility via responsiveness to the changes in θ (we observed a linear relationship in all FO combinations), though observed bias with decreasing soil water contents (up to 22 %) was also reported. Optimization will require further models to account for the finite radius and thermal influence of the FO cables, employed here as “needle probes”. Also, consideration of the range of soil conditions and <b>cable</b> <b>spacing</b> and jacket configurations, suggested here to be valuable subjects of further study and development...|$|E
