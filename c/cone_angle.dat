40|$|Thermodynamic {{studies of}} a series of [H_(2) Rh(PP) _ 2]^+ and [HRh(PP) _(2) (CH_(3) CN) ]^(2 +) {{complexes}} have been carried out in acetonitrile. Seven different diphosphine (PP) ligands were selected to allow variation of the electronic properties of the ligand substituents, the <b>cone</b> <b>angles,</b> and the natural bite angles (NBAs). Oxidative addition of H_ 2 to [Rh(PP) _ 2]^+ complexes is favored by diphosphine ligands with large NBAs, small <b>cone</b> <b>angles,</b> and electron donating substituents, with the NBA being the dominant factor. Large pK_a values for [HRh(PP) _(2) (CH_(3) CN) ]^(2 +) complexes are favored by small ligand <b>cone</b> <b>angles,</b> small NBAs, and electron donating substituents with the <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> playing a major role. The hydride donor abilities of [H_(2) Rh(PP) _ 2]^+ complexes increase as the NBAs decrease, the <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> decrease, and the electron donor abilities of the substituents increase. These results indicate that if solvent coordination is involved in hydride transfer or proton transfer reactions, the observed trends can be understood in terms of a combination of two different steric effects, NBAs and <b>cone</b> <b>angles,</b> and electron-donor effects of the ligand substituents...|$|R

2500|$|In optics, an {{aperture}} is a hole or {{an opening}} through which light travels. [...] More specifically, the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> of {{a bundle of}} rays that come to a focus in the image plane. The aperture determines how collimated the admitted rays are, which is of great importance for the appearance at the image plane. [...] If an aperture is narrow, then highly collimated rays are admitted, resulting in a sharp focus at the image plane. [...] A wide aperture admits uncollimated rays, resulting in a sharp focus only for rays coming from a certain distance. [...] This means that a wide aperture results in an image that is sharp for things at the correct distance. The aperture also determines {{how many of the}} incoming rays are actually admitted and thus how much light reaches the image plane (the narrower the aperture, the darker the image for a given exposure time). In the human eye, the pupil is the aperture.|$|E
