5|$|After this success, which {{secured the}} Balkans, Maurice {{intended}} to consolidate Roman <b>control</b> <b>by</b> bringing in Armenian settlers {{who would be}} given land in exchange for military service. To this end, Priscus was sent to Armenia to recruit men and their families. His mission there, however, {{was interrupted by a}} large-scale military revolt that brought about the downfall of Maurice. In 602, Maurice again ordered his troops on the Danube frontier to winter north of the river. Again, this provoked widespread discontent, and when Peter, who had replaced Priscus, refused to bow down and rescind the order, an outright mutiny broke out. The army chose the officer Phocas as its new leader and marched down to Constantinople. Without any credible military forces of his own, Maurice had to flee, but was captured with his family and executed by Phocas, who now became emperor.|$|E
5|$|Although Australia {{does not}} have any nuclear power reactors, Pangea Resources {{considered}} siting an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year.

A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures.

Years later in 1924–1925, the Saud clan regained control over Hijaz and the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd was formed under Abdul Aziz ibn Saud's rule.|$|E
