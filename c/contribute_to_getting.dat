5000|$|Many {{times the}} {{economic}} development goals of specific countries cannot be reached because they lack the State’s capabilities to do so. For example, if a nation has little capacity to carry out basic functions like security and policing or core service delivery {{it is unlikely that}} a program that wants to foster a free-trade zone (special economic zones) or distribute vaccinations to vulnerable populations can accomplish their goals. This has been something overlooked by multiple international organizations, aid programs and even participating governments who attempt to carry out ‘best practices’ from other places in a carbon-copy manner with little success. This isomorphic mimicry -adopting organizational forms that have been successful elsewhere but that only hide institutional dysfunction without solving it on the home country -can <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> countries stuck in ‘capability traps’ where the country does not advance in its development goals. An example of this can be seen through some of the criticisms of foreign aid and its success rate at helping countries develop.|$|E
50|$|There is {{an implied}} bias {{based on this}} {{advertising}} money. Companies and/or individuals can come to have great influence over a publication due to the money they <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> the paper printed. The interest of take-ones, {{if they wish to}} keep running, can easily become about their advertisers' interests rather than their own journalistic ones. Since commuter newspapers are ad- revenue-based, it is possible that it would be susceptible to corporate bias or bias from advertisers trying to slip their products into the paper's stories. This in theory could lead to a less consistent, and ultimately a less trustworthy paper, however this concern is not unique to the take-one format. Though other Canadian newspapers such as the National Post or the Toronto Star often do include many advertisements, the line between the commuter newspapers that are supported chiefly by advertising revenue, and regular newspapers which are not, becomes more and more blurred as newspaper readership and subscription continues to decline and even traditional newspapers need to rely more and more heavily on advertisers. It is also important to remember that these standard-format newspapers are part of large media conglomerates which may also be serving their own interests, for instance advertising for other companies or products associated with the brand.|$|E

The analysis uses the concept of empowerment and four social psychological concepts: social responsivity, asocial non-responsivity, abstract sociability and concrete sociability. The conclusions of the study are that the participation is described as a sense of solidarity, community and belonging. The participation can also be a source of joy, excitement and pleasure and a way to get praise and confirmation. To participate in RTN is described as being active and involved in the work, and as a way to send an important message and to get heard.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the {{appearance}} on urban agendas of social and environmental issues not conventionally understood as municipal concerns. Often framed as policy areas that promote sustainability, quality of life or social inclusion, these new arrivals are complex {{not only because they}} are often cross-sectoral, but equally because there are few regulatory tools and resources to support their implementation. This trend has resulted in {{a growing body of research}} that asks what factors result in some social and environmental policies being adopted by municipalities, while others are not? And why in certain places and not others? Such research typically focuses on factors and processes that <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> an issue on the official agenda of a municipality, but offers comparatively little by way of analysis of what happens next. This article addresses this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the early stages of implementation of an emerging urban issue, food policy, in the City of Vancouver, Canada. The article draws attention to the often overlooked spaces and contours of governmental institutions as sites of organizational learning and capacity building in support of sustainability. In this way, the analysis brings deeper understandings of a specific case of food policy implementation by a municipal government, while also advancing research on how similar cross-cutting social and environmental issues are implemented by local governments elsewhere.

This thesis could <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> {{a deeper understanding of}} how Swedish management is adapted to foreign cultures. The empirical material in this study has been collected through qualitative interviews with four different Swedish managers with experience of managing abroad. The theoretical framework is based on the concepts cultural dimensions, management and cross-cultural adaptation which also are the three concepts in our conceptual framework. The conceptual framework is present in the interview template, the empirical chapter and the analysis to provide the thesis with a clear line of argument. The empirical chapter describes how the Swedish managers have dealt with the challenges of working in a foreign culture and how they have adapted their management to another culture. In the analysis the empirical material is analyzed {{with the help of the}} theoretical framework. In the analysis the effect of cultural dimensions is discussed in relations to Swedish management and which challenges a Swedish manager encounter when managing abroad.

It seems to be a linkage between to what extent Swedish mangers have to adapt their management style to the local culture and what kind of management position they have...|$|E
40|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that prosocial sharing is emotionally rewarding, which leads to further prosocial actions; such a positive feedback loop suggests a proximal mechanism of human&# 39;s tendency to act prosocially. However, it leaves open a question {{as to how the}} emotional benefits from sharing develop in young children and whether sharing under pressure promotes happiness as well. The current study directly compared 3 - and 5 -year-old Chinese children&# 39;s happiness when sharing was autonomous (the recipient did not <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> the reward) with when sharing was obligated (the recipient and the actor jointly earned the reward). We found that children shared more items overall when sharing was obligated than autonomous, demonstrating their conformity to social norms of merit-based sharing. In children who eventually shared with others, 5 -year-olds gave out more stickers in the obligated sharing condition than in the autonomous sharing condition, but 3 -year-olds shared the same amount between the conditions, suggesting that 5 -year-olds adhered to the meritbased sharing norm more strictly than 3 -year-olds. Moreover, in the autonomous sharing condition, children displayed greater happiness when they shared with the recipient than when they kept stickers for themselves, suggesting that costly prosocial giving benefited children with positive mood; however, children did not gain happiness when they shared with the recipient in the obligated sharing condition. These findings demonstrate that children&# 39;s affective benefits depend on the motivation underlying their prosocial behavior, and further imply that normative force and emotional gains may independently drive preschoolers&# 39; prosocial behaviors. </p...|$|E
40|$|More {{than half}} of the world’s {{population}} now lives in urban areas. In 2050, it will be even two thirds. Global problems such as climate change and scarcity of resources constitute new challenges especially for cities. The City of Vienna is meeting these challenges with the Smart City Wien Framework Strategy (SCWR) – a long-term umbrella strategy for the period up to 2050 with objectives regarding three dimensions: resources – quality of life – innovation. The City of Vienna considers participation crucial for implementing the SCWR. The requirements for this are still very general and need to be put into concrete terms. The realisation of participation within the SCWR is closely linked to {{the development and implementation of}} relevant programmes and projects of urban planning. This paper addresses the question of what the key success factors are in drawing up participatory processes within the context of these programmes and projects. The methodological approach was to combine available results of research and data analyses with analyses of case studies. The method of evaluation chosen is a summary analysis of the criteria deduced. The major findings of this thesis are the following: in order to achieve high-quality municipal programmes and projects, essential success factors need to be considered: -	division of the process into separate phases -	paying special attention to the initial phase -	involvement of relevant stakeholders -	openness to ideas -	simultaneity of product and process -	attractiveness of process design -	external communication -	conducive attitude and values. High-quality participatory processes entail particular benefits for the implementation of the SCWR. For instance, they can help to activate the innovation potential more efficiently and <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> closer to the citizens...|$|E

40|$|After {{a period}} of {{studying}} a certain subject, students form an opinion about it and begin having certain expectations. These expectations and the degree in which, in the end, they fulfil, contribute to {{the reputation of the}} university. Consequently, a continuous evaluation {{of the quality of the}} educational process is needed. The present research presents a part of a more complex study made on a sample of master students in Audit and Financial Management in Romania. The goal was to evidence the main factors that affect students' expectations in what regards the grades they will obtain at the end of the semester. For this, a questionnaire of 20 questions was applied to 250 such students. After factor reduction procedures were applied, six most significant variables were kept in the analysis: the proportion of knowledge acquired, the perceived level of utility of the discipline in the professional career of the student, the proportion in which the subject could <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> employed in the field it belongs to, the evaluation method and two variables evaluating through grades the didactic performance during the course and the overall performance of the tenure professor. The influence of these variables upon the grade expected by the student was assessed with the help of the OLS regression, both in the simple and multiple forms. Out of the six hypotheses formulated, only one proved to be false based on the simple regression analysis. When individually assessed, the evaluation method announced by the teacher at the beginning of the semester turned out to have no statistically significant influence upon students' expectations. For the rest of the variables, results were according to the assumptions made, i. e. all determine in a significant positive manner the students' opinion about the grade they will get. We have also constructed the multiple regression models. When putting all variables together, the significance changes. The level of difficulty of the evaluation method becomes significant, while from the rest of the variables only the proportion of knowledge acquirement still holds. The final conclusion is as expected: the higher the proportion of acquirement, the higher the grade expected at the end of the semester, while the more difficult the evaluation method, the lower the grade...|$|E
40|$|The name of Guatemala {{derives from}} the náhuatl “Quahtlemallan”, which means “land of trees”. However, since 1950 total {{deforestation}} has ranged from 60, 000 to 70, 000 ha/year, with an accumulated loss of 2, 958, 826 hectares (ha) of forest. Deforestation {{is not unique to}} Guatemala, and many national and international efforts have been proposed to address this environmental problem. One of them is the international scheme to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). REDD+, is considered as a global payment for ecosystem services scheme in which high income countries will pay low and low-middle income countries to keep their forest standing for the ecosystem service of carbon storage. Its founders hoped that REDD+ could deliver emission reductions as well as social and environmental benefits in these low and low-middle income countries, known as the “win-win-win” of the scheme. REDD+ promises a dream as stated on theory; but there are more challenges on the ground than dreamt of in REDD+ PES literature. If Guatemalan conditions on the ground do not align with REDD+’s theory, it could well turn into a nightmare. This raises three questions: (i) Is Guatemala ready to implement REDD+ successfully in order to achieve positive outcomes? (ii) If not, what will make Guatemala or any other non-annex I countries ready? And, more broadly; (iii) does REDD+ have the potential to deliver emission reductions, social benefits and environmental conservation in the context of countries like Guatemala? Through the development of this research, I analysed the decisions made of the Conference of the Parties of the Kyoto Protocol, since REDD+ was initially proposed (2008), {{until the end of the}} first commitment period of Kyoto Protocol (2012) and the following Conference of the Parties in Warsaw (2013) in order to analyse how it had evolved. This information provided of key issues that I then identified and analysed in Latin America case studies which included 6 international REDD+ and PES scheme projects and 4 REDD+ pilot projects of Guatemala. From here I distilled assumptions of how it should be REDD+ implemented, considering PES theory and what are the necessary conditions for the achievement of the expected outcomes. This information helped to elaborate research questions that were then asked in semi-structured interviews. Because REDD+ was recently new, not many people had much information about the topic. However, I identified actors from different sectors like: (i) academia; (ii) forest communities; (iii) government; (iv) Non-government organizations; (v) International non-government organizations (INGOs) and (vi) private sector. The Guatemalan and Latin American case studies showed varied success. In the more successful cases, projects were promoted by an independent entity or forest-dependent communities were the ones designing and implementing the scheme in a voluntarily manner. These cases achieved ‘win-win-win’ outcomes. In the less successful, initiatives were imposed by project developers and the outcome was rejection of the project. Guatemala is not ready for REDD+ yet because it is using the governance as usual method, in which the Guatemalan government has the only, and final, word in decision making for processes and projects at the national level. Indeed, this approach has not just been weak at national level but also when dealing with negotiations and commitments at international level. With this approach REDD+ will be a nightmare as it is unlikely to achieve ‘win-win-win’ outcomes. To be ready, Guatemala needs to follow a ‘governance without government’ structure for REDD+, which is my empirical contribution to governance and payment for ecosystem services’ theory. Building on this I offer practical recommendations for REDD+ itself. The most important is the development of the Social and Environmental Agency. Once this agency is developed it will <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> Guatemala ready for REDD+; therefore REDD+ will be a dream. The participation of the agency at international levels will attract buyers and, with that, the REDD+ market will begin and that will contribute to the achievement of the social and environmental benefits. Indeed, this REDD+ market will contribute to the process of recovering the forest cover that Guatemala has lost, and once recovered Guatemala will be once again called the Land of Trees...|$|E
