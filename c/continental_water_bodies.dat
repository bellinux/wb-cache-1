40|$|Although only a {{small amount}} of the Earth's <b>water</b> exists as <b>continental</b> surface <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> this {{compartment}} {{plays an important role in}} the biogeochemical cycles connecting the land to the atmosphere. The territory of Brazil encompasses a dense river net and enormous number of shallow lakes. Human actions have been heavily influenced by the inland waters across the country. Both biodiversity and processes in the water are strongly driven by seasonal fluvial forces and/or precipitation. These macro drivers are sensitive to climate changes. In addition to their crucial importance to humans, inland waters are extremely rich ecosystems, harboring high biodiversity, promoting landscape equilibrium (connecting ecosystems, maintaining animal and plant flows in the landscape, and transferring mass, nutrients and inocula), and controlling regional climates through hydrological-cycle feedback. In this contribution, we describe the aquatic ecological responses to climate change in a conceptual perspective, and we then analyze the possible climate-change scenarios in different regions in Brazil. We also indentify some potential biogeochemical signals in running waters, natural lakes and man-made impoundments. The possible future changes in climate and aquatic ecosystems in Brazil are highly uncertain. Inland waters are pressured by local environmental changes because of land uses, landscape fragmentation, damming and diversion of <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> urbanization, wastewater load, and level of pollutants can alter biogeochemical patterns in inland waters over a shorter term than can climate changes. In fact, many intense environmental changes may enhance the effects of changes in climate. Therefore, the maintenance of key elements within the landscape and avoiding extreme perturbation in the systems are urgent to maintain the sustainability of Brazilian inland waters, in order to prevent more catastrophic future events...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Sugarcane {{cultivation}} is {{the most}} important agricultural activity in the State of SÃ£o Paulo, which is responsible for over half of Brazilian production of the crop. Eutrophication and contamination of hydric resources caused by agricultural chemicals are major problems related to this crop. In the case of herbicides used to control weeds, aquatic organisms can be exposed to more than one toxic agent, and combinations of such pollutants can have different effects on biological systems. The aim of this work was to evaluate the toxic effects of mixtures of herbicides widely used in sugarcane cultivation, namely tebuthiuron (TBUT), ametryn (AMT), and Velpar K (a commercial mixture of diuron (DIU) and hexazinone (HZN)), to tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fingerling. The herbicides showed low to moderate toxicity and AMT was notably more toxic then TBUT and DIU+HZN. The mixtures were found to be moderately toxic to the tilapia fingerling (LC 50; 96 h were: TBUT+AMT: 10. 76 mg L- 1; (DIU+HZN) +TBUT: 43. 09 mg L- 1; and (DIU+HZN) +TBUT+AMT: 11. 90 mg L- 1), and a slight antagonism was observed between the components tested. These findings could contribute to the establishment of maximum permissible levels for the herbicides in Brazilian <b>continental</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> 201...|$|E
40|$|Euryhaline adaptations in Pennsylvanian {{vertebrates}} {{allowed them}} to inhabit the marine to freshwater spectrum. This is illustrated by new assemblages of fish and tetrapods from the early Moscovian Minto Formation of New Brunswick, Canada. Fish include chondrichthyans (xenacanthids and the enigmatic Ageleodus), acanthodians (gyracanthids and acanthodiforms), sarcopterygians (rhizodontids, megalichthyids and dipnoans), and actinopterygians (eurynotiforms). Tetrapods include small- to medium-sized, and largely aquatic, stem tetrapods (colosteids) and anthracosaurs (embolomeres). A key finding is that the parautochthonous fossil assemblages are preserved across a salinity gradient, with diversity (measured by the Simpson Index) declining from open marine environments, through brackish embayments, and reaching a nadir in tidal estuaries. Chondrichthyans dominate the entire salinity spectrum (65 % of fossils), a distribution that demonstrates a euryhaline mode of life, and one large predatory chondrichthyan, Orthacanthus, may have practised filial cannibalism in coastal nurseries because its heteropolar coprolites contain juvenile xenacanthid teeth. In contrast, other fish communities were more common in open marine settings while tetrapods were more common in coastal brackish waters. While all these faunas were also {{likely to have been}} euryhaline, their osmoregulation was, perhaps, less versatile. The demonstration of widespread euryhalinity among fish and aquatic tetrapods explains why Pennsylvanian faunas generally show a cosmopolitan biogeography because taxa were able to disperse via seaways. It also resolves the paradox of enriched strontium isotopic signatures observed in these faunas because organisms would have been, at times, exposed to <b>continental</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> as well. Therefore, our new findings contribute to the long-running debate about the ecology of Pennsylvanian fishes and tetrapods...|$|E
40|$|The Brachionus rotifers {{are small}} zooplanktonic organisms {{that can be}} found in <b>continental</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> They are {{economically}} important organisms, since they are commonly used as live food for fish larvae in the aquaculture industry. They also have an interesting life cycle (cyclic parthenogenesis, formation of resistant resting eggs) and they are characterised by the presence of cryptic species. Thus, many research efforts have been devoted to their study. As a result, the genus Brachionus has been characterised as the âguinea pig of the rotifersâ. The presence of cryptic species in Brachionus rotifers necessitates the use of genetic characterisation methods for the study of their populations. Up to date, a significant number of Brachionus cryptic species have been found following analyses of nucleotide sequence variation in the COI and ITS 1 regions. Most of these cryptic taxa form the âB. plicatilis species complexâ. With the description of the B. plicatilis species complex it became evident that many of its members are used in hatcheries and body size is an inaccurate criterion to describe the cultured strains at the level of species. Currently, the best way to identify a rotifer of the B. plicatilis complex is by studying its sequence in one of the two previous markers. However, it is difficult to use this approach to study Brachionus populations, because of the excessive number of samples that are needed to be analysed. It is therefore necessary to develop a method that will allow the fast and reliable genetic characterisation of rotifer samples. On the other hand, there is growing evidence of additional cryptic species, both within and outside the B. plicatilis complex. New genetic markers could help us reconstruct more robust phylogenies and determine more accurately the actual number and the evolutionary relationships of the Brachionus cryptic species. In this dissertation, a considerable number of COI sequences deposited in the GenBank was used to develop an RFLP method for the genetic characterisation of the cryptic Brachionus rotifers. Sequencing analysis has shown that most of the known cryptic species/biotypes are included in the examined data set, whereas the presence of new cryptic species is also supported. Using these sequences, a detailed restriction map was constructed. Additionally, Brachionus-specific primers for the 16 S rRNA mitochondrial region were designed and employed to the studied rotifer populations to yield a collection of 16 S rRNA sequences. Sequencing analysis revealed that the 16 S rRNA marker is superior to the COI, when deep divergences are studied in Brachionus rotifers. Thus, by combining these two markers a more robust mitochondrial-based Brachionus phylogeny can be inferred. The 16 S rRNA sequences were also used to develop a second restriction map. The data from both the COI and 16 S maps were used successfully to genetically characterise rotifers from the studied populations. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{freshwater}} {{bodies are}} very dynamic systems, {{and have been}} the first aquatic ecosystems susceptible to receive the direct impact of human activities, becoming very vulnerable ecosystems. The Lake Nicaragua has been recognised as a <b>continental</b> <b>water</b> <b>body</b> with an important source of fish living resources for the fishery sector. In addition, its dimension is very attractive for the development of aquaculture activities. However, the exploitation level of fishing resources in the lake has lead to an overexploitation of some species already included in UICN red list, while others are in risk of being overexploited if management measures are not taken. Studies on species diversity in the lake defined two demersal fish habitats: the âshallow benthicâ habitat, which has a higher index of species diversity and the âdeep benthicâ habitat with lower diversity index. The landings data series do not allow ascertaining the catches composition. Hence, any evaluation of the fish exploitation pattern in the Lake Nicaragua derived from landings record is imprecise. Besides, the large gap on knowledge of many other important biological parameters of the fish species - the dynamic of reproductive behaviour of the population, the reproductive cycle, spawning ground, egg production and the maternal features affecting reproductive output and fitness- prevents the implementation of management actions directed towards the conservation of the lake stock reproductive potential, such as regulations on closing season and/or areas, and minimum landing sizes. This study, besides providing information about actual state of distribution and abundance of Amphilophus citrinellus, Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, Parachromis managuensis, and Brycon guatemalensis, provides information of the reproductive strategy of B. guatemalensis and proposes some management alternatives based on its biological features. The present study was conducted along {{the eastern part of the}} Lake Nicaragua and showed that even all the species studied were widely distributed in this area, species abundance varied geographically (zones: northwest, central and southeast) and vertically (depth: from shallow to deeper areas). The patterns of abundance of cichlid (A. citrinellus, H. nicaraguensis and P. managuensis) are affected by spatial (zones) and environmental factors as the vertical profiles (depth), whereas in B. guatemalensis was also affected by seasons of the year, i. e., dry and rainy season. Cichlids were more abundant in shallow waters and in the southeast zone, whereas B. guatemalensis larger abundances were found in the southeast and northwest side. Similarly, the size distribution pattern was influenced by both latitude and vertical profiles. Overall, larger fishes are found in the southeast and to a lesser extent in the central zone of the lake, whereas in the northwest are smaller. Furthermore, larger fish are found in relative deeper waters. The reproductive studies on B. guatemalensis using histological procedures showed that the oocytes final maturation ended with the migration of the germinal vesicle to the animal pole, without oocyte hydration, and oocytes being surrounded by mucus indicative of eggs adhesiveness. The species presented a protracted spawning season that lasted 8 months. Both small and large females started the spawning activity in July, but spawning asynchrony occurred between female sizes as spawning season progressed.

This study analyzes water storage simulated with the Watergap Global Hydrology Model. The model represents four major storage compartments: surface water, snow, soil, and groundwater. Water storage variations are analyzed for the period 1961 - 1995 with 0. 5 degrees resolution, for the major global climate zones, and for the 30 largest river basins worldwide. Seasonal variations are the dominant storage change signal with maximum values in the marginal tropics and in snow-dominated high-latitude areas. Interannual variations are associated with large-scale oscillations such as El Nino Southern Oscillation. The contribution of individual water storage compartments to total storage change varies with the climate region and the timescale under consideration. In most regions, a prominent role of storage variations in surface <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> is found. Surface water reduces markedly the spatial correlation lengths of water storage fields. The simulation results are evaluated against storage variations of combined atmospheric-terrestrial water balance studies and other global models.

40|$|The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims at {{improving}} the ecological status of <b>continental</b> <b>waters,</b> including man-made <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Thereby {{it raises the}} question of the reference conditions for reservoirs.

Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} contribute to the implementation of the WFD by comparing the fish communities across these three types of ecosystems. This was achieved using fish sampling data from 21 natural lakes, 50 reservoirs and 549 river stations. The lists of occurring species are very similar between lakes and reservoirs, and appear as a subset of the species occurring in rivers. Lakes and reservoirs are also very similar in terms of common and rare species. Conversely, the comparison of community structures (summarised by correspondence analysis axes) supports the hypothesis of an intermediate position of reservoirs between lake and river systems. This latter result could reflect the effect of large-scale processes undergone by freshwater ecosystems whatever their type and the non-independence of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> within their catchments, particularly when considering the communities of highly mobile organisms like fishes.

My research aimed to determine if constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (e. g., <b>water</b> supply reservoirs, dams and ponds) were invaded by zooplankton with greater ease than natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> and whether this was due to a lower biodiversity, and therefore lower 'biotic resistance', in constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Sediment cores were collected from a cross-section of 46 lakes, ponds and reservoirs (23 natural and 23 constructed) throughout the North Island, New Zealand. Diapausing zooplankton eggs were separated from the sediments and hatched to assess species composition and richness. In addition, the distributions of non-indigenous zooplankton were examined to determine if they occurred more frequently in constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> than in natural ones. Species composition results showed that natural <b>water</b> <b>body</b> zooplankton communities appeared to consist mainly of a core group of truly planktonic species. However, the species assemblages of constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were more varied, comprising of a number of littoral and benthic species, and a large number of species that were recorded from only a single <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that Trophic Level Index explained a significant amount of variation in zooplankton community composition of natural waters (p = 0. 002). Distance to nearest <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and number of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> within a 20 km radius explained significant amounts of variation in community composition of constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (p = 0. 040 and 0. 038 respectively).

A stepwise linear regression indicated that latitude and approximate maximum depth of <b>water</b> <b>body</b> were significant predictors of natural <b>water</b> <b>body</b> species richness (p = 0. 002 and 0. 016 respectively). However, no significant predictors of species richness were elucidated for constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The non-indigenous calanoid copepods Sinodiaptomus valkanovi and Boeckella minuta were only found in constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> However, the non-indigenous cladoceran Daphnia galeata was recorded in both natural and constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The non-indigenous calanoid copepods are more likely to establish populations in constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> due to the absence of key species (i. e. native calanoid copepods), whose presence in natural waters seemingly provides 'biotic resistance'. The invasion success of D. galeata in constructed and natural waters may be attributed to the absence of a superior competitor, as native Daphnia populations, for example, are rare in the North Island. My results suggest that species richness may not be as important as species composition in influencing the ease with which non-indigenous species invade constructed <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The core group of species found in natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> are likely to be better adapted to pelagic conditions, and therefore better at resisting invaders, than the more varied constructed <b>water</b> <b>body</b> assemblages...|$|R

In urban land covers, as compared to surrounding undeveloped land, <b>water</b> <b>body</b> size distributions converged on moderate sizes, shapes toward less tortuous shorelines, and the number and area of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> that intersected surface flow lines (i. e., streams and rivers) decreased. Potential mechanisms responsible for changing the characteristics of urban <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> include: preferential removal, physical reshaping or addition of <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> and selection of locations for development. The relative contributions of each mechanism likely change as cities grow. The larger size and reduced surface connectivity of urban <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> may affect the role of internal dynamics and sensitivity to catchment processes. More broadly, these results illustrate the complex nature of urban watersheds and highlight the need to develop a conceptual framework for urban <b>water</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R

As explained by MA (2005) and Costanza et al. (1997), we considered the tangible and intangible benefits provided by an ecosystem as provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services that people derived from four ecosystems mainly forest, agro-ecosystem, seasonal and perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Because of the seasonal variation affecting the <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> we classified rain fed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> into seasonal and perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Seasonal rain influencing fresh <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> like inundation are considered as seasonal <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> excluding seasonal influences are considered as perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Survey questions mainly focused on (i) dependency on ES by communities for their livelihood, (ii) communityâs perception on state of LULCC and ES and (iii) long term changes over the flow {{of goods and services}} derived from these four ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|In this research, <b>water</b> <b>body</b> {{characterization}} {{is performed}} by decomposing the <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> into convex components using morphological decomposition. Opening by reconstruction is implemented on the decomposed convex components using square kernels of increasing sizes. A power law relationship is observed {{between the number}} of decomposed convex components removed at each iteration of opening by reconstruction and the kernel size. The scaling exponent of this power law is the fractal dimension of the <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> which indicates the measure of complexity of the self-similarity of the <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The iterative opening by reconstruction process is implemented on the individual <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> to compute their fractal dimensions. The computed fractal dimensions are shape dependant and consider the topological regions of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> rather than their geometric boundaries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a Global 3 arc-second <b>Water</b> <b>Body</b> Map (G 3 WBM), using an automated algorithm to process multi-temporal Landsat images from the Global Land Survey (GLS) database. We used 33, 890 scenes from 4 GLS epochs in order to delineate a seamless <b>water</b> <b>body</b> map, without cloud and ice/snow gaps. Permanent <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> were distinguished from temporal water-covered areas by calculating the frequency of <b>water</b> <b>body</b> existence from overlapping, multi-temporal, Landsat scenes. By analyzing the frequency of <b>water</b> <b>body</b> existence at 3 arc-second resolution, the G 3 WBM separates river channels and floodplains more clearly than previous studies. This suggests that the use of multi-temporal images is as important as analysis at a higher resolution for global <b>water</b> <b>body</b> mapping. The global totals of delineated permanent <b>water</b> <b>body</b> area and temporal water-covered area are 3. 25 and 0. 49 million km 2 respectively, which highlights the importance of river-floodplain separation using multi-temporal images. The accuracy of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> classification was validated in Hokkaido (Japan) and in the contiguous United States using an existing <b>water</b> <b>body</b> databases. There was almost no commission error, and about 70 % of lakes > 1 km 2 shows relative water area error < 25 %. Though smaller <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (< 1 km 2) were underestimated mainly due to omission of shoreline pixels, the overall accuracy of the G 3 WBM should be adequate for larger scale research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate systems and importantly includes a quantification of the temporal nature of global <b>water</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{software}} {{has been}} designed to detect <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> that are out in the open on cross-country terrain at close range (out to 30 meters), using imagery acquired from a stereo pair of color cameras mounted on a terrestrial, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). This detector exploits the fact that the color variation across <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> is generally larger and more uniform than that of other naturally occurring types of terrain, such as soil and vegetation. Non-traversable <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> such as large puddles, ponds, and lakes, are detected based on color variation, image intensity variance, image intensity gradient, size, and shape. At ranges beyond 20 meters, <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> out in the open can be indirectly detected by detecting reflections of the sky below the horizon in color imagery. But at closer range, the color coming out of a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> dominates sky reflections, and the water cue from sky reflections is of marginal use. Since there may be times during UGV autonomous navigation when a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> does not come into a perception system s field of view until it is at close range, the ability to detect <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> at close range is critical. Factors that influence the perceived color of a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> at close range are the amount and type of sediment in the water, the water s depth, and the angle of incidence to the <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> Developing a single model of the mixture ratio of light reflected off the water surface (to the camera) to light coming out of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> (to the camera) for all <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> would be fairly difficult. Instead, this software detects close <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> based on local terrain features and the natural, uniform change in color that occurs across the surface from the leading edge to the trailing edge...|$|R

They are used as indicators of environmental contamination, ecosystem health and habitat quality., Amphibian species are sensitive {{to changes in the}} aquatic environment and therefore, may form the basis for the classification of <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>bodies</b> in which there are a large number of amphibian species are especially valuable even if they are located in urban areas. The automation of the classification process allows for a faster evaluation of the presence of amphibian species in the <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Three machine-learning methods (artificial neural networks, decision trees and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm) have been used to classify <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in ChorzÃ³w â one of 19 cities in the Upper Silesia Agglomeration. In this case, classification is a supervised data mining method consisting of several stages such as building the model, the testing phase and the prediction. Seven natural and anthropogenic features of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (e. g. the type of <b>water</b> <b>body,</b> aquatic plants, the purpose of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> (destination), position of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> in relation to any possible buildings, condition of the <b>water</b> <b>body,</b> the degree of littering, the shore type and fishing activities) have been taken into account in the classification.
