40|$|Abstract. Automatic Variable Transmission (AVT) is {{composed}} of a metal belt CVT unit and a step speed changing transmission component. According {{to the needs of}} automotive conditions, AVT can realize <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission and <b>gear</b> transmission, which not only play the advantage of gear transmission efficiency, but also overcome the deficiency of CVT when it is in high-speed. In the paper, the transmission matching rule is introduced, and engine model is established using engine test data. Based on SimulationX software, a vehicle that equips AVT is used for modeling and simulation. Finally the power matching is researched...|$|R

Particularly, three different Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) have been considered as the electric motor, which are characterized by different speed operating ranges and constant-power speed regions. In addition, four transmission systems are introduced and briefly described, i. e. Single-Gear, Multi-Gear, <b>Continuously</b> <b>Variable</b> and Magnetic <b>Gear</b> Transmission. Among these, the most suitable one is chosen for each PMSM in accordance with its inherent features. Subsequently, four EPSs have been designed based on specific vehicle traction and power requirements. The proposed EPS configurations are tested over three driving cycles {{in order to assess}} their efficiency over different driving conditions...|$|R

The proposed Infinity Variable Drive (IVD) mechanism can be categorized as the Infinitely Variable Transmission providing <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio including neutral and reverse. The main objective of this thesis was to study the functionality of novel IVD. The new transmission system was studied using multibody dynamic simulation approach. The study was done using the multibody simulation tool MSC ADAMS 2016. The sub systems were studied separately before studying the IVD mechanism as a whole. The sub systems studied are simple planetary gear set with multiple inputs, two stage planetary gear system, and one way overrunning clutch. The results obtained from simulation of two stage planetary gear set was verified using analytical approach. The Proof of Concept (PoC) was developed during the project and the simulation results were compared with the measurements done with the PoC...|$|E

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} is how {{to control}} vehicle speed over a given distance on a given time such that fuel consumption is minimized. Analytical expressions for the necessary optimality conditions are derived. These expressions are essential for {{the understanding of the}} decisive parameters affecting fuel optimal driving and the analytical optimality conditions make it possible to see how each parameter affects the optimal solution. Optimal solutions for an affine engine torque model are compared to solutions for a piece-wise affine model, and it is shown that small non-linearities have significant effect on the optimal control strategy. The solutions for the non linear engine model has a smoother character but also requires longer prediction horizons. Assuming a <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission, optimal <b>gear</b> ratio control is presented, and it is shown how the maximum fueling function is essential for the solution. It is also shown that the gear ratio never is chosen such that engine speed exceeds the speed of maximum engine power. Those results are then extended t...|$|R
25|$|The Insight’s <b>Continuously</b> <b>Variable</b> Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s <b>gear</b> ratios are <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|R
40|$|Part I: Governing and Synchronization The {{design and}} {{construction}} of an aircraft propeller governor or synchronizer is a specialized problem concerning Servo-Mechanism Theory. Search developed that adequate theory existed to cover the specific variables involved. The sources used in this report {{are listed in the}} extensive bibliography. Short descriptions are presented of the various governing and synchronizing means used to control present day propellers. In this research an airplane engine-propeller system was simulated and a single unit of a synchronizer, suitable for use as a governor for one engine, was invented and constructed. It was demonstrated to meet the United States Army Air Corps tentative specifications for propeller synchronizers. Time and unavailability of material and overworked shop facilities did not permit the construction of a model for full scale multi-motored airplane test. It is contemplated that such a model will later be constructed at the Materiel Division, United States Air Corps, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. A detailed description of this invention is presented in Appendix I. A discussion is presented of the general servo-mechanism theory as applied to airplane propeller governors and synchronizers. In addition, a short discussion is presented of how synchronization of propellers influences the tactical employment of military aircraft. The physiological effect on occupants of aircraft is also shortly discussed. Part II: Effect of <b>Variable</b> Engine Reduction <b>Gearing</b> on Aircraft Performance The demand for improved performance in aircraft has led through the years to the development of more efficient propulsive systems, starting with the fixed pitch propeller directly driven from the engine and progressing to the modern <b>geared</b> constant speed <b>variable</b> pitch propeller. This development and the reasons for it are briefly described. The continued increase in performance leads to the two speed reduction gear and finally to the <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> reduction <b>gear</b> combined with the constant speed variable pitch propeller. The possible advantages of such an installation and the reasons for these advantages are described. Two examples of modern military airplanes are used to illustrate in detail the gains in performance that may be obtained. The extension to probable developments in airplanes to be built in the near future is considered. Mechanical difficulties and control problems are briefly discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Continuously</b> <b>Variable</b> Transmission (CVT) {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{technologies}} in automotive industries. Many researchers apply CVT in their system especially in speed control but not much was reported in position control. This project develops a control system design using the concept of CVT by replacing the fixed gearing system in conventional position control system into <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio. The <b>variable</b> <b>gearing</b> gearbox can be modeled by two continuously separated cones with different ratio banded by a belt that transfers the power from motor to the load. Simulation study in closed loop system is done to find how speed ratios can control position of the output load as the ratio change from under-drive to over-drive stage. Designed CVT system is analyzed based on settling-time, rise-time, peak-time, and overshoot compared to the conventional fixed gearing system. The output position of designed system can be controlled by only varying speed ratio, thus making system’s performance easily tuned from under-drive to over-drive stage. From the analysis, designed CVT model shows better in overshoot compared to the fixed gearing system. As a result, a system with CVT have advantage over fixed gear and add up a new degree of freedom in control system design, which position can be control by only varying the speed ratio instead of applied forward and feed gain...|$|R
