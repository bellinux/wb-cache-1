50|$|Along with intervals, <b>cross-certifications</b> {{are stored}} in a network archive. Within a transient-key network, the archive is a logical {{database}} that can be stored and replicated on any system to enable verification of data that has been timestamped and signed by transient keys. A map of the set of accessible archives is stored within every digital signature created in the system. Whenever <b>cross-certifications</b> are completed {{at the beginning of}} an interval, the archive map is updated and published to all servers in the network.|$|R
50|$|Through {{independently}} operating servers, <b>cross-certification</b> {{can provide}} third-party {{proof of the}} validity of a time interval chain and irrefutable evidence of consensus on the current time. Transient-key cryptographic systems display high Byzantine fault tolerance. A web of interconnected cross-certifying servers in a distributed environment creates a widely witnessed chain of trust that is as strong as its strongest link. By contrast, entire hierarchies of traditional public key systems can be compromised if a single private key is exposed. An individual transient key interval chain can be cross-certified with other transient key chains and server instances. Through <b>cross-certification,</b> Server A signs Server B's interval chain, the signed data of which is the interval definition. In effect, the private keys from Server B are used to sign the public keys of Server A. In the diagram, a server instance is cross-certified with two other server instances (blue and orange).Cross-certification requires that the timestamp for the interval agree with the timestamp of the cross-certifying server within acceptable tolerances, which are user-defined and typically a few hundred milliseconds in duration.|$|E

50|$|Examining how {{certificate}} {{chains are}} built and validated, {{it is important}} to note that a concrete certificate can be part of very different certificate chains (all of them valid). This is because several CA certificates can be generated for the same subject and public key signing them with different private keys (from different CAs or different private keys from the same CA). So, although a single X.509 certificate can have only one issuer and one CA signature, it can be validly linked to more than one certificate building completely different certificate chains. This is crucial for <b>cross-certification</b> between PKIs and other applications.|$|E
50|$|Windows XP PKI {{supports}} <b>cross-certification</b> and Bridge CA scenarios. User-type certificates can be auto-enrolled and renewed. Certificate {{requests for}} issuing new certificates or renewing expired ones can be pending until administrator approval or until {{issued by the}} certificate authority and once approved, they install automatically. Root CA certificates now also auto-update via Microsoft Update. Windows XP also supports delta CRLs (CRLs whose status has changed since the last full base compiled CRL) and base64-encoded CRLs for revocation checking and will use them by default. Windows XP can enroll version 2 certificate templates which have many configurable attributes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} PKI {{problems}} is currently the lack of interoperability at international level, which is greatly dependent on the automation of the <b>cross-certification</b> procedure using Certificate Policies (CP). This paper addresses the above-mentioned need by presenting an XML-based tool for the automated development and comparison of CPs, with main emphasis on healthcare environments. The CP tool is developed in JAVA and is characterized as flexible, standards-based and extendable, since all data representation is in XML. The implementation follows a prototype CP content standardization for healthcare using RFC 2527 Standard, whereas the CP comparison algorithm {{is based on a}} multi-criteria decision support system. The final aim of the CP tool is to serve as a baseline for an on-line automated <b>cross-certification</b> service, thus enhancing PKI co-operation and interconnection for several business sectors. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a proposed structure for a Federal PKI, {{developed by the}} Federal PKI Technical Working Group and stated in the Federal PKI Concept of Operations [CONOPS 95], that combines a hierarchy with a more general networked cross-certificate structure.

An important attribute of this proposal is that a local CA may issue certificates and broadly cross-certify with whomever it needs, but the certificate holders of other CAs are protected from the possibly unwise <b>cross-certification</b> decisions of that CA. 2.

40|$|Abstract—MapReduce is a {{key-value}} based programming {{model and}} an associated implementation for processing large data sets. It {{has been adopted}} in various scenarios and seems promising. However, when spatial computation is expressed straightforward by this key-value based model, difficulties arise due to unfit features and performance degradation. In this paper, we present methods as follows: 1) a splitting method for balancing workload, 2) pending file structure and redundant data partition dealing with relation between spatial objects, 3) a strip-based two-direction plane sweep-ing algorithm for computation accelerating. Based on these methods, ANN(All nearest neighbors) query and astronomical <b>cross-certification</b> are developed. Performance evaluation shows that the MapReduce-based spatial applications outperform the traditional one on DBMS...|$|E

The research developed a scenario definition file for the CyberCIEGE game engine that supports a new game scenario that illustrates PKI concepts (e. g., <b>cross-certification,</b> certificate path processing and certificate revocation), configuration choices, and the security implications thereof. The game engine was enhanced to realistically model the parameters of an actual X. 509 digital certificate. Test cases designed for this game extension verified that the scenario reasonably portrayed realistic PKI deployment issues and provided feedback consistent with real-world PKI implementations.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a PKI-based e-Health authentication architecture. This architecture was developed to authenticate e-Health Professionals accessing RTS (Rede Telemática da Saúde), a regional platform for sharing clinical data among a set of affiliated health institutions. The architecture had to accommodate specific RTS requirements, namely the security of Professionals ’ credentials, the mobility of Professionals, and the scalability to accommodate new health institutions. The adopted solution uses short lived certificates and <b>cross-certification</b> agreements between RTS and e-Health institutions for authenticating Professionals accessing the RTS. These certificates carry as well the Professional’s role at their home institution for role-based authorization. Trust agreements between health institutions and RTS are {{necessary in order to}} make the certificates recognized by the RTS. As a proof of concept, a prototype was implemented with Windows technology. The presented authentication architecture is intended to be applied to other medical telematic systems. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new framework for polling responses from a large population. Our framework allows gathering information without violating the responders ’ anonymity {{and at the same}} time enables public verification of the poll’s result. In contrast to prior approaches to the problem, we do not require trusting the pollster for faithfully announcing the poll’s results, nor do we rely on strong identity verification. We propose an “effort based ” polling protocol whose results can be publicly verified by constructing a “responder certification graph ” whose nodes are labeled by responders’ replies to the poll, and whose edges cross-certify that adjacent nodes correspond to honest participants. <b>Cross-certification</b> is achieved using a newly introduced (privately verifiable) “Private Proof of Effort ” (PPE). In effect, our protocol gives a general method for con-verting privately-verifiable proofs into a publicly-verifiable protocol. The soundness of the transformation relies on expansion properties of the certification graph. Our results are applicable to a variety of settings in which crowd-sourced information gathering is required. This includes crypto-currencies, political polling, elections, recom-mendation systems, viewer voting in TV shows, and prediction markets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Vehicular Ad-Hoc NETworks (VANETs) {{have evolved}} con-siderably {{over the last}} years, {{promising}} to drastically {{reduce the number of}} traffic victims by increasing the overall road safety. Despite the wide number of potential applications VANETs also raise a broad range of critical security challenges mostly related with Privacy, which remains as an important factor to consider for the successful deployment of these technologies. To achieve privacy it is important to enforce the concepts of authentication and authorization via well proved mechanisms, i. e. Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) relying on a large set of regional Certification Authorities (CAs) with explicit <b>cross-certification</b> agreements to provide interoperability for vehicles and services. To avoid the burden of man-aging these cross-certificates our research proposes the Interoperability System (IS), an architecture able to provide VANETs ’ nodes with a se-curity mechanism for different and mutually untrusted domains. The IS supplies vehicles with a trusted set of authentication and authorization credentials, by implementing an OCSP-based certificate status service and a quantitative security level evaluator. This paper shows that the proposed architecture can be used to implement a Mandatory Access Control mechanism in two well known VANET scenarios, therefore en-forcing driver’s privacy and liability (non-repudiation) with a protocol independent of the underlying communication system...|$|E
