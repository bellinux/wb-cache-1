5000|$|Bangladesh Dairy Feed: Land {{is scarce}} in this densely {{populated}} and disaster prone country and therefore, grazing land for livestock is shrinking day by day. Also, due to poor genetic potential of milking cows coupled with non-availability of balanced supplemental feed, {{the national average}} milk production in Bangladesh has remained very low (in the range of 1.5-3.0 liters per cow per day). In this backdrop, F2F volunteer Dr. Roy Chapin helped to develop the first dairy feed program in Bangladesh, which included developing a computer assisted program for formulating rations for lactating cows, a <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> ration and a ration for growing heifers. “Making dairy feed is the intermediate step in having more milk, meat, money and manure produced in Bangladesh so people there will have more protein, energy, vitamins and minerals in their diets, more money in their pockets and more rice straw converted to fertilizers to increase soil fertility”, Dr. Chapin mentioned in his comments after the assignment. In practice, feed produced following Chapin’s formulation is showing highly encouraging results with an average increase in milk production by around 40 percent, which means, the cow that earlier gave an average of five liters milk per day, now with Chapin formulated feed is giving seven liters. Feed production plant manager Mohammad Khasru and marketing officer Jadu Gopal {{in a recent interview}} mentioned that demand for their dairy feed is increasing and the marketing horizon is gradually being widened to cover most of the strategic dairy pockets in northern, eastern and north eastern parts of the country.|$|E

Particle size distribution of processed wheat grains, skeletal growth measures, starter digestibility, starter intake, health status, and blood metabolites of neonatal calves were assessed in weeks 4, 8 and 12 to assess rumen development {{and find the}} optimum method of wheat processing for calves. The experiment started when calves were 3 ± 1 d old and studied for 90 days. Calves were weaned {{at the end of}} 9 th week and a post weaning specific starter diets were fed for one month. PW and SFW dramatically decreased fine particles in comparison to GW or DRW. PW had the most proportion of larger particles (93. 52 % > 3. 38 mm) where GW had the finest texture (70. 71 % < 2 mm). Health status parameters of calves did not affected by treatments, but respiratory index was affected by time. Skeletal growth measures including body length, body barrel, wither height and hip width did not affected by treatments, but these measures progressed by age. Calves received PW had the highest body weight and daily gain, but feed; gain ratio was not affected by treatments. These parameters were also affected by age. Although, calves received DRW had the lowest starter intake, but the highest digestibility coefficients for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, NDF and energy. This higher digestibility was attributed to lower starter intake resulted in probably higher rumen retention time and thus the most rumen degradation of nutrients.

40|$|This {{study was}} an {{extension}} of a study submitted in April 2014 by Sheldon D. Holt entitled “Ambient Temperature, Calf Intakes, and Weight Gains on Preweaned Dairy Calves”. A major component in a profitable dairy operation is the raising of female calves as replacement heifers; but since no direct income is generated by calf raising alone, it is often overlooked as a potential profit area on a dairy farm. Calf management practices that ultimately impact milk productivity and reproductive performance during a heifer’s lifetime begin at birth. This study examines the effect of <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> intake on calf growth, measuring specifically calf weight. How <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> intake affected production costs was also examined. Other factors {{included in the study}} were seasonal change, hip height, days since birth, and weather conditions. The cost of <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> {{is one of the main}} contributors to total production cost in raising dairy calves. Since the amount of starter intake consumed by the calves in this study was measured by Holt, a cost analysis can be performed using these data. Therefore, the first two objectives of this study are to 1) develop a model which minimizes cost of starter feed (which is a variable controlled by the dairy producer) and 2) use the model developed under objective 1) to find the breakeven point (where the cost of an input is less than or equal to the value gained from that input) and conduct sensitivity analysis with respect to this point. Although an analysis was performed on the data at the close of its collection in 2014 by S. D Holt, there are several econometric issues that were not adequately addressed before these analyses were performed. The following problems have been found in the data: functional form, multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity, and serial correlation. Any interpretation or prediction based on these data, without these issues being resolved, is not reliable. In order for interpretations and predictions based on these data to be valid, the last two objectives of this study are to 3) define in detail the econometric problems that existed in Holt’s study and 4) find and implement solutions to econometric problems that existed in that study...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{soybean meal}} in animal diets is {{primarily}} limited to adult animals {{due to the}} inefficient digestibility of soy proteins by young animals and the susceptibility of young animals to antinutritional compounds in soybeans that are either not properly processed or undercooked. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the suitability of fermented soybean meal for use in dairy <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> diets in place of soybean meal. Growth rates, weaning age, and health and immunological parameters were obtained to evaluate the effects of feeding fermented soybean meal in place of soybean meal in dairy <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> diets. The experiment was conducted using 66 dairy bull calves that were randomly assigned to either the control diet, containing soybean meal as the primary source of protein in the starter diet, or the treatment diet, containing fermented soybean meal in place of soybean meal as the primary source of protein in the starter diet. Weekly weight gains, total weight gained, attitude, appetite, and fecal scores, and immunological parameters all showed no significant differences between the calves on the control and treatment diets. Weaning age was older for calves on the fermented soybean meal in comparison to the soybean meal based starter diet (P= 0. 0422). This data suggests that fermented soybean meal based starter diets are similar to soybean meal based diets and that that fermented soybean meal could replace soybean meal without any adverse affects on growth or digestive processes...|$|E
40|$|Male Holstein calves (n = 120) {{purchased}} from local dairy farms were fed {{one of three}} calf milk replacers for 42 d. Experimental milk replacers were formulated to contain whey protein concentrate (WPC) as the pri-mary protein source orWPCplus 5 % spray-dried bovine plasma (SDBP) or spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP). The SDPP was heated to remove heat-insoluble materi-als and provide products with similar IgG content. Calves were also fed commercial <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> and water for ad libitum consumption. Intake, change in body weight (BW), feed efficiency, morbidity and mortality were determined. Mortality was 10, 3, and 2 in calves fed WPC, SDBP, and SDPP treatments, respectively. Morbidity, measured {{as the number of}} days that calves had diarrhea was reduced by 30 %when SDBP or SDPP were fed. Calves had diarrhea for 6. 9, 3. 9, and 4. 7 d during the 42 -d study when fed commercial calf milk replacer containing WPC, SDBP, and SDPP, respec-tively. Fecal scores tended to be reduced and feed effi-ciency tended to be improved when SDBP or SDPPwere fed. Mean intakes of total dry matter during the 42 -d studywere greaterwhen calveswere fed SDBP or SDPP and were 661, 710, and 684 g/d for calves fed WPC, SDBP, and SDPP, respectively. Mean BW gains from d 0 to 42 were 231, 261, and 218 g/d, respectively. Calves fed SDPP tended to have lower BW gain during the first 28 d of the study. However, difference in daily BW gain from d 1 to 28 was only 39 g/d. Inclusion of SDBP orSDPP inmilk replacer reducedmorbidity andmortal-ity of milk-fed dairy calves.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} ruminal pH and bacteria in calves fed <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> with and without forage during weaning transition. First, 16 Holstein bull calves were obtained from dairy farms and equipped with rumen cannulas by cannulation surgery. Then, calves (73. 5 ± 4. 2 kg; mean ± SE) were assigned to groups fed <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> either with forage (HAY, n = 8) or without forage (CON, n = 8), and all calves were weaned at 8 weeks of age. Ruminal pH was measured continuously, and rumen fluid samples were collected at 7, 8, 9, and 11 weeks of age, namely 1, 0, 1, and 3 weeks after weaning, respectively, to assess volatile fatty acid concentrations and bacterial DNA. The 24 -h mean ruminal pH was significantly (P < 0. 05) different between the two groups. Diurnal changes in the 1 -h mean ruminal pH were observed throughout the study in the HAY group; however, they were not observed at 0 and 1 weeks after weaning in the CON group. Moreover, the HAY group had significantly (P < 0. 05) higher proportions of acetate and butyrate and lower proportion of propionate, and significantly (P < 0. 05) lower ruminal acetate-to-propionate ratios were observed in the CON group. The ruminal bacterial diversity indices decreased after - 1 week in both groups and increased at 0 and 1 weeks after weaning in the HAY and CON groups, respectively. From the 454 pyrosequencing analysis, significant differences (P < 0. 05) were observed in the relative abundance of several phyla (Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes) and one genus (Prevotella) between the two groups. From quantitative real-time PCR analysis, the HAY group had the higher copy numbers of cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus) compared with the CON group. This study demonstrated that feeding of dietary forage alleviates subacute ruminal acidosis due to diurnal changes in ruminal pH. Furthermore, changes in ruminal pH affect the ruminal bacterial diversity and relative abundance, and these changes might have influenced the establishment of fermentative ruminal functions during weaning transition...|$|E
40|$|Dairy calves have {{traditionally}} been kept in individual pens throughout the milk-feeding period. Social rearing is associated with increased solid feed intake and hence higher weight gains before and after weaning. Little {{is known about the}} effect of the age at which social housing begins. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of early versus late pairing on feeding behavior and weight gain before and after weaning. Holstein bull calves were reared individually (n= 8 calves), or paired with another calf at 6 ± 3 d (n= 8 pairs) or 43 ± 3 d of age (n= 8 pairs). All calves were fed 8 L of milk/d for 4 wk, 6 L/d from 4 to 7 wk and then milk was reduced by 20 %/d until calves were completely weaned at 8 wk of age. Calves were provided ad libitum access to <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> and a total mixed ration (TMR). Body weight and feed intake were measured weekly from 3 to 10 wk of age. Intake of <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> was significantly higher for the early-paired calves than for individually-reared and late-paired calves throughout the experimental period. At 10 wk of age, starter dry matter intake (DMI) averaged 2. 20 ± 0. 22 kg/d, 1. 09 ± 0. 25 kg/d and 1. 26 ± 0. 33 kg/d for early pair, late pair and individually housed calves, respectively. Intake of TMR did not differ among treatments, TMR dry matter intake (averaged 3. 27 ± 0. 72 kg/d, 3. 08 ± 0. 46 kg/d, and 2. 89 ± 0. 54 kg/d for the same three treatments). Calves in the early pair treatment also showed significantly higher average daily gain (ADG) over the experimental period (0. 89 ± 0. 04 kg/d versus 0. 76 ± 0. 04 kg/d and 0. 73 ± 0. 04 kg/d for the early paired, individual and late-paired calves, respectively).

40|$|Subacute ruminal {{acidosis}} (SARA) {{is characterized}} by repeated bouts of low ruminal pH. Cows with SARA often develop complications or other diseases, and associate physiologically with immunosuppression and inflammation. Ruminal free lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases during SARA and translocates into the blood circulation activating an inflammatory response. Ruminal fermentation and cellular immunity are encouraged by supplementing hay with <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> during weaning. SARA calves given a 5 -day repeated administration of a bacteria-based probiotic had stable ruminal pH levels (6. 6 - 6. 8). The repeated administration of probiotics enhance cellular immune function and encourage recovery from diarrhea in pre-weaning calves. Furthermore, the ruminal fermentation could guard against acute and short-term feeding changes, {{and changes in the}} rumen microbial composition of SARA cattle might occur following changes in ruminal pH. The repeated bouts of low ruminal pH in SARA cattle might be associated with depression of cellular immunity...|$|E
40|$|Kelp is {{a common}} feed {{additive}} used on many dairy farms in the United States. However, few data are available supporting the efficacy of its addition to cattle feed. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the taste preferences of calves provided with 0, 30, or 60 g of kelp daily in a sequential elimination experiment. Calves in this study always ranked the control treatment first when given a choice and consumed 34. 5 % more dry matter from the control treatment in the first 3 -d segment of the experiment. During the second feeding segment (d 4 and 5), when the control treatment was removed, daily dry matter consumption was reduced in 4 out of 6 calves compared with control calves when this treatment was available (first feeding segment). However, calves did not differentiate between the 2 amounts of kelp. Results indicated that calves preferred <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> grains without kelp...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated-growth feeding {{programs}} are the newest buzz word in calf rearing. Accelerated programs require a milk replacer containing more crude protein and less fat content than traditional milk replacers. These {{programs are}} generally phase-feeding programs {{that increase the}} amount of milk replacer as the calf advances in age. In addition, changes in the <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> are necessary to achieve optimal performance. These programs increase weight gain during the liquid-feeding period and may positively impact calf health. Changes in the composition and amount of milk replacer used increase the cost of the accelerated program, compared with that of conventional programs. Gains achieved from an accelerated-growth program during the first few weeks of life are quickly lost if aggressive feeding and management programs are not followed through after weaning. Acceleratedgrowth calf programs are part of the total heifer rearing program to improve overall lactation efficiency by reaching optimal growth and age-at-first-breeding targets for dairy operations...|$|E
40|$|Effects of weaning age on plasma VFA were {{examined}} using 16 Holstein heifer calves. Animals entered the study at 6 f 3. 5 d {{of age and}} were fed 1. 8 kg milk twice daily to 28 (early weaning) or 56 d (late weaning) and a commercial pelleted <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> from 0 (early) or 28 (late) d. Blood was sampled once weekly for 14 wk Total blood concentrations of VFA, acetate, propionate, and butyrate were higher in calves weaned early.

40|$|One hundred Holstein heifers {{were used}} {{to examine the effects of}} {{monensin}} (Rumensin®) and lasalocid (Bovatec®) included in <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> and grower diets. Heifers were assigned alternately at birth to a starter feed containing either Rumensin (28 g/ton, 90 % dry matter basis) or Bovatec (40 g/ton, 90 % dry matter basis). The Bovatec group was switched to a starter feed containing 28 g Bovatec/ton (90 % dry matter basis) at 6 weeks of age. Both groups were switched at 8 weeks of age to grower diets designed to deliver 100 mg/head/day of either Rumensin or Bovatec. No treatment differences were observed between birth and 8 weeks of age. Heifers were moved from individual hutches at 8 weeks of age to group pens (five heifers/pen) and remained on the same treatment for the next 84 days. During this 84 -day period, heifers receiving Rumensin gained more weight at a faster rate and tended to be more efficient than heifers fed Bovatec.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} ketoprofen for mitigating pain following dehorning with an electric cautery iron. Forty Holstein heifer calves, 4 to 8 wk of age, were randomized to receive a lidocaine cornual nerve block and either an injection of ketoprofen (3 mg/kg IM) or physiological saline, 10 min prior to dehorning. Cortisol was measured from serum obtained 10 min prior to dehorning and at 3 and 6 h post-dehorning. Calf behavior was video-recorded between 0 to 2, 3 to 5, and 6 to 8 h post-dehorning, and frequency of ear flicks, head shakes, head rubs, lying, standing, feeding, and grooming were recorded. Finally, 24 -h intake of <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> was recorded. There was no effect of treatment on cortisol (P > 0. 1); however, ketoprofen-treated calves displayed less ear-flicks and total head behavior (P < 0. 05), and tended to consume more starter (P = 0. 09) than control calves.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of feeding different <b>calf</b> <b>starter</b> rations, weaning age and their interactions on testicular growth and body weight of Borena Friesian (BF) crossbred bull calves at the age of 105 (closer to weaning) and 202 (nearly 6 months) days. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences (p> 0. 05) in values obtained in testes diameter (TD) and scrotal circumference (SC) at both ages. There was, however, significant (p< 0. 05) and positive correlation between testes measurements and the body weight of bull calves. The result of this study suggests that Borena Friesian crossbred calves can successfully be weaned as early as seven weeks of age, provided that they are supplied with easily digestible solid feeds enough to support the protein and energy requirements of the growing calves. Adequate supply of proper solid feed both at pre and post weaning period, is believed to over come any adverse effect encountered during the pre-weaning period, through compensatory growth effect. Other aspects of rearing future bulls such as the effects of feed and other environmental factors on semen characteristics could be the subject of further study...|$|E
