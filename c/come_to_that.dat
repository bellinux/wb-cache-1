5|$|Themistocles, therefore, {{suggested}} a second strategy to the Greeks: {{the route to}} southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnesus) would require Xerxes' army to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae, which could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians from bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. Congress adopted this dual-pronged strategy. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, should it <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> whilst {{the women and children}} of Athens had been evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

25|$|Collins {{subsequently}} {{stated that}} the strain of the interrogation merely exacerbated increasing doubts that he had already possessed about the moral justification of the IRA's terrorist paramilitary campaign and his actions within it. These doubts had been made worse by the strategic view that he had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> the organization's senior leadership had in the early 1980s quietly decided that the war had failed, and was now slowly manoeuvering the movement away from a military campaign to allow its political wing Sinn Féin to pursue its purposes by another means in {{what would become the}} Northern Ireland peace process. This negated in Collins' mind the justification for its then on-going military actions.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{through their}} privateering activities, which {{apparently}} did not spare neutral powers, the Hollanders had come into conflict with the rich and very influential trade city of Hamburg, which confiscated a fleet of 52 Hollandic ships as a retaliatory measure {{in the autumn of}} 1399. Holland regarded this as a declaration of war, and the situation on the seas this resulted in, brought trade along the North Sea coast virtually to a standstill. In the spring of 1401 Hamburg fitted out a large fleet, apparently to take the war to the coasts of Holland. That it did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> was due to mediation by the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Thorn, and Stralsund, who negotiated a truce, which eventually led to a peace that went into effect in 1403, after arbitration by the Flemish city of Ghent.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire {{among other}} names) {{is a white}} wine grape variety from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means {{it can be used}} to make {{everything}} from sparkling wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine's natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it is also known as Steen. The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia by 1862.|$|E

500|$|Obama's {{selections}} of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial. Warren {{had a history}} of vocal opposition to same-sex marriage, and Lowery had a background as a civil rights activist. Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community. In the invocation, Warren asked for [...] "forgiveness for Americans 'when we fight each other' and 'civility in our attitudes even when we differ.'" [...] Warren mentioned Dr.MartinLuther King and Jesus in the invocation, and he concluded the invocation with the Lord's Prayer. Lowery used humor as he delivered the benediction. One of his messages was the statement that [...] "as we leave this mountaintop, help us {{to hold on to the}} spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family." [...] Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day [...] "when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead man and when white would embrace what is right". Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh decried Lowery's benediction, which quoted from [...] "Lift Every Voice and Sing" [...] (the [...] "Black National Anthem"), as racist, while Democrats disagreed. Another of Lowery's rhymes, [...] "When black will not be asked to get in back", borrowing (along with other lines in his conclusion) from the Big Bill Broonzy song [...] "Black, Brown and White", particularly offended the likes of Limbaugh who felt that Obama's ascension on that day symbolized the fact that America had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> point already.|$|E

One would think that in South Africa there would be no need to press home that truth.

Hanson stated that two of the hairs were consistent with samples taken from Laurie Bembenek's hairbrush. Dr. Samuels refuted that claim, stating in a 1983 letter, quoted in the Toronto Star in 1991, that [...] "I recovered no blonde or red hairs of any length or texture ... ll of the hairs I recovered from the body were brown and were grossly identical to the hair of the victim ... do not like to suggest that evidence was altered in any way, but I can find no logical explanation for what amounted to the mysterious appearance of blonde hair in an envelope that contained no such hair {{at the time it was}} sealed by me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Years later, former Confederate General George H. [...] "Maryland" [...] Stuart would stumble upon General Garnett's {{sword in}} a Baltimore pawn shop.

Another article in the museum's collection is the 19th Virginia's regimental battle flag (restored by the modern day re-enactors of the 19th VA Co B and Co K), captured during Pickett's Charge on July 3. Color bearer Polk Points was wounded in the charge, and gave the banner to an unidentified soldier who carried to the stone wall. Lore has it that this second color bearer was wounded and lying midst a pile of corpse on the east side of the stone wall. Sergeant Benjamin Falls and Corporal Joseph H. De Costro of the 19th Massachusetts saw a corner of a Confederate battle flag beneath a body and went forward as the firing died down to claim the valued prize of an enemy banner. Upon turning over the body they presumed to be a corpse to retrieve the flag, the [...] "corpse" [...] turned out to be the barely alive bearer of the 19th's flag. Falls tried to wrest the flag from the hands of the man, but the wounded Confederate refused to surrender the treasured banner. Falls threatened to run the man through if he did not surrender the flag. Apparently, it did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> and Benjamin Falls and Joseph De Costro of the 19th Massachusetts thus captured the battle flag of the 19th Virginia.
