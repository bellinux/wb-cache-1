5|$|For {{many years}} Harris <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the first woman}} science-fiction writer in the United States.

5|$|In August 1964, as {{a result}} of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, in which U.S. naval vessels <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{attacked}} by North Vietnamese patrol boats, President Johnson ordered retaliatory air strikes (Operation Pierce Arrow) launched against the north.

5|$|When inquired by {{the media}} {{in regard to the}} long periods of shoot, whilst in production, the lead actor {{expressed}} that they were also unaware of how long the film's shoot was going to carry on. Reemma Sen originally signed for forty days whilst Andrea signed for three months, without knowing that the film would eventually take 263 days of filming. Furthermore, Parthiepan <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> signed for forty days, whilst his segment lasted up to 140 days.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row who <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert {{was the son}} of Eata, who was {{descended from}} the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there. Ecgbert has been <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a student of Bede, who much later visited with Ecgbert in 733 at York, but this {{statement}} may simply mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, and not that he was formally taught by him.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Fannin {{had begun}} {{evacuating}} Presidio La Bahía on March 19. The estimated 320 troops were low {{on food and}} water, and the breakdown of a wagon allowed Urrea's men to overtake them at Coleto Creek, ending in Fannin's surrender on March 20. Peter Kerr, who had served with Fannin and <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> held prisoner, arrived at DeWees on March 25. Houston announced Fannin's surrender, but would later claim to have uncovered evidence that Kerr was a spy for the Mexicans.|$|E

5|$|In 1990 Myron entered Dewey into {{a charity}} pet {{photograph}} contest {{as a way}} to promote the library; Dewey won the contest after receiving more than 80% of the votes. Dewey's win was covered in The Des Moines Register, which led to increased local and state publicity in print and on television, and the library never again made an effort to increase Dewey's publicity outside of the local area. An appearance in the June/July 1990 issue of Country magazine took Dewey's story national, after which eleven people <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the person who left Dewey in the book drop {{as a way to}} protect him from the cold.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates who <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 1997 (a {{day after}} Flores' 35th wedding anniversary), in a {{follow-up}} report on Televisa, a handful of women <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sexually abused by Flores approximately twenty years earlier. In a third report on August 17, shortly after the church's most significant holiday, former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing {{him when he was}} a teenager. These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely's anti-cult group, which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be stripped of its legal recognition as a religious organization. Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed.|$|E
5|$|Outside of China, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} texts to mention gunpowder is Roger Bacon's Opus Majus (1267) and Opus Tertium in what has been interpreted as a reference to firecrackers. In the early 20th century, a British artillery officer proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae, also known as Opus Minor, dated to 1247, contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. These claims have been disputed by science historians. The formula itself, <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hidden within the text through encryption, is not useful for firearm or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.|$|E
5|$|She's Done it Again is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{written by}} Lloyd Lonergan and {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York.

The film was the third release of the Thanhouser company and featured the leading players, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. The film was met with positive reviews, but is presumed to be lost.|$|E
