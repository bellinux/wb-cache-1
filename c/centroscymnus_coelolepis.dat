The effect on plasma CGRP-levels of daily gavage with siki hydrolysate containing CGRP-like molecules was further studied in male Wistar rats. The plasma CGRP-levels in rats force fed with the siki hydrolysate were significantly higher than those of the control group. The siki hydrolysate included immunoreactive-CGRP molecules which resisted simulated protein digestion. They were able to cross the intestinal barrier intact and could be responsible for the increase in plasma CGRP levels.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} Spanish deep-sea fishery performed in international waters on the Hatton Bank and proximities (NE Atlantic) {{during the period}} 1996 - 2000. This is a multi-species fishery, carried out by stern bottom trawlers, mainly between June and September, in depths mainly between 800 m to 1600 m. The importance of the fishing activity {{in this area is}} increasing notably. This fishery has been monitored since the beginning in 1996, with the collaboration of the fishing industry, by means of a scientific observer programme. The observers on board provide data on catches, discards, location and depth, haul by haul. Length samples of the main species and biological material are also collected. The species composition of the catches is presented. In terms of weight, the roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the bairdii smoothhead (Alepocephalus bairdi i) are the most important species in the catches.

40|$|Aspects of {{the biology}} of three {{exploited}} sharks (Elasmobranchii: Squalidae) from the continental slopes of the Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank (NE Atlantic) were examined using specimens taken during trawl and long-line surveys (December 1995 to December 1999) and commercial samples obtained from trawlers (March 1997 to June 1998). The species under study were <b>Centroscymnus</b> <b>coelolepis,</b> Centrophorus squamosus, and Deania calceus. The entire depth range (300 m – 1, 800 m) of each species was sampled. C. squamosus and D. calceus were abundant between 700 m and 900 m. C. coelolepis was more abundant deeper (1, 300 m) but gravid females were more abundant in shallower waters. Small specimens of each species were absent from the study area. Trawls and long-lines selected for different size ranges of C. coelolepis and D. calceus, though not C. squamosus. Deepwater bobbin and French high headline trawls did not select for different size ranges of C. coelolepis. Unlike the other species D. calceus is not landed. Discard rates from long-liners exceeded 40 % of total catch depending on depth fished. While percentage discard rates from trawlers were lower, an estimated 745 t of this species were discarded in 1996 alone. Sexual maturity was achieved at large size, more than 75 % of maximum length in each species. No evidence of seasonal cycles in reproduction was found from spermatogenic analysis or the occurrence of maturity stages. Mean ovarian fecundity was low; C. squamosus, 8, C. coelolepis and D. calceus 13. Dorsal spine sections were used for age estimation. Significant positive regressions of spine width and total length were found and the growth rates of first and second spines were not significantly different. Estimates of 21 - 70 years (C. squamosus) and 11 - 35 years (D. calceus) were obtained. Agreement within 1 year was found for more than 93 % of D. calceus and 88 % of C. squamosus first and second spines. Empirical and von Bertalanffy growth data suggest that growth had slowed down or ceased {{before the onset of}} maturity. Estimates of natural mortality (M) for C. squamosus (0. 066 – 0. 087) and D. calceus (0. 116 - 0. 177) were low. Fishing mortality (F) for D. calceus was estimated to have reached the level of M for females but below M for males. This study suggests that these species have conservative life-history strategies. No management plan currently exists for the multi-species deepwater fishery in the northeast Atlantic. In the absence of suitable abundance indices, stock assessment should be based on known life history parameters of target and by-catch species. Such an approach will facilitate the rational management of the fishery. Correspondance à: Maurice Clarke, Marine Institute, Abbotstown, Dublin 15, République d’Irlande.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between catches from deepwater trawl and longline surveys (1993 – 2000) in the Northeast Atlantic. Longline catches {{were dominated by}} elasmobranchs, particularly squalid sharks and species numbers were low. Trawl catches had higher species numbers, with more teleosts, though elasmobranchs were still an important component. Species composition of the catch was depth dependent. Comparative trawl and longline surveys of the eastern and southern slopes of the Rockall Trough (west and north of Ireland) were used to examine size-selectivity. Trawls and longlines selected for significantly different size frequency distributions of <b>Centroscymnus</b> <b>coelolepis</b> and Deania calceus, though not for Centrophorus squamosus. These data highlight some important aspects of behavior of the species studying relation to fishing gears. Smaller C. coelolepis were selected by longlines than trawls, suggesting that smaller sharks were present at a considerable height above the seabed, {{out of reach of}} trawls, but attracted to baited hooks. In the case of D. calceus, larger females were selected by hooks, but were not present in trawl catches, possibly indicating their ability to escape towed gears. Trawl selectivity ogives were constructed for D. calceus and ogives for C. coelolepis and C. squamosus were simulated, using available data. Results suggest that longlines are not as selective for C. coelolepis as trawls. Selectivity ogives for D. calceus were similar in form, but longlines selected bigger individuals. Life history studies suggest that these species cannot sustain high fishing pressures. The implications of these results for the management of fisheries taking elasmobranchs are discussed...|$|E

ISOBAY 13, 11 - 13 April 2012, Santander, SpainThe {{aim of the}} INDEMARES Project is {{to obtain}} {{information}} to identify valuable areas for the Natura 2000 network in the Spanish sea. One of these potential marine protected areas is the Galicia Bank, a large seamount located at 150 miles far from {{the west coast of}} Galician coast. This deep seamount have a flat summit with slight slopes from 600 m to the bank break around 1000 m. Deeper 1500 m, slope increases sharply until it reaches the abyssal platform, at 5000 m deep. During the summers of the 2010 and 2011, 20 hauls were performed in the Galicia Bank with a GOC 73 otter trawl (20 mm mesh size). A total of 94 fish species were identified and two main fish assemblages were observed. One of them seemed {{to be associated with the}} Mediterranean Outflow Waters (MOW), and it was found up to 1, 025 m depth. The main species (in biomass) were Hoplostethus mediterraneus, Alepocephalus bairdii, Mora moro and Scymnodon ringens.

40|$|Deep-water sharks exhibit species-specific {{reproductive}} strategies, {{which include}} segregation by sex, size and reproductive stage. However, {{due to the}} wide spatial distribution of most species, available information, usually collected at a regional scale, is usually not adequate to infer species reproductive spatial dynamics. This study draws together information {{on the distribution of}} reproductive stages of three species of squaliform sharks: Portuguese dogfish <b>Centroscymnus</b> <b>coelolepis</b> (Somniosidae), leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (Centrophoridae) and birdbeak dogfish Deania calcea (Centrophoridae), gathering data from several geographical areas from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. For each species we analysed the sex ratio and the spatial patterns of reproductive stages within regions, considering the influence of geographical area, depth, season, temperature and salinity. The combination of statistical methods used in this study successfully identified a number of life history patterns which reflect different use of habitats by sex and life cycle stage. Pregnant females of the three species are spatially segregated, inhabiting shallower and/or warmer waters. In the case of the leafscale gulper shark this segregation might be associated with large scale migrations. In contrast, in Portuguese dogfish all adult maturity stages occur in the same geographical area. Pregnant female birdbeak dogfish were rare in all samples. Larger immature specimens of all the three species distribute deeper than the remaining maturity stages in most of the regions analysed. Mature males of leafscale gulper shark and birdbeak dogfish were more broadly distributed than mature females, supporting the possibility of sex-biased dispersal. Neonates and small sized specimens were scarce in the Northeast Atlantic potentially explained by their concentration in nurseries, and/or by gear selectivity. Management measures will benefit from considering the geographic scale of demographic variation between species. However, standardized collaborative approaches will be needed for comprehensive assessment. Publicado...|$|E
40|$|Portuguese {{commercial}} Elasmobranch landings were {{analysed for}} the period 1986 – 2009 and revealed that some species may be in danger of overfishing. Landings totalled 122, 515 mt, {{with an average of}} 5, 105 mt landed yearly, with captured sharks, skates and rays representing 8 orders, 14 families and 44 species. Annual landings for the fishery generally decreased over time, with a corresponding increase in price per kilogram. The most landed group, skates (Raja sp.), accounted for 33 % of the landings, or 40, 344 mt. They were followed by lesser spotted catsharks (Scyliorhinus sp.), Portuguese dogfish (<b>Centroscymnus</b> <b>coelolepis),</b> leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus), blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and gulper sharks (Centrophorus granulosus) (accounting for 12 %, 11 %, 10 %, 9 % and 8 % of the landings, respectively). In the absence of CPUE data, comparative trends of landings and price over time were used as an indicator of the status of specific Elasmobranch species. Centrophorus granulosus, smoothounds (Mustelus sp.), torpedo rays (Torpedo sp.), requiem sharks (Carcharhinus sp.) and angel sharks (Squatina sp.) displayed indications of possible over-exploitation, with significantly decreasing landings and increasing prices over time, and merit the focus of future research. The pattern shown by fishing effort over time (i. e. number of fishing vessels over time) displayed a marked decrease, although this was substantially less than the decrease shown by landings of the species mentioned earlier. It is therefore unlikely that such a decrease in landings is justified solely by a decrease in number of fishing vessels. Similarly, the increase in price shown for all species was largely superior to the increase in inflation, which would suggest that the increase in inflation alone would not account for the increase in price. All results and data corroborate the notion that some species are, in fact, over-exploited and in need of immediate management and conservation measurements. These findings were substantiated by min/max auto-correlation factor analysis (MAFA), which shows that the most important trend is that of a decrease in landings of those species where overfishing in indicated.

40|$|Data {{collected}} during the DESEAS survey carried out in three areas of the Mediterranean Sea (Balearic Sea, western and eastern Ionian Sea) were {{used to describe the}} structure and spatial distribution of the fish assemblages at depths between 600 and 4000 m. A total of 55 species (8 chondrichthyes and 47 teleost fish) were sampled, 38 of them in the Balearic Sea, 30 in the western Ionian and 37 in the eastern Ionian. Multivariate analysis showed a clear pattern of zonation with depth and geographic area. Three main assemblages were identified across the vertical gradient investigated: on the upper slope around a depth of 600 m, on the middle slope between 800 and 1300 m, and on the lower slope below 1300 m. The geographic characterisation of the ichthyofauna structure was mainly observed on the upper and middle slope. The highest abundance and biomass values were found at depths of 1000 - 1200 m due to the presence of larger species with high energy requirements, such as Alepocephalus rostratus, Mora moro and Galeus melastomus. On the middle slope, significant differences in the abundance, biomass and mean fish weight were detected between the three areas. Significant differences for these parameters were also shown between the middle and lower slope assemblages. A significant decrease in species richness and diversity was shown with increasing depth, indicating an impoverishment of the megafauna with depth and a higher similarity between the Balearic Sea and the Ionian Sea with regard to the greatest depths. The dominant species on the deepest bottoms were Bathypterois mediterraneus, Chalinura mediterranea and Coryphaenoides guentheri. On the lower slope, the shark <b>Centroscymnus</b> <b>coelolepis</b> was also found to be relatively abundant off the Balearic Islands, Etmopterus spinax in the eastern Ionian Sea and the teleost fish Cataetyx laticeps throughout the three study areas.

40|$|Short-term {{temporal}} {{variability in}} deep-sea demersal fish assemblages is described for two slope areas characterised by different oceanographic conditions, which are situated north (Balearic sub-basin, BsB) and south (Algerian sub-basin, AsB) of the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean). A total of 75 hauls were analysed from six bottom trawl surveys {{carried out in}} the two sub-basins. At BsB, surveys were designed for sampling different slope habitats during April 1991, December 1991, March 1992 and July 1992 : (i) a submarine canyon at a depth of around 450 m, (ii) the upper slope at a depth of 600 - 650 m, and (iii) the middle slope at a depth of around 1200 m. At AsB, surveys were carried out during October 1996 and May 1998, along a continuous transect on the upper, middle and lower slope. The taxonomic composition, ecological parameters (number of species, abundance and biomass) and biomass spectra of the assemblages, as well as the length frequency distribution of the main species, were compared for different seasons and bathymetric ranges. Forty-four demersal species were captured in BsB and 38 in AsB. Helicolenus dactylopterus and Trachyrinchus scabrus were more abundant in BsB, and Hoplostethus mediterraneus, Galeus melastomus and <b>Centroscymnus</b> <b>coelolepis</b> in AsB. Depth was the determinant factor in all the analyses. Species-specific densities (abundance and biomass) showed significant differences between surveys, depth strata and their interaction in BsB. However, survey and its interaction with depth, were not significant in AsB. We also found significant differences in relation to depth and season for the three ecological parameters tested in BsB, but only significant differences in relation to depth in AsB. Biomass spectra showed large differences in relation to depth but only slight between-survey differences, which mainly occurred in the upper slope. The length frequency distributions of single species presented short-term temporal variations, mainly due to the varying presence of a larger proportion of small or large individuals. Depth, geographic area and sampling time were the main factors determining the species composition and structure of deep-sea slope demersal fish assemblages. The effects of short-term temporal variations were observed in both the replacement and the size structure of some dominant and subdominant species throughout the year. The different temporal variation effects observed between the two sub-basins might be related to differences in productivity and its transport to the benthos. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

C. coelolepis population structure was studied using 11 nuclear microsatellite markers and a 497 -bp fragment from the mtDNA control region. High levels of genetic homogeneity across the Atlantic (Φ = - 0. 0091, F = 0. 0024, P > 0. 05) were found suggesting one large population unit at this basin. The {{low levels of}} genetic divergence between Atlantic and Australia (Φ = 0. 0744, P 0. 05) further suggested that this species {{may be able to}} maintain some degree of genetic connectivity even across ocean basins. In contrast, sharks from the Mediterranean Sea exhibited marked genetic differentiation from all other localities studied (Φ = 0. 3808, F = 0. 1149, P < 0. 001). This finding suggests that the shallow depth of the Strait of Gibraltar acts as a barrier to dispersal and that isolation and genetic drift may have had an important role shaping the Mediterranean shark population over time. Analyses of life history traits allowed the direct comparison among regions providing a complete characterization of this shark's populations. Sharks from the Mediterranean had markedly smaller adult body size and size at maturity compared to Atlantic and Pacific individuals. Together, these results suggest the existence of an isolated and unique population of C. coelolepis inhabiting the Mediterranean that most likely became separated from the Atlantic in the late PleistoceneThis study was performed under the framework of ReDEco (FP 6 ERA-NET, MARIN-ERA/MAR/ 0003 / 2008) and Hermione (FP 7 -ENV- 2008 - 1, nr 226354) projects.
