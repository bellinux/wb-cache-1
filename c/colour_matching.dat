5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Different {{camouflage}} methods {{employed by}} terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic animals, and in military usage, are compared in the table. Several methods are often combined, so {{for example the}} Bushbuck is both countershaded over its whole body, and disruptively coloured with small pale spots. Until the discovery of countershading in the 1890s, protective coloration {{was considered to be}} mainly a matter of <b>colour</b> <b>matching,</b> but while this is certainly important, a variety of other methods are used to provide effective camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{appliances}} and uses for gas developed over the years. Gas fires, gas cookers, refrigerators, washing machines, hand irons, pokers for lighting coal fires, gas-heated baths, remotely controlled clusters of gas lights, gas engines of various types and, in later years, gas warm air and hot water central heating and air conditioning, all of which made immense contributions to {{the improvement of the}} quality of life in cities and towns worldwide. The evolution of electric lighting made available from public supply extinguished the gas light, except where <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> was practised as in haberdashery shops.|$|E
25|$|The John Conolly Wing {{was built}} on the Asylum playing fields, {{removing}} the opportunities for patients and staff to play football or cricket. A two story building, it was designed as two East and West halves under another blue roof, a <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> exactly that of the Maternity unit. A hanging corridor was built from the first floor into the general hospital entrance, but with the general hospital gaining trust status and general hospital patients (and some staff) not keen on having psychiatric patients in the shop areas of the general hospital, this corridor was closed off and is now only used for fire evacuation reasons which admittedly was always its primary design purpose.|$|E

500|$|Countershading is {{observed}} {{in a wide range}} of animal groups, both terrestrial, such as deer, and marine, such as sharks. It is the basis of camouflage in both predators and prey. It is used alongside other forms of camouflage including <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> and disruptive coloration. Among predatory fish, the gray snapper, Lutianus griseus, is effectively flattened by its countershading, while it hunts an [...] "almost invisible" [...] prey, the hardhead fish, Atherina laticeps which swims over greyish sands. Other countershaded marine animals include blue shark, herring, and dolphin; while fish like the mackerel and sergeant fish are both countershaded and patterned with stripes or spots.|$|E
500|$|Hugh Cott's 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals {{introduced}} ideas such as [...] "maximum disruptive contrast". This uses {{streaks of}} boldly contrasting colour, which paradoxically make animals or military vehicles less visible by breaking up their outlines. Cott explains that in ideal conditions, background <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> together with countershading would [...] "suffice to render an animal absolutely invisible against a plain background", but at once adds that conditions are hardly ever ideal, {{as they are}} constantly changing, as is the light. Therefore, Cott argues, camouflage has {{to break up the}} perceived continuous surfaces of an object and its outlines. In Cott's own words, [...] "for effective concealment, it is essential that the tell-tale appearance of form should be destroyed." [...] Cott draws an analogy with a pickpocket who carefully distracts your attention, arguing that: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} performance of three posterior composites and two amalgams was evaluated over 3 years. Three hundred and nine composites and 200 amalgams were reviewed at the 3 -year recall. The following parameters were assessed: fractures, gingival condition, interproximal contacts, marginal adaptation, staining and <b>colour</b> <b>match.</b> Although {{there was no}} significant difference in the overall failure rate between the two types of material, there was a significantly higher incidence of fracture in the amalgam restorations. The amalgam failures were exclusively mechanical, whereas those affecting composites also included failures that were more biological in nature. A significantly higher proportion of the Class II composites failed to achieve an adequate approximal contact, but this was not reflected in a more adverse gingival response. <b>Colour</b> <b>match,</b> surface and marginal stain varied significantly within the composite group and appeared to be material-related. Overall, the materials Occlusion and P- 30 were considered to be performing adequately. The clinical handling, <b>colour</b> <b>match</b> and radiopacity of Clearfil Posterior were considered to be unsatisfactory...|$|R

The 160Z also had front and rear spoilers; however, the front spoiler differed from the 140Z. Earlier models included a black rubber rear spoiler, whilst others had a <b>colour</b> <b>matched</b> yellow fibreglass rear spoiler - there is speculation as to whether Datsun-Nissan South Africa could no longer procure rubber spoilers or whether they felt the fibreglass spoiler was lighter and more durable than the rubber one.|$|R
