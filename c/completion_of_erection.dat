40|$|Modern {{intensive}} {{development of}} precast-cast-in-place construction {{has led to}} creation {{of a wide range}} of various constructive systems of buildings during the last 100 years. They allow constructing buildings with best account of the requirements of functionality, architectural expressiveness, production possibilities of construction companies, etc. However in spite of this development both precast and cast-in-place housing construction has its peculiarities, positive and negative ones. The constructive systems of precast monolithic buildings existing at the moment are based on the required mutual deformation of prefabricated reinforced and cast iron reinforced concrete at the stage of a building construction and at the stage of its use as well. Having refused from this rule, the authors of this article have introduced a constructive system of a precast monolithic building able to bear loads, developing at the stage <b>of</b> <b>erection</b> (due to <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> a precast frame) and at the stage of use (due to <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> a precast monolithic frame). The offered construction of a precast monolithic building frame allows efficiently using the advantages of precast and cast-in-place construction minimizing their disadvantages and it also fully corresponds to the obligatory requirements to buildings.
