Optical interconnercts have gained attention recently as a promising solution offering high throughput,low latency and reduced energy cosumption compared to <b>current</b> <b>networks</b> based in commidity switches. This paper presents a novel architecture for data center networks based on optical OFDM using Wavelength Selective Swithces(WSS). The OFDM-based solution provides high throughput,reduced latency and fine grain bandwidth allocation.

It provides crisis intervention, affordable rental housing, and gives each family a grace period of {{six months to a year}} of social service to allow the family to get back on their feet. [...] The effectiveness of this concept is that it assists homeless families in identifying their needs and recognizing the choices they must make. From this point families can create better options for them and plan strategies for living on their own.|$|E
