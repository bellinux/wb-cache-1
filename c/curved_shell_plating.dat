The proposed method {{consists of two}} parts: method for shape measurement of edges by using points of side faces of the components and method for length measurement of edges by attaching the 3 D targets. At the experiments with a surface <b>plate</b> and a <b>curved</b> <b>shell</b> <b>plate,</b> the results give suggestions for having possibility of applying this proposed method for actual shipbuilding components...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{survive in}} the current {{shipbuilding}} industry, it is of vital importance for shipyards to have the ship components’ accuracy evaluated efficiently {{during most of the}} manufacturing steps. Evaluating components’ accuracy by comparing each component’s point cloud data scanned by laser scanners and the ship’s design data formatted in CAD cannot be processed efficiently when (1) extract components from point cloud data include irregular obstacles endogenously, or when (2) registration of the two data sets have no clear direction setting. This paper presents reformative point cloud data processing methods to solve these problems. K-d tree construction of the point cloud data fastens a neighbor searching of each point. Region growing method performed on the neighbor points of the seed point extracts the continuous part of the component, while curved surface fitting and B-spline curved line fitting {{at the edge of the}} continuous part recognize the neighbor domains of the same component divided by obstacles’ shadows. The ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm conducts a registration of the two sets of data after the proper registration’s direction is decided by principal component analysis. By experiments conducted at the shipyard, 200 <b>curved</b> <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> are extracted from the scanned point cloud data, and registrations are conducted between them and the designed CAD data using the proposed methods for an accuracy evaluation. Results show that the methods proposed in this paper support the accuracy evaluation targeted point cloud data processing efficiently in practice...|$|R

50|$|Chitons have a shell {{composed}} of eight separate <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> or valves. These plates overlap slightly {{at the front}} and back edges, and yet articulate well with one another. Because of this, the shell provides protection {{at the same time as}} permitting the chiton to flex upward when needed for locomotion over uneven surfaces, and even allows the animal to curl up into a ball when dislodged from rocks. The <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> are encircled by a skirt known as a girdle.|$|R
40|$|By {{evolving}} bilaterally separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates,</b> bivalves {{acquired a}} unique body plan {{in which their}} soft tissues are completely protected by hard <b>shell</b> <b>plates.</b> In this unique body plan, mobility between the separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> is provided by novel structures such as a ligament and adductor muscles. As a first step towards understanding how the bivalve body plan was established, we investigated {{the development of the}} separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> and ligament. Over 100 years ago, it was hypothesized that the development of separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> is tightly linked with the unique cell cleavage (division) pattern of bivalves during development, wherein each bilateral daughter cell of the 2 d descendant 2 d 1121 develops into one of the bilateral shell fields. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by tracing the cell lineages of the Japanese purple mussel Septifer virgatus. Although the shell fields were found to be exclusively derived from the bilateral descendant cells of 2 d: 2 d 11211 and 2 d 11212, the descendants of these cells were not restricted to shell fields alone, nor were they confined to the left or right side of the shell field based on their lineage. Our study demonstrated that ligament cells are also derived from 2 d 11211 and 2 d 11212, indicating that the ligament cells emerged as a subpopulation of shell field cells. This also suggests that the establishment of the novel developmental system for the ligament cells was critical for the evolution of the unique body plan of bivalves...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{operculum}} {{is a novel}} {{structure in}} gastropod molluscs. Because the operculum shows notable similarities to the <b>shell</b> <b>plate,</b> we asked whether there were an evolutionary link between these two secretory organs. We found {{that some of the}} genes involved in shell-field development are expressed in the operculum, such as dpp and grainyhead, whereas engrailed and Hox 1 are not. Specific knockdown of dpp by injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) resulted in malformation of the <b>shell</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> was smaller due to failure of activation of cell proliferation in the shell-field margin. The expressions of grainyhead and chitin synthase 1 in the shell field margin were suppressed by dpp-dsRNA. However, matrix secretion was not completely abolished, and the expressions of ferritin, engrailed or Hox 1 were not affected by dpp-dsRNA, indicating that dpp is partly involved in the developmental pathway for shell matrix secretion. We also present evidence that dpp performs a key role in operculum development. Indeed, dpp-dsRNA impaired matrix secretion in the operculum as well as expression of grainyhead. Based on these observations that dpp is important for development of both the <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> and operculum, we conclude that co-option of dpp to the posterior part of the foot contributed to the innovation of the operculum in gastropods...|$|R

50|$|Most land slugs have, {{within the}} mantle, the {{remnants}} or residue of what was, in the evolutionary past, a larger external shell. In most slugs, this remnant {{takes the form}} either of a small internal shell (a thin shelly plate), or a collection of calcareous (chalky) granules. In this species there is an internal <b>shell</b> or <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> which resembles that found in land slugs of the genus Limax. In other words, the <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> in this species is oval in shape, solid, and chalky, with a transparent conchiolin (horny) base. The <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> is usually somewhat convex above and concave beneath, with a few indistinct concentric lines of growth, and is covered outwardly with a very thin transparent periostracum (a protein layer), and with the nucleus (the oldest growth part) situated near the front. In young Kerry slugs the shell is very thin and convex, abruptly cut off behind, and with an extremely thin layer that projects in front and contains minute granules.|$|R
5000|$|Short and stubby icebreakers are {{generally}} built using transverse framing {{in which the}} <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> is stiffened with frames placed about 400 to 1000 mm apart as opposed to longitudinal framing used in longer ships. Near the waterline, the frames running in vertical direction distribute the local ice loads on the <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> to longitudinal girders called stringers, which in turn are supported by web frames and bulkheads that carry the global hull loads. While the <b>shell</b> <b>plating,</b> which is {{in direct contact with}} the ice, can be up to 50 mm thick in older polar icebreakers, the use of high strength steel with yield strength up to [...] in modern icebreakers results in the same structural strength with smaller material thicknesses and lower steel weight. Regardless of the strength, the steel used in the hull structures of an icebreaker must be capable of resisting brittle fracture in low ambient temperatures and high loading conditions, both of which are typical for operations in ice-filled waters.|$|R
40|$|Although {{bivalves}} develop through spiral cleavage patterns, {{similar to}} other lophotrochozoans, the cleavage pattern of D lineage blastomeres is unique, since 2 d shows four rounds of stereotypic unequal cleavage before bilateral cleavage of the largest derivative of 2 d: 2 d 1121. This unique modification of spiral cleavage is directly associated with the characteristic morphology of bivalves, namely, bilaterally separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates,</b> because the bilateral <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> {{are thought to be}} derived from the bilateral derivatives of 2 d 1121. In this report, to determine whether the unique cleavage pattern of bivalves is regulated depending on the interaction with other cells or by cell autonomous mechanisms, we performed cell isolation experiments and observed subsequent cleavage patterns of isolated blastomeres. When focusing on the largest derivatives of D blastomeres, 8 % of isolated D blastomeres followed the cleavage pattern of normal development up to bilateral cleavage. Importantly, the remainder of the partial embryos ended cleavage before that stage, and none of the isolated blastomeres showed abnormal cleavage patterns. We also examined the development of isolated blastomeres and found that isolated D blastomeres could develop <b>shell</b> <b>plates,</b> whereas larvae developed from AB blastomeres never had <b>shell</b> <b>plates.</b> Based on these observations, we concluded that D blastomeres control their unique cleavage pattern through intrinsic mechanisms and develop shell glands autonomously without any cell–cell interaction with other lineages...|$|R

40|$|Modelling the vibro-acoustic {{properties}} of mechanical built-up structures is a challenging task. Commonly employed techniques, such as finite element methods, are robust {{only in the}} low frequency regime. Recently, Discrete Flow Mapping has been forwarded as a cost efficient alternative method for mid- to high-frequency vibro-acoustic modelling. Discrete Flow Mapping employs local ray tracing approximations, providing a good model of the ray dynamics in homogeneous, isotropic flat <b>plates</b> or on <b>curved</b> <b>shells</b> in the geodesic high-frequency limit. However, in the mid-frequency case when the wavelength approaches the shell’s local radius of curvature, the resulting ray dynamics depend on the curvature in a non-trivial way. In this work, we consider ray-tracing approaches for modelling vibrational energy transport in <b>curved</b> <b>shells</b> of variable thickness at mid-to-high frequencies. In particular, we analyse mid-frequency effects on the dispersion <b>curves</b> for <b>curved</b> <b>shells</b> of variable thickness, and identify novel reflection/transmission behaviour...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of a European Research Project, semi-prefabricated solutions for short and medium span shell roofs were developed by several European institutions and private companies. The main aim of the research was finding an industrialized solution for the construction of <b>curved</b> masonry <b>shells,</b> inspired by those designed by the well-known Uruguayan architect and engineer Eladio Dieste, and to prove their structural reliability. As part of the research, several tests on basic materials and small assemblages were carried out at the University of Padova to obtain specific material properties and to reduce uncertainties in resistance models. A full size model of a thin <b>curved</b> <b>shell,</b> with eight metres span, was built and tested in order to evaluate the ultimate resistance. The experimental results allowed calibrating non linear finite element models, in order to reproduce the structural behaviour of the developed construction system. A macro modelling strategy, implementing inelastic isotropic material laws and resorting on layered <b>curved</b> <b>shell</b> finite elements, was adopted. Parametric analyses on small assemblages and on <b>curved</b> <b>shells</b> were performed. The effects of variation of strength of materials, size and location of reinforcements and boundary conditions within plausible discrete ranges were investigated. Results allow some conclusions to be drawn about the influence of these parameters on the ultimate resistance of small assemblages and <b>curved</b> <b>shells.</b> In the present contribution, the results of the finite element analyses carried out are discussed...|$|R
