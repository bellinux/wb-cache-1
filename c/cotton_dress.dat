500|$|Around this time, Dickinson's {{behavior}} {{began to}} change. She {{did not leave}} the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors {{from the other side}} of a door rather than speaking to them face to face. She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white <b>cotton</b> <b>dress,</b> possibly sewn circa 1878–1882. Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person. Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders. Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers. Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that [...] "Aunt Emily stood for indulgence." [...] MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called [...] "A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson", thought of her as always offering support to the neighborhood children.|$|E
2500|$|Roller printing, {{also called}} {{cylinder}} printing or machine printing, on fabrics is a textile printing process patented by Thomas Bell of Scotland in 1783 {{in an attempt}} to reduce the cost of the earlier copperplate printing. [...] This method was used in Lancashire fabric mills to produce <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> fabrics from the 1790s, most often reproducing small monochrome patterns characterized by striped motifs and tiny dotted patterns called [...] "machine grounds".|$|E

2500|$|On June 18, 2011, Marilyn Monroe's [...] "subway dress", whose skirt {{is raised}} by the updraft of a passing subway train in The Seven Year Itch, sold for $4.6million, far in excess of pre-auction {{estimates}} of $1–2million. Another Monroe dress, worn in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, fetched $1.2 million; it had been expected to go for $200,000 to $300,000. Estimated at $60,000 to $80,000, a blue <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> Judy Garland used in test shots for The Wizard of Oz went for $910,000. In total, the auction grossed $22.8 million.|$|E

60|$|Her light <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> {{was visible}} to Tim {{lounging}} in the arbor {{of the opposite}} corner, though he was hidden from her.

This done, she stepped back and surveyed her work as an artist might study a picture.|$|R

60|$|But {{the most}} forlorn {{creature}} out {{that day was}} a small errand girl, with a bonnet-box on each arm, and both hands struggling to hold a big broken umbrella. A pair of worn-out boots let in the wet upon her tired feet; a thin <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> and an old shawl poorly protected her from the storm; and a faded hood covered her head.|$|E
60|$|Then the fire-raising began. A blue spark {{flew out}} of a wash-stand, into Mrs. Shchapoff's bedroom. Luckily she was absent, and her mother, rushing forward with a water-jug, {{extinguished}} a flaming <b>cotton</b> <b>dress.</b> Bright red globular meteors now danced in the veranda. Mr. Portnoff next takes up the tale as follows, Mr. Shchapoff having been absent from home on the occasion described.|$|E
60|$|I felt {{convinced}} {{from that}} parting look {{that she had}} understood me, that my words had in some sort given her relief; for, strong as was her faith in the supernatural, she appeared as ready to escape from it, when a way of escape offered, as from the limp cotton gown and constrained manner worn in the house. The religion and <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> were evidently remains of her early training at the settlement of Voa.|$|E

5000|$|New {{technical}} resources {{brought by the}} Spanish inspired the typical <b>cotton</b> <b>dresses,</b> the ones called ao poi, made with a fine thread, and the povyi, a little wider thread weaving, as well as linen, and the beautiful ñanduti, which means [...] "spider web" [...] in Guaraní language and consists of fine embroidery, with which table clothes, curtains, blouses and more are made.|$|R
5|$|When the College {{first opened}} in 1888 {{there was no}} uniform, instead the girls wore long <b>cotton</b> <b>dresses,</b> gloves and hat.

During this time Prefects wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} to be attired as befits your rank and beauty." [...] And {{immediately}} the Princess's <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> became a magnificent robe of silver brocade embroidered with carbuncles, and her soft dark hair was encircled by a crown of diamonds, from which floated a clear white veil. With her bright eyes, and the charming color in her cheeks, she was altogether such a dazzling sight that the Prince could hardly bear it.|$|E
6000|$|Scarcely had {{the train}} dashed up before Mrs. Ponsonby {{was startled by}} a shout of 'He's there himself! Louis!

Louis let go the reins to catch hold of both hands, and cry, 'Well, old Giraffe! {{what have you done}} with Jem?' ...|$|E
60|$|She wore a dirty apron, and {{the sleeves}} of her <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> were turned up above her elbows; she had curling pins in her hair. Mrs. Athelny was a large woman, a good three inches taller than her husband, fair, with blue eyes and a kindly expression; {{she had been a}} {{handsome}} creature, but advancing years and the bearing of many children had made her fat and blousy; her blue eyes had become pale, her skin was coarse and red, the colour had gone out of her hair. She straightened herself, wiped her hand on her apron, and held it out.|$|E

60|$|When {{they had}} entered, and Stephen had dutifully and warmly greeted his mother--who {{appeared}} in a <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> of a dark-blue ground, covered broadcast with a multitude of new and full moons, stars, and planets, with an occasional dash of a comet-like aspect to diversify the scene--the crackle of cart-wheels was heard outside, and Martin Cannister stamped in at the doorway, {{in the form of}} a pair of legs beneath a great box, his body being nowhere visible. When the luggage had been all taken down, and Stephen had gone upstairs to change his clothes, Mrs. Smith's mind seemed to recover a lost thread.|$|E
60|$|He {{was soon}} among the slave huts. No one was about, the women being mostly {{up at the}} fire with the men. He looked in {{at the door of}} each hut he passed. As he was still without shoes his {{movements}} were noiseless. In a few of them women were cooking, or putting their children to bed. At the last hut of the first row which he visited an old negro woman was rocking herself in great grief, and two or three children were playing on the floor. Nat knew that he had {{come to the end of}} his search, by the blue <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> with large white spots that the woman wore. He went in and touched her.|$|E
60|$|Here {{again we}} struck {{a sea of}} reeds in which, after casting about, Hans once more found the spoor of the Amahagger. That it was theirs beyond doubt was proved by the {{circumstance}} that on a thorny kind of weed we found a fragment of a <b>cotton</b> <b>dress</b> which, because of the pattern stamped on it, we all recognised as one that Inez had been wearing. At first I thought that this had been torn off by the thorns, but on examination we became certain {{that it had been}} placed there purposely, probably by Janee, to give us a clue. This conclusion was confirmed when at subsequent periods of the hunt we found other fragments of the same garment.|$|E

50|$|Although {{young people}} wear Western style clothing, {{traditional}} clothing is still common among adults. While in town, a Comorian man will typically wear a white cotton garment and a knee-length shirt, sometimes {{with a white}} jacket and white skull cap. Out of town, a long cloth sarong (colorful skirt) is worn. Most women wear long, colorful <b>cotton</b> <b>dresses</b> with bright shawls as face coverings. Others prefer black robes that cover their heads.|$|R
