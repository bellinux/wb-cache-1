40|$|Background of the Study: Ability to {{cope with}} {{pressure}} and anxiety to increase performance {{is an integral part}} of sports. There is considerable evidence in support of the relationship between anxiety and coping strategies and performance of athletes. Coping strategies can be divided into <b>cognitive,</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>and</b> negative. <b>Cognitive</b> coping strategies are imagery, thought stopping, focus in the present, think practice, worst-case scenario, keep active, positive self-talk, simulation <b>and</b> goal-setting. Whereas <b>somatic</b> coping strategies, which include in the present research are progressive relaxation, meditation, breath control, autogenic training and biofeedback. Athletes also found using negative coping strategies like drugs, alcohol and smoking. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usage of <b>cognitive,</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>and</b> negative coping strategies according to gender. Besides that, the present study also finds the correlations between coping strategies and sport performance. Study Design: Comparative descriptive study design was used to compare <b>Cognitive,</b> <b>Somatic</b> <b>and</b> Negative Coping Strategies among athletes. Place and Duration of Study: Sample: The sample consisted of 98 athletes, male (N= 53) and female (N= 45). The data was collected during sport between universities. Methodology: The instrument used for the study comprised of a 26 -item of <b>Cognitive,</b> <b>Somatic</b> <b>and</b> Negative Coping Strategies. In additional, the study also used Sport Performance Questionnaire. Results: Result showed that male athletes used more <b>cognitive,</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>and</b> negative coping strategies. The result also showed that those athletes, who highly used <b>cognitive,</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>and</b> negative coping strategies, their performance increase. Conclusion: Therefore, sport psychologist and coach should encourage female athletes to use more coping strategies, since it increases sport performances. Even though, negative coping strategies also enhance performance, but sport psychologist, sport counselor and coach, should discourage athletes use it, since it can cause negative effect to health and consider as unethical behavior...|$|R

50|$|The Yerkes-Dodson Law spurred further {{research}} into its direct application in athletics. As a result, Sport psychologist, Yuri L. Hanin, developed the Zone of Optimal Functioning theory, which states, ″In order for an athlete to perform to their highest capability, they must experience their preferred level of anxiety.″ Hanin used a sport-specific {{version of the}} State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to measure the <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> anxiety levels of each player before his or her performance. Hanin determined that each player has a certain range of pre-performance anxiety which leads to optimal performance. Hanin later postulates the functional relationship between emotions and optimal performance differs between each individual based on emotional factors, thus the revised version was called the Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning (IZOF). The newer model better accounts for ″the multidimensionality of emotional constructs″ by accounting for {{both positive and negative}} affect in athletes prior {{to the beginning of the}} sporting event. The study confirmed the existence of an ″association of the intensity of pre-competition state anxiety to optimal athletic performance.″ A majority of elite athletes perform personalized pre-game rituals in order to mentally prepare themselves for gameplay. Players may revert to these rituals immediately before the clutch moment so as to stabilize cognitive and anxiety in order to revert to their individual zone of optimal functioning. This type of self-control is what leads to the ability to excel in the clutch.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine Jones ’ (1991) {{directionality}} hypothesis and Hanin’s (2000) individual zone of optimal functioning model. Swimmers ’ performance was examined to determine if <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> anxiety was within <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> individual zones of optimal functioning (IZOFs). Direction of <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> anxiety was exam-ined to determine if anxiety within IZOFs would be reported as facilitative to performance. One 3 X 3 (cognitive anxiety X somatic anxiety) ANOVA was calculated using ipsative t scores as the performance dependent variable. Two separate one factor ANOVAs for cognitive anxiety and somatic anxiety were calculated using ipsatized <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> direction scores as the dependent variables. Results indicated support for Hanin’s IZOF theory relative to intensity of cognitive anxiety, however, interpretations of anxiety within IZOFs failed to provide support for the directional hypothesis. Results are explained via examination of extant anxiety-performance and directionality literature. Potential limitations and implications for future research are discussed.

High rates of stress among physicians can be manifested in various expressions including <b>cognitive,</b> behavioral, <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> expressions. Work performance and quality of medical care administered to the patients can be undermined by over stressed physicians. ObjectiveThe aim {{of the study was}} to reveal sources and expressions of stress among hospital physicians and their relationship with socio-demographic and job factors. Subjects and methodsTwo hundred and forty-seven physicians working in a general hospital in Kuwait were the candidates of this study. Quick Stress Questionnaire (QSQ) was used. It consisted mainly of two parts, the first dealt with the sources of stress while the second entailed <b>cognitive,</b> behavioral, <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> expressions of stress. In addition, sociopage title demographic and work characteristics of physicians were studied and their association with stress domains was illustrated. ResultsThe most commonly encountered sources of work stress were work concerns (55. 9 %), followed by financial (51. 0 %), and family (45. 7 %) concerns. The most commonly encountered expressions are “sleeping disturbance, night awakening, and troublesome dreams” (27. 5 %) followed by “anxiety, fears, and worrying” (25. 9 %). The least commonly encountered ones are “acne, eczema, hives, breaking out, and skin blotching and skin blanching” (3. 6 %) followed by “tics, tremors, and muscle spasms” (4. 0 %).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} temporal responses associated with competitive anxiety in athletes with facilitative and debilitative interpretations of their anxiety symptoms. Qualitative interviews assessed the intensity, frequency, {{and direction of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> symptoms experienced during a 7 -day competitive cycle and the psychological strategies used to attain/maintain a positive psychological state. Analysis indicated three distinct temporal phases within the competitive cycle during which the intensity and frequency of <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> symptoms increased. The facilitators utilized a refined repertoire of psychological skills to internally control and re-interpret the <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> symptoms experienced. The debilitators did not possess this refined repertoire of psychological skills and relied on external strategies to stabilize the negative symptoms experienced. The findings emphasize the dynamic properties of the stress response and {{provide a framework for}} the structure, timing, and content of psychological skills interventions for use with performers who interpret anxiety symptoms as debilitative. </p...|$|E

Design: To test this mediational role, the three-step procedure advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986) was used. Method: After hearing and reading about specific conditions of performing that were intended to favor invoking excuses for future poor performance, 68 competitive basketball players completed measures of self-esteem, anxiety (<b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic),</b> self-confidence, and claimed self-handicapping. Then, they warmed-up and carried out a basketball task. Results: Self-esteem negatively predicted cognitive anxiety and positively predicted self-confidence.

The second aim sought to determine to what extent the important rugby match alters the <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> anxiety experienced by high school rugby players. In order to realize these aims, high school rugby players were compared to male adolescents who were not participating in any type of sport. A purposeful sample of 10 first team high school rugby players and 10 male adolescents not participating in any type of sport was drawn from a high school situated in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Cognitive anxiety was measured through the administration of the State and Trait Anxiety subscales of the State-Trait Personality Inventory Form Y (STPI-Y) and the Sport Competition Anxiety Test (SCAT). Somatic anxiety was measured by investigating the salivary cortisol levels of the rugby players. A baseline measure, along with measures on the day of an important rugby match and one week after the important rugby match were taken. Statistical analysis within the group of rugby players revealed that significant differences occurred in the state anxiety and SCAT scores.

A boy's scholastic swim team was used as the interventiongroup while a girl's scholastic swim team was used as the comparison group. All participants attended the same school and were members of their 2004 - 2005 swim team. Participants completed the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory- 2 (CSAI- 2) (Martens et al., 1990). All participants completed the CSAI- 2 once a week over the course of six weeks. The CSAI- 2 was subdivided into three subscales to measure cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-confidence. Imagery scripts were developed for the boys' swim team (intervention group) and were implemented twice a week during practice. Individualized scripts were created for the swimmers to practice on their own time at a minimum of once per week. No imagery training was provided to the girls' team. The results for multivariate analysis revealed no significant main effect for group, week, or week x group interaction (p >. 05). Univariate results for the week x group interaction showed no significance for cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, or for self-confidence (p >. 05).

The stabilogram diffusion analysis indicated a different set point in Highs and Lows and suggested that the former are more independent of specific sensory information than the latter, likely due to different abilities in sensory re-weighting and/or peculiar internal models of postural control. The results are discussed within the general perspective of high pervasiveness of the hypnotizability trait, which modulates <b>cognitive,</b> autonomic <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> functions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the psychological stress present in elite sailors in a competition. Based on a descriptive field research, 31 elite sailors volunteered to participate. They answered the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen & Williamson, 1988) and also specific questions on self-control, sources and strategies of coping. Data were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential (Student t test and Pearson's correlation) statistics. These athletes revealed low and moderate scores (M = 20. 00, DP = 6. 83) of stress originated from both intrinsic (ship troubles, team disorders) and extrinsic (study, working and training, family and financial problems) sources. The group reported good stress control during competition through the use of <b>cognitive</b> (avoidance) <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> (listening music, resting/sleeping, talk to friends) strategies. It is important that sailors are able to control and cope with high levels of psychological stress and to understand how to proceed when under unstable and unexpected situations that arise during competition...|$|R
