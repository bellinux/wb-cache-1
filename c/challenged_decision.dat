The Court upheld a decision by ESA finding that Norway Post had abused its dominant position {{in the market for}} business-to-consumer parcel services with over-the-counter delivery in Norway by pursuing an exclusivity strategy with preferential treatment when establishing and maintaining its Postin-Shop network. The facts of the case were as follows. In 2000 and 2001, Norway Post concluded framework agreements with several undertakings with a view to establish its Post-in-Shop network. Certain agreements specifically excluded competitors in the market for business-to-consumer parcel services from access to any of the outlets in these chains, while others guaranteed Norway Post exclusivity in the outlets which hosted a Post-in-Shop. Due to these exclusivity obligations, once the main roll-out of the Post-in-Shop concept had been implemented towards the end of 2003, Norway Post’s competitors were foreclosed from approximately 50% of all outlets belonging to grocery store, kiosk and petrol station chains in Norway. Furthermore, from 2004 to 2006, Norway Post negotiated preference status questions with its partners for the period subsequent to the expiry of those agreements in 2006. While Norway Post did not actively link the negotiations on preference status with the exclusivity obligations, it did not announce to its partners that it would not maintain such clauses in future cooperation agreements. In its judgment, the Court held that the proceedings, which had led to the imposition of a substantial fine on the applicant, as a matter of principle, must respect the guarantees for criminal proceedings enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In particular, the right to a fair trial requires that the Court must be able to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and of law, the <b>challenged</b> <b>decision.</b> Furthermore, it follows from the principle of the presumption of innocence that the undertaking to which the decision finding an infringement was addressed must be given the benefit of the doubt. As a consequence, the Court rejected ESA’s submission that its review of complex economic assessments by ESA would be limited to a “manifest error” standard. In substance, the Court upheld ESA’s assessment of Norway Post’s conduct. The Court dismissed Norway Post’s arguments that the exclusivity clauses were objectively necessary for the efficient implementation of the Post-in-Shop concept.|$|E

40|$|The legal {{doctrine}} of ‘common purpose’ in South African criminal law considers all parties liable {{who have been}} in implicit or explicit agreement to commit an unlawful act, and associated with each other for that purpose, even if the consequential act has been carried out by one of them. It relieves the prosecution of proving the causal link between the conduct of an individual member of a group acting in common purpose, and the ultimate consequence caused by the action of the group as a whole. The National Prosecuting Authority’s controversial and vociferously <b>challenged</b> <b>decision</b> (initially upheld, then withdrawn at the beginning of September 2012) to charge 270 demonstrators at Lonmin Platinum Mine in Marikana with the murders of 34 colleagues under the ‘common purpose’ doctrine, implying liability by association or agreement, raises the question as to the constitution and characteristics of the crowd and of the public, respectively. This article outlines the history of the application of the common purpose rule in South Africa, to then examine ‘common purpose’ within the philosophical parameters of group psychology and collective intentionality.

40|$|Since the {{enactment}} of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the courts have struggled to define the burdens of proof surrounding the central issue of an employer 2 ̆ 7 s alleged discriminatory intent. What evolved was the McDonnell Douglas framework, premised upon established concepts of circumstantial proof and inference. The approach permits plaintiffs lacking direct proof to nonetheless establish {{a violation of the}} Act by proving that the employer 2 ̆ 7 s explanation of the <b>challenged</b> <b>decision</b> was pretextual. In St. Mary 2 ̆ 7 s Honor Center v. Hicks, a closely-divided Supreme Court substantially altered the McDonnell Douglas framework. Discrediting the reasons offered by the employer for its decision no longer suffices to establish a violation of Title VII. Rather, plaintiffs must somehow prove that the pretext was offered to hide discrimination, and not for some other motivation. Moreover, the trier of fact is permitted to construct its own explanation of the events even though that scenario was not offered by either party at trial. As a result, plaintiffs must be prepared to discredit stated and unstated non-discriminatory reasons for the employer 2 ̆ 7 s action. Professor Brodin criticizes the sharp move away from McDonnell Douglas and argues that it will distort the fact-finding process and deprive victims of bias of a meaningful opportunity to enforce their rights to equal employment opportunity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} number of hospitalized elderly persons has greatly <b>challenged</b> <b>decision</b> makers to reorganize services so as {{to meet the needs}} of this clientele. Established progressively over the last 30 years, the short-term Geriatric Assessment Unit (GAU) is a specialized care program, now implemented in all the general hospital centres in Quebec. Within the scope of a broader reflection upon the appropriate care delivery for elderly patients in our demographic context, there is a need to revisit the role of GAU within the hospital and the continuum of care. The objective of this project is to describe the range of activities offered by Quebec GAU and the resources available to them. Methods In 2004, 64 managers of 71 GAU answered a mail questionnaire which included 119 items covering their unit's operation and resources in 2002 - 2003. The clinical and administrative characteristics of the clientele admitted during this period were obtained from the provincial database Med-Echo. The results were presented according to the geographical location of GAU, their size, their university academic affiliation, the composition of their medical staff, and their clinical care profile. Results Overall, GAU programs admitted 9 % of all patients aged 65 years and older in the surveyed year. GAU patients presented one or more geriatric syndromes, including dementia. Based on their clientele, three distinct clinical care profiles of GAU were identified. Only 19 % of GAU were focused on geriatric assessment and acute care management; 23 % mainly offered rehabilitation care, and the others offered a mix of both types. Thus, there was a significant heterogeneity in GAU's operation. Conclusions The GAU is at the cutting edge of geriatric services in hospital centres. Given the scarcity of these resources, it would be appropriate to better target the clientele that may benefit from them. Standardizing and promoting GAU's primary role in acute care must be reinforced. In order {{to meet the needs of}} the frail elderly not admitted in GAU, alternative care models centered on prevention of functional decline must be applied throughout all hospital wards. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{biomedical}} research oversight {{system in the}} United States delegates most responsibilities to local review entities known as institutional review boards (IRBs). The IRBs are charged with responsibility for safeguarding the welfare of research participants and ensuring that clinical studies involving human subjects comply with federal regulations. During the past three decades, the United States has experienced a dramatic proliferation of {{biomedical research}} studies. Contemporary critics often voice serious concerns about {{the adequacy of the}} regulations as a mechanism to insure the safety of study participants. Several lawsuits in recent years have named IRBs and IRB members as defendants, and these may portend a future fraught with litigation against IRBs. Such litigation poses new challenges for the IRB oversight system, including difficulty in recruiting IRB members, increased research costs, and potential over-deterrence that may adversely affect IRB deliberations and decision-making. Frequent litigation, therefore, could have profound implications for the research community that should be considered and addressed proactively. This article argues that retroactive review can be a useful adjunct to prospective oversight, but that it should be limited in scope. First, we recommend that all claims against IRBs be brought before the FDA or HHS for mandatory administrative review prior to the commencement of litigation. Such review would serve a useful gate-keeping role by filtering out or deterring frivolous actions and resolving some claims quickly, privately, and efficiently. Second, for cases that advance to the courthouse, we recommend that IRB members be given qualified immunity similar to that available for peer reviewers under The Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (HCQIA). IRB members should be immune from liability for civil damages so long as they had a good faith belief that the <b>challenged</b> <b>decision</b> protected the welfare of human subjects and so long as they complied with all federal regulatory requirements concerning protocol review. These safeguards should promote both the welfare of human subjects and the integrity of the oversight system...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{civil rights}} policy is, {{as the late}} Justice Scalia warned, at “war. ” On the one hand, some laws, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) and the Fair Housing Act, can impose {{liability}} for decisions due to their racial impacts rather than their racial motivation. Defendants in such cases can always respond that the <b>challenged</b> <b>decision</b> (a test, a criterion, an allocation) is necessary in some legally cognizable sense; but the courthouse doors open with the prima facie case of disparate impact. On the other hand, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, ever since the ascent of the “color-blind” over the “antisubordination” reading of the Amendment, subjects even benign discrimination—that designed to help minorities—to searching constitutional scrutiny. As a result, race-conscious decisions intended to alleviate disparate impacts under laws designed to enforce Equal Protection norms may themselves violate Equal Protection. The Court has yet to defuse the conflict. This Article offers some thoughts on how to subtly reframe the debate {{by looking at the}} problem of disparate impacts as a Thirteenth Amendment issue, and not solely as a Fourteenth Amendment one. In this Article, I argue that modern systemic empathetic failures towards minorities, and those of African descent in particular, are legacies of an instrumentalist view of Black lives and Black labor. Once Blacks ceased to be useful as a source of property or service, there was a widespread desire to have them simply go away. These attitudes form an underappreciated historical “badge” or “relic” of slavery that Congress can address through its Section Two enforcement power. Even in the absence of such legislation, race-conscious policies designed to address systemic empathy deficits towards minorities, understood as a “badge” or “relic” of slavery, form a compelling governmental interest. This compelling government interest need not be subject to the most restrictive race- neutral and narrow-tailoring strictures of Equal Protection. The policies can be race-conscious because, unlike the commerce authority or the “colorblind” Equal Protection Clause, slavery was a race-conscious institution in America. One must be conscious of race to dismantle a race-conscious institution...|$|E

40|$|Disparate {{treatment}} claims {{require a}} finding of an intent to discriminate. The search for discriminatory intent or motive in disparate treatment cases often is envisioned {{as an attempt to}} determine whether a supervisor, despite his denials, consciously acted out of bias, animus or on the basis of "inaccurate or stigmatizing stereotypes" in making an employment decision. Many employment decisions, however, are not made by a single individual. Sometimes, employment decisions are made after a recommendation works its way up a chain of authority. Sometimes, they are made by a committee or group, and sometimes, the decision making process incorporates elements of both. Some {{of the participants in the}} decision making process may act for prohibited reasons, while others may act for reasons having nothing to do with a plaintiff's protected class status. In such cases, whose motive matters? An ultimate decision maker or members of a decision making group may be, and often are, unaware that others involved in the process have based their decisions, in whole or in part, on an employee's protected-group status. Courts facing such claims generally have not considered that unawareness a sufficient basis for depriving a plaintiff of her discrimination claim. Instead, they have examined whether impermissible considerations in one part of the decision making chain caused the action to occur, in whole or in part. These multiple actor cases provide a useful model for the intent inquiry in individual decision maker situations as well. Just as persons involved in a decision making process may be unaware of the motives of others, individuals, as work in social cognition has demonstrated, are often unaware of their own biases. Implicit stereotypes can influence an individual's decision making in much the same way as an invidiously motivated supervisor can influence the actions of her superiors. In either context, the fact-finder should ask not whether decision makers made conscious use of the plaintiff's group status in the decision making process, but whether the plaintiff's group status caused the <b>challenged</b> <b>decision</b> to be made, in whole or in part. But causation alone, the article submits, is not a sufficient basis for employer liability. Under principles articulated by the Supreme Court in Burlington Industries v. Ellerth, the action complained of must be attributable to the employer, either directly or vicariously. Moreover, there must exist an unbroken chain of causation between these actions and the harm suffered by the plaintiff...|$|E
40|$|Building on the {{psychological}} research and publications indicating that much discrimination is unconscious {{and the result of}} implicit bias, this Article addresses the utility of laws that prohibit intentional discrimination in addressing this recently understood form of discrimination. More specifically, does unconscious discrimination violate a statute that prohibits intentional discrimination? The Article argues that the answer is yes. Unconscious discrimination is the result of stereotyping or categorization, a cognitive mechanism used by most people to simplify the task of perceiving, processing and retaining information about people. Absent a special effort to overcome this cognitive mechanism in making decisions about people, such decisions are frequently {{made on the basis of}} the category into which the decisionmaker places the person, rather than an individualized assessment. When a decisionmaker chooses to base decisions on the category into which an individual falls, rather than an individual assessment, the decisionmaker has made an intentional choice. Thus, the argument advanced here is that the intentional decision to discriminate is made when a decisionmaker chooses to use categories rather than an individual assessment, not at the precise point where a specific decision is made. Therefore, while a specific decision to hire or fire may not be the result of intentional discrimination at the point where the decision is made, it is, nevertheless, the product of intentional discrimination because at some point the decisionmaker decided to base decisions on categories rather than an individual assessment. The Article also discusses the common proof schemes for disparate treatment claims, including the direct method, the indirect method (McDonnell-Douglas) and mixed-motive. When the direct method is properly understood to include circumstantial evidence, it becomes the dominant method of establishing intentional discrimination. The key to proving intentional discrimination is showing that the decisionmaker engages in stereotyping and a likely way to establish this is through comments made by the decisionmaker, not necessarily in the context of the <b>challenged</b> <b>decision.</b> Once it is established that the decisionmaker engages in stereotyping and has a negative view of persons in the challenger 2 ̆ 7 s protected group, the burden of persuasion should shift to the one whose decision is being challenged to establish an affirmative defense. What constitutes an affirmative defense, and the effect of such a defense, is explained in the Article. Understanding how discrimination works, will help guide organizations that want to eliminate all discrimination, including unconscious discrimination. Once discrimination is better understood, preventive measures can be tailored to addressing the problem...|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} the author {{presents}} the legal setting for licensure testing, I discusses {{the role of}} various professional standards and codes (i. e., the EEOC Uniform Guidelines, 1978, and the AERA/APA/NCME Standards, 1985), presents some of the pertinent rulings from several court decisions, and makes inferences about future changes in professional standards and their potential impact on licensure test development. There necessarily is some minor overlap with the material in this chapter and some other chapters in this book. There is a brief discussion {{of the differences between}} licensure, certification. and employment testing and how those differences relate to the professional standards and court cases. It is necessary to mention some concepts such as task analysis, validity, and cut scores when discussing the professional standards and the court cases. However, these concepts are not dealt with in the depth that occurs in later chapters. THE LEGAL SETTING Licensure and certification tests are high-stakes tests and those considering using or constructing such tests should be aware of previous case law regarding such testing. Some generic legal issues are discussed first. In subsequent sections, the various professional standards and some court decisions are presented. Generic Legal Issues Existing case law is based on constitutional requirements- primarily the 14 th Amendment- and statutory requirements- primarily Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Constitutional Requirements: The 14 th Amendment Two basic requirements of the U. S. Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s 14 th Amendment are discussed: equal protection and due process. For a plaintiff to win under the equal protection analysis, it must be shown that there was intent to discriminate. In Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. (1977), the court stated that the following factors could be considered in establishing discriminatory intent: (a) historical background, (b) the specific sequence of events leading up to the <b>challenged</b> <b>decision,</b> (c) departures from normal procedural sequences, and (d) the legislative or administrative history. Nevertheless, to prove discriminatory intent, one court has ruled that it must be shown that the user of the test 2 ̆ 2 selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part 2 ̆ 7 because of 2 ̆ 7 not merely 2 ̆ 7 in spite of, 2 ̆ 7 its adverse effects upon an identifiable group 2 ̆ 2 (Personnel Administrator v. Feeney, 1979, at 4656). Another court has stated that:An action does not violate the equal protection clause simply because the decision maker knows that it wi ll have a disparate impact on racial or ethnic groups. (United States v. LULAC, 1986, p. 646) It is difficult to prove intent. As a consequence, most plaintiffs would prefer basing their cases on the Civil Rights Acts, which do not require proof of discriminatory motive. The due process provisions of the Constitution relate to substantive and procedural due process. Substantive due process requires a legitimate relationship between a requirement and the purpose. This legitimate relationship is easier to establish than the business necessity requirement of the Civil Rights Acts. In fact, for licensure and certification challenges Herbsleb, Sales, and Overcast (1985) concluded that: the rationality standard is so lenient that we were unable to find a single case where an examination was successfully challenged on this basis. (p. 1169) Procedural due process requires fairness in the way things are done. In testing cases, this means that there must be advance notice of the requirement, an opportunity for hearings/appeals, and that the hearings must be conducted fairly. A licensure or certification testing program should not be implemented without paying careful attention to these procedures. It {{should be pointed out that}} if a plaintiff wins on procedural grounds, he/she does not necessarily get a license. However, some additional procedure- such as a hearing- must be applied...|$|E
