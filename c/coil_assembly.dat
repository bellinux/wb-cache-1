50|$|A linear {{induction}} motor consists of two parts: the primary <b>coil</b> <b>assembly</b> and the reaction plate. The primary <b>coil</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of phase windings surrounded by steel laminations, and includes a thermal sensor within a thermal epoxy. The reaction plate consists of a 3.2 mm (0.125 inch) thick aluminum or copper plate bonded to a 6.4 mm (0.25 inch) thick cold rolled steel sheet. There is an air gap between these two parts that creates the frictionless property an electromagnetic propulsion system encompasses. Functioning of a linear {{induction motor}} begins with an AC force that is supplied to the coil windings within the primary <b>coil</b> <b>assembly.</b> This creates a traveling magnetic field that induces a current in the reaction plate, which then creates its own magnetic field. The magnetic fields in the primary <b>coil</b> <b>assembly</b> and reaction plate alternate, which generates force and direct linear motion.|$|E

50|$|However, at speed, the {{impedance}} of the coils increases, proportionate to speed, and {{dominates the}} composite impedance of the <b>coil</b> <b>assemblies.</b> This delays the phase of the current peak so that induced current in the track tends more closely {{to coincide with the}} field peaks of the magnet array.

40|$|Vibrations of {{a string}} can provide a model for {{vibrations}} of MRI <b>coil</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The string model for the vibrations of MRI coils is presented, and compared with experimental results. Gradient coils exhibit resonant modes because of the finite coil length, l, and the elasticity of materials that comprise the assembly. The resonance frequencies depend on l and the Young modulus, {{as well as on}} the current distribution. Under longitudinal gradient pulses, anti-symmetrical modes of surface vibration are produced due to the symmetry of current distribution. In contrast, transverse gradient pulses produce coil bending that results in symmetrical vibration modes of the coil axis. The viscosity of the assembly materials controls the width of the vibrational resonance modes. Experimental results are in agreement with this simple string model...|$|R
40|$|Halo {{currents}} (HCs), {{flowing through}} the plasma and the vacuum vessel during plasma disruptive events, induce severe mechanical stresses in the plasma facing components and in the vessel, and are a major concern for present and future fusion experiments like ITER.

The HCS system will include four identical mechanical structures each including eight Rogowski coils and two toroidal pick-up coils.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{contactless}} {{energy transfer}} (CET) desktop application is presented. The CET desktop uses {{a matrix of}} hexagon spiral windings embedded underneath its surface, to transfer power to CET enabled consumer electronics devices placed on the table. To improve efficiency and limit stray magnetic fields, clusters of only three primary coils, located closest to the receiving devices, are excited. The coils are excited with out-of-phase currents to further reduce stray magnetic fields. Due {{to the design of}} the CET desktop the power transfer efficiency is not constant but varies throughout the surface of the table. Using the design and evaluation process presented in this paper, different secondary coil configurations can be designed and evaluated to find topologies best suited for different electronic devices.

The benefits of VFD-based FCAs have not been realized with commercially available Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based VSDs because added filter components, power conditioning and environmental mitigation required for shipboard compatibility increase the size to six times the conventional motor controller based solution. This paper presents a 3. 75 horsepower VSD/PM motor based FCA system having sufficient compactness to fit within the space allocated for the motor and fan in a typical FCA system of this size. A significant power density is achieved in the VSD by using Current Source Converter (CSC) based interface as the front end interface to the 440 V distribution system.

A half moon shape loop goes around the bridge continuing just short of the fingerboard.

40|$|ITER will {{incorporate}} In Vessel Coils (IVCs) as {{a method}} of stabilizing "Edge Localized Modes" (ELM) and providing "Vertical Stabilization" (VS). To meet the ELM and VS Coil requirements strong coupling with the plasma is required so that it is necessary for the coils to be installed in the vessel just behind the blanket shield modules. Due to this close proximity to the plasma the radiation and temperature environment is severe and conventional electrical insulation materials and processes cannot be used. The development of mineral insulated conductor technology has been required in the IVC design to deal with this high radiation and high temperature environment. While mineral insulated conductor technology is not new, building a large magnet with high current carrying capability and a conductor diameter larger than the mineral insulated conductor currently manufactured requires RandD and the extension of existing technologies. A 59 mm Stainless Steel Jacketed Mineral Insulated Conductor (SSMIC) using MgO is being developed for this application.

The magnetic field up to 2. 6 T at the magnet centerline {{is to keep the}} muons within the MICE RF cavities. Its self inductance is around 592 H and its magnet stored energy is about 13 MJ at a full current of 210 A for the worst operation case of the MICE channel. The stress induced inside the coil during cool down and charging is relatively high. Two test coils are to build and test in order to validate the design method and develop the fabrication technique required for the coupling coil winding, one is 350 mm inner diameter and full length same as the coupling coil, and the other is one-quarter length and 1. 5 m diameter. The 1. 5 m diameter coil will be charged to strain conditions that are greater than would be encountered in the coupling coil.

40|$|Pre-deployment and {{degradation}} testing of commercial leak seal products {{were performed to}} evaluate the potential for remote, short-term repair of leaks in waste storage tank cooling coils. A liquid glass metallic product was identified for extensive testing after initial screening of four candidates. Testing was performed with manufactured holes and slits in an immersed pipe operated at nominal coil pressure (approximately 50 psig). The maximum leak sizes that sealed under simulated field conditions were a slit, 0. 016 times 0. 291 in. (leak rate, 1. 34 gpm) and a 0. 046 inch diameter hole (leak rate, 0. 63 gpm). Degradation of seals and of the constituent fiber samples was studied for radiation and for immersion in water and simulated waste. Seals withstood doses up 1. 66 E 7 R, equivalent to 2 years in a nuclear waste tank. A seal functioned for 50 days when immersed in simulated waste at 75 - 80 C, low-pressure cooling water at 27 - 35 C, and several salt/desalt cycles. A small leak occurred at 23 days, but self-healed. The limited test results provided confidence that small leaks in the evaporator cooling coils could be repaired. Visual sighting of the leaks in situ was unsuccessful, so geometry and locations were unknown. A simple deployment system was designed to introduce the sealant to the <b>coil</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The <b>coils</b> have successfully operated for three years with only one reapplication necessary...|$|R
5000|$|In a maglev {{train the}} primary <b>coil</b> <b>assembly</b> lies below the {{reaction}} plate. There is a 1-10 cm (0.39-3.93 inch) air gap between that eliminates friction, allowing for {{speeds up to}} 500 km/h (310 mph). An alternating electric current is supplied to the coils, which creates a change in polarity of the magnetic field. This pulls the train forward from the front, and thrusts the train forward from the back. A typical Maglev train costs three cents per passenger mile, or seven cents per ton mile (not including construction costs). This compares to 15 cents per passenger miles for travel by plane and 30 cents for ton mile for travel by intercity trucks. Maglev tracks have high longevity due to minimal friction and an even distribution of weight. Most last for at least 50 years and require little maintenance during this time. Maglev trains are promoted for their energy efficiency since they run on electricity, which can be produced by coal, nuclear, hydro, fusion, wind or solar power without requiring oil. On average most trains travel 483 km/h (300 mph) and use 0.4 megajoules per passenger mile. Using a 20 mi/gallon car with 1.8 people as a comparison, travel by car is typically 97 km/h (60 mph) and uses 4 megajoules per passenger mile. The carbon dioxide emissions are based upon the method of electrical production and fuel use. Many renewable electrical production methods generate little or no carbon dioxide during production (although carbon dioxide may be released during manufacture of the components, e.g. the steel used in wind turbines). The running of the train is significantly quieter than other trains, trucks or airplanes.|$|E
5000|$|The general {{problem of}} {{deciding}} on the folded {{structure of a}} protein when given the amino acid sequence (the so-called protein folding problem) has not been solved. However, the coiled coil {{is one of a}} relatively small number of folding motifs for which the relationships between the sequence and the final folded structure are comparatively well understood. Harbury et al. performed a landmark study using an archetypal coiled coil, GCN4, in which rules that govern the way that peptide sequence affects the oligomeric state (that is, the number of alpha-helices in the final assembly) were established. The GCN4 coiled coil is a 31-amino-acid (which equates to just over four heptads) parallel, dimeric (i.e., consisting of two alpha-helices) coiled coil and has a repeated isoleucine (or I, in single-letter code) and leucine (L) at the a and d positions, respectively, and forms a dimeric coiled coil. When the amino acids in the a and d positions were changed from I at a and L at d to L at a and I at d, a trimeric (three alpha-helices) coiled coil was formed. Furthermore, mutating the a and d positions both to L resulted in the formation of a tetrameric (four alpha-helices) coiled coil. These represent a set of rules for the determination of coiled coil oligomeric states and allows scientists to effectively [...] "dial-in" [...] the oligomerization behavior. Another aspect of coiled <b>coil</b> <b>assembly</b> that is relatively well understood, at least in the case of dimeric coiled coils, is that placing a polar residue (in particular asparagine, N) at opposing a positions forces parallel assembly of the coiled coil. This effect is due to a self-complementary hydrogen bonding between these residues, which would go unsatisfied if an N were paired with, for instance, an L on the opposing helix.|$|E
