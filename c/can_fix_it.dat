500|$|Rousseau asks Sayid about Nadia, and he {{says that}} she is dead because of him. Rousseau shows Sayid a broken music box given to her as a gift, and he tells her he <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> <b>it.</b> Rousseau reveals that she was part of a science team, and they were shipwrecked on the island about three days after leaving Tahiti. She {{identifies}} the [...] "Others" [...] as the carriers of a sickness that her companions caught, and says that the Others whisper in the jungle, although she has never seen them. Sayid does not believe her, but continues to fix the music box. After finishing the repairs, much to Rousseau's joy, he asks her to let him go. The duo hear a growl outside, and Rousseau pursues it, leaving Sayid alone.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} the second {{version of the}} song, Lennon {{wanted to do something}} different with it, as Martin remembered: [...] "He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. He asked me if I could write him a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it." [...] Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and swarmandel, an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> <b>it,</b> George", giving Martin and Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score {{in the middle of the}} second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly [...] "swimming" [...] quality.|$|E
