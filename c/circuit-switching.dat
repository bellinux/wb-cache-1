40|$|As {{cellular}} packet {{data services}} become widely deployed by the rollout {{of the networks}} such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and 3 G cellular networks, packet-switched voice service such as voice over IP (VoIP) can soon {{be expected to be}} offered as an alternative to <b>circuit-switched</b> voice service. While <b>circuit-switched</b> voice offers better quality, packet-switched voice offers better resource utilization due to its multiplexing and compression techniques {{that can be used in}} packet radio principle. Therefore, the capability of having voice service over either <b>circuit-switched</b> network or packet-switched network provides a tradeoff between voice quality and bandwidth utilization. This paper proposes three schemes that allow users to toggle between <b>circuit-switched</b> voice and packet-switched voice based on the desired tradeoff. The basic idea is to allow ongoing voice traffic to alternate between <b>circuit-switched</b> network and packetswitched network using a 3 -way calling mechanism in the SIP-enabled GSM/GPRS cellular network. We also show how these toggle schemes can be used depending on the cell load. Detailed performances of the proposed schemes are evaluated using simulation with realistic parameters of a cellular environment. The result shows our schemes can alleviate cell overloading as well as provide the smooth transition of an ongoing call between <b>circuit-switched</b> network and packet-switched network. Our schemes can be easily deployed in any cellular mobile network where <b>circuit-switched</b> network and packet-switched network coexist...|$|R

5000|$|The {{issue of}} {{connecting}} separate physical networks to form one logical network {{was the first}} of many problems. In the 1960s, Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation produced a study of survivable networks for the U.S. military in the event of nuclear war.

Independently, Donald Davies (National Physical Laboratory, UK), proposed and was the first to put into practice a similar network based on what he called packet-switching, the term that would ultimately be adopted. Leonard Kleinrock (MIT) developed a mathematical theory behind this technology (without the packets). Packet-switching provides better bandwidth utilization and response times than the traditional <b>circuit-switching</b> technology used for telephony, particularly on resource-limited interconnection links.|$|E

40|$|The {{number and}} size of les {{transferred}} over the Internet is sufficiently significant to warrant the investigation of faster and more efficient mechanisms for their transfer. This research begins by comparing the performance of <b>circuit-switching</b> and TCP/IP (which is most commonly used in the Internet) when bulk data is transferred. Experimental and analytical analysis suggests that <b>circuit-switching</b> is indeed better suited for bulk data transfer than TCP/IP. <b>Circuit-switching</b> suffers from the drawback that connections at rates higher than DS 0 (64 Kbps) can only be obtained in provisioned mode. For <b>circuit-switching</b> to be usable for bulk data transfer, it should support on demand circuits at much higher data rates, for example OC 1 (51. 84 Mbps) to OC 768 (40 Gbps).

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} hybrid {{approach}} for efficiently handling both best-effort and streaming traffic while enhancing {{performance in a}} Network-on-Chip “NoC”. The hybrid approach consists in separately handling each type of traffic using the appropriate, suitable and specialized switching technique while introducing mechanisms for improving performances. Three hybrid router architectures are then proposed and are summarized as follows. A SDM-Based hybrid router architecture in which, a packet-switching technique is used to handle the best-effort traffic while the <b>circuit-switching</b> technique is used to handle the streaming traffic. Since <b>circuit-switching</b> technique often leads to poor utilization of communication resources, the Spatial Division Multiplexing ”SDM" technique is introduced in the <b>circuit-switching</b> technique in order to mitigate the poor utilization of communication resources by increasing router path diversity while the packet-switching is kept as simple as possible. A SDM-TDM Based hybrid router architecture which, while {{taking advantage of the}} hybrid approach implemented in the SDM-based hybrid router, introduces the temporal dimension by associating Spatial Division Multiplexing with Time Division Multiplexing “TDM” in order to share, in the <b>circuit-switching</b> technique, communication resources among multiple streaming data flows. Combining SDM and TDM techniques allows the highest number of available channels in the <b>circuit-switching.</b> Furthermore, this is an efficient and simple solution to overcome limitations in TDM-based NoCs due to time slot scheduling constraints. A CDM-Based hybrid router with CDM-TDM based bus which takes advantage of both NoC and Bus architectures. The CDM-based router also benefits from the hybrid approach; however the <b>circuit-switching</b> technique is Code Division Multiplexing “CDM”-Based, and allowing communication resources to be simultaneously accessed by several streaming data flow. The bus architecture combines CDM and TDM techniques in order to benefit from simultaneous channel access while sharing resources over time. Finally, the SDM and SDM-TDM based hybrid routers are used to build any size of 2 D Mesh NoC. The resulting NoCs are used as interconnection infrastructures in a Multiprocessor System-on-Chip “MPSoC” platform. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
