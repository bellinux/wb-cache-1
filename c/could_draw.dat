5|$|Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 {{before he}} <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> up his last will. Since his son Richard had predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, claimed the inheritance. The Dudleys {{maintained}} that Guildford's daughter Jane was the natural heir. They finally won the resulting court {{case with the}} assistance of Thomas Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|Second, the longitudes of {{ascending}} nodes {{of the two}} bodies—the points {{where they}} cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This {{is known as the}} 1:1 superresonance. All the Jovian planets, particularly Jupiter, {{play a role in the}} creation of the superresonance.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{requested}} that Jean Dupont, {{the editor of}} L'Écho illustré– the magazine in which The Adventures of Tintin was serialised in Switzerland– send him documentation on Swiss railways which he <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> from. He also {{requested that}} his Swiss friend Charly Fornora send him a bottle of Valais wine which he could again use as a model from which to draw. Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland himself to produce accurate sketches of scenes around Geneva which he could then incorporate into the story; these included at Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Genève-Cornavin railway station, and the Cornavin Hotel, {{as well as the}} road through Cervens and Topolino's house in Nyon. Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé's depiction of Geneva.|$|E
50|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals {{was held on}} 18 June 2015. Teams from {{different}} zones <b>could</b> be <b>drawn</b> into the same tie, {{and there was no}} seeding or country protection, so teams from the same association <b>could</b> be <b>drawn</b> into the same tie.|$|R

5000|$|The Sofia 2005 tournament {{employed}} a similar rule, {{which has become}} known as [...] "Sofia rules". The players <b>could</b> not <b>draw</b> by agreement, but they <b>could</b> have <b>draws</b> by stalemate, threefold repetition, the fifty-move rule, and insufficient material. Other draws are only allowed if the arbiter declares it is a drawn position.|$|R
5|$|In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and {{a partner}} bought a small general store on credit in New Salem, Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the {{business}} struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly. He had attained local popularity and <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee spoke out against the use of {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused to take part in the education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
5|$|In general, in the Solar System, {{planetary}} {{formation is}} thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets. During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals. This gravitational accretion {{led to the formation of}} the planets.|$|E
50|$|In the quarter-finals, {{teams from}} the same group <b>could</b> not be <b>drawn</b> against each other. In the draws for the semi-finals all teams <b>could</b> be <b>drawn</b> against each other. In all rounds, home team was decided in the draw.|$|R
50|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals {{was held on}} 18 June 2015, 15:00 UTC+8, at the Grand Millennium Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{military}} confederation {{with the}} other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army {{was provided by the}} Socii, such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> on 770,000 men {{at the beginning of the}} Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in alae, or wings, roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{argued that}} among the Vietnamese forces {{involved}} {{in the civil war}} there were nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention. He opposed many of the strategies associated with troop escalation, notably the air campaign over North Vietnam, which he saw as an aggressive measure causing civilian casualties that <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> the People's Republic of China or the Soviet Union into the conflict. He also feared that other American interests, including the economy, were suffering through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E

5|$|The Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold, {{selected}} Colonel James C. Marshall to {{head the}} Army's {{part of the project}} in June 1942. Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York, where he <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers' North Atlantic Division. It was close to the Manhattan office of Stone & Webster, the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University. He had permission to draw on his former command, the Syracuse District, for staff, and he started with Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols, who became his deputy.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith {{had prior}} {{political}} experience, having been elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in France {{as part of}} the Eurosceptic Movement for France coalition in June 1994. Although his father had been a Member of Parliament representing Britain's Conservative Party, and he had personally had a close relationship to the party when it was led by Margaret Thatcher, Goldsmith wanted to launch his campaign independently of the Conservatives, hoping that it <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> on cross-party concerns about the direction of the EU. At the time of the party's formation, Goldsmith had an estimated personal wealth of £800 million, and promised to put £20 million into the party. He pledged to spend at least £10 million on campaigning for the next general election, to ensure that his party was funded to the same extent as the country's larger political parties. Goldsmith's intervention in British politics has been compared to that of the multi-millionaires Ross Perot in the United States and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy.|$|E

5|$|Transport {{aircraft}} {{were controlled}} by the 54th Troop Carrier Wing, which was commanded by Colonel Paul H. Prentiss, with his headquarters at Port Moresby. He had two groups under his command: the 374th Troop Carrier Group at Ward's Field and the 375th Troop Carrier Group at Dobodura, plus the 65th and 66th Troop Carrier Squadrons of the 403rd Troop Carrier Group at Jackson's Field. In addition, Prentiss <b>could</b> <b>draw</b> on the 317th Troop Carrier Group at Archerfield Airport and RAAF Base Townsville, {{although it was not}} under his command. Postponing the operation from August to September 1943 allowed for the arrival of the 433rd Troop Carrier Group from the United States. Each squadron was equipped with 13 C-47 aircraft, and each group consisted of four squadrons, for a total of 52 aircraft per group.|$|E

25|$|Byzantine {{philosophy}} {{refers to}} the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the Byzantine Empire, especially between the 8th and 15th centuries.
