5|$|After leaving Echo & the Bunnymen in 1988 {{to pursue}} a solo career, vocalist Ian McCulloch {{released}} two albums that were not commercial successes. Despite McCulloch's departure and drummer Pete de Freitas's death, guitarist Will Sergeant and bassist Les Pattinson decided to recruit three new members– Noel Burke (vocals), Jake Brockman (keyboards) and Damon Reece (drums)– and <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same band name, which angered McCulloch. The Bunnymen released one further album, Reverberation (1990), which critics and fans alike received poorly. WEA Records subsequently dropped the group, {{who went on to}} break-up in early 1993.|$|E

5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advantage of the extra forward.|$|E

5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite to <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E
