25|$|In February or March 1899, as Sections 21, 22, and 23 {{were being}} {{prepared}} for the burial of Spanish–American War dead, Secretary of War Elihu Root chose a promontory on {{the eastern edge of}} the burial field as the site for a new Spanish–American War memorial. Veterans of the war strongly supported the construction of a memorial, but no action was taken. Agnes Kissam <b>Capron,</b> wife of Captain Allyn K. <b>Capron,</b> Sr. (an Army artillery officer who died of typhoid fever in September 1898), began lobbying Congress in April 1900 to appropriate money for a memorial and Representative John H.

25|$|Battery <b>Capron,</b> with sixteen 12-inch mortars, was {{the largest}} {{component}} of the new defenses. In 1906 it was organizationally split into two batteries, <b>Capron</b> and Butler, each with eight mortars.

In April 1898 the Spanish–American War broke out, with Fort Moultrie's smaller, rapid-fire batteries still years from completion. Batteries Logan and Bingham were added to the fort, mostly equipped with weapons purchased from the United Kingdom. In 1901 Battery McCorkle was added to defend the minefield against minesweepers with three 3-inch guns on retractable masking parapet carriages. In 1905 Battery Lord was added with two 3-inch guns, and in 1906 Battery Gadsden provided four 6-inch rapid-fire disappearing guns.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} who first {{proposed}} a Rough Rider Memorial, or when the idea was first raised. A Rough Riders National Monument Society was organized on June 15, 1906. Lillian <b>Capron,</b> wife of Captain Allyn K. <b>Capron,</b> Jr. (the Rough Riders' first officer to be killed in action), was elected president and treasurer. Eldridge E. Jordan, a prominent businessman, was elected vice president. The {{other members of the}} board of directors included Charles E. Hunter, an Oklahoma Republican politician and clerk of the Oklahoma Federal District Court; William Henry Harrison Llewellyn, a New Mexico Territory Republican politician and United States Attorney; Captain James R. Church, M.D., U.S. Army; and the Reverend Henry A. Brown, U.S. Army. All the men were former Rough Riders. Rev. Brown had served as the regimental chaplain.|$|E
25|$|The Rough Rider Memorial was {{designed}} by Mrs. <b>Capron,</b> who decided to model the monument on the Rough Riders shaft erected by General Wood in Cuba.

25|$|A {{fundraising}} {{campaign was}} undertaken {{to pay for}} the memorial. On June 10, 1906. Mrs. <b>Capron</b> had organized a party to raise money for a monument. During the event, a saber was raffled off, various donated items sold, and the United States Marine Band gave a two-hour concert. President Theodore Roosevelt donated a large number of American Beauty roses from the White House Rose Garden. Another fund-raiser was held on February 8, 1907, when members of the 13th Cavalry and the 4th Battery, U.S. Light Field Artillery, put on a display of horsemanship at Fort Myer, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. President Roosevelt and most of Washington society were expected to attend. The event drew a large crowd and raised a significant amount of money.|$|E
25|$|As {{commander}} of Company A of the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment, Gardner, along with Captain Abner Doubleday, {{his wife and}} Company E, arrived from Fort <b>Capron,</b> Florida, reaching their new post aboard the steamer Gordon on June 16, 1858, joining Captain Truman Seymour’s Company H to jointly constitute Moultrie’s new U.S. Army garrison. In August, yellow fever broke out amongst the companies of newly arrived artillerymen, infecting 49 and eventually killing 28. To reduce the possibility of further spreading of the epidemic, Washington authorized Gardner to temporarily move his command outside the fort into a healthier locale during the hot summer season. Subsequently, Gardner was absent from Fort Moultrie {{throughout most of the}} summer of 1859, scouting out potential arrangements around Smithville, North Carolina. Doubleday acted as commandant during Gardner's absence.|$|E

Rough Riders on both left and right sides of the trail moved forward and eventually forced the Spaniards back to their second line of trenches. Continuing to advance, the Rough Riders eventually forced the Spanish to withdraw completely from their final positions. Rough Riders from A Troop on the far right linked up with their regular counterparts and helped them seize the Spanish positions on the long finger-like hill to the right of the right road, with both Rough Riders and Regulars meeting at the base of the finger-like hill. By this time it was approximately 9:30. Reinforcements from the regular 9th Cavalry arrived, but it was already 30 minutes after the fight.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1830s, the U.S. Postmaster General {{refused to}} allow the mails to carry {{abolition}} pamphlets to the South. Northern teachers suspected of abolitionism were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists. They pointed to John Brown's attempt in 1859 to start a slave uprising as proof that multiple Northern conspiracies were afoot to ignite slave rebellions. Although some abolitionists did call for slave revolts, {{no evidence of any}} other Brown-like conspiracy has been discovered. The North felt threatened as well, for as Eric Foner concludes, [...] "Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests". The famous, [...] "fiery" [...] Abolitionist, Abby Kelley Foster, from Massachusetts, was considered an [...] "ultra" [...] abolitionist who believed in full civil rights for all black people. She held to the views that the freed slaves would colonize Liberia. Parts of the anti-slavery movement became known as [...] "Abby Kellyism". She recruited Susan B Anthony and Lucy Stone to the movement. Effingham <b>Capron,</b> a cotton and textile scion, who attended the Quaker meeting where Abby Kelley Foster and her family were members, became a prominent abolitionist at the local, state and national levels. The local anti-slavery society at Uxbridge had more than one quarter of the town's population as members.|$|E

2500|$|Guánica is {{a modern}} town that {{maintains}} roots and connections to a traditional past. Known as el pueblo de la amistad (The town of Friendship), it is also occasionally referred to as el pueblo de las doce calles (the town of the twelve streets). The central part of town consists of five streets running north-south crossing seven other streets that run east-west, resulting in a compact grid of 24 square blocks, {{one of which is}} the town plaza. Facing the plaza is the Catholic Church, city hall, a school, and many shops; the plaza itself contains greenery, walks, and a music stand. In recent years this central area of the twelve streets has been extensively supplemented by suburbs in the south and west. Hills surround the town and harbor, including the 450-foot (140 m) hill to the east of town, itself topped by the tiny Fort <b>Caprón.</b> Two large factories, one producing fertilizer, partially distract the eye from the pleasant landscape, but both have been important to the economy of the town, at one time dominated by the sugar plantations of Central Guanica. The resort chain known as Club Med once attempted to set up a luxury resort on beaches east of the town, but withdrew due to local opposition which was apprehensive about both environmental and community degradation. East of the town some [...] of land, including three miles (5km) of beach, have been intermittently for sale.

2500|$|Slater's Mill was {{established}} in the Blackstone Valley, which extended into neighboring Massachusetts, (Daniel Day's Woolen Mill, 1809 at Uxbridge), and became one of the earliest industrialized region in the United States, second to the North Shore of Massachusetts. [...] Slater's business model of independent mills and mill villages (the [...] "Rhode Island System") began to be replaced by the 1820s by a more efficient system (the [...] "Waltham System") based upon Francis Cabot Lowell's replications of British power looms. [...] Slater went on to build several more cotton and wool mills throughout New England, but when faced with a labor shortage, resorted to building housing, shops, and churches for the workers and their families adjacent to his factories. [...] The first power looms for woolens were installed in 1820, at Uxbridge, Massachusetts, by John <b>Capron,</b> of Cumberland, Rhode Island. [...] These added automated weaving under the same roof, a step which Slater's system outsourced to local farms. [...] Lowell looms were managed by specialized employees, many of the employed were unmarried young women ("Lowell Mill Girls"), and owned by a corporation. Unlike the previous forms of labor (apprenticeship, family labor, slavery, and indenture), the Lowell system popularized the concept of wage laborer who sells his labor to an employer under contract—a socio-economic system which persists in many modern countries and industries. [...] The corporation also looked out for the health and well being of the young women, including their spiritual health, and the hundreds of women employed by it culturally established the pattern of a young woman going off to work a few years and saving monies before returning home to school and marriage. [...] It created an independent breed of women uncommon in most of the world.|$|E
