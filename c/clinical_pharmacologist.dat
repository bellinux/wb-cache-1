40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{information}} about cost-effectiveness analysis and the roles of <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists</b> generally in providing efficient health care. The paper highlights the potential consequences of ‘off-label prescribing’ and ‘indication creep’ behaviour given slower growth (or potential cuts) in the NHS budget. This paper highlights the key roles of <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists</b> in delivering an efficient health care system when resources are allocated using cost-effectiveness analyses. It describes what cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is and how incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are used to identify efficient options. After outlining the theoretical framework within which using CEA can promote the efficient allocation of the health care budget, it considers the place of disinvestment within achieving efficient resource allocation. <b>Clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists</b> are argued to be critical to providing improved population health under CEA-based resource allocation processes because of their roles in implementation and disinvestment. Given that the challenges facing the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) are likely to increase, this paper sets out the stark choices facing <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists...</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{transformation}} {{in the role of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists</b> in Australasia.

Today many more opportunities exist for expanding the roles of health professionals who have the clinical pharmacology training. These professionals can influence national and international policy, practice, and education in their field. However, the new roles do require extra initiatives in providing educational input in clinical pharmacology to take care of future needs.

40|$|Objectives: Drug-related {{problems}} (DRPs) are {{events or}} circumstances involving drug therapy that actually or potentially interfere with desired health outcomes. This study tested {{the applicability of}} clinical decision support software in identifying and managing DRPs among cardiovascular surgery inpatients. Methods: Two <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists</b> attended ward rounds on a low-dependency cardiovascular surgery ward every 2 weeks over a 7 -month period. Three hundred and three patients were assessed. On average, patients received 17 scheduled and 'as required' medicines. DRPs were identified 'manually' via assessment of electronic prescription charts and patient records and 'electronically' using clinical decision support software (Pharmavista®). The numbers of alerts for optimizing medication safety generated by the two methods were compared. Results: Manual checking identified 346 DRPs leading to 346 alerts in 201 patients (overall 1. 1 alerts/patient). Relevant interactions accounted for 44 % of DRPs detected by <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists.</b> <b>Clinical</b> decision support software, which could only report interactions, however, generated 1, 370 alerts (average 4. 5 alerts/patient). Only 147 (11 %) drug-drug interaction alerts were identical to those identified by manual checking; the remaining 89 % were considered not clinically relevant. Conclusions: Compared to identification of DRPs by <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists,</b> the <b>clinical</b> decision support software performed poorly due to over-alerting and inability to assess for problems not caused by drug-drug interactions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{retrospective}} study aimed to assess {{to what extent}} an adverse drug reaction (ADR), an abnormal therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) or a non-response, was attributable to an abnormal cytochrome P 450 activity in a psychiatric setting. MethodWe collected the results of investigations performed in these situations related to psychotropic drugs between January 2005 and November 2014. Activities of different cytochrome P 450 were assessed by genotyping and/or phenotyping. Two experienced <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists</b> assessed independently the possible association between the event {{and the results of}} the investigations. ResultsOne hundred and thirty eight clinical or biological situations had a complete assessment of all major metabolic pathways of the target drug. A majority of clinical or biological situations were observed with antidepressants (n= 93, 67. 4 %), followed by antipsychotics (n= 28, 20. 3 %), benzodiazepines and hypnotics (n= 13, 9. 4 %), and psychostimulants (n= 4, 2. 9 %). Genotype and/or phenotype determination was mainly performed because of ADRs (n= 68, 49. 3 %) or non-response (n= 46, 33. 3 %). Inter-rate reliability of the scoring system between the pharmacologists was excellent (kappa= 0. 94). The probability of an association between ADR, TDM or non-response and metabolic status was rated as intermediate to high in 34. 7 % of all cases, with proportions of 30. 4 % and 36. 7 %, for non-response and ADR respectively. ConclusionWhen indicated by <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists,</b> ADR, TDM or non-response may be attributable to a variation of the metabolic status with an intermediate to high probability in 34. 7 % of patients, based on the congruent assessment made by two <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacologists.</b> Further studies assessing the clinical relevance of prospective explorations and clarifying the appropriate method according to the clinical context are needed...|$|R

50|$|Clinical {{pharmacology}} {{connects the}} gap between medical practice and laboratory science. The main objective is to promote the safety of prescription, maximise the drug effects and minimise the side effects.
