40|$|The {{implementation}} {{and development of}} managed aquifer recharge (MAR) have been limited by the <b>clogging</b> attributed to physical, chemical, and biological reactions. In application field of MAR, physical <b>clogging</b> is usually the dominant type. Although numerous studies on the physical <b>clogging</b> mechanism during MAR are available, studies on the more detailed suspended <b>clogging</b> types and its prediction methods still remain few. In this study, a series of column experiments were inducted to show the process of suspended solids <b>clogging</b> process. The suspended solids <b>clogging</b> was divided into three types of surface <b>clogging,</b> inner <b>clogging</b> and mixed <b>clogging</b> based on the different <b>clogging</b> characteristics. Surface <b>clogging</b> indicates that the suspended solids are intercepted by the medium surface when suspended solids grain diameter is larger than pore diameter of infiltration medium. Inner <b>clogging</b> indicates that the suspended solids particles could transport through the infiltration medium. Mixed <b>clogging</b> refers to the comprehensive performance of surface <b>clogging</b> and inner <b>clogging.</b> Each suspended solids <b>clogging</b> type has the different <b>clogging</b> position, different changing laws of hydraulic conductivity and different deposition profile of suspended solids. Based on the experiment data, the ratio of effective medium pore diameter (Dp) and median grain size of suspended solids (d 50) was proposed as the judgment index for suspended solids <b>clogging</b> types. Surface <b>clogging</b> occurred while Dp/d 50 was less than 5. 5, inner <b>clogging</b> occurred while Dp/d 50 was greater than 180, and mixed <b>clogging</b> occurred while Dp/d 50 was between 5. 5 and 180. In order to improve the judgment accuracy and applicability, Bayesian method, which considered more ratios of medium pore diameter (Dp) and different level of grain diameter of suspended solids (di), were developed to predict the potential suspended solids types...|$|R

5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage <b>clogs</b> its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
5|$|Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, {{topped with}} sticky secretions, that cover their laminae. The {{trapping}} and digestion mechanism usually employs {{two types of}} glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as D.erythrorhiza). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the mucilage envelops them and <b>clogs</b> their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes esterase, peroxidase, phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient mixture is then absorbed through the leaf surfaces {{to be used by}} the rest of the plant.|$|E

40|$|Well bore <b>clogging</b> {{is caused}} by {{accumulation}} of particles on the well bore. However, all abstracted groundwaters contain particles, but not all wells <b>clog.</b> Apparently, <b>clogging</b> is not caused by {{the mere presence of}} particles, but other factors are also involved. Results from on-line well-head readings demonstrate that the <b>clogging</b> rate is not constant: the specific capacity decreases during long abstraction periods and remains constant during intermittent abstraction. Results of particle counts reveal that the particle concentration in the abstracted groundwater shows a peak immediately after switching on the well. This concentration peak {{is caused by}} the removal of particles from the well bore that accumulated during the preceding abstraction period. As long as all accumulated particles are removed, no <b>clogging</b> will occur; if not, <b>clogging</b> will occur. Consequently, well bore <b>clogging</b> can be prevented by switching the pump on and off with sufficient frequency to remove the particles accumulated on the well bore during the preceding abstraction period.

40|$|International audienceDripper <b>clogging</b> {{is a major}} {{drawback}} of microirrigation {{systems that}} must be addressed to improve their efficiency and durability. Particle-induced <b>clogging</b> is first studied in situ. The experiments consist in observing in real conditions the behavior of a series of drippers fitted on an agricultural plot in the south of France.

40|$|Prefabricated {{vertical}} drains (PVD) {{are used}} to accelerate drainage and consolidation of soft sediment. An effective functioning of these PVD depends on its capacity to drain water from the subsurface. Among other causes, the <b>clogging</b> of filter jackets {{is thought to be}} of a considerable negative influence on the functioning of PVD. Current regulations prescribe a minimum ratio between the filters aperture size and the grain size distribution of the soil to prevent this <b>clogging.</b> Objective: The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of filter <b>clogging</b> on the performance of PVD filter jackets, with regards to the soft soil conditions that are encountered in large parts of the Netherlands. Method: A literature review is performed on the principle of vertical drainage, soil types, filter types, <b>clogging</b> criteria, processes and testing methods. An experimental program was undertaken in the laboratory in which filter jackets were exposed to two different <b>clogging</b> phenomena, i. e. particle <b>clogging</b> and chemical <b>clogging.</b> Also filters from the field were evaluated. All filters were evaluated on their loss of permittivity with constant head measurements on filter pieces of three different filter types, the D 165 and HS 5417 from the Typar line of DuPont and the 30195 of Freudenberg. Particle <b>clogging</b> was evaluated by two different setups, the Oedometer and a long term filtration setup. Within the Oedometer tests the load and the moisture content of the clay sample varied. Chemical testing was done briefly, to see till what extend iron precipitation could induce filter <b>clogging</b> and if one filter would be more prone to <b>clog</b> than the other. Results: The permittivity tests on the filter pieces showed reproducible results. Repeated measurements on the same sample showed an average standard deviation of not larger than four percent of the samples mean. The initial permittivity also corresponded reasonable with the values provided by the filter manufacturers. With particle <b>clogging,</b> it was seldom observed that <b>clogging</b> ratios were higher than five. Relations between <b>clogging</b> and the applied load on the clay sample could not be found. Increasing moisture content showed a slightly higher <b>clogging</b> ratio. Another <b>clogging</b> indicator was found from work by Aydilek, initial permittivity. This is believed to be a better estimator; higher initial permittivity in general gave lower <b>clogging</b> ratios. In the chemical experiment it was observed that on the filter of Freudenberg large amounts of iron oxide precipitated. During filtration the filter seemed fully <b>clogged.</b> Permittivity tests on this filter showed an approximately four times larger <b>clogging</b> ratio, than that of the other ones. Conclusions: Based on literature and observations from both experiments and field data, it can be concluded that the permittivity reduction of filter jackets is always less than a factor of ten. Hence filter <b>clogging</b> is not a real issue, since the permeability of the soft sediments is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the <b>clogged</b> filters. Hence, the system permeability is mainly determined by the soil behavior. Geo-EngineeringGeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
