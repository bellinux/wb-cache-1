About 1.5% of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E

Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier, Major Charles Kearney. Jacques later claimed that the pair had been engaged and that Kearney had been killed in action, although her biographer, Andy Merriman, discovered that Kearney had a wife and <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> when he had proposed to Jacques, and had returned to them after the war.|$|E

25|$|Tonsillectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which each}} tonsil is removed from a recess {{in the side of}} the pharynx called the tonsillar fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis, sleep surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, diphtheria carrier state, snoring, or peritonsillar abscess. For children, the adenoids (also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil) are usually removed, a procedure called adenoidectomy (or tonsilloadenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy when combined). Adenoidectomy is uncommon in adults in whom the adenoids are usually vestigial. Although tonsillectomy is performed less frequently than in the 1950s, it remains a common surgical procedures in <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and many other western countries.|$|E
25|$|The gap {{in income}} {{between rich and}} poor is greater in the United States than in any other {{developed}} country. Starting in the 1980s relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations, though analyses using a common data set for comparisons tend to find that the U.S. has a lower absolute poverty rate by market income than most other wealthy nations. Extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2 per day before government benefits, doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011, including 2.8 million children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels.

25|$|In 2005 an {{investigator}} from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children {{became involved in}} Olmedo's case, the solving of which was made a priority by the organization. The evidence was {{compared to that of}} at least 12 missing boys from Illinois and other missing <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> who were of the same age range and race. His face was also forensically reconstructed many times in 3D and 2D, along with a digital rendering to give an approximation of his likeness when he was alive. To assist with the search for the victim's identity, television shows such as America's Most Wanted and Without a Trace broadcast the case. The local police department was working on a child abuse case in early 2008 and came to believe that the boy may have been a victim of the same person. A girl, who later turned out to be his sister, had told how her stepfather had subjected her and her siblings to violent beatings which left visible wounds on her body. The alleged abuse occurred on a daily basis.|$|E
500|$|Dental caries (cavities), {{described}} as [...] "tooth decay", is an infectious disease which damages {{the structures of}} teeth. The disease can lead to pain, tooth loss, and infection. Dental caries has a long history, with evidence showing the disease was present in the Bronze, Iron, and Middle ages but also prior to the neolithic period. The largest increases in the prevalence of caries {{have been associated with}} diet changes. Today, caries {{remains one of the most}} common diseases throughout the world. In the United States, dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, being at least five times more common than asthma. Countries that have experienced an overall decrease in cases of tooth decay continue to have a disparity in the distribution of the disease.

500|$|The Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop), the {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, [...] "My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. Perhaps we could do it with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure". Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that [...] "divorce is a middle-class thing," [...] and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single-parent family, with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, [...] "We were really nervous about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo-in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's so personal. People react differently." [...] The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households.|$|E
