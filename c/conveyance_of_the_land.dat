50|$|The estate {{ultimately}} {{came into}} <b>the</b> possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clopton family, into {{which one of}} William's three daughters, Martha, had married.

50|$|As a preliminary, there {{needed to}} be a <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land.</b> The owner (in tail) of the land A {{conveyed}} {{it to someone else}} B (known as the tenant in precipe) to the intent that a third person C (known as the demandant) might sue for it. C accordingly issued a writ against B. In court, B defended his right saying (correctly) that he had acquired it from A. A (now called the vouchee) was called upon to vouch for his right to the land. He alleged that he had acquired it from D (a person known as the common vouchee). D asked for time and failed to appear subsequently; alternatively, he dashed out of the court. In either case, the judgment was that C should recover the land, and that D should compensate B with land of equal value. However, D was chosen because he was a 'man of straw' with no property at all, so that the judgment against him was valueless, and it was never enforced. The result was thus that C recovered land in fee simple, which A had owned in only fee tail; thus, the entail was barred.|$|E

40|$|Amid a {{field of}} law of {{peculiar}} interest to the student be- cause of its confusion both of history and of policy [...] that of covenants running with the land [...] the subject of party wall covenants seems especially attractive. Here we have a form of covenant which has appealed to most courts as a sensible and desirable arrangement for the use and development of realty. Yet current legal theory is against the validity of such an agree- ment as a running covenant, passing with the <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land.</b> As might be expected, the courts tend to follow their natural instincts, such covenants are being more and more generally upheld, and legal theory is left to stew in the difficulties of its own concocting. It is proposed herein to reexamine the problem, {{with a view of}} testing the soundness of such legal theory and of determining whether current judicial practice does violate the policy of applicable and analogous legal rules. The cases on the subject were carefully collected and analyzed some years ago by Professor Ralph W. Aigler in a learned and excellent article, and hence we need not repeat that task but may confine ourselves to a consideration of the principles thought to underlie the problem...|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> {{legality}} <b>of</b> Virginia's confiscation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Neck Proprietary lands {{continued to}} be contested {{in state and federal}} courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proprietary's <b>lands,</b> arguing that <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jay Treaty with <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v.

The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v.

On October 3, 1836, after Texas Independence, Menard sold <b>the</b> <b>land</b> to Thomas F. McKinney on behalf of Seguin. Then, in order to settle <b>the</b> legality <b>of</b> Seguin's original ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> Menard led a group of ten men who were petitioning the Texas Government to recognize <b>the</b> 1833 <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galveston Island <b>land</b> from Mexico to Seguin.

White concluded several times {{that the federal government}} fully intended to convey riparian rights to the new landowners because the government and its agents repeatedly indicated in letters, memoranda, contracts of sale, and other documents and statements its expectation that the waterside landowners were to build and maintain docks, wharves, and quays and improve the riparian rights they enjoyed. To assume otherwise, White concluded, was nonsensical. [...] Either the federal government intended to convey riparian rights, or the government deceptively contemplated building Water Street and cutting the new landowners off from their access. [...] "...the first hypothesis is the one naturally to be assumed." [...] "The contracts for <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> water lots with riparian rights attached, <b>the</b> reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surveyors, and <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commissioners, all blend into a harmonious and perfect whole, working from an original conception to a successful consummation of a well-understood result.
