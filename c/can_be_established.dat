5|$|The casting for the opera's premiere is uncertain. While the {{participation}} of singers such as La Florinda and Francesco Rasi <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established,</b> sources have speculated on the involvement of other singers. There are several versions of the published libretto; the list of roles is taken from the publication by Gherardo & Iseppo Imberti, Venice 1622.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{speculation}} that the assassination of Spanish prime minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo by Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo in 1897 was at least supported or influenced by Betances, and possibly even planned by him (although there is no physical link that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established</b> that might link Betances to the event itself).|$|E
5|$|An {{order for}} review of {{detention}} directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that {{the legality of the}} detention <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established.</b> The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E

5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs {{have been found to}} be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the market}} for sculpture, plagued by fakes, {{the value of a}} piece {{increases}} significantly when its provenance <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established.</b> A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8 million in 1999, and Rodin's bronze Eve, grand modele– version sans rocher sold for $18.9 million at a 2008 Christie's auction in New York. Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued that taking a cast does not equal reproducing a Rodin sculpture– especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin's work.|$|E
5|$|Oslac's origins {{are unclear}} and no {{specific}} relationship with any previous known figure <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established</b> from available sources. Oslac's name suggests to some historians {{that he was}} a Norseman. Dorothy Whitelock points out that the name Oslac is often an anglicisation of the Old Scandinavian name Áslákr, while the writers of the Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain entry on Oslac comment that the name suggests an origin in the Danelaw, a suggestion supported by the fact that Thored, Oslac's son, held lands in Cambridgeshire.|$|E

5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after the find was made, and when the {{remaining}} objects were recovered, {{it was discovered that}} the other ring had been cut into at least four pieces by a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged to the point of illegibility. Fortunately, detailed drawings, a cast, and a photograph made by London's Arundel Society of the ring before it was damaged survive, {{and the nature of the}} lost character <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established</b> with relative certainty.|$|E
5|$|The wall {{contained}} nine main gates, which pierced {{both the}} inner and the outer walls, {{and a number of}} smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates is debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established</b> directly from the literary evidence.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{historical}} record {{of events in}} Iron Age Britain, so archaeological investigation {{is the only way}} to reconstruct the history of Danebury, and other such hill forts. It is impossible to state with certainty every significant event in the hill fort’s history, but where an event leaves an archaeologically identifiable trace, a general chronology <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established,</b> although dates are much less easy to establish. The hill fort was occupied from the mid-6th centuryBC until around 100BC, and the defences were remodelled numerous times.|$|E

5|$|Coins are {{the only}} items in the Hoxne Hoard for which a {{definite}} date and place of manufacture <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established.</b> All of the gold coins, {{and many of the}} silver coins, bear the names and portraits of the emperor in whose reign they were minted. Most also retain the original mint marks that identify where they were minted, illustrating the Roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design. The coins' manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources: Trier, Arles and Lyon (in Gaul), Ravenna, Milan, Aquileia, Rome (in modern Italy); Siscia (modern Croatia), Sirmium (modern Serbia), Thessaloniki (Greece), Constantinople, Cyzicus, Nicomedia, and Antioch (modern Turkey).|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported {{and is not a}} wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>established.</b> The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.|$|E
