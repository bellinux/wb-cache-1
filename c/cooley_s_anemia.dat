The main outcome measures were height-for-age Z-score (HAZ), body-mass-index Z-score (BMIZ), triceps skinfold Z-score, hemoglobin, and fecal occult blood loss. Multivariate models were created to assess the relationship between S. japonicum infection and nutritional status after adjusting for age, gender, other helminths, and SES. After controlling for confounders, intensity of S. japonicum infection was inversely related to hemoglobin in all age groups (P < 0. 0001) and HAZ among children 12 years (P 0. 03), but not to BMIZ (P 0. 52) or triceps skinfold Z-score (P 0. 11). Individuals with high-intensity S. japonicum infection were 3. 5 {{times more likely to have}} occult blood in the stool.

Os mecanismos genéticos desta influência são avaliados em análises moleculares dos genes da globina humana. Com o objetivo de verificar a presença de talassemia alfa em portadores de hemoglobina S em heterozigose, com presença de anemia, encaminhados ao Laboratório de Hemoglobinas do Departamento de Biologia da UNESP, de São José do Rio Preto, analisamos 1. 002 amostras de sangue com traço falciforme, no período de 1990 a 1998. As amostras foram colhidas com EDTA como anticoagulante, após prévia autorização dos portadores. Para o diagnóstico laboratorial as amostras de sangue foram submetidas a procedimentos eletroforéticos em pH alcalino e ácido e pesquisa citológica de hemoglobina H. Os procedimentos eletroforéticos confirmaram a presença de hemoglobina AS. A pesquisa citológica evidenciou a presença de talassemia alfa. Deste total analisado, 16 (1, 59 %) amostras de sangue apresentaram a associação entre hemoglobina AS e alfa talassemia, sendo que duas eram de indivíduos de uma mesma família. Os resultados obtidos nos direcionaram a sugerir aos laboratórios de rotina que realizem a pesquisa de alfa talassemia entre os portadores de hemoglobina AS, com presença de anemia, para verificar a interação com talassemia alfa, fornecendo assim aos portadores informação importante sobre seu perfil hematológico. Sickle Cell {{disease is}} a generic term {{for a group of}} genetic {{disorders}} characterized by the predominance of hemoglobin S. These disorders include Sickle Cell anemia, the Sickle Cell beta Thalassemia syndromes, and Hemoglobinopathies in which hemoglobin S is in association with another abnormal hemoglobin, such as hemoglobin S/C. The Sickle Cell trait (hemoglobin AS) associated with Alpha Thalassemia presents alterations in the red blood cells morphology, usually absent in the heterozygous for this hemoglobin variant. The interaction between hemoglobin S and alpha Thalassemia has been described as one of the factors responsible for the improvement in the clinical picture of homozygous of hemoglobin <b>S</b> (Sickle Cell <b>Anemia),</b> decreasing the number of episodes of pain. The genetic mechanisms of this influence are evaluated using molecular analyses of the human globin genes. With the objective of verifying the presence of alpha Thalassemia in heterozygous of hemoglobin <b>S,</b> with <b>anemia,</b> sent to the Laboratory of Hemoglobins, Department of Biology, UNESP, São José do Rio Preto, SP, we analyzed 1002 blood samples with Sickle Cell trait, in the period from 1990 to 1998.

The primary objective {{of this study was}} to assess the role of occult blood loss in mediating <b>S.</b> japonicum-associated <b>anemia</b> after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and other helminth infections. The secondary objective was to identify intensity categories of risk for occult blood loss for Trichuris and hookworm after adjustment for the presence of other helminth infections. The role of occult blood loss in mediating <b>S.</b> japonicum-associated <b>anemia</b> was studied cross-sectionally in 729 individuals 8 − 30 years old in Leyte, The Philippines. Three stool specimens were examined in duplicate for helminth eggs. Hemoglobin, fecal occult blood loss, and anemia were measured and related to the presence and intensity of helminths. Multivariate models were made to adjust for con-founding by other helminths and SES. In multivariate models, hemoglobin significantly decreased with increasing infection intensity of S. japonicum, hookworm, and T. trichuria (P < 0. 0031, P < 0. 0001, and P < 0. 0001, respectively). Individuals with higher intensities S. japonicum and T. trichuria were significantly more likely to be fecal occult positive (odds ratio [OR] 3. 54; P 0. 008 and OR 2. 68; P 0. 013, respectively), although this was not true for individuals with hookworm. Additionally, individuals with higher intensities of S. japonicum, hookworm, and T. trichuria were all more likely to be anemic (OR 3. 7, P 0. 0002; OR 5. 3, P 0. 0003; and OR 1. 6, P 0. 021, respectively).

40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a {{term for}} a group of genetic {{disorders}} characterized by the production of hemoglobin <b>S,</b> <b>anemia,</b> and acute and chronic tissue damage. Primarily African Americans are affected by SCD in the United States with an estimated incidence of 1 in every 375 live births for the most common form, homozygous SS disease (Sickle Cell Disease Guideline Panel, 1993). The course and severity of SCD are highly unpredictable. Morbidity and complications directly impact {{the quality of life of}} affected individuals and their families. A diagnosis of SCD no longer means an early death. The average life span of a person with SS disease has increased from about 14 years in 1973 to a median age of death in the 19902 ̆ 7 s among males at 42 years and females at 48 years (Bloom, 1995; Platt et al., 1994).

Bessis (5) noted a fine network of fibrils oriented preferentially in the long axis of the cells, and stated that the thickness of the fibrils seemed to range around 200 A. Stetso...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a misguided}} {{perception}} that RF spectrum space is fully allocated and fully used though even a superficial study of actual spectrum usage by measuring local RF energy shows it largely empty of radiation. Traditional regulation uses a fence-off policy, in which competing uses are isolated by frequency and/or geography. We seek to modernize this strategy. Given advances in radio technology {{that can lead}} to fully cooperative broadcast, relay, and reception designs, we begin by studying the existing radio environment in a qualitative manner. We wish to objectively understand the purpose of a particular transmission, its threshold of allowable interference, and whether anyone is attempting to receive it. We wish to propose ways in which cognitive radio systems might coexist with legacy radio systems. In Chapter 1, we review the conditions that led to the current regulatory climate. Chapter 2 discusses the purpose of this thesis and how the work done relates to cognitive radio technologies. Chapter 3 discuses the design of data capture and analysis modules used to better understand RF spectrum space usage. Chapter 4 applies the software modules to a range of spectrum space and evaluates the results. by James E. <b>Cooley.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

40|$|Sickle Cell {{disease is}} a generic term {{for a group of}} genetic {{disorders}} characterized by the predominance of hemoglobin S. These disorders include Sickle Cell anemia, the Sickle Cell beta Thalassemia syndromes and Hemoglobinopathies in which hemoglobin S is in association with another abnormal hemoglobin, such as hemoglobin S/C. The Sickle Cell trait (hemoglobin AS) associated with Alpha Thalassemia presents alterations in the red blood cells morphology, usually absent in the heterozygous for this hemoglobin variant. The interaction between hemoglobin Sand alpha Thalassemia has been described as one of the factors responsible for the improvement in the clinical picture of homozygous of hemoglobin <b>S</b> (Sickle Cell <b>Anemia),</b> decreasing the number of episodes of pain. The genetic mechanisms of this influence are evaluated using molecular analyses of the human globin genes. With the objective of verifying the presence of alpha Thalassemia in heterozygous of hemoglobin <b>S,</b> with <b>anemia,</b> sent to the Laboratory of Hemoglobins, Department of Biology, UNESP, São José do Rio Preto, SP, we analyzed 1002 blood samples with Sickle Cell trait, in the period from 1990 to 1998. The samples were picked with EDTA 5 % as anticoagulant, after previous authorization of the carriers. Appropriated counseling and management requires definitive diagnosis. For the laboratorial diagnosis the blood samples were submitted to electrophoretic procedures in alkaline and acid pH and cytological evaluation of hemoglobin H. The electrophoretic procedures confirmed the presence of hemoglobin AS. The cytological evaluation evidenced the presence of alpha Thalassemia. Of this total analyzed, 16 (1, 59 %) blood samples presented the association between hemoglobin AS and alpha Thalassemia and two individuals belonged of the same family. Our results addressed us to suggest to the routine laboratories, that is important to accomplish the research of alpha Thalassemia among the Sickle Cell trait, with anemia, to verify the interaction with alpha Thalassemia, supplying to the carriers a important information on its hematological profile, genetic pattern of hemoglobinopathies and the appropriated counseling.

50|$|David Lawrence Gregg {{was born}} in Pennsylvania on July 21, 1819. He moved west and settled in Joliet, Illinois, to {{practice}} law. He edited the Juliet Courier, the first paper in Will County, Illinois. Gregg {{was elected to the}} Illinois House of Representatives in 1842, serving two two-year terms. Gregg then accepted an appointment by President James K. Polk as United States Attorney for the District of Illinois. He was a delegate to the Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1847, representing Cook County. In 1850, he was named the Illinois Secretary of State as a Democrat, filling the unexpired term of the deceased Horace <b>S.</b> <b>Cooley.</b> Gregg was then re-elected to a two-year term. He then was a presidential elector for the 1852 election. He was a leading candidate in 1852 for the Democratic nomination as Governor of Illinois, but was defeated by Joel Aldrich Matteson.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the natural history of}} homozygous <b>S</b> sickle <b>anemia</b> in two sisters who have completely different morbidity patterns. Medical records beginning in May 1976 from the Urban League Sickle Cell program and my office, hospital records, and personal interviews were used. The sisters were older than 20 years when the diagnosis was made. Both had two essentially uneventful pregnancies, and neither was treated with prophylactic transfusions during the pregnancies. One sister has a hemoglobin F level of 23 %, has been hospitalized only 15 times to date, and has no gallstones. The other sister has a hemoglobin F level below 3 %, has been hospitalized more than 148 times to date, and had a cholecystectomy in 1979. Clinical symptoms in sickle cell patients with high levels of hemoglobin F is reportedly mild, and this has been supported by this study. Likewise, the conclusion by some investigators that prophylactic blood transfusions during pregnancy are unnecessary also has been supported. While many exciting investigative approaches relative to management and prevention of sickle cell anemia continue, it is equally important to maintain emphasis on the variables that encourage and facilitate positive psychosocial adaptations by these patients...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: To {{determine}} whether point-of-care (POC) International Normalized Ratio (INR) test results correlate with plasma INR measures in intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) patients on warfarin. Anemia {{is thought to}} reduce the accuracy of POC INR assay results. Whether POC INR testing could be implemented for hemodialysis patients on chronic warfarin, who are often anemic despite hematopoietic therapy, has not been established. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Thirty-seven chronic hemodialysis patients on warfarin contributed sets of three consecutive blood samples for INR comparison immediately before hemodialysis: one finger stick, two from hemodi-alysis access (arteriovenous graft, fistula, or catheter). POC INR testing was performed using CoaguChek <b>S</b> device. <b>Anemia</b> was defined as hematocrit 0. 6 INR units, four (1. 6 %) differed by> 0. 8 INR units, and one differed by> 1. 0 INR units. Resulting pairwise correlation analyses between samples were: for anemic patients (0. 96; P < 0. 001), nonanemic patients (0. 93; P < 0. 001), and for those obtained from arteriovenous grafts (0. 94; P < 0. 001). POC INR samples from dialysis catheters correlated poorly with laboratory INR results. Conclusions: POC INR correlates well with plasma INR measures in IHD patients requiring chronic warfarin, and anemia did not influence this reliability. Blood sampling from finger stick or arteriovenous graft or fistula showed excellen...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{relationship}} between schistosomiasis and anemia, although the magnitude and exact mechanisms involved are unclear. In a cohort of 580 Schistosoma japonicum-infected 7 - to 30 -year-old patients from Leyte, The Philippines, we evaluated the impact of reinfection with S. japonicum after treatment with praziquantel on the mean hemoglobin level, iron-deficiency (IDA) and non-iron-deficiency anemia (NIDA), and inflammatory markers. All participants were treated at baseline and followed up every 3 months {{for a total of}} 18 months. At each follow-up, participants provided stools to quantify reinfection and venous blood samples for hemograms and measures of iron status and inflammation. After 18 months, reinfection with S. japonicum was associated with a lower mean hemoglobin level (− 0. 39 g/dl; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], − 0. 63 to − 0. 16) and 1. 70 (95 % CI, 1. 10 to 2. 61) times higher odds of all-cause anemia than those without reinfection. Reinfection was associated with IDA for high reinfection intensities only. Conversely, reinfection was associated with NIDA for all infection intensities. Reinfection was associated with serum interleukin- 6 responses (P < 0. 01), and these responses were associated with NIDA (P = 0. 019) but not with IDA (P = 0. 29). Our results provide strong evidence for the causal relationship between S. japonicum infection and anemia. Rapidly reinfected individuals did not have the positive treatment effect on hemoglobin seen in nonreinfected individuals. The principle mechanism involved in <b>S.</b> japonicum-associated <b>anemia</b> is that of proinflammatory cytokine-mediated anemia, with iron deficiency playing a role in high-intensity infections. Based on the proposed mechanism, anemia is unlikely to be ameliorated by iron therapy alone...|$|R

APO was founded by Frank Reed Horton and 13 other {{students}} who were former Boy Scouts and scouters, {{as a way to}} continue participating in the ideals of Scouting at the college level. These founding brothers were Frank Reed Horton, Everett William Probst, Ephraim Moyer Detwiler Jr., Thane Sanford Cooley, William Taylor Wood, Lewis Burnett Blair, Gordon Minnier Looney, Donald LeRoy Terwilliger, William Weber Highberger, Robert Jefferson Green, Donald H. Fritts, Ellsworth Stewart Dobson, George Axel Olsen, and Herbert Heinrich. Six advisors were also inducted: Lafayette President John H. MacCracken, Dean Donald B. Prentice, Professors D. Arthur Hatch and Harry T. Spengler; one local Scouting official, Herbert G. Horton, and one national Scouting official, the national director of relationships for the Boy Scouts of America, Ray O. Wyland. The founders insisted that all those gaining membership must pledge to uphold the fraternity's three cardinal principles of Leadership, Friendship, and Service. Of these important founding members, a few made extremely notable and important contributions to APO that we still recognize today. Everett Probst designed the pin and coat of arms, Thane <b>S.</b> <b>Cooley</b> suggested the hand clasp during the toast song, and Elsworth Dobson & Gordon M. Looney helped write the constitution and bylaws.|$|R
