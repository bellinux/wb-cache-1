5|$|The {{historic}} Fort at Lahaina, {{facing the}} Lahaina Harbor, is now {{represented by a}} partial reconstruction at the southern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the park. Lahaina Fort was demolished in 1854. However, in 1964, the State Parks Department reconstructed a part of old fort wall in the southwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the park which was the venue for the 1961 feature film, The Devil at 4 O'Clock.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} two {{ancillary}} buildings that store station equipment. Ancillary 1 {{is at the}} northeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Second Avenue and 93rd Street, while ancillary 2 is at the SW <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Second Avenue and 97th Street. The Metropolitan Hospital Center is one block {{to the north of}} the station's northernmost entrance.|$|E
25|$|The book of Leviticus in the Torah makes mention <b>of</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the head, and {{prohibits the}} marring <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the beard, with {{particular}} emphasis on priests not marring the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the beard; as with {{many other parts of}} Leviticus, the Book of Ezekiel describes different regulations, stating that the priests should not shave their heads, or let their locks grow long.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Four Classical Elements; {{this classic}} diagram has two squares {{on top of}} each other, with the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> one being the {{classical}} elements, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the other being the properties ...|$|R
50|$|For {{chemical}} compounds with regular lattices such as sodium chloride and caesium chloride, {{a count of}} the nearest neighbors gives a good picture of {{the environment of the}} ions. In sodium chloride each sodium ion has 6 chloride ions as nearest neighbours (at 276 pm) at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> an octahedron and each chloride ion has 6 sodium atoms (also at 276 pm) at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> an octahedron. In caesium chloride each caesium has 8 chloride ions (at 356 pm) situated at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a cube and each chloride has eight caesium ions (also at 356 pm) at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a cube.|$|R
5|$|There {{are public}} {{athletic}} fields at the Jim R. Griggs Sports Complex, {{located at the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Florida Avenue and Fairgrounds Road, and the Travis C. Hooser Ballfield Complex (also called Walker Field) located at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> U.S. Route 70 and Walker Road.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{staircase}} exits: two {{going up to}} the northeastern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the intersection of Grand and Chrystie Streets, and one {{going up to the}} northwestern corner. The station originally only had the two street stairs to the northeastern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the intersection, but due to growing ridership over the years—mainly by commuters from various Brooklyn neighborhoods to Manhattan's Chinatown—the third staircase to the northwestern corner was added in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Truck M-78 was {{a former}} truck route through the city of Lansing. It started at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Capitol Avenue and Main Street and ran along Main Street to Grand Avenue. There, it turned north on Grand Avenue to Kalamazoo Street and turned east on Kalamazoo over the Grand River. At Larch Street, Truck M-78 {{continued}} north to rejoin the mainline at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Larch and Saginaw streets.|$|E
50|$|The cheek bulges, and {{the wide}} and deep {{depression}} below them, suggest a muscular arrangement associated with the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the mouth, whereby {{it is possible for}} such an animal to pull the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the mouth forwards as is characteristic of mammals, while in true reptiles the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the mouth are fixed and very close to the articulation of the lower jaw. This is a significant arrangement, because even with a secondary palate an animal {{would not be able to}} suck unless the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the mouth can be brought forward, allowing the mouth as a whole to close properly around the teat of a milk gland.|$|R
50|$|When {{viewed from}} the top, metal {{counterweight}} is basically rectangular, typically with 45-degree angle chamfers cut at two opposing corners. A slot is cut into {{each end of the}} weight so as to enable the weight to straddle, and be laterally secured by, the arbor rods. In order to facilitate removal of weights with angle cuts, it is customary to stack the weights in alternating orientations so that the square <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> any weight will be aligned with the angled <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> adjacent weights. This simplifies removal because the square <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> each weight protrude beyond the angled <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the weight below, serving as handles that can be easily gripped, even with gloved hands.|$|R
50|$|There are two exit points, {{each with}} one {{stairway}} {{to each side}} of Stillwell Avenue: one at both northern <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> Harway Avenue at the station's extreme south end, and the other at both southern <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> Bay 50th Street in the middle.|$|R

50|$|The {{coordination}} {{number of}} each atom {{in the structure}} is 8: the central cation is coordinated to 8 anions on the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a cube as shown, and similarly, the central anion is coordinated to 8 cations on the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a cube.|$|R

5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} the 2 D coordinates of N points, we select the points with rigid body invariance, {{such as the}} nose tip, <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> eyes, and mouth. In the work, there are six points including the nose tip, chin, left, and right <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> eyes and mouth.|$|R
50|$|Classic {{cases of}} metal {{failures}} due to stress concentrations include metal fatigue at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> {{the windows of}} the De Havilland Comet aircraft and brittle fractures at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> hatches in Liberty ships in cold and stressful conditions in winter storms in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
5000|$|A classic diagram has one square {{inscribed in}} the other, with the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> one being the {{classical}} elements, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the other being the properties.

5|$|Bayswater tube station, on the Circle and District lines, is also {{close to}} Queensway {{station and the}} north-west <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the park. High Street Kensington tube station, on the Circle and District {{is very close to}} Kensington Palace located on the Southwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Kensington Gardens. Paddington station, served by Bakerloo, Circle and District, and Hammersmith & City lines, is close to Lancaster Gate station and a short walk away from Hyde Park.|$|E

5000|$|Batter boards (or battre boards, Sometimes mispronounced as [...] "battle boads") are {{temporary}} frames, set {{beyond the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a planned foundation at precise elevations.

50|$|This {{is known}} as the Chautisa Yantra. Each row, column, and diagonal, as well as each 2×2 sub-square, the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> each 3×3 and 4×4 square, the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> each 2×4 and 4×2 rectangle, and the offset diagonals (12+8+5+9, 1+11+16+6, 14+2+3+15 and 7+11+10+6, 12+2+5+15, 1+13+16+4) sum to 34.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{pyramidal}} roof on {{towers of}} square plan. Each {{of the four}} sides of the roof is rhomboid in form, with the long diagonal running from the apex of roof to one <b>of</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the supporting tower. Each side of the tower is topped with an even triangular gable from the peak of which runs a ridge to {{the apex of the}} roof. Thus the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the pyramidical roof do not correspond with the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the tower but with the peaks of the gables.|$|R
