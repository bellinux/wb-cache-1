5|$|Pots and vessels {{were also}} recovered. Pots {{were used for}} cooking, while the large vessels for food import from Oman and Mesopotamia. Artifacts found there {{indicates}} the location. These include a cuneiform inscription and hematite, both of which link to Mesopotamia; steatite bowls to Oman; and <b>carnelian</b> beads, a stone weight and a few potsherds to the Indus Civilization.|$|E
5|$|The written sources do {{not offer}} deep insight on {{the economy of the}} kingdom; it counted mainly on {{agriculture}} during the Middle Bronze Age but, by the Late Bronze Age, it became based on trade with surrounding regions. Securing raw materials scarce near the city was an important concern for the rulers; basalt was an important building tool and it was probably acquired from the Salamiyah region or Al-Rastan. Calcite was provided from either the Syrian coast or Egypt, amber came from the Baltic region, while regions in modern Afghanistan provided <b>carnelian</b> and lapis-lazul.|$|E
5|$|Achaemenid ruler Cyrus the Great conquered Sogdiana while {{campaigning in}} Central Asia in 546–539 BC, a fact {{mentioned}} {{by the ancient}} Greek historian Herodotus in his Histories. Darius I introduced the Aramaic writing system and coin currency to Central Asia, in addition to incorporating Sogdians into his standing army as regular soldiers and cavalrymen. A contingent of Sogdian soldiers fought in the main army of Xerxes I during his ultimately failed invasion of Greece in 480 BC. A Persian inscription from Susa claims that the palace there was adorned with lapis lazuli and <b>carnelian</b> originating from Sogdiana.|$|E

5|$|During the Achaemenid period (550–330 BC), the Sogdians {{lived as}} a nomadic people {{much like the}} {{neighboring}} Yuezhi, who spoke Bactrian, an Indo-Iranian language closely related to Sogdian, and were already engaging in overland trade. Some of them had also gradually settled the land to engage in agriculture. Similar to how the Yuezhi offered tributary gifts of jade to the emperors of China, the Sogdians are recorded in Persian records as submitting precious gifts of lapis lazuli and <b>carnelian</b> to Darius I, the Persian king of kings. Although the Sogdians were at times independent and living outside the boundaries of large empires, they never formed a great empire of their own like the Yuezhi, who established the Kushan Empire (30–375 AD) of Central and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|Human {{occupation}} {{dates back}} to the Beaker culture of the late Bronze Age. There is also evidence of an Iron Age hill fort and prehistoric barrows and field systems. There is evidence of a shrine dating from pre-Roman times, which was re-established as a Romano-Celtic Temple in the mid-4th century. According to at least one source, it is extremely likely this was succeeded by a small late-4th-century Christian oratory. Several Roman finds including gold coins of Augustus, Nero, and Drusus, two silver denarii of Vespasian and a Roman <b>carnelian</b> ring were found at the site during quarrying.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{had been}} {{extensively}} plundered by tomb robbers during antiquity, yet numerous stone vessels and earthen jars remained. Some {{of the stone}} vessels had copper-coated rims and {{are similar to the}} better known finds from tomb of Khasekhemwy. Vessels from preceding rulers such as Nynetjer and Raneb were also found. Beads and bracelets made of fayence and <b>carnelian</b> and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king Hor Aha and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib. The two stone stelae from the entrance, common to burial chambers of the First and Second dynasties, are now on display in two different museums.|$|E

50|$|The altarpiece is 3 meters (9.8 ft) wide by 2 meters (6.6 ft) tall. It {{is made of}} {{gold and}} silver, 187 enamel plaques, and 1,927 gems. These include 526 pearls, 330 garnets, 320 emeralds, 255 sapphires, 183 amethysts, 175 agates, 75 rubies, 34 topazes, 16 <b>carnelians,</b> and 13 jaspers.|$|R
5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, <b>carnelian,</b> amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from <b>carnelian</b> and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and <b>carnelian</b> dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked {{deposits of}} emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.|$|E

60|$|Often, {{the surest}} way to convey {{misinformation}} is to tell the strict truth. The describers of the Taj have used the word gem in its strictest sense--its scientific sense. In that sense it is a mild word, and promises but little to the eye--nothing bright, nothing brilliant, nothing sparkling, nothing splendid in the way of color. It accurately describes the sober and unobtrusive gem-work of the Taj; that is, to the very highly-educated one person in a thousand; but it most falsely describes it to the 999. But the 999 are the people who ought to be especially taken care of, and to them it does not mean quiet-colored designs wrought in <b>carnelians,</b> or agates, or such things; they know the word in its wide and ordinary sense only, and so to them it means diamonds and rubies and opals and their kindred, and the moment their eyes fall upon it in print they see a vision of glorious colors clothed in fire.|$|R
60|$|But {{why should}} thunderbolts, whether stone axes or flint arrowheads, be preserved, not merely as curiosities, but from motives of superstition? The reason {{is a simple}} one. Everybody knows that in all magical ceremonies it is {{necessary}} to have something belonging to the person you wish to conjure against, in order to make your spells effectual. A bone, be it but a joint of the little finger, is sufficient to raise the ghost to which it once belonged; cuttings of hair or clippings of nails are enough to put their owner magically in your power; and that is the reason why, if you are a prudent person, you will always burn all such off-castings of your body, lest haply an enemy should get hold of them, and cast the evil eye upon you with their potent aid. In the same way, if you can lay hands upon anything that once belonged to an elf, such as a fairy-bolt or flint arrowhead, you can get its former possessor to do anything you wish by simply rubbing it and calling upon him to appear. This is the secret of half the charms and amulets in existence, most of which are either real old arrowheads, or <b>carnelians</b> cut in the same shape, which has now mostly degenerated from the barb to the conventional heart, and been mistakenly associated with the idea of love. This is the secret, too, of all the rings, lamps, gems, and boxes, possession of which gives a man power over fairies, spirits, gnomes, and genii. All magic proceeds upon the prime belief that you must possess something belonging to the person you wish to control, constrain, or injure. And, failing anything else, you must at least have a wax image of him, which you call by his name, and use as his substitute in your incantations.|$|R
5000|$|Andrea Picchi, born in Florence in 1823, was a {{well-known}} ebonist who framed {{works of art}} for aristocratic clients ("Prestigious orders from imperial and aristocratic customers rolled in for ANDREA PICCHI and Paolo Fanfani, designers in some respects imprisioned by a past both sought after and beloved but also perhaps hortus conclusus and extremely difficult to escape") (1). For Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna Romanova, he framed a pair of tondi after paintings by Fra Angelico (15th century), executed by Diomede della Bruna, a Florentine painter born in 1839 ( [...] "Elaborate, octagonal Baroque style frame with flame-carved border, ebony with part-gilt bronze fittings and 16 set <b>carnelians</b> each. On the verso the Florentine frame maker's label [...] "Ebanista Andrea Picchi". 46 cm diameter each"). (2) He also framed for Umberto I and his wife Queen Margherita of Savoy,two works by Tito Chelazzi - an oil painting of daisies (after the queen's name, Margherita, which means [...] "daisy") and a mirror (roses thea painted on glass) the royal couple had commissioned from this painter, he too a sought after artist by European royal families. After some years in Via della Vigna Nuova, Picchi moved to Via Maggio,28, where he developed his artistry in carving ebony, a dense yet fine textured black wood. But his masterpiece in carving would be the excepcionally beautiful ebony and ivory cabinet {{in the style of}} the Italian Renaissance Picchi presented in the 1867 Paris Exhibition, though with [...] "a marked similarity in this design to that of a 17th century cabinet(...)"as Frederick Litchfiel points out in his History of Furniture(3). In fact, when comparing the pictures of the two cabinets in Litchfiel's book, one may doubt if it is a mere coincidence or not. Nevertheless Picchi's cabinet remains a jewel of carving and an example of mastering ivory and ebony.Now in oblivion, only his oval stamp on the verso of some ebony framed works of the 19th century calls out [...] "Andrea Picchi, ebanista, Via Maggio, No. 28, Firenze".|$|R
25|$|Sumerian potters {{decorated}} pots with cedar oil paints. The potters used a bow {{drill to}} produce the fire needed for baking the pottery. Sumerian masons and jewelers knew and made use of alabaster (calcite), ivory, iron, gold, silver, <b>carnelian,</b> and lapis lazuli.|$|E
25|$|Jewellery in Mesopotamia {{tended to}} be {{manufactured}} from thin metal leaf and was set {{with large numbers of}} brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate, lapis, <b>carnelian,</b> and jasper). Favoured shapes included leaves, spirals, cones, and bunches of grapes. Jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols. They employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques, such as cloisonné, engraving, fine granulation, and filigree.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the other}} finds of this Period are: small blades of {{chalcedony}} and agate, sometimes serrated or backed; beads of steatite, shell, <b>carnelian,</b> terracotta and copper; bangles of copper, shell and terracotta; terracotta objects like a toy-cart, wheel {{and a broken}} bull; quem with mullers, a bone point, and copper celts, including an unusual axe, etc. Toy carts suggest carts were used for transportation in early phase of Kalibangan.|$|E
25|$|Jacques Guay (1711–93) was a French {{gemstone}} engraver, a protegé of Madame de Pompadour (1721–1764), {{mistress of}} King Louis XV of France (1710–74). He {{was the most}} eminent gemstone engraver of his time, the official engraver of the king, and produced many cameo and intaglio engravings in semi-precious stones such as onyx, jasper and <b>carnelian.</b> Subjects included classical figures, events in {{the reign of the}} king and portraits of members of the court.|$|E
25|$|While Shoshenq's tomb is {{currently}} unknown, the burial {{of one of}} his prominent state officials at Thebes, the Third Prophet of Amun Djedptahiufankh, was discovered intact in Tomb DB320 in the 19th Century. Inscriptions on Djedptahiufankh's Mummy bandages show that he died in or after Year 11 of this king. His Mummy was discovered to contain various gold bracelets, amulets and precious <b>carnelian</b> objects and give a small hint of the vast treasures that would have adorned Shoshenq I's tomb.|$|E
25|$|This period {{corresponds}} in {{an archaeological}} context to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture. Especially focused in the Central Ganges plain but also spreading across vast {{areas of the}} northern and central Indian subcontinent, this culture {{is characterized by the}} emergence of large cities with massive fortifications, significant population growth, increased social stratification, wide-ranging trade networks, construction of public architecture and water channels, specialized craft industries (e.g., ivory and <b>carnelian</b> carving), a system of weights, punch-marked coins, and the introduction of writing in the form of Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts.|$|E
25|$|Imports to Ur {{came from}} various {{regions of the}} Near East and the Old World. Discoveries of goods from remote {{locations}} such as obsidian from Turkey, lapis lazuli from Badakhshan in Afghanistan, beads from Bahrain, and seals inscribed with the Indus Valley script from India suggested a wide-ranging network of ancient trade centered on the Persian Gulf. Metals of all types had to be imported. Both Sumerian stonemasons and jewelers knew and made use of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, chlorite, ivory, iron, and <b>carnelian.</b> The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen Puabi at Ur, indicated that resin was traded {{from as far away}} as Mozambique.|$|E
25|$|Over the centuries, trade developed. Egyptian caravans carried grain to Kush and {{returned}} to Aswan with ivory, incense, hides, and <b>carnelian</b> (a stone prized both as jewellery and for arrowheads) for shipment downriver. Egyptian governors particularly valued gold in Nubia and soldiers in the pharaoh's army. Egyptian military expeditions penetrated Kush periodically during the Old Kingdom. Yet there was no attempt to establish a permanent presence in the area until the Middle Kingdom (c.2100-1720BC), when Egypt constructed a network of forts along the Nile {{as far south as}} Samnah in Lower Egypt to guard the flow of gold from mines in Wawat, the area between the First and Second Cataracts.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{central and}} {{southern}} Vietnam were not originally part of the Vietnamese state. The peoples of those areas developed a distinct culture from the ancient Vietnamese in the Red River Delta region. For instance, the 1st millennium BC Sa Huỳnh culture {{in the areas of}} present-day central Vietnam revealed a considerable use of iron and decorative items made from glass, semi-precious and precious stones such as agate, <b>carnelian,</b> rock crystal, amethyst, and nephrite. The culture also showed evidence of an extensive trade network. The Sa Huỳnh people were most likely the predecessors of the Cham people, an Austronesian-speaking people and the founders of the kingdom of Champa.|$|E
25|$|The first written {{evidence}} mentioning the city {{comes from the}} nearby city of Ebla, c. 1800 BCE. Ugarit passed into the sphere of influence of Egypt, which deeply influenced its art. Evidence of the earliest Ugaritic contact with Egypt (and the first exact dating of Ugaritic civilization) comes from a <b>carnelian</b> bead identified with the Middle Kingdom pharaoh Senusret I, 1971–1926 BC. A stela and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been found. However, it is unclear at what time these monuments were brought to Ugarit. Amarna letters from Ugarit c. 1350 BCE record one letter each from Ammittamru I, Niqmaddu II, and his queen.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptian use of {{turquoise}} stretches {{back as far}} as the First Dynasty {{and possibly}} earlier; however, probably the most well-known pieces incorporating the gem are those recovered from Tutankhamun's tomb, most notably the Pharaoh's iconic burial mask which was liberally inlaid with the stone. It also adorned rings and great sweeping necklaces called pectorals. Set in gold, the gem was fashioned into beads, used as inlay, and often carved in a scarab motif, accompanied by <b>carnelian,</b> lapis lazuli, and in later pieces, coloured glass. Turquoise, associated with the goddess Hathor, was so liked by the Ancient Egyptians that it became (arguably) the first gemstone to be imitated, the fair structure created by an artificial glazed ceramic product known as faience.|$|E
25|$|Signet rings have a flat bezel, usually {{wider than}} the rest of the hoop, which is decorated, {{normally}} in intaglio, so that it will leave a raised (relief) impression of the design when the ring is pressed onto soft sealing wax or a similar material. They have been used since ancient times as the personal seal of an individual. In recent times the design is generally a crest, made by engraving, either in metal or engraved gems (generally semiprecious). Agate is a frequent material, especially <b>carnelian</b> or banded agate like sardonyx; the banding makes the impression contrast with the ground. Most smaller classical engraved gems were probably originally worn as signet rings, or as seals on a necklace. Metal signet rings can also be cast, which may be cheaper but yields a weaker material.|$|E
