As {{a result of a}} complex of engineering-geological and geophysical surveys, it is established that the significant deformations of the foundations of the structure are caused by the zones of weakened (unconsolidated) soil in the bases of the foundations formed due to landslide developments in the bulk ground mass.

40|$|In dam rock foundations, {{grouting}} {{is performed}} to improve water-tightness and reinforce weak parts. It {{is difficult to}} accurately estimate the improvements brought about by grouting, because the grouting is applied in the rock mass where it is not visible. Recently, research on optimum grout mixtures has advanced and a system that can automatically change the grout mix proportion has been developed. It is possible to change the grouting specifications in order to shorten the injection duration time, if the injection process can be predicted from early grout injection process data.

In this paper, a joint element and the load-sharing ratio of the consolidation layer are introduced to investigate the joint load-bearing characteristics of the steel lining and the consolidation layer and to determine a suitable consolidation layer thickness; a coupling method for simulating the hydromechanical interaction of the reinforced concrete lining is adopted to investigate the effect of internal water exosmosis on the seepage field at {{the collapse}} zone and to determine the external water pressure on the steel lining. In the case of a steel-lined pressure diversion tunnel, a numerical simulation is implemented to analyse the effect of the thickness of the consolidation layer and the distribution of the seepage field under the influence of internal water exosmosis.

40|$|AbstractJinping I {{hydropower}} {{station is}} one of the most challenging projects in China due to its highest arch dam and complex geological conditions for construction. After geological investigation into the dam foundation, a few large-scale weak discontinuities are observed. The rock masses in the left dam foundation are intensively unloaded, approximately to the depth of 150 – 300 m. These serious geological defects lead to a geological asymmetry on the left and right banks, and thus some major difficulties of dam construction are encountered. In this paper, the influences of geological defects on the project are analyzed, followed by the concepts and methods of treatment design. Based on the analysis, the treatment methods of the weak rock masses and discontinuities are carefully determined, including the concrete cushion, concrete replacement grids, and <b>consolidation</b> <b>grouting.</b> They work together to enhance the strength and integrity of the dam foundation. Evaluations and calibrations through geo-mechanical model tests in combination with field monitoring results in early impoundment period show that the arch dam and its foundation are roughly stable, suggesting that the treatment designs are reasonable and effective.

40|$|In {{cooperation}} with the AKTOR Constructing Group of Engineers the Geophysics and Geothermic Department of the University of Athens performed an electrical resistivity survey at a section of Ymittos highway in Athens. The survey aimed to image the subsurface structure including karstic voids and to evaluate their extent that can result in potentially dangerous collapse of the road segment overlying these features. A synthetic simulation study preceded the field survey was performed aiming {{to determine whether the}} electrical resistivity method could identify such features and to choose the acquisition parameters for optimum detect ability and resolution. The field survey results indicated the presence both of conductive and resistive anomalies along the proposed stretch of the highway. The interpretation of the resistive features indicates that the affected section of the highway overlies five prominent voids attributed mostly to the karstic activity. The conductive anomalies indicate an area where the host limestone rock has been lowered by faulting and is associated with the subsurface continuation of the fault zone observed in the slope of the road during the excavations.

The Himalayan geology {{is one of the}} tectonically youngest geological formations in the world. Except the young formations, rock mass in the Himalaya is highly weathered, fractured and weak in strength and is thus challenging for the construction of underground structure like tunnel and caverns especially for the development of hydropower project. Middle Modi Hydropower Project (MMHP) is also facing the problem with weathered, fractured and weak rock mass for the construction of headrace tunnel. The Middle Modi Hydropower Project (MMHP) is a run of the river scheme with installed capacity 15 MW. Design discharge of 25 m 3 /s is feeding 2 Francis turbines utilizing the grosshead of 75. 34 m. Geologically, MMHP lies in the Precambrian sequence of the lesser Himalayan meta-sedimentary rock formation of Baglung zone. The extension of Lumle Fault crossing the project area is challenge for the underground structures. The major structures of the project are headworks, approximately 2. 8 km headrace tunnel with 34 m height surge tank and semi surface power house. Quartzite and Phyllite are the major rock types covered throughout the whole length of 2. 8 Km headrace tunnel. Quartzite and Phyllite rock mass formation are highly weathered, fractured and shared, and separated by the Sathi khola fault (Extension of Lumle Fault) about chainage 1 + 800 is the weakest part of headrace tunnel. The main aim {{of this study was to}} analyze hydraulic fracturing, rock support design throughout the headrace tunnel and carry out stability analysis in the weakness zone (Lumle Fault) by different approaches. Analysis of hydraulic fracturing from the different approaches; deterministic, analytical and finally verified by numerical model phase 2. The highest hydrostatic water pressure in headrace tunnel was found to be 0. 3 MPa. From numerical analysis, possible hydraulic fracturing was shown in tunnel crown in the weakness zone. From the analysis of few sections, rock bolts and shotcrete is sufficient for rock support except for the weakness zone of headrace tunnel. Stability analysis of the major weakness zone in headrace tunnel using empirical, semi analytical and numerical methods have been presented. From both empirical and semianalytical analysis, squeezing problem was found in the weakness zone.

40|$|Questions {{have been}} raised about the {{effectiveness}} of ventilation control devices (VCDs) to safely resist explosions during their intended life. This functionality depends on the ability of the VCDs and in particular seals to withstand changes in the behaviour of the strata, particularly where longwall abutments influence the stress regime in and around the chain pillars. As a consequence of an explosion impact on a seal, the surrounding strata could experience increased loads possibly resulting in permanent deformation and requiring <b>grout</b> <b>consolidation.</b> These aspects of seal design have been investigated using advanced numerical analysis. Globally since the early 20 th century, to protect underground personnel, ventilation seal designs have been required to be tested at an internationally recognized explosion test gallery to achieve pressure ratings required by legislation. The last two decades has seen advances in materials technology and engineering of structures. It has become accepted practice to use numerical methods to provide engineering ratings for mine seals in line with other industries where the elimination of prototype testing provides more rapid product introduction to the market. Before presenting the results of numerical analysis, structural aspects of seal design are simply explained including arching behaviour and the contribution of dynamic magnification due to impact loads. High-fidelity physics-based computer simulations using software LS-DYNA were able to predict the results from physical testing of mine based seals in a most realistic way.

40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} urban areas {{sometimes}} requires the construction of tall buildings close to existing shield-driven tunnels. The convergence, displacement, and bending moment change of the tunnel lining due to adjacent deep excavations could be significant. The design and construction of a deep excavation must meet the stringent requirements for {{the stability of the}} existing tunnels. In this thesis, firstly, the responses of a jointed shield-driven tunnel in-situ are briefly introduced. An analytical approach and a computer program for the prediction of internal forces and displacements of a jointed shield-driven tunnel are proposed. This analytical approach is justified by field observations, numerical verifications and laboratory model tests. The effects of joint stiffness, soil resistance, joint distribution and number of joints on the tunnel response are outlined. A simplified solution of the relationship of maximum bending moment and horizontal diameter change during adjacent excavation is proposed. Secondly, a new method to determine the equivalent factors for approximating a jointed shield-driven tunnel lining as a continuous ring structure under a 2 D condition is introduced in order to facilitate the numerical simulations and preliminary design of jointed tunnels. Simplified equations for the estimation of the equivalence factors are also proposed for typical tunnel geometry. Thirdly, a detailed field instrumentation program conducted in a deep excavation site, Wanxiang International Square, Shanghai, where Shanghai Metro Line 2 uptrack tunnel was constructed with the closest clearance of 3. 2 m to the excavation pit, is introduced. The field data relevant to the behaviors of soil and earth retaining structures, which are {{in the vicinity of the}} uptrack tunnel, and the performance of the uptrack tunnel are critically interpreted and evaluated. Preliminary mechanism analyses of the tunnel response to the adjacent deep excavation is discussed and the influence factors are summarized based on the field instrumentation data. The deflection of the tunnel is a combination of several kinds of movements, such as translation, slippage, rotation and squash deformation (distortion). Factors that affect the tunnel response during excavation include horizontal clearance of the tunnel and the wall, embeddment depth of the tunnel, three dimensional and arching effect, bottom slab construction and compensation <b>grouting,</b> <b>consolidation</b> properties of the soil and adjacent existing buildings, etc. Finally, comprehensive fully coupled numerical simulations are employed to further examine the tunnel response and the complicated soil-tunnel interaction behaviors. Stress and strain paths of 10 critical points around the tunnel and the pit are plotted to understand the stress and strain changes along the tunnel lining and around the pit during excavation; strain distribution, pore water pressure distribution, and displacement fields around the site during the excavation are examined. Shoulder regions and left heel region are found to experience significant volumetric and deviatoric strain during adjacent excavation. Pure seepage flow has less effect on tunnel response. The squash deformation of the tunnel is found to be the most critical item among all kinds of movement. The change of maximum bending moment of the tunnel caused by the adjacent excavation can be correlated to the change of horizontal diameter change by the proposed analytical approach...|$|R
40|$|Behind {{the tunnel}} boring machine (TBM) the rings form a tunnel lining that is {{embedded}} in grout and soil. The TBM exerts a normal force, a bending moment and a shear force on the lining. The tunnel rings behind the TBM experience a load through the grout, ground and ground water, but the ground also acts as a support medium. A ring that has just left the TBM floats in the fluid grout that has hardly any stiffness and offers resistance to tunnel displacements due to downward grout flow. Furthermore, resistance is offered by force transfer to the TBM and the adjacent rings of the tunnel lining and the hardened grout further down the tunnel. The rings thus have to cooperate to create equilibrium. This cooperation is called beam action. The focus of the research of COB-committee F 512 was aimed at the beam action behind the TBM during the construction phase of the Boortunnel Groene Hart (bored tunnel in the Groene Hart in the Netherlands). Important issues in the research were the displacements and deformations of the tunnel, stresses in the tunnel lining and the grout pressure at {{the exterior of the}} tunnel tube. The research consisted of the following phases: 1. Execution of predictions of the vertical displacements of an escape shaft in the planned route of the tunnel; 2. Composition of a measuring plan, placement of the measuring instruments, execution of the measurements and composition of the measuring reports; 3. Assessment and check on the measurement results; 4. Evaluation of the measurement results by means of modelling; 5. Composition of the final report. The executed predictions (phase 1, see above) forecasted only small displacements and thus only little beam action was expected to occur. Therefore it was decided to aim the research at beam action in the tunnel behind the TBM. Beam action in the tunnel is researched by carrying out several measurements:  displacements and tilt angles of the lining;  ovalisation of the lining;  strains in de tunnel segments;  grout loads at the tunnel lining;  water pressures in the surroundings of the tunnel;  deformations of ground level. The results of the measurements are summarized in measurement reports. Not all measurements appeared to have impeccable results due to both execution aspects and the reliability of the measurement instruments. Recommendations on the execution of the measurements are discussed. A pre-evaluation is executed to assess and perform a check on the consistency of the measurement results for consistence. Furthermore the measurement results have been evaluated. On the one side, by studying several types of results and searching for explanations for phenomena found. Especially the result of the tilt and strain measurement appeared to be much more informative than would be expected beforehand. On the other side several types of measurering results are evaluated using models. Two models were used to analyse beam action:  A finite element method model, in which the tunnel is modelled as a 1 D shear and bending beam (partly) on an elasto-plastic support. Also phased construction of the tunnel rings is implemented;  An analytic model, implemented in an Excel worksheet. The tunnel is modelled as a 1 D bending beam (partly) on an elastic support. Phased construction of the tunnel rings is implemented also in this model. Several models for the behaviour of grout are used to investigate the <b>consolidation</b> of the <b>grout</b> (for instance the influence of ground water flow), the formation of the grout cake, the flow of grout directly behind the TBM and the uplift loading of the grout on the tunnel. In the end of the report an evaluation of the research is given and the most significant conclusions and recommendations are summarized...|$|R
