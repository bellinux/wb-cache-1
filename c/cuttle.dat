Sherman, [...] "...Our <b>cuttle</b> fish [...] of the navy {{although}} he may conceal his tracks for a while in the obscure atmosphere which surrounds him, will eventually be brought to bay...." [...] Robeson later testified in front of a House Naval Committee on January 16, 1879, about giving contracts to private companies. Robeson was asked about the use of old material to build ironclads and whether he had the authority to dispose of the Puritan, an outdated ironclad. Although Robeson served ably during the Virginius Affair and did authorize the construction of five new Navy ships, his financial integrity remained in question and was suspect during the Grant administration. To be fair, Congress gave Robeson limited funding to build ships and as Secretary was constantly finding ways to cut budgets.|$|E
