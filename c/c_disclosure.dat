40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays examining how corporate fraud and litigation impact on financial markets. The first essay examines the direct effects of these events and the second essay examines the indirect, or contagion, effects. The underlying theme behind both essays is that corporate fraud is a classic manifestation of agency cost/information asymmetry problems. The study consists of an examination of over 451 fraud and litigation cases between 1993 and 1999. Essay I reports that announcing firms experience serious wealth, volume, bid-ask spread, firm specific risk and systematic risk shifts in relation to both the fraud (F) and law-suit (<b>C)</b> <b>disclosures.</b> Moreover, these influences persist {{for an extended period}} beyond the events. Interestingly, systematic risk measures drop sharply following the events. The results suggest that these extreme agency events seriously “dislocate” normal market relationships (beta) and that firm specific risk becomes a pricing factor. We also find support for the argument that PSLRA represented a weakening in the monitoring and bonding regime available to shareholders. In the second essay we examine the pure contagion effects of the fraud and litigation cases. We start from the premise that as fraud events are firm-specific, which is the tenor of any lawsuit, then, if any industry wide contagion reaction were to occur it would be of the pure contagion form. Essay II 2 ̆ 7 s principal finding is that strong pure contagion responses are evident following both fraud (F) disclosures and class action (C) filings. In further analysis, we identify that the intensity of the contagion reactions is generally linked to well recognized measures of risk, notably: book-to-market ratios (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1993); leverage (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1988), up markets (or time varying risk premia (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1988)) and the level of regulatory protection (Ali and Kallapur, 2001). This link to risk is interesting as it suggests that contagion susceptibility may be predictable. These pure contagion results underline the continued threat that fraud and litigation represent to well functioning financial markets. ...|$|R

In a cross-sectional survey of people with hepatitis C (N = 504) more than half reported receiving a bad reaction from someone following disclosure.

The factors associated with widespread disclosure were: education level; knowing other people with hepatitis C; feeling fatigued; receiving disclosure advice; and experiencing unauthorized disclosure. Bad reactions following disclosure are common and may impede health-seeking behaviour including uptake of hepatitis C treatment...|$|E

What mechanisms may help to deter subsequent defections of individuals who have already “betrayed” once? Drawing on a unique set of primary data, this article examines the effective counter-defection practices of Chechnya’s pro-Moscow paramilitaries toward prospective defectors from among ex-insurgents. It explores three interwoven mechanisms employed with various intensities to avert “double defections” {{at the peak of the}} locally fought counterinsurgency in Chechnya from 2000 to 2005. These mechanisms are: a) extrajudicial executions of recidivists and their relatives, b) initiation violence targeting insurgents’ relatives, and <b>c)</b> <b>disclosure</b> of the identities of defected insurgents who were responsible for killing insurgents in combat to the families of slain insurgents...|$|E

Counselors-in-training (N = 480) completed the (a) Attachment to Supervisor Scale, (b) Supervisory Working Alliance Inventory-Trainee, and (<b>c)</b> <b>Disclosure</b> in Supervision Scale. Structural equation modeling tested the following hypotheses: (a) Supervisee secure attachment to the supervisor would be associated with higher levels of disclosure in supervision, mediated by the Rapport (i. e., bond) and Client Focus (i. e., goals and tasks) components of the supervisory working alliance; (b) Supervisee secure attachment to the supervisor would be associated with higher ratings of the Rapport component of the supervisory working alliance; and (c) Supervisee secure attachment to the supervisor would be associated with higher ratings of the Client Focus component of the supervisory working alliance. The best fitting model indicated that higher attachment security is related to increased disclosure, partially mediated by the supervisory working alliance. Higher attachment security was also associated with higher levels of Rapport and Client Focus. The results suggest that trainee disclosure can be increased by facilitating increased attachment security and Rapport, and provide {{a better understanding of the}} learning relationship that forms between trainees and their supervisors. ...|$|E

Our analysis shows that equilibrium disclosure can be characterized by four regions. For estimates above (below) the prior expectation of the asset value, the entrepreneur discloses only high (low) precision information. The main idea is to enhance (diminish) confidence in estimates that improve upon (detract from) prior beliefs. We further show that the entrepreneur over-invests in the acquisition of precision information due to the option value of discretion over <b>disclosure.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.

While some scholars and judges argue that rolling contracts do not merit special attention, others, including consumer advocates, are concerned that sellers take advantage of delayed disclosure by hiding especially unfavorable terms. I find no evidence for this view. In a large sample of software license agreements, I find that software publishers that use rolling contracts for their online sales do not offer more one-sided terms than those who make their licenses available prior to purchase.

40|$|This Note’s first Part explores two {{landmark}} Supreme Court cases, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey and NFIB, {{that may}} have been decided based on extralegal considerations. Part II describes three prominent theories of judicial candor with an eye to the results they might yield with respect to extralegal reasoning. Part III offers and defends a new, partial theory of judicial candor. This theory is that a judge who employs extralegal reasoning should omit discussion of her reliance on that reasoning and justify her decision with legal reasoning. The first two Parts will demonstrate that there is a strong presumption for judicial disclosure and an even stronger one against insincerity. This Note accepts those presumptions, but only where the reasoning in question is legal. Thus, a judge should omit discussion of his reliance on extralegal considerations because: (a) the alternative asks too much of the judge; (b) disclosing extralegal reasoning risks leading other judges to believe that engaging in extralegal reasoning is normal and proper; (<b>c)</b> such <b>disclosure</b> is defiant and disrespectful to litigants and to the public; (d) disclosing extralegal reasoning risks legalizing that reasoning; and (e) such disclosure harms the judiciary’s legitimacy. Instead of disclosing his reliance on extralegal reasoning, the judge should justify his decisions with legal reasoning. This Note also discusses and defends against the criticisms that by omitting and justifying extralegal reasons, judges violate their own moral duties, the rights of litigants, and the rights of the public as a whole...|$|R

I argue that the limited disclosure obligations in this global context follow rather than shape market developments, and that complex infrastructures of sampling, testing and detection are required to put disclosed information to use. If so, rather than a normative right-to-know of importing countries, a competing norm of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) prevails.

The use of occupational PEP (oPEP) for case management for persons with possible HIV exposures occurring in health care settings are not addressed in this guideline; updated oPEP guidelines have been published separately. This update incorporates additional evidence regarding use of nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) from animal studies, human observational studies, and consideration of new antiretroviral medications that were approved since the 2005 guidelines, some of which have improved tolerability. New features are inclusion of guidelines for the use of rapid antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combination HIV tests, for revised preferred and alternative 3 -drug antiretroviral nPEP regimens, an updated schedule of laboratory evaluations of source and exposed persons, updated antimicrobial regimens for prophylaxis of sexually transmitted infections and hepatitis, and a suggested procedure for transitioning patients between nPEP and HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as appropriate.

The objective of this study was to investigate evidence of earnings management among Brazilian companies that have adopted fair value based on the discounted cash flow method. The firms were investigated with regard to: a) disclosure of the discount rate, b) BM&FBovespa corporate governance levels; and <b>c)</b> adherence to <b>disclosure</b> requirements in the Brazilian accounting standard CPC 29 (IAS 41). We analyzed 31 firms with significant biological assets from 2010 to 2012. The earnings management measurements were calculated according to the modified Jones, the Teoh, Welch and Wong (1998), and the KS models. The Mann-Whitney test of the means was applied and revealed evidence of greater earnings management for companies that use discounted cash flow, and the ones that least meet CPC 29 disclosure requirements, considering the KS model estimates. Regarding the other proposals, testing did not offer enough evidence of differences in discretionary accruals. In this sense, only hypotheses 1 and 4 are partially accepted, demanding more research in this area. We also present evidence in favor of adopting Exposure Draft ED/ 2013 / 08 Agriculture: Bearer Plants, Proposed amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41, which proposes to measure biological assets at cost, because firms already following these rules showed lower earnings management in this study...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{enormous}} {{research on}} the experience of living with HIV, many questions remain regarding self-disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners by people living with HIV (PLWHIV), which is essential to reducing further infection. In this study, a phenomenological approach captured the experience of self-disclosure among South Africans living with HIV in Louwsburg, South Africa. The health belief model served as a theoretical framework, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 PLWHIV (8 women, 4 men) who self-disclosed their HIV status to their sexual partners. Their experiences were explored, discovering their illness, motives for self-disclosure, feelings regarding disclosing, responses of their sexual partners, their emotional reaction, and about their medical care. The themes rose from interviews showed that (a) many PLWHIV are reluctant to self-disclose until they actively experienced health issues; (b) motives for disclosure include the wish to ensure fairness; support and to empower other PLWHIV to prevent further infection; (<b>c)</b> feelings of <b>disclosure</b> are primarily relief and liberation, even though risks remain, especially for families separated by labor migration laws; (d) the response of sexual partners to disclosure varies widely; some are motivated to get tested and use condoms, decline and respond only with anger, blame, even abandonment; and (e) after accessing medical care, most PLWHIV reported support and appearing less sick, which reduces social stigma. The women were more open, forthcoming, and transparent about disclosing than men participants. Findings will assist with the creation of future health education programs aimed at creating safe environments to disclose HIV status, which may reduce community risk of contracting the virus...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to map Togolese people’s {{positions}} regarding the breaking of bad news to elderly patients. Two hundred eleven participants who had in the past received bad medical news were presented with 72 vignettes depicting communication of bad news to elderly female patients and asked to indicate the acceptability of the physician’s conduct in each case. The vignettes were all combinations of five factors: (a) the severity of the disease, (b) the patient’s wishes about <b>disclosure,</b> (<b>c)</b> the level of social support during hospitalization, (d) the patient’s psychological robustness, and (e) the physician’s decision about how to communicate the bad news. Five qualitatively different positions were found. Two percent of the participants preferred that the physician always tell the full truth to both the patient and her relatives, 8 % preferred that the truth be told depending on the physician’s perception of the situation, 15 % preferred that the physician tell the truth, but understood that in some cases, nondisclosure to the patient was not inappropriate, 33 % preferred that the physician tell the full truth to the relatives but not as much information to the patient, and 42 % preferred that the physician tell the full truth to the relatives only. These findings present a challenge to European physicians taking care of African patients living in Europe or working in African hospitals, and to African physicians trained in Europe and now working in their home countries. If these physicians respect the imperative of always telling the truth directly to their patients, their behavior may trigger anger and considerable misunderstanding among African patients and their families...|$|R
40|$|In 1984, {{the author}} {{predicted}} in an unpublished patent disclosure letter at the Diamond Technology Center of Norton Company that C 3 N 4 may be harder than diamond, the hardest material known. According to this <b>disclosure,</b> <b>C</b> 3 N 4 may exist with two phases (α and β) that are isostructural to corresponding phases of Si 3 N 4. In order {{to estimate the}} hardness of these hypothetical materials, the author contracted Professor M. Cohen to calculate the theoretical values of their bulk moduli. Cohen has since published such results and confirmed that C 3 N 4 may be superhard. Bulk modulus is the best indicator of hardness for materials with diamond-like structure. An accurate regression equation for bulk modulus (B in kb) has been derived from 24 diamond-like semiconductors made of elements in Groups III, IV, and V as follows: In B= 9. 75 P- 0. 0448 D- 0. 423 C 0. 0462, where P is the average period number of the constituent elements and D their average interatomic distance; C= 4 -Δp/ 2, where Δp is the difference {{of the number of}} p-orbital electrons between bonding atoms. Bulk moduli so calculated for the 24 semiconductors deviate by E only 1. 8 % on average from their literature values. Using the above equation, the bulk modulus of a hypothetical diamond-like structure made of CN was calculated to be 4. 9 Mb. C 3 N 4 has 24 / 28 of the number of bonds per formula as compared with a diamond-like structure so its bulk modulus may be reduced in proportion to 4. 2 Mb. This value is on a par with diamond (4. 4 Mb) but significantly higher than the 3. 7 Mb for cubic boron nitride, the second hardest material known. Based on the analogy of the hardness differences between corresponding phases (α and β) of Si 3 N 4 and SiC, it is predicted, that α-C 3 N 4 is harder than diamond (CC), whereas β-C 3 N 4 is softer. Both phases of C 3 N 4 could be more thermally stable than diamond. Hence, it may have advantages over diamond in processing and applications at high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Intent: The {{intent of}} this paper is to discuss ethical issues and the {{importance}} of reflexivity in the conduct of research on occupation with children, including both general considerations as well as particular issues that arise when using visual methods such as photoelicitation interviews. Argument: Reflexivity is often used to demonstrate rigour in qualitative research (Finlay, 2002) however, reflexivity is also an important tool to enact ethical research practice (Etherington, 2007; Guillemin 2 ̆ 6 Gillam, 2004; Nutbrown, 2010). While engaged in a research project involving the use of visual methods with children, we discovered that there are many ethical considerations beyond what we could have predicted at the outset. Some of these considerations are important with respect to research with children in general, while others arise more particularly when using visual methods. In particular, the safety, dignity, and voice of children in the research process is of concern. Framed around the two broad categories of procedural ethics and ethics in practice (Guillemin 2 ̆ 6 Gillam, 2004), five areas of ethical concern were identified (a) Assent or willingness to participate, (b) Informed consent and assent using visual methods, (<b>c)</b> Issues of <b>disclosure,</b> (d) Power imbalances, and (e) Representations of the child. In this paper, we propose a series of reflexive questions that may help to guide researchers as they adopt ethical approaches to research with children. These questions are intended to prompt researcher reflexivity in the hope of revealing ethical moments and points of consideration that may otherwise go unnoticed. Beginning with questions such as these, has the potential to generate additional questions specific to the research, and to encourage reflexivity to permeate through the work. Importance to Occupational Science: Given the growing interest in researching occupation and occupational constructs (such as occupational identity, participation, and development) with children, the importance of ethical considerations and reflexivity becomes more pertinent. Conclusion: In this paper, we highlight particular ethical issues that researchers may face when conducting research with children. We propose that researcher reflexivity on ethically important moments lies at the heart of living ethical practice in qualitative research, and that the ideals of enabling child safety, dignity and voice serve as useful guides in the quest for ethical practices in research with children. Discussion Questions: What actions might a researcher take to ensure they are practicing ethical research with children? How might reflexivity assist in promoting ethical research with children at all stages in the research process? How have you used reflexivity in your experiences researching with children and adults? Has it assisted you in negotiating procedural ethics and ethics in practice...|$|R
40|$|U. S. {{campaign}} finance regulation {{is currently in}} bad shape. The combination of congressional inaction, regulatory ineffectiveness, and constitutional constraint perpetuates a status quo that no one intended and many deplore. Public financing for presidential elections is effectively dead, while Super PACs {{and other forms of}} independent spending are on the rise. The 501 (<b>c)</b> (4) nonprofit <b>disclosure</b> rules are very leaky, allowing corporations and others to conceal soft money contributions to Super PACs if they so choose. The Supreme Court has effectively precluded comprehensive {{campaign finance}} reform by its rulings, which have thrown out independent and personal expenditure bans, 1 limited public finance to opt-in schemes, 2 loosened the definition of issue ads, 3 and allowed corporations to use unlimited amounts of their treasury monies to fund independent campaigns. 4 To borrow from Vladimir Lenin, 2 ̆ 2 [W]hat is to be done? 2 ̆ 25 Professor Lawrence Lessig, in his Jorde Symposium Essay, What an Originalist Would Understand 2 ̆ 2 Corruption 2 ̆ 2 to Mean, believes the answer is to reframe the campaign finance problem as 2 ̆ 2 dependence corruption 2 ̆ 2 using originalist logic. Is he right? I have my doubts, as I will explain. In an effort to persuade the Court to reconsider its very narrow construction of permissible campaign finance reform, Professor Lessig is trying to thread the eye of a doctrinal needle. He wants to broaden the Buckley v. Valeo material corruption logic 6 but avoid the Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce equality rationale 7 that was overturned in Citizens United v. FEC. 8 This is a hard task that he makes even harder by embedding 2 ̆ 2 dependence corruption 2 ̆ 2 in an originalist argument. In this short commentary, I will examine the merits of this approach from a political science perspective and offer an alternative way to look at the same problem. Lessig 2 ̆ 7 s original-intent account rests on too many contestable counterfactual assumptions regarding what the Founders would have thought about conditions and political practices that they could not have imagined in their day. Moreover, the argument that the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s intent was only direct popular sovereignty ignores the Electoral College and U. S. Senate elections, which are based on geography. Nonetheless, I must leave it to constitutional scholars to determine whether his story is plausible enough to convince the Court. 9 My focus is on whether dependence corruption is the right principle for regulating campaign finance. As I will explain, I prefer to think that the problem is one of democratic distortion, and that the solution under the current constitutional constraints requires continuing efforts to open up donor participation to all voters, fix the broken disclosure system, and preserve the current system of congestion pricing. 1...|$|R
40|$| riconosciuto alla Commissione europea ed alle iniziative da questa messe in campo per rimuovere gli ostacoli che rendono difficile per imprese e consumatori agire in giudizio per il risarcimento dei danni patiti. Dopo il formale riconoscimento, del diritto al risarcimento dei danni delle vittime delle condotte antitrust, si sono susseguiti studi e proposte {{legislative}} tese a superare le significative divergenze relative ai diversi rimedi risarcitori offerti dagli Stati Membri, in vista di eliminare qualsiasi disparità di trattamento tra le imprese comunitarie e garantire il corretto funzionamento del mercato interno. Ciò è avvenuto, dapprima, attraverso la pubblicazione del Libro Verde sulle “Azioni di risarcimento del danno per violazione delle norme antitrust comunitarie” (2005), con l’intento di agevolare il private enforcement e porre le basi per una strategia condivisa, e poi con la pubblicazione nel 2008 del Libro Bianco con l’obiettivo primario, purtroppo non raggiunto, di chiarire i presupposti per l’esercizio del diritto al risarcimento del danno da parte dei privati. A novembre 2014, la Commissione ha finalmente approvato una direttiva e stabilito nuove norme per facilitare le richieste di indennizzo da parte di chi è vittima di violazioni delle regole antitrust, riuscendo a superare le diverse posizioni fra stati membri, che in passato, avevano impedito di pervenire ad una disciplina al riguardo. Un primo tentativo della Commissione di presentare una proposta legislativa in tema di private enforcement era, infatti, abortito per la mancanza di condivisione su alcuni aspetti della disciplina ritenuti particolarmente delicati, quali la prospettata introduzione dello strumento delle {{class actions}} di impronta nordamericana, ovvero di quelle azioni basate su un sistema c. d. di opt-out, della divulgazione predibattimentale (<b>c.</b> d. <b>disclosure)</b> e del risarcimento cumulativo dei danni. L’elaborato ripercorre, quindi, le evoluzioni legislative più recenti degli Stati Membri e analizza brevemente le tutele apprestate nelle principali giurisdizioni europee. In particolare esamina la proposta di legge inglese (c. d. Consumer Rights Bill), che introduce la procedura opt-out per le azioni collettive (in contrasto con il regime di opt-in raccomandato dalla Commissione) e con cui si ampliano i poteri del Competition Appeal Tribunal (“CAT”), rendendolo così la sede principale per le azioni private in tema di concorrenza, nonché la nuova legge francese (c. d. Loi Hamon), entrata in vigore nel marzo 2014, che introduce per la prima volta una disciplina per le azioni di classe con caratteristiche proprie rispetto a quelle presenti negli altri stati Membri. Nella nuova legge francese, in specie, si prevede una azione con opt-in espresso ed una tutela specifica per gli illeciti anticoncorrenziali (c. d. “actione de groupe en réparation des préjudices causés par une pratique anticoncurrentielle”) esperibile, però, solo in seguito ad una decisione di condanna da parte dell’Autorità nazionale per la Concorrenza. La Loi Hamon prevede, altresì, una azione di classe semplificata per tutti quei casi in cui il procedimento è più semplice poiché l’identità dei consumatori lesi è già conosciuta o lo sarebbe facilmente. Da ultimo, l’analisi si sofferma sulla direttiva approvata a Novembre 2014, emanata, proprio, per armonizzare e garantire l’effettiva applicazione delle regole di risarcimento del danno proveniente da violazioni delle norme antitrust all’interno dell’Unione Europea. Trattasi di un importante traguardo, che migliora la legge europea sulla concorrenza e la adatta alle ultime necessità. L’impatto che avrà la direttiva all’interno dei singoli Stati membri è ad oggi solamente ipotizzabile, certamente tale direttiva insieme con i recenti sforzi legislativi quali quello francese ed inglese in tema di class action, mostrano la volontà di superare i risultati modesti ottenuti sinora all’interno degli Stati Membri nell’utilizzo delle azioni private da parte dei danneggiati indiretti e di superare le varie cause che hanno per lungo tempo scoraggiato i consumatori a proporre tali azioni. Ciò nonostante, ci sono ancora diversi profili problematici che la Direttiva non affronta. L’elaborato si conclude, quindi, con una riflessione sulle problematiche irrisolte e sui possibili rimedi. Tra le questioni irrisolte che sembrano indebolire il sistema del private enforcement, significative e di particolare interesse risultano quelle legate al finanziamento delle azioni di classe. Le azioni di classe hanno, purtroppo, costi molto elevati. In particolare, chi propone un’azione di classe nei sistemi opt-in, oltre le tradizionali spese legali, deve sostenere i costi per dare pubblicità alla classe e per raccogliere le adesioni dei consumatori interessati a partecipare all’azione. E fra tutti i possibili rimedi, anche alla luce delle proposte ed iniziative adottate nei sistemi di private enforcement più evoluti per garantire l’accesso alla giustizia dei consumatori, nell’elaborato si privilegia proprio la soluzione (più discussa e controversa, ma che appare anche la più efficace) del finanziamento delle azioni di classe da parte di terzi.
