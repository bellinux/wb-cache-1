Snow is quite rare, lying for around 3 to 10 days each year, although in the winter of 2009/2010 and in November / December 2010 there were spells when snow lay on the ground for approximately five weeks continuously.Summer is warm and largely dry compared {{with the rest of the}} UK with a mixture of cloud, sun and occasional light rain.

40|$|Regional Climate Models (RCMs) {{constitute}} the {{most often used}} method to perform affordable high-resolution regional climate simulations. The key issue {{in the evaluation of}} nested regional models is to determine whether RCM simulations improve the representation of climatic statistics compared to the driving data, that is, whether RCMs add value. In this study we examine a necessary condition that some <b>climate</b> <b>statistics</b> derived from the precipitation field must satisfy in order that the RCM technique can generate some added value: we focus on whether the <b>climate</b> <b>statistics</b> of interest contain some fine spatial-scale variability that would be absent on a coarser grid. The presence and magnitude of fine-scale precipitation variance required to adequately describe a given <b>climate</b> <b>statistics</b> will then be used to quantify the potential added value (PAV) of RCMs. Our results show that the PAV of RCMs is much higher for short temporal scales (e. g., 3 -hourly data) than for long temporal scales (16 -day average data) due to the filtering resulting from the time-averaging process. PAV is higher in warm season compared to cold season due to the higher proportion of precipitation falling from small-scale weather systems in the warm season. In regions of complex topography, the orographic forcing induces an extra component of PAV, no matter the season or the temporal scale considered. The PAV is also estimated using high-resolution datasets based on observations allowing the evaluation of the sensitivity of changing resolution in the real climate system. The results show that RCMs tend to reproduce relatively well the PAV compared to observations although showing an overestimation of the PAV in warm season and mountainous regions...|$|E

40|$|Recent <b>climate</b> change <b>statistics</b> {{attribute}} over {{a quarter}} of carbon emissions to residential energy use in the UK. To address this, a building standard (Code for Sustainable Homes) was introduced to aim to reduce levels of carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption. This paper analyses how such an environmental standard reconfigures the socio-technological relations and practices of housing professionals that design, construct, and manage social housing. We focus on how actors engage with the standard’s recommendation for incorporating low and zero carbon technologies into new buildings. We identify diverse practices that emerge from these engagements, which, we contend, have significant consequences for the working relationships of professional actors, and for renewable energy provision. By being entwined in, and generative of actors’ practices, we argue that the Code becomes part of the socio-technological relationships and infrastructures that shape energy provision...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} added {{value in the}} {{representation}} of surface climate variables from an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) simulations by comparing the relative skill of the RCM simulations and their driving data {{over a wide range}} of RCM experimental setups and <b>climate</b> <b>statistics.</b> The methodology is speciﬁcally designed to compare results across diﬀerent variables and metrics, and it incorporates a rigorous approach to separate the added value occurring at diﬀerent spatial scales. Results show that the RCMs’ added value strongly depends on the type of driving data, the climate variable, and the region of interest but depends rather weakly on the choice of the statistical measure, the season, and the RCM physical conﬁguration. Decomposing <b>climate</b> <b>statistics</b> according to diﬀerent spatial scales shows that improvements are coming from the small scales when considering the representation of spatial patterns, but from the large-scale contribution in the case of absolute values.

40|$|Quantitative reconstructions of {{the past}} <b>climate</b> <b>statistics</b> from geochemical coral or mollusk records require {{quantified}} error bars in order to properly interpret the amplitude of the climate change and to perform meaningful comparisons with climate model outputs. We introduce here a more precise categorization of reconstruction errors, differentiating the error bar due to the proxy calibration uncertainty from the standard error due to sampling and variability in the proxy formation process. Then, we propose a numerical approach based on Monte Carlo simulations with surrogate proxy-derived climate records. These are produced by perturbing a known time series {{in a way that}} mimics the uncertainty sources in the proxy climate reconstruction. A freely available algorithm, MoCo, was designed to be parameterized by the user and to calculate realistic systematic and standard errors of the mean and the variance of the annual temperature, and of the mean and the variance of the temperature seasonality reconstructed from marine accretionary archive geochemistry. In this study, the algorithm is used for sensitivity experiments in a case study to characterize and quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of systematic and standard errors to sampling size, stochastic uncertainty sources, archive-specific biological limitations, and climate non-stationarity. The results of the experiments yield an illustrative example of the range of variations of the standard error and the systematic error in the reconstruction of <b>climate</b> <b>statistics</b> in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Thus, we show that the sample size and the climate variability are the main sources of the standard error. The experiments allowed the identification and estimation of systematic bias that would not otherwise be detected because of limited modern datasets. Our study demonstrates that numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo analyses are a simple and powerful approach to improve the understanding of the proxy records. We show that the standard error for the <b>climate</b> <b>statistics</b> linearly increases with the climate variability, which means that the accuracy of the error estimated by MoCo is limited by the climate non-stationarity...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} optimally remove the {{systematic}} bias of the modeled precipitation, a new methodology {{that was developed}} in the frame of European funded projects, including ECLISE FP 7, is applied to climate model outputs. The methodology belongs to the widely used family of quantile mapping correction methods. The method uses different instances of gamma function that are fitted on multiple discrete segments on the precipitation CDF, instead of the common quantile-quantile approach that uses one theoretical distribution to fit the entire CDF. This gives the method the ability to better adjust raw <b>climate</b> model <b>statistics</b> towards the observations. The selection of the segment number is performed by an information criterion to poise between complexity and efficiency of the transfer function. The methodology was tested on CMIP 3 global climate models resulting to a very good performance in reducing the systematic biases of the climate model data. Details of the methodology and the validation are presented in (Grillakis et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{intensive}} {{research of}} recent years on climate change {{has led to the}} strong conclusion that climate has always, throughout the Earth’s history, changed irregularly on all time scales. Climate changes are closely related to the Hurst phenomenon, which has been detected in many long hydroclimatic time series and is stochastically equi-valent to a simple scaling behaviour of climate variability over time scale. The climate variability, anthropogenic or natural, increases the uncertainty of the hydrological processes. It is shown that hydrological statistics, the branch of hydrology that deals with uncertainty, in its current state is not consistent with the varying character of <b>climate.</b> Typical <b>statistics</b> used in hydrology such as means, variances, cross- and auto-correlations and Hurst coefficients, and the variability thereof, are revisited under the hypothesis of a varying climate following a simple scaling law, and new estimators are studied which, in many cases, differ dramatically from the classical ones. The new statistical framework is applied to real-world examples for typical tasks such as estima-tion and hypothesis testing where, again, the results depart significantly from those of the classical statistics...|$|R
