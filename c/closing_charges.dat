40|$|Free-standing {{polypyrrole}} films, {{being the}} metal–polymer contact located several millimeters outside the electrolyte, give stationary closed coulovoltammetric (charge/potential) loop responses to consecutive potential sweeps from – 2. 50 V to 0. 65 V in aqueous solutions. The continuous and <b>closed</b> <b>charge</b> evolution corroborates {{the presence of}} reversible film reactions (electroactivity), together high electronic and ionic conductivities in the full potential range. The <b>closed</b> <b>charge</b> loop demonstrates that the irreversible hydrogen evolution is fully inhibited from aqueous solutions of different salts up to – 2. 5 V vs Ag/AgCl. The morphology of the <b>closed</b> <b>charge</b> loops shows abrupt slope changes corresponding to the four basic components of the structural electrochemistry for a 3 D electroactive gel: reduction-shrinking, reduction-compaction, oxidation-relaxation, and oxidation-swelling. Freestanding films of conducting polymers behave as 3 D gel electrodes (reactors) at the chain level, where reversible electrochemical reactions drive structural conformational and macroscopic (volume variation) changes. Very slow hydrogen evolution is revealed by coulovoltammetric responses at more cathodic potentials than – 1. 1 V from strong acid solutions, or in neutral salts self-supported blend films of polypyrrole with large organic acids. Conducting polymers overcome graphite, mercury, lead, diamond, or carbon electrodes as hydrogen inhibitors, and can compete with them for some electro-analytical and electrochemical applications in aqueous solutions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Close</b> to <b>charge</b> neutrality, the {{electronic}} properties of graphene and its multilayers {{are sensitive to}} electron-electron interactions. In bilayers, for instance, interactions are predicted to open a gap between valence and conduction bands, turning the system into an insulator. In mono and (Bernal-stacked) trilayers, which remain conducting at low temperature, interactions do not have equally drastic consequences. It is expected that interaction effects become weaker for thicker multilayers, whose behaviour should converge to that of graphite. Here we show that this expectation does not correspond to reality by revealing the occurrence of an insulating state <b>close</b> to <b>charge</b> neutrality in Bernal-stacked tetralayer graphene. The phenomenology-incompatible with the behaviour expected from the single-particle band structure-resembles that observed in bilayers, but the insulating state in tetralayers is visible at higher temperature.

40|$|Many {{separation}} {{processes are}} related to the behavior of ions <b>close</b> to <b>charged</b> surfaces. In this work, we examine uranyl ions, which can be considered as rod-like molecular ions with a spatially distributed charge, embedded in a system of like charged surfaces. The analysis of the system is based on an approximate field theory which is accurate from the weak to the strong electrostatic coupling regimes. The numerical results show that <b>close</b> to the <b>charged</b> surface the ions are oriented parallel to the surface, whereas at distances greater than half of the ion length, they are randomly oriented. Due to the restriction of the orientational degrees of freedom, the density of ions at the charged surface decreases to zero. For large surface charge densities, the force between like charged surfaces becomes attractive, as a result of charge correlations. The theoretical results are in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulation result...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the occurrence of}} magnetic and charge density wave instabilities in rhombohedral-stacked multilayer (three to eight layers) graphene {{by first principles calculations}} including exact exchange. Neglecting spin polarization, an extremely flat surface band centered at the special point K of the Brillouin zone occurs at the Fermi level. Spin polarization opens a gap in the surface state by stabilizing an antiferromagnetic state. The top and the bottom surface layers are weakly ferrimagnetic in-plane (net magnetization smaller than 10 (- 3) mu B) and are antiferromagnetic coupled to each other. This coupling is propagated by the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic coupling between the nearest neighbors. The gap is very small in a spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation, while it is proportional to the amount of exact exchange in hybrid functionals. For trilayer rhombohedral graphene it is 38. 6 meV in PBE 0, in agreement with the 42 meV gap found in experiments. We study the temperature and doping dependence of the magnetic gap. At electron doping of n similar to 7 x 10 (11) cm(- 2) the gap <b>closes.</b> <b>Charge</b> density wave instabilities with root 3 x root 3 periodicity do not occur...|$|R

40|$|A formal {{correspondence}} {{is established}} between the curvature theory of generalized implicit hypersurfaces, electromagnetism {{as expressed in}} terms of exterior differential systems, and thermodynamics. Starting with a generalized implicit surface whose normal field is represented by an exterior differential 1 -form, it is possible to deduce the curvature invariants of the implicit surface and to construct a globally closed vector density in terms of the Jacobian properties of the normal field. When the closed vector density is assigned the role of an intrinsic charge current density, and the components of the normal field are assigned the roles of the electromagnetic potentials, the theory is formally equivalent to an exterior differential system that generates the PDE's of both the Maxwell Faraday equations and the Maxwell Ampere equations. The interaction energy density between the potentials and the induced <b>closed</b> <b>charge</b> current density is exactly the similarity curvature invariant of highest degree (N- 1) for the implicit surface. Although developed without direct contact with M-brane theory, these ideas of generalized implicit surfaces should have application to the study of p-branes that can have multiple components and envelopes. The theory suggests that gravitational collapse of mass energy density should include terms that involve the interaction between charge-current densities and electromagnetic potentials.
