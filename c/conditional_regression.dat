40|$|In digital human {{modelling}} (DHM) systems {{consideration of}} anthropometry is central. Important functionality in DHM tools is the regression model, i. e. {{the possibility to}} predict {{a complete set of}} measurements based on a number of defined independent anthropometric variables. The accuracy of a regression model is measured by how well the model predicts dependent variables based on independent variables, i. e. known key anthropometric measurements. In literature, existing regression models often use stature and/or body weight as independent variables in so-called flat regressions models which can produce estimations with large errors when there are low correlations between the independent and dependent variables. This paper suggests a <b>conditional</b> <b>regression</b> model that utilise all known measurements as independent variables when predicting each unknown dependent variable. The <b>conditional</b> <b>regression</b> model is compared to a flat regression model, using stature and weight as independent variables, and a hierarchical regression model that uses geometric and statistical relationships between body measurements to create specific linear regression equations in a hierarchical structure. The accuracy of the models is assessed by evaluating the coefficient of determination, R 2 and the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). The results from the study show that using a <b>conditional</b> <b>regression</b> model that makes use of all known variables to predict the values of unknown measurements is advantageous compared to the flat and hierarchical regression models. Both the conditional linear regression model and the hierarchical regression model have the advantage that when more measurements are included the models will give a better prediction of the unknown measurements compared to the flat regression model based on stature and weight. A conditional linear regression model has the additional advantage that any measurement can be used as independent variable. This gives the possibility to only include measurements that have a direct connection to the design dimensions being sought. Utilising the <b>conditional</b> <b>regression</b> model would create digital manikins with enhanced accuracy that would produce more realistic and accurate simulations and evaluations when using DHM tools for the design of products and workplaces...|$|E

The authors evaluated {{the performance of}} the two methods using Monte Carlo simulation. Data were generated from a 1 :m matched design based on McNemar’s 2 × 2 tables with four scenarios for missing values: completely-at-random, case-dependent, exposure-dependent, and case/exposure-dependent. In their analysis, the authors used <b>conditional</b> logistic <b>regression</b> for complete pairs and the missing-indicator method for all pairs. For 1 : 1 matched studies, given no confounding between exposure and disease, the two methods yielded unbiased estimates. Otherwise, <b>conditional</b> logistic <b>regression</b> produced unbiased estimates with empirical confidence interval coverage similar to nominal coverage under the first three missing-value scenarios, whereas the missing-indicator method produced slightly more bias and lower confidence interval coverage. An increased number of matched controls was associated with slightly more bias and lower confidence interval coverage. Under the case/ exposure-dependent missing-value scenario, neither method performed satisfactorily; this indicates the need for more sophisticated statistical methods for handling such missing values.

The authors undertook an ecologic study during the high-ozone seasons among persons over age 55 years. In contrast to <b>conditional</b> <b>regression</b> analysis and MSMs based on G-computation and simple inverse probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW), an MSM that protected against violation of the experimental treatment assignment (ETA) assumption and considered only those areas that could have experienced both high and low ozone concentrations during 1983 – 2000 found no consistent evidence that reductions in quarterly 1 -hour maximum ozone concentrations from levels above any of the regulatory standards to levels below those standards led to decreases in cardiac mortality; however, it did find evidence of decreases related to a decrease in 8 -hour maximum concentrations. The G-computation estimator and simple IPTW estimators were biased because of serious violation of the ETA assumption.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an adaptive linear regression model for synthesizing of missing anthropometric population data based on a flexible set of known predictive data. The method is based on a <b>conditional</b> <b>regression</b> model and includes use of principal component analysis, to reduce effects of multicollinearity between selected predictive measurements, and incorporation of a stochastic component, using the partial correlation coefficients between predicted measurements. In addition, skewness of the distributions of the dependent variables is considered when incorporating the stochastic components. Results from the study show that the proposed regression models for synthesizing population data give valid results with small errors of the compared percentile values. However, higher accuracy was not achieved when the number of measurements used as independent variables was increased compared to using only stature and weight as independent variables. This indicates problems with multicollinearity that principal component regression were not able to overcome. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation values together with correlation coefficients is sufficient to perform the <b>conditional</b> <b>regression</b> procedure. However, to incorporate a stochastic component when using principal component regression requires raw data on an individual level. Relevance to industry When developing products, workplaces or systems, it is of great importance to consider the anthropometric diversity of the intended users. The proposed regression model offers a procedure that gives valid results, maintains the correlation between the measurements that are predicted and is adaptable regarding which, and number of, predictive measurements that are selected...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{relationship}} between asthma and traffic-related pollutants has received considerable attention. The use of individual-level exposure measures, such as residence location or proximity to emission sources, may avoid ecological biases. Method This {{study focused on}} the pediatric Medicaid population in Detroit, MI, a high-risk population for asthma-related events. A population-based matched case-control {{analysis was used to}} investigate associations between acute asthma outcomes and proximity of residence to major roads, including freeways. Asthma cases were identified as all children who made at least one asthma claim, including inpatient and emergency department visits, during the three-year study period, 2004 - 06. Individually matched controls were randomly selected {{from the rest of the}} Medicaid population on the basis of non-respiratory related illness. We used <b>conditional</b> logistic <b>regression</b> with distance as both categorical and continuous variables, and examined non-linear relationships with distance using polynomial splines. The <b>conditional</b> logistic <b>regression</b> models were then extended by considering multiple asthma states (based on the frequency of acute asthma outcomes) using polychotomous <b>conditional</b> logistic <b>regression.</b> Results Asthma events were associated with proximity to primary roads with an odds ratio of 0. 97 (95 % CI: 0. 94, 0. 99) for a 1 km increase in distance using <b>conditional</b> logistic <b>regression,</b> implying that asthma events are less likely as the distance between the residence and a primary road increases. Similar relationships and effect sizes were found using polychotomous <b>conditional</b> logistic <b>regression.</b> Another plausible exposure metric, a reduced form response surface model that represents atmospheric dispersion of pollutants from roads, was not associated under that exposure model. Conclusions There is moderately strong evidence of elevated risk of asthma close to major roads based on the results obtained in this population-based matched case-control study. </p...|$|R
