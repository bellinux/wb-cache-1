This type of regulation {{has lost the}} role it once had, as the emphasis has moved toward capital adequacy, and in many countries there is no <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio. The purpose of <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> ratios is liquidity rather than safety.

30|$|IEEE 802.16 MAC {{protocol}} is connection-oriented; each {{connection is}} assigned a connection ID (CID) {{and a single}} scheduling service determined {{by a set of}} QoS parameters. Four scheduling services in the 802.16 standard are supported: unsolicited grant service (UGS), real-time polling service (rtPS), nonreal-time polling service (nrtPS), and best effort (BE). The UGS supports real-time constant bitrate data streams, such as voice over IP (VoIP) without silence suppression. The QoS parameters of UGS service are <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate, the tolerated jitter, maximum latency, and request/transmission policy. The rtPS supports real-time variable-rate data streams, such as MPEG video or VoIP with silence suppression. The QoS parameters of rtPS are maximum latency, request/transmission policy, <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate, and traffic priority. The nrtPS supports delay-tolerant variable-rate data streams, such as FTP. The QoS parameters of nrtPS are <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate, request/transmission policy, and traffic priority. The BE supports best-effort data streams. The QoS parameter is request/transmission policy. In IEEE 802.16 e [2], an additional service class called extended real-time polling service (ertPS) has superior efficiency than both UGS and rtPS. It supports real-time variable-rate data streams, such as VoIP with silence suppression. The QoS parameters of ertPS are <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate, maximum latency, request/transmission policy, and the tolerated jitter. Hence, considering the QoS requirements of the four class services, we calculate the reference goal as traffic specification (TSPEC) according to these QoS parameters.|$|R

More specifically, we discuss how the overdraft rate and the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements affect the equilibrium values of lending rate and deposit rate {{as well as the}} corresponding quantities, when there is only one commercial bank in the economy and the Central Bank. Moreover, we examine the impact of these changes on the magnitude of the spread between the equilibrium rates. It is demonstrated that monetary policy via the overdraft rate does not affect the spread, while the effect of a change in the fraction of the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements differs depending on the case...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{monetary}} policy on the optimal bank behavior under oligopolistic conditions. In addition, we attempt to extend this analysis {{in the sphere of}} bank-clients behavior. We concentrate on the way the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements of commercial banks influence the optimal bank behavior in oligopoly. In particular, we are interested in the influence of this instrument of monetary policy on the interest rate spread. For this reason, we formulate a two-stage Cournot game with scope economies. We conclude that the sign of each change depends on the type of scope economies. Finally, treating an overlapping generation model as a guiding principle, we show that the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements of commercial banks {{have an impact on the}} depositors’ and borrowers’ two periods’ optimal level of consumption. ...|$|R

It will be shown that high levels of salinity can, in part, be attributed to regulatory failure for two reasons. First, the method of water allocation, a <b>compulsory</b> <b>minimum</b> charge with the marginal cost of water being zero, encouraged over watering, resulting in increased water tables via groundwater recharge. Second, the government did not provide adequate finance for construction of appropriate removal of saline drainage water, and thereby allowed increasing in-stream salinity. externalities, government failure, institutions, salinity, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
