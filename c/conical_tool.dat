40|$|International audienceStatement of problemComputer-aided design/computer-aided {{manufacturing}} (CAD/CAM) machining {{influences the}} surface roughness of dental restorations and tool wear. Roughness must be suitable to meet clinical requirements, and the tool must {{last as long}} as possible. PurposeThe purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the influence of the CAD/CAM tool-material couple on tool wear and surface roughness after milling. Material and methodsThree tools (Lyra <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> Ø 1 mm; GACD SASU, Lyra <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> Ø 1. 05 mm; GACD SASU, and Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S; Sirona Dental Systems GmbH) and 3 CAD/CAM materials (Lava Ultimate; 3 M ESPE, Mark II; VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH, and Enamic; VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH) were tested. The tool wear of 6 tool-material couples at a feed rate of 2 m/min was analyzed before and after 8 minutes of flank and climb milling with optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and tool weighing. The surface roughness after milling was observed for 9 tool-material couples for flank and climb milling. Feed rates of 1, 2, 3, and 4. 8 m/min were used for each couple. Ra, Rt, Rz, Sa, Sq, and Sz roughness criteria were measured. A paired comparison of tool-material couples was conducted with the Kruskal-Wallis test. ResultsThe Mark II material led to more severe tool wear. Milling of Lava Ultimate resulted in chip deposits on the tool grit. The Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S was less worn for each material tested. The Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S and the Lyra <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> Ø 1. 05 mm provided similar roughness measurements for the 3 materials tested. The Lyra <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> Ø 1. 05 mm tool provided better roughness than the Lyra <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> Ø 1 mm tool for the Enamic material.

Two types of material removal are observed depending on the load acting on the cutting grits. When the load is small, the cutting grits are in the condition of wear and the surface roughness of the work material is improved.

40|$|Abstract: Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is {{regarded}} as the most significant development in joining over the past two decades. In FSW, process parameters and tool geometry play a fundamental role in obtaining desirable mechanical properties and microstructures in the welded zone. The tool geometry {{plays an important role in}} producing sound friction stir welds. Tool designs are however, generally propriety to individual researchers and only limited information is available in open literature. There are however, continuous efforts to understand the material flow and the influence that the FSW tool design has on the friction stir welded material. Within industries that use various welding techniques it well known that FSW is particularly suited for the welding of aluminium; there is great potential for FSW of copper. Given the limited supply, high cost, copper theft and commercial demand associated with copper, engineers and scientists will either attempt to reduce the quantity of copper consumed by industries or alternatively replace copper with a substitute metal that exhibits similar attributable properties. On account of the limited supply and consequently the high cost associated with copper and copper alloys; the need to join aluminium and copper and its’ alloys is anticipated to increase in the near future. FSW of dissimilar alloys/metals has attracted extensive research interest due to potential engineering prominence and inherent problems associated with conventional welding methods. This research identifies the choice of suitable tool designs and process parameters to produce sound dissimilar friction stir welds of 5754 aluminium and C 11000 copper. This research focuses primarily on determining the effect of FSW process parameters on the forces experienced by the FSW tool and the relationship that this has on the electrical conductivity properties of the friction stir dissimilar weld. The experimental work was performed by completing dissimilar friction stir welds on 3 mm thick butt welds of the two materials by means of an I-stir FSW platform. During the experimental work, the rotational speed was varied between 600 and 1200 rpm in intervals on 300 related to low, medium and high rotational speeds respectively and four different FSW tool geometries were tested. The first tool was a new design with a unique shoulder topography and a cylindrical pin named the “Reddy tool”. The second tool was a tool consisted of a concave shoulder and conical pin. Tests were performed using the second tool at a 0 degree tilt and at a 2 degree tilt relative to the work-piece. The third tool consisted of a concave shoulder and cylindrical pin. The forth tool design consisted of a flat shoulder and a cylindrical pin. This research forms part of the initial experimental work to determine the forces and electrical resistance of dissimilar friction stir welds of aluminium and copper by employing different tool shoulder designs. The welds were characterised through visual inspection, weld defect and material flow analysis, microstructural evaluation, electrical resistance measurements and tool forces and tool torque analysis. Microstructural evaluation results revealed complex flow patterns of copper and aluminium material. Lamellae structures composed of copper particles with a streamline shape and continuous aluminium strips were present. Some evidence of dynamic recrystallization was observed in the nugget of the defect free welds. Based on material flow evaluation and defect formation results, the Reddy tool design is most suitable for high and low rotational speeds, the <b>conical</b> Shoulder <b>tool</b> at no tilt is most suitable for medium rotational speeds, the <b>conical</b> shoulder <b>tool</b> at a two degree tool tilt is most suitable for medium rotational speeds, the [...] .

Important geometry and weight variations were observed on the pin and shoulder for all welding conditions, in particular when low tool rotation and travel speeds were used. Experimental results also show that the radial wear of the pin is not uniform, indicating the presence of important frictional temperature gradients through the thickness of the joint. The maximum wear was measured at a location of about one millimeter from the pin root center. Finally, tool rotation was determined as the most significant process parameter influencing both tool wear and microstructure of the joints...|$|R

40|$|Genes {{and culture}} are two {{inheritance}} systems through which {{information can be}} passed on between generations. For my PhD, I investigated the interplay between genetic make up and the apparently culturally transmitted behaviour &# 147;sponging&# 148; in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in the western gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia, and compared my results to findings from the eastern gulf. Spongers wear <b>conical</b> sponges as <b>tools</b> over their rostra which apparently aids foraging in deep water. Within each gulf, spongers share a maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA haplotype &# 150; indicative of vertical social transmission. However, haplotypes differ between gulfs. We conducted boat based surveys and collected biopsy samples of dolphins in the western gulf of Shark Bay and identified 40 spongers. As in the eastern gulf, spongers are predominantly female. In the western gulf, spongers invest more time in foraging and rest less compared to non-spongers. A distinct segregation was found between dolphins with different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and habitat use, despite different habitats being separated by just tens of meters. Dolphins with the sponger haplotype were in one habitat (deep water) where resting and travelling groups were larger than in shallow habitat. However, foraging groups were smaller in shallow water suggesting that predation pressure is higher and resource abundance lower in deep water. Community analysis revealed that the genetic differences found between habitats are also reflected in the social structure: female dolphins preferentially associate with females from the same habitat and rarely with females from the other habitat. The two matrilines within the deep water habitat interacted. Socially learnt foraging specialisations may have lead to natal habitat preference so that the observed genetic structure arose from cultural hitchhiking of the mitochondrial DNA. An individual-based model showed that a new vertically transmitted trait is often lost by chance but once established it can be maintained. In order to assess the relative influence of potential factors driving sponging, a combined analysis of genetic, ecological and social factors showed that ecological and social but not genetic factors drive sponging. In summary, vertically transmitted, habitat-dependent foraging specialisations influence the social and genetic population structure and thus the evolutionary success of a population...|$|R
40|$|This thesis in Thermal Flow Drilling and Flowtap in thin {{metal sheet}} and pipes of copper and copper alloys had as {{objectives}} {{to know the}} comportment of copper and copper alloys sheet metal during the Thermal Flow Drill processes with normal tools, to know the best Speed and Feed machine data for the best bushing quality, to known the best Speed for Form Tapping processes and to know the best bush long in pure copper pipes for water solar interchange equipment. Thermal Flow Drilling (TFD) and Form Tapping (FT) {{is one of the}} research lines of the Institute of Production and Logistics (IPL) at University of Kassel. At December 1995, a work meeting of IPL, Santa Catarina University, Brazil, Buenos Aires University, Argentine, Tarapacá University (UTA), Chile members and the CEO of Flowdrill B. V. was held in Brazil. The group decided that the Manufacturing Laboratory (ML) of UTA would work with pure copper and brass alloys sheet metal and pure copper pipes in order to develop a water interchange solar heater. The Flowdrill BV Company sent tools to Tarapacá University in 1996. In 1999 IPL and the ML carried out an ALECHILE research project promoted by the DAAD and CONICyT in copper sheet metal and copper pipes and sheet metal a-brass alloys. The normal <b>tools</b> are lobed, <b>conical</b> tungsten carbide <b>tool.</b> When rotated at high speed and pressed with high axial force into sheet metal or thin walled tube generated heat softens the metal and allows the drill to feed forward produce a hole and simultaneously form a bushing from the displacement material. In the market exist many features but in this thesis is used short and longs normal tools of TFD. For reach the objectives it was takes as references four qualities of the frayed end bushing, where the best one is the quality class I. It was used pure copper and a-brass alloys sheet metals, with different thickness. It was used different TFD drills diameter for four thread type, from M- 5 to M 10. Similar to the Aluminium sheet metals studies it was used the predrilling processes with HSS drills around 30 % of the TFD diameter (1, 5 – 3, 0 mm D). In the next step is used only 2, 0 mm thick metal sheet, and 9, 2 mm TFD diameter for M- 10 thread. For the case of pure commercial copper pipes is used for ¾” inch diameter and 12, 8 mm (3 / 8 ”) TFD drill for holes for 3 / 8 ” pipes and different normal HSS drills for predrilling processes. The chemical sheet metal characteristics were takes as reference for the material behaviour. The Chilean pure copper have 99, 35 % of Cu and 0, 163 % of Zinc and the Chilean a-brass alloys have 75, 6 % of Cu and 24, 0 % of Zinc. It is used two German a-brass alloys; Nº 1 have 61, 6 % of Cu, 36, 03 % of Zinc and 2, 2 % of Pb and the German a-brass alloys Nº 2 have 63, 1 % of Cu, 36, 7 % of Zinc and 0 % of Pb. The equipments used were a HAAS CNC milling machine centre, a Kistler dynamometer, PC Pentium II, Acquisition card, TESTPOINT and XAct software, 3 D measurement machine, micro hardness, universal test machine, and metallographic microscope. During the test is obtained the feed force and momentum curves that shows the material behaviour with TFD processes. In general it is take three phases. It was possible obtain the best machining data for the different sheet of copper and a-brass alloys thick of Chilean materials and bush quality class I. In the case of a-brass alloys, the chemical components and the TFD processes temperature have big influence. The temperature reach to 400 º Celsius during the TFD processes and the a-brass alloys have some percents of Zinc the bush quality is class I. But when the a-brass alloys have some percents of Lead who have 200 º C melting point is not possible to obtain a bush, because the Lead gasify and the metallographic net broke. During the TFD processes the recrystallization structures occur around the Copper and a-brass alloy bush, who gives more hardness in these zones. When the threads were produce with Form Tapping processes with Flowtap tools, this hardness amount gives a high limit load of the thread when hey are tested in a special support that was developed for it. For eliminated the predrilling processes with normal HSS drills it was developed a compound tool. With this new tool it was possible obtain the best machining data for quality class I bush. For the copper pipes it is made bush without predrilling and the quality class IV was obtained. When it is was used predrilling processes, quality classes I bush were obtained. Then with different HSS drill diameter were obtained different long bush, where were soldering with four types soldering materials between pipes with 3 / 8 ” in a big one as ¾”. Those soldering unions were tested by traction test and all the 3 / 8 ” pipes broken, and the soldering zone doesn’t have any problem. Finally were developed different solar water interchange heaters and tested. As conclusions, the present Thesis shows that the Thermal Flow Drilling in thinner metal sheets of cooper and cooper alloys needs a predrilling process for frayed end quality class I bushings, similar to thinner sheets of aluminium bushes. The compound tool developed could obtain quality class I bushings and excludes predrilling processes. The bush recrystalization, product of the friction between the tool and the material, the hardness grows and it is advantageous for the Form Tapping.

40|$|The LHCb SciFi tracker will {{be based}} on scintillating fibres with a nominal {{diameter}} of 250 μm. A small length fraction of these fibres shows millimetre-scale fluctuations of the diameter, also known as bumps and necks. In particular, bumps exceeding a diameter of about 350 μm are problematic as they can distort the winding pattern of the fibre mats over more extended regions. We present a method to reduce the diameter of large bumps to a diameter of 350 μm by locally heating and pulling the fibre through a <b>conical</b> <b>tool.</b> The method has been proven to work for bumps up to 450 – 500 μm diameter. Larger bumps need to be treated manually by a cut-and-glue technique which relies on UV-curing instant glue. The bump shrinking and cut-and-glue processes were integrated in a fibre diameter scanner at CERN. The central scanning and bump shrinking of all fibres is expected to minimise bump related issues at the four mat winding centres of the SciFi project...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of cutting speed, and thermal {{properties of the}} work material and the tool material on the thermal partition coefficient is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The temperature {{at the top of}} a <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> is measured immediately after micro chip forming using an infrared radiation pyrometer with an optical fiber. A carbon steel, a titanium, a molybdenum and a tungsten are used as work materials, and a silicon nitride Si 3 N 4, a zirconia ZrO 2 and a diamond are used as tool materials. The cutting temperature increases in proportion to the 1 / 2 power of cutting speed and saturates to the melting point of work material. The fraction of heat conducted into the cutting tool is independent on the cutting speed, and it becomes larger as the thermal conductivity of workpiece is smaller or that of tool material is larger. In the diamond tool which has the highest thermal conductivity, its thermal partition coefficient is the highest, but the tool tip temperature is the lowest...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aiming at micro {{machining}} of 3 D microstructure of {{brittle materials}} {{with a novel}} tiny-grinding wheel based on the electro-magneto-rheological (EMR) effect, five conical tools with different cone angles are designed to reveal {{the effect of the}} cone angle on the machining characteristics. The distribution of the magnetic and electric fields in the polishing area is simulated using the finite element analysis software, and the machining experiments of micro groove were conducted to confirm the simulation results. Experimental results indicate that the material removal rate increases first and decreases afterwards with the increase of the cone angle, and the section width of micro groove increases but the section depth of micro groove shows a fluctuation phenomenon within a certain range. The intensities of the electric and magnetic fields on the tip of the <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> with the 45 ° cone angle are at a larger level in the five tools, which is helpful to form a stable tiny-grinding wheel based on the EMR effect and obtain a better machining effect, so the tool with the 45 ° cone angle is an effective and ideal machining tool for the machining of 3 D microstructure...|$|E
40|$|Drilling plays a very {{influential}} role in machining since more than 40 % of material removal operations {{are associated with}} this type of action. Traditionally, it generates high temperature during drilling operation. Therefore, the drilling tool becomes dull and leads to a limited service life. Moreover, the workpiece materials have been hardened during drilling operation which makes the post operation troublesome. Also, the chips adhered to the exit of a drilled hole destruction the surface quality and deteriorates the drilling precision. To eliminate this difficulty form drilling established. Form drilling, also known as גthermal drillingג, גflow drillingג, גfriction drillingג, or גfriction stir drillingג, is the best result to the aforementioned difficulty. Form drilling is a non-traditional hole making operation. A rotating <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> is appeal to penetrate a hole and create a bushing in a single step without initiating chip. The form drilling process relies on the heat initiated from the frictional force between the tool and sheet metal workpiece to soften, penetrate, and deform the work-material into a bushing. The present review focus on a complete explanation of the influence of various drilling process parameters of form drill tool on different work material in form drilling process...|$|E
40|$|Friction {{drilling}} {{is a novel}} hole-making process {{performed on}} thin-walled sheet metals. The friction between a rapid-rotating <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> and a sheet metal generates heat to soften the work material and penetrate it to form a hole. The bushing is formed in situ from the workpiece. This experimental study investigated friction drilling process. Axial thrust forces during the process were measured by a dynamometer and data acquisition system. The thrust force curves and the cross-sectioned images of friction-drilled holes were characterized to {{study the effects of}} process parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate, workpiece thickness, and tool diameter. The results showed that either increasing spindle speed or decreasing feed rate can reduce the thrust forces. Generating a bushing with good quality has been a challenge in friction drilling. The lower die fixture was designed to improve the bushing shape in its cylindricality, cracks and petal formation. Threads were tapped to demonstrate the improvement of the bushing quality in practical application. Due to the similarities in friction stir welding and friction drilling, the feasibility of joining sheet metals in friction drilling was explored. Different coalescence conditions were observed. The potential of joining sheet metals by friction drilling was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFriction {{drilling}} is a nontraditional hole-making {{process in}} which, a rotating <b>conical</b> <b>tool</b> uses the heat generated by friction to soften and penetrate a thin workpiece {{and create a}} bushing without generating chips. During friction drilling most of the frictional heat is retained in the tool-workpiece interface. The effect of frictional heating is relatively prominent; this causes excessive temperatures in the workpiece and results in undesired material damage and improper bushing formation. To overcome these issues, this study investigates the surface texture generated from friction drilling process to characterize the behaviour of friction drilling on Al 2024 -T 6 material. The surface roughness and integrity are of prime importance for any machined components in terms of aesthetics, tribological considerations, corrosion resistance, subsequent processing advantages, fatigue life improvement as well as precision fit of critical mating surfaces. In this study, {{in addition to the}} surface roughness measurement, optical microcopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) have been carried out to gain insight into the friction drilled surface. Obtained results from the microstructures depict that the development of the microstructures are affected by the magnitude of the friction forces and the heat produced during the friction drilling process. It is also found that from the micrographs there is no direct micro-structural evidence for melting of work-material in friction drilling...|$|E
