25|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>custom</b> <b>plate</b> options in Victoria, issued by V Plates on behalf of VicRoads. <b>Custom</b> or personalised <b>plates</b> come with the {{optional}} purchase of a contract. This contract allows the plate holder to retain the plates whether on a vehicle or not. Holding a contract on certain plates, means that when the plates are no longer registered they cannot be resold/issued to another person unless the contract holder sells the contract. VicRoads (who own V Plates) do not know the cumulative figure {{of the total number of}} <b>custom</b> registration <b>plates</b> sold since they were first launched in 1986. This is because many personalised plates are not on vehicles, or they are held on self-retention, or have been handed back to VicRoads. However, VicRoads do know that around 30,000 sets of <b>custom</b> registration <b>plates</b> are made every year, and they estimate 10 percent of registered vehicles have <b>custom</b> registration <b>plates.</b>|$|R

The detector signals were fed into the scanner electronics to establish coinci-dences between the 2 systems. The detector was mounted to a rotation stage that {{is attached to the}} scanner via the <b>custom</b> mounting <b>plate</b> after removing the transmission source holder.

Furthermore, the present approach will lead to exploration of plate modification and optimization. The three-dimensional (3 D) surface model of a detailed femur and the corresponding fixation plate were represented with high-level feature parameters, and {{the shape of the}} specific plate was recursively modified in order to obtain the optimal plate for a specific patient. The proposed approach was tested and verified on a case study, and it could be helpful for orthopedic surgeons to design and modify the plate in order to fit the specific femur anatomy and the fracture information...|$|R
