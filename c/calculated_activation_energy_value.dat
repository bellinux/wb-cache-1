40|$|The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) {{paradigm}} {{details the}} existing knowledge that links the initial interaction between a chemical and a biological system, termed the molecular initiating event (MIE), {{through a series}} of intermediate events, to an adverse effect. An important example of a well-defined MIE is the formation of a covalent bond between a biological nucleophile and an electrophilic compound. This particular MIE has been associated with various toxicological end points such as acute aquatic toxicity, skin sensitization, and respiratory sensitization. This study has investigated the calculated parameters that are required to predict the rate of chemical bond formation (reactivity) of a dataset of Michael acceptors. Reactivity of these compounds toward glutathione was predicted using a combination of a <b>calculated</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>value</b> (Eact, calculated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B 3 YLP/ 6 - 31 G+(d) level of theory, and solvent-accessible surface area values (SAS) at the α carbon. To further develop the method, a fragment-based algorithm was developed enabling the reactivity to be predicted for Michael acceptors without the need to perform the time-consuming DFT calculations. Results showed the developed fragment method was successful in predicting the reactivity of the Michael acceptors excluding two sets of chemicals: volatile esters with an extended substituent at the β-carbon and chemicals containing a conjugated benzene ring as part of the polarizing group. Additionally the study also demonstrated the ease with which the approach can be extended to other chemical classes by the calculation of additional fragments and their associated Eact and SAS values. The resulting method is likely to be of use in regulatory toxicology tools where an understanding of covalent bond formation as a potential MIE is important within the AOP paradigm...|$|E

All oxides have an orthorhombic GdFeO 3 -type structure (space group Pbnm), as determined by XRD. The pseudo-cubic lattice constant increases with increasing Mn content. The electrical conductivity was measured in the temperature range from 100 to 800 degrees C in air. The substitutionally-mixed compositions exhibit a semiconducting behavior, where the small polaron hopping conductivity model applies. The normalized conductivity shows a sharp decrease when y increases in the range 0 < y < 0. 4, and it reaches a minimum in the range 0. 4 < y < 0. 6. The small polaron is trapped at the energetically lower Mn sites, and the slow transition rate to a neighboring Co site dominates the hopping process. At higher y values, the hopping proceeds among adjacent Mn sites, and as a result, an increase of conductivity is observed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of relative humidity (RH) on the oxygen permeability and water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) of whey protein coated Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or whey protein monolayer films. Furthermore, the <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> for the permeability of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen as well as the permselectivities under different set of temperatures were measured. The results showed that the permeability values through the whey protein coating and whey protein film increased with increasing RH. The water vapour permeability measured at 50 % RH of (9. 3 ± 0. 6) − 10 cm 3 (STP) cm cm− 2 s− 1 Pa− 1 increased to (16. 2 ± 0. 9) − 10 cm 3 (STP) cm cm− 2 s− 1 Pa− 1 at 85 % RH.

The study concerns dust of various origins, i. e. washing towers, electrostatic filters and polycyclones. Laboratory made pellets from these dusts were also examined. Reducibility was {{studied in the}} temperature range of 700 °C to 850 °C in a laboratory tube furnace. Experimental {{results showed that the}} reduction degree reaches maximum values of 28 % and 26 % percentage for dusts and pellets respectively within the first twenty minutes of the process, and then reaction tends to equilibrium for all cases examined. The rate of reduction increases significantly during the first ten minutes of reaction and then it becomes lower until it diminishes to zero after twenty minutes of roasting. Temperature favors the reduction process, the reduction percentage being increased as a function of temperature up to about 800 °C. Rates and reduction degrees are higher for the dusts than for the corresponding pellets, for all experimental conditions examined. Kinetic analysis of the results showed that at low temperature values the mixed kinetic model verifies the experimental results of dust and pellet samples. At higher temperatures (800 °C and 850 °C), diffusion becomes the rate determining step. The change in the controlling mechanism is attributed to the formation of silicate compounds around the grains as temperature rises.

All compositions had the GdFeO 3 -type orthorhombic perovskite structure. The lattice parameters were determined at room temperature by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). The pseudo-cubic lattice constant decreased continuously with x. The average linear {{thermal expansion}} coefficient (TEC) in the temperature range from 573 to 973 K was found to increase with x. The thermal expansion curves for all values of x displayed rapid increase in slope at high temperatures. The electrical conductivity increased with x for the entire temperature range of measurement. The <b>calculated</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>values</b> indicate that electrical conduction takes place primarily by the small polaron hopping mechanism. The charge compensation for the divalent ion on the A-site is provided by the formation of Fe 4 + ions on the B-site (in preference to Co 4 + ions) and vacancies on the oxygen sublattice for low values of x. The large increase in the conductivity with x in the range from 0. 6 to 0. 8 is attributed to the substitution of Fe 4 + ions by Co 4 + ions. The Fe site has a lower small polaron site energy than Co and hence behaves like a carrier trap, thereby drastically reducing the conductivity. The non-linear behaviour in the dependence of log sigmaT with reciprocal temperature can be attributed to the generation of additional charge carriers with increasing temperature by the charge disproportionation of Co 3 + ions.

Unlike Walter, EIS measurement was conducted at 50 °C as well as after cooling, and measurements at intermediate temperatures have been used to characterize the dependence of the process involved. The proposition that corrosion rate is controlled by the ionic resistance of an organic coating has been tested. EIS results were fitted to a model circuit and changes in the film resistance and charge-transfer resistance with temperature were analyzed to deduce <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> for the processes involved. Surprisingly, the <b>calculated</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> for coating resistance is significantly lower than the <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> for the charge transfer resistance.

40|$|Cobalt(III) - and copper(II) -Schiff base {{complexes}} {{have been}} prepared by reaction of the bidentate Schiff base ligand (HL: 2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -iminosalicylidenethane) with cobalt(II) and copper(II) chlorides. Structures of the synthesized complexes have been characterized by various physicochemical techniques, such as IR and UV–Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG), and by elemental analysis. Additionally, the redox behavior of the cobalt(III) and copper(II) complexes has been examined by cyclic voltammetry at a glassy carbon electrode in DMF solutions. Thermogravimetric analysis has been employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the prepared complexes CoIII(L) 3 · 1 / 2 H 2 O, CuII(L) 2, {{in addition to the}} previously synthesized HL and NiII(L) 2. Furthermore, <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> of the thermal decomposition were calculated using Kissinger, Ozawa and Coats-Redfern methods. The <b>calculated</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> were also useful to evaluate kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the ligand and the corresponding metal complexes including ΔS, ΔH and ΔG. <b>Calculated</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> follow the order: Ea(NiII(L) 2) > Ea(CuII(L) 2) > Ea(CoIII(L) 3 · 1 / 2 H 2 O) ...|$|R
40|$|Isothermal {{reduction}} of haematite carbon mixtures was investigated at temperatures 750 - 1100 degrees C under inert atmosphere. Mass loss curves proved the stepwise {{reduction of}} haematite to metallic iron. The non-linear feature of haematite to magnetite reduction kinetics was observed and an <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> of 209 kJ mol(- 1) was calculated. Irrespective of carbon-bearing material type, reduction rate of magnetite was linear. <b>Activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>values</b> were <b>calculated</b> to be 293 - 418 kJ mol(- 1). Significant {{increase in the}} reduction kinetics in the last step (Wustite reduction) was observed and explained by the catalytic effect of freshly formed metallic iron.

40|$|The {{properties}} of untreated {{sugar cane bagasse}} (SCB) and soft wood (SW) and their respective celluloses were investigated. The celluloses indicated improved crystallinity index values and decreased concentration of lignin and hemicellulose compared to their untreated counterparts. Three degradation models, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (OFW), and Kissinger (KGR) methods were employed to determine apparent <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>values.</b> Generally, the thermal degradation processes of both sugarcane bagasse and soft wood included dehydration, degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose, whereas the lignin degraded from the degradation temperature of hemicellulose {{to the end of}} the cellulose. The apparent <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>values</b> obtained from the OFW and KAS models vary with the degree of conversion, and showed similar trends. The <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> obtained by KGR were relatively lower than those obtained from the KAS and OFW methods...|$|R
