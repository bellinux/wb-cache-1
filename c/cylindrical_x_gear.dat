The <b>cylindrical</b> 3.6 <b>x</b> 20 m module consisted of six individual crew compartments, a kitchen/dining room, a living room, the main control room, and a toilet. The individual bedroom compartments, which had an area of approximately 3 m2 each, contained a bed, a desk, a chair and shelves for personal belongings.|$|R

Fourteen are {{available}} from the outset, with Testament and Dizzy unlockable characters. Guilty <b>Gear</b> <b>X</b> Plus adds three unlockable characters: Justice and Kliff Undersn, who return from the first game, and Robo-Ky, an alternate version of Ky Kiske. The Plus edition allows a player to unlock gold versions of each character, who possesses a special advantage over the regular version.|$|R

Guilty <b>Gear</b> <b>X</b> Plus also has art-gallery and story modes; according to the Sega website, the latter explains [...] "misteries" [...] which the Dreamcast version does not.

40|$|Marketed sources {{equipped}} with polycapillary optics allow now laboratory X Ray Fluorescence XRF analysis with 5 10 m lateral resolution. To improve it, {{we had the}} idea to use a thin <b>cylindrical</b> <b>X</b> ray capillary fitted to the XRF detector. The combination with near field microscopy would then lead to a simultaneous record of both topography and XRF from a sample at m lateral resolution. For this purpose, we have built a home made Shear Force Microscope {{to carry out this}} experiment in the future. In a first step, we have validated the microscope, operating in SNOM configuration, using test sample consisting in ZnO clusters deposited on a Si 3 N 4 grating. Second, the feasibility of XRF collection through a thin <b>X</b> ray <b>cylindrical</b> capillary on Co Ti sample is shown in this work. The results suggest that sub 1 m in lab XRF analysis is possible, replacing the optical fibre of our SNOM apparatus by an X ray capillary. On the basis of modelling our results, we then further discuss the possibility to reach 100 nm XRF resolution, combined to surface topography, working in synchrotron environmen...|$|R

40|$|The Harary-Hill Conjecture States {{that the}} number of {{crossings}} in any drawing of the complete graph K_n in the plane is at least Z(n) := 1 / 4 n/ 2 n- 1 / 2 n- 2 / 2 n- 3 / 2. In this paper, we settle the Harary-Hill conjecture for shellable drawings. We say that a drawing D of K_n is s -shellable if there exist a subset S = {v_ 1,v_ 2, [...] .,v_ s} of the vertices and a region R of D with the following property: For all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ s, if D_ij is the drawing obtained from D by removing v_ 1,v_ 2, [...] . v_i- 1,v_j+ 1, [...] .,v_s, then v_i and v_j are on the boundary of the region of D_ij that contains R.

Unveiled at the Amusement Expo in February 2000, Guilty <b>Gear</b> <b>X</b> was released for Japanese arcades on the Sega NAOMI system in July 2000. After the game's release, it was speculated that it would be ported to home consoles. Although the developers initially indicated that Guilty <b>Gear</b> <b>X</b> would debut for the PlayStation 2 (PS2), it was first released for Dreamcast on December 14, 2000 and re-released as part of a Dreamcast collection on May 23, 2003.|$|R

It is noted that the dual-channel construction not only doubles the data acquisition rate but also permits {{a reversal of the}} electrostatic field orientation in the inner channel for lighter ions. The outer channel is then optimized for ions of medium to high mass numbers, resulting in increased mass resolution for such heavy ions. When combined with a <b>cylindrical</b> E bar <b>x</b> B bar analyzer, a 90 -deg-deflection angle spherical electrostatic analyzer provides an extremely wide viewing angle.
