50|$|It {{was found}} that the amount of {{fertilizing}} pollen can influence secondary sex ratio in dioecious plants. Increase in pollen amount leads to decrease in number of male plants in the progeny. This relationship was confirmed on four plant species from three families - Rumex acetosa (Polygonaceae), Melandrium album (Cariophyllaceae), Cannabis sativa and Humulus japonicus (<b>Cannabinaceae).</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} three years, {{there has been a}} renewed {{interest}} in the production of fiber hemp (Cannabis sativa L., <b>Cannabinaceae)</b> in Alberta. This effort has sparked a great deal of interest and speculation regarding the crop’s potential. Since 1995 fiber hemp research plots have been grown in various parts of Alberta to evaluate the potential of this crop for both seed and fiber production (Blade 1998). Research licenses were granted by the Health Protection Branch of Health Canada, the branch of the federal government charged with enforcing legislation concerning this species. In March, 1998, Health Canada announced that commercial production of low-THC hemp would be allowed through a licensing process. Hemp is an annual herbaceous plant which flourishes in temperate regions (Bosca and Karus 1998). All cultivars tested in Alberta have been low-THC (delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol) genotypes. Canada has adopted the 0. 3 % THC standard established by the European Union and the OECD as the concentration which separates non-psychoactive strains suitable for legal fiber production from those which are illegally grown for their properties of intoxication. The 0. 3 % THC designation is ver...|$|E
40|$|The present review {{describes}} the morphological, phytochemical and ethnopharmacological aspects of Humulus lupulus L. (<b>Cannabinaceae)</b> and summarizes {{the most interesting}} findings obtained in the preclinical and clinical research related to the plant. The female inflorescences of Humulus lupulus (hops), well-known as bittering agent in brewing industry, have long been used in traditional medicine mainly to treat sleep disturbances. However the sedative activity is still under investigation in order to recognize the active principles responsible for the neuropharmacological effects observed in laboratory animals, and their mechanism of action. Here we report the data from our experiments {{as well as those}} obtained from other researchers, focusing on the variability of the results. Other traditional applications of hops as stomachic, antibacterial and antifungal remedy have been supported by in vivo and/or in vitro investigations. In recent years some prenylated chalcones present in hops have received much attention for their biological effects: in particular, xanthohumol has been shown to exert cancer chemopreventive activity in in vitro experiments, while 8 -prenylnaringenin has been characterized {{as one of the most}} potent phytoestrogens isolated until now. Nevertheless much additional work is needed to open up new biomedical application of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{have been}} {{sporadic}} reports of hypersensitivity reactions to plants of the <b>Cannabinaceae</b> family (hemp and hops), {{but it has}} remained unclear whether these reactions are immunologic or nonimmunologic in nature. Objective: We examined the IgE-binding and histamine-releasing properties of hashish and marijuana extracts by CAP-FEIA and a basophil histamine release test. Methods: Two workers at a forensic laboratory suffered from nasal congestion, rbinitis, sneezing and asthmatic symptoms upon occupational contact with hashish or marijuana, which they had handled frequently for 25 and 16 years, respectively. Neither patient {{had a history of}} atopic disease. Serum was analyzed for specific IgE antibodies to hashish or marijuana extract by research prototype ImmunoCAP, and histamine release from basophils upon exposure to hashish or marijuana extracts was assessed. Results were matched to those of 4 nonatopic and 10 atopic control subjects with no known history of recreational or occupational exposure to marijuana or hashish. Results: Patient 1 had specific IgE to both hashish and marijuana (CAP class 2), and patient 2 to marijuana only (CAP class 2). Controls proved negative for specific IgE except for 2 atopic individuals with CAP class 1 to marijuana and 1 other atopic individual with CAP class 1 to hashish. Stimulation of basophils with hashish or marijuana extracts elicited histamine release from basophils of both patients and 4 atopic control subjects. Conclusions: Our results suggest an IgE-related pathomechanism for hypersensitivity reactions to marijuana or hashish. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is {{probably}} one of the oldest field crops used in nutrition, but also for the production of fibres for clothes, ropes or canvas. Cannabis sativa is one of the most spread species of cannabis which belongs to family <b>Cannabinaceae.</b> The seeds are important part of cannabis sativa, which contains high part of lipids and proteins. It provides also valuable essential fatty acids, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Due to low content of THC is possible to produce valuable oil from seeds, which is used in cosmetic and food industry. The aim of this work was to evaluate composition of hemp seeds from one harvest, observe and compare quality of parameters both cold pressed hemp seed oil and hemp seed oil by CO 2 extraction.   Both oils are comparable in composition of fatty acids which follow from results of analyses. Also contents of sterols and moisture are similar in both oils. The saponification value is similar in both oils, conformable to as a iodine value. Also were found dissimilarities in colours, phospholipides, unsaponifiable matter, acid value and peroxide value. The cold pressed hemp seed oil contained lower values of unsaponifiable matter, colours and higher concentration of phospholipides and lower acid value. It is caused by influence of CO 2. The oxidation stability of cold pressed hemp seed oil was four times higher than oil by CO 2 extraction.   doi: 10. 5219 / 32  </p...|$|E

The oil of the seeds of Cannabis sativa exerted pronounced antibacterial activity (21 - 28 mm) against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, moderate activity (15 mm) against Escherichia coli and high activity (16 mm) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and inactive against the two fungi tested. The {{petroleum ether}} extract of the whole plant exhibited pronounced antibacterial activity (23 - 28 mm) against both Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus organisms, high activity (16 mm) against Escherichia coli and inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and both fungi. The methanol extract of the whole plant showed also pronounced antibacterial activity (29 mm) against Bacillus subtilis, low activity (12 mm) against Staphylococcus aureus and high activity (16 - 18 mm) against both Gram negative organisms, inactive against Aspergillus niger and low activity (13 mm) against Candida albicans. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of Cannabis sativa methanol extracts of the seeds and the whole plant against the standard organisms were determined using the agar plate dilution method.

40|$|The hop, Humulus lupulus, is a {{cultivated}} flowering plant, {{green in}} color that has many economically important roles. The hop {{belongs to the}} hemp family, <b>Cannabinaceae.</b> There are many features that are distinctive about this plant. A hops plant has yellow lupulin glands between the petals, which is used for preservative and flavoring characteristics in beer. The bitterness of the hop is used to balance {{the sweetness of the}} malt, and the essential oils add a flavor and aroma which cannot be achieved by using any other plant. The hop plant is a perennial spiraling vine, which will grow in almost any climate given enough water and sunlight. It can climb either string or poles and can reach height of 40 feet. The flowers are usually dried before use. Farmers have developed a systemic approach to the cultivation of hops. There are also a number of chemical compounds present in this plant that give rise to its economic value. (1) The hop plant has several structurally distinctive properties. The root is stout and perennial. The stem that arise from it every year is of a twining nature, reaching a great length, flexible and very tough, angular and prickly, with a tenacious fiber. This fiber has been explored in the manufacturing of a white, durable cloth. The cloth is not of wide use because the fibers are so difficult to separate. Normally, the stems require to be steeped in water a whole winter before they can be utilized. Paper has also bee...|$|E
40|$|Sequence {{similarity}} in the 16 S rDNA gene confirmed that crucifer pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. alisalensis belongs to P. syringae sensu lato. In reciprocal DNA/DNA hybridization experiments, DNA relatedness was high (69 – 100 %) between P. syringae pv. alisalensis strains {{and the type}} strain of P. cannabina (genomospecies 9). In contrast, DNA relatedness was low (below 48 %) between P. syringae pv. alisalensis and reference strains from the remaining genomospecies of P. syringae including the type strain of P. syringae and reference strain of genomospecies 3 (P. syringae pv. tomato) although the well-known crucifer pathogen, P. syringae pv. maculicola, also belongs to genomospecies 3. Additional evidence that P. syringae pv. alisalensis belongs to P. cannabina was sequence {{similarity in}} five gene fragments used in multilocus sequence typing, as well as similar rep-PCR patterns when using the BOX-A 1 R primers. The description of P. cannabina has been emended to include P. syringae pv. alisalensis. Host range testing demonstrated that P. syringae pv. alisalensis strains, originally isolated from broccoli, broccoli raab or arugula, were not pathogenic on Cannabis sativa (family <b>Cannabinaceae).</b> Additionally, P. cannabina strains, originally isolated from the C. sativa were not pathogenic on broccoli raab or oat while P. syringae pv. alisalensis strains were pathogenic on these hosts. Distinct host ranges for these two groups indicate that P. cannabina emend. consists {{of at least two}} distinct pathovars, P. cannabina pv. cannabina pv. nov., and P. cannabina pv. alisalensis comb. nov.
