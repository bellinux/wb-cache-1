40|$|Abstract Importance {{measure is}} an index for {{estimating}} {{the importance of}} an individual component {{or a group of}} <b>components</b> <b>in</b> a reliability system. So far, the importance measures for <b>components</b> <b>in</b> stochastic reliability systems have been investigated. In order to calculate the importance of a component or a group of <b>components</b> <b>in</b> an uncertain reliability system, this paper proposes a new concept of importance index. Some formulas are given to calculate the importance index of a component and a group of <b>components</b> <b>in</b> an uncertain reliability system. Then, some special types of uncertain reliability systems such as uncertain series, parallel, parallel-series, series-parallel, bridge, and k-out-of-n systems are studied...|$|R

5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor <b>component</b> <b>in</b> most zinc ores and is a {{byproduct}} of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt in {{compound}} form {{occurs as}} a minor component of copper and nickel minerals. It is the major metallic <b>component</b> <b>in</b> combination with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs2), glaucodot ((Co,Fe)AsS), and skutterudite (CoAs3) minerals. The mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of the Katanga Province. Upon contact with the atmosphere, weathering occurs and the sulfide minerals oxidize to form pink erythrite ("cobalt glance": Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O) and spherocobaltite (CoCO3).|$|E

The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic <b>component</b> <b>in</b> AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a minor <b>component</b> <b>in</b> mixed fill deposits. This {{suggests}} that Motul de San José was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} <b>component</b> <b>in</b> {{zinc sulfide}} ores and is {{produced}} as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{by-products}} at Rjukan was {{the production}} of heavy water—a key <b>component</b> <b>in</b> nuclear weapons, and necessary for the Germany designs as a moderator. The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer of heavy water, and in 1939 IG Farben, who owned 25% of Norsk Hydro at the time, asked to import five liters of heavy water, but was denied {{due to lack of}} an export license. In 1939–40 production at Vemork was 20 kilograms, by 1942 production had increased to five kilograms per day.|$|E
