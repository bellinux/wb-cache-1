5|$|The type's first fatal {{accident}} occurred on 30 June 1994 near Toulouse {{on a test}} flight when an Airbus-owned A330-300 crashed while simulating an engine failure on <b>climbout,</b> killing all seven on board. Airbus subsequently advised A330 operators to disconnect the autopilot and limit pitch attitude {{in the event of}} an engine failure at low speed.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 1930, a Sabena F.VII (OO-AIN) {{crashed on}} <b>climbout</b> from Croydon Airport {{due to an}} {{in-flight}} fire, killing both pilots.|$|E
25|$|Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 322 was a {{scheduled}} Buenos Aires–São Paulo–Port of Spain–New York City international passenger service, operated with a Comet 4, registration LV-AHR, that crashed during <b>climbout</b> {{on the early}} stages of its second leg, when it collided with tree tops shortly after takeoff from Viracopos-Campinas International Airport on 23 November 1961. There were 52 fatalities, 40 of them passengers.|$|E
25|$|US Airways Flight 1549 was an Airbus A320-214 which, in the <b>climbout</b> {{after takeoff}} from New York City's LaGuardia Airport on January 15, 2009, struck {{a flock of}} Canada geese just {{northeast}} of the George Washington Bridge and consequently lost all engine power. Unable to reach any airport, pilots Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles glided the plane to a ditching in the Hudson River off Midtown Manhattan. All 155 people aboard were rescued by nearby boats and there were few serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 1964, {{a pair of}} {{commercial}} pilots flew a Cessna 150 into the Meteor Crater in Arizona. On crossing the rim, they could not maintain level flight. The pilot attempted to build up speed by circling in the crater to climb over the rim. During the attempted <b>climbout,</b> the aircraft stalled, crashed, and caught fire. It is commonly reported that the plane ran out of fuel, but this is incorrect. Both occupants were severely injured but survived their ordeal. A {{small portion of the}} wreckage not removed from the crash site remains visible to this day.|$|E
500|$|Several {{in-flight}} shutdowns of Trent 700–powered A330-300s occurred. On 11 November 1996, {{engine failure}} on a Cathay Pacific flight forced {{it back to}} Ho Chi Minh City. On 17 April 1997, Cathay Pacific's subsidiary Dragonair experienced an engine shutdown on an A330, caused by carbon clogging the oil filter. As a result, Cathay Pacific self-suspended its 120-minute ETOPS clearance. [...] Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during <b>climbout</b> with a Cathay Pacific A330, due to a bearing failure in a Hispano-Suiza-built gearbox. Three days later, a Cathay Pacific A330 on <b>climbout</b> during a Bangkok–Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant engine spool down, forcing a return to Bangkok. The cause was traced to metal contamination in the engine's master chip. Following a fifth engine failure on 23 May, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair voluntarily grounded their A330 fleets for two weeks, causing major disruption as Cathay's eleven A330s made up fifteen per cent of its passenger capacity. Rolls-Royce and Hispano-Suiza developed a redesigned lubrication system to resolve the problem.|$|E
2500|$|Muñiz Air National Guard Base or [...] "Base Muñiz" [...] in Carolina, Puerto Rico was {{formally}} named in 1963 to honor {{of one of}} the initial members of the unit who was killed in the line of duty. Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Muñiz (full name: José Antonio Muñiz Vazquez) was lost on July 4, 1960 when his F-86D lost power on <b>climbout</b> for a formation fly-by. [...] Major General Orlando Llenza, then a fellow aviator in the unit, later described the loss in the following translation: ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{around the}} same time, JP550 {{contacted}} middle-sector controller Bojan Erjavec asking for a higher flight level; the aircraft was at [...] FL280 and FL310 were unavailable, so Erjavec informed JP550 {{of the situation and}} offered , which the pilots accepted. To get clearance for a higher level, it was necessary to obtain the permission of the upper-sector controller. Erjavec waved his hand to get Tasić's attention, but Tasić (who was working the upper sector on his own, as co-worker Mladen Hochberger had gone to search for Nenad Tepeš, Tasić's replacement who was running late) was far too busy to be interrupted. Middle sector controller Gradimir Pelin was then instructed to co-ordinate the <b>climbout</b> for the DC-9 with Tasić.|$|E

50|$|The 1998 Lignes Aériennes Congolaises crash {{refers to}} a non-scheduled {{domestic}} Kindu-Kinshasa passenger service that was shot down by rebel forces, just after takeoff from Kindu Airport, during <b>climbout,</b> on 10 October 1998.

5000|$|On 26 October 1989, Flight 204, a Boeing 737-200, {{struck a}} {{mountain}} near Hualien, Taiwan after the crew used the <b>climbout</b> procedure of the incorrect runway, causing the aircraft {{to make a}} wrong turn. All 54 passengers and crew aboard were killed.|$|E
5000|$|On July 5, 1993, a test {{example of}} Ilyushin Il-114 {{suffered}} a crash during testing at Ramenskoye Airport, due to crew error when pre-takeoff engine run-up protocol was not followed and both engines stalled on throttle-back during <b>climbout.</b> 7 of 9 crewmembers were killed.|$|E
50|$|Crash {{investigators}} {{determined that}} the pilots of Flight 725 didn't use the checklists prior to departure. During <b>climbout,</b> the pilots became confused about what heading to take during a standard instrument departure. Spatial disorientation {{was believed to be}} one factor in the crash of Flight 725.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, a climb is the {{operation}} of increasing the altitude of an aircraft. It is also the logical phase of a typical flight (the climb phase or <b>climbout)</b> following takeoff and preceding the cruise. During the climb phase there {{is an increase in}} altitude to a predetermined level.|$|E
5000|$|On February 27, 1951, a Convair CV-240-2 (N90664) {{crashed on}} <b>climbout</b> from Tulsa International Airport after the flaps were {{retracted}} at a too low air speed following engine problems; all 34 {{passengers and crew}} survived, but the aircraft was written off. The aircraft was operating a Minneapolis-Houston service with intermediate stops.|$|E

5000|$|On 11 February 1978 Pacific Western Airlines Flight 314, a Boeing 737-200, crashed while {{executing}} a rejected {{landing at}} Cranbrook Airport.

Out of 5 crew members and 44 passengers, only 6 passengers and a flight attendant survived.|$|E
50|$|Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 644 {{refers to}} a Douglas DC-6, {{registration}} LV-ADW, that on 19 July 1961 was due to operate a domestic scheduled passenger service between Ministro Pistarini International Airport and General Enrique Mosconi International Airport, but crashed 12 km west of Pardo, Buenos Aires, Argentina, half an hour after takeoff, owing to severe turbulence during <b>climbout.</b> Some reports stated the aircraft was struck by lightning.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the crash, pilot Moore and co-pilot Banty were detained by Mexican authorities. The investigation found that during the <b>climbout</b> process, the horses inside the aircraft panicked and ran around inside the compartment, causing a shift on the aircraft's center of gravity. A short circuit later occurred and caused a gear malfunction, which caused small fires {{on the body of}} the aircraft and further panicked the horses.|$|E
