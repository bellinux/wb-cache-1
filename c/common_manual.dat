The wheelbasecar grew 2 in and the track width was also increased, while the overall length of the vehicle was slightly shorter than the previous generation. The curb weight of the vehicle increased by about 80 lbs kg relative to the 1994 model. Dual air bags were added and the automatic seatbelts were replaced with <b>common</b> <b>manual</b> type.

40|$|Position {{and rate}} control {{are the two}} <b>common</b> <b>manual</b> control modes in teleoperations. Human {{operator}} performance using the two modes is evaluated and compared.

Then {{the effects of the}} manipulator system dynamics are investigated by varying the natural frequency and speed limit. Experimental results show that ideal position control is superior to ideal rate control, regardless of joystick type or display mode, when the manipulation work space is small or comparable to the human operator's control space. Results also show that when the manipulator system is slow, the superiority of position control disappears. Position control is recommended for small-work-space telemanipulation tasks, while rate control is recommended for slow wide-work-space telemanipulation tasks...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} industrial system, both working in low and medium power, {{is the possibility}} that some circuits have a current dispersion, with a subsequent increasing in local temperature. This situation, if not immediately corrected, can produce, in some cases, firing accidents, with a great amount of money loss and long period of out-of-order systems. Although procedures based on Infrared Thermography to analyze and find critical situations already exist, these are always based on long manual procedures and usually are used for analysis of complex industrial systems. In this paper, after a short review of the <b>common</b> <b>manual</b> thermograph investigation, an automatic system based on two infrared thermograph cameras and an image processing real time analysis is proposed. The device demonstrates the possibility to take under control some critical systems and preventing firing accident in automatic way.

In this study, we demonstrate the value of a microsystem for the fully automated detection of drug-induced changes in cellular viability by continuous monitoring of the metabolic activity over several days. To this end, glucose consumption and lactate secretion of a hepatic tumor cell line were continuously measured using microfluidically addressed electrochemical sensors. Adapting enzyme-based electrochemical flat-plate sensors, originally designed for human whole-blood samples, to their use with cell culture medium supersedes the <b>common</b> <b>manual</b> and laborious colorimetric assays and off-line operated external measurement system s.

40|$|Purpose. Intracyclic {{velocity}} {{variation is}} an important kinematic parameter to evaluate swimming performance. It can be estimated by a fixed point at the swimmer’s hip. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the reproducibility and repeatability of active light markers to measure intracyclic velocity variation in swimming. Methods. Reproducibility and repeatability were tested by image measurement, by five manual digitizing processes and five sessions of automatic tracking of a LED marker set in a swimmer’s hip. The procedures were evaluated by the intraclass correlation coefficient, and the agreement between the methods was evaluated with Bland-Altman plots. The reproducibility was excellent in both procedures. Results. The repeatability of manual digitalization ranged between satisfactory to excellent, while the repeatability of automatic tracking was excellent. In addition, the Bland-Altman plots displayed a good agreement between manual and automatic measurements. The automatic tracking was 27 % faster than manual digitization. Conclusions. Active markers are promising to evaluate the intracyclic velocity variation of swimmers, with a faster response than the <b>common</b> <b>manual</b> processing...|$|E
40|$|Langmuir probe {{traces of}} plasmas are {{routinely}} analyzed to determine important characteristics, such as plasma density and electron temperatures. This article describes how a <b>common</b> <b>manual</b> technique to analyze probe {{data can be}} automated and how {{the sensitivity of the}} results to changes in the operator‐specified starting values can be explored. The probe traces, which were taken in an electron cyclotron resonance plasma source, characteristically exhibit two Maxwellian electron populations, one at a bulk (Tebulk≊ 3 – 5 eV) and one at a hot (Tehot≊ 12 – 20 eV) temperature. The electron current (F) {{as a function of the}} sweep voltage (ν) of the probe traces is modeled by: F(ν) = Isate{(1 − p) exp[(Vp − ν) /Tebulk] + p[*]exp[(Vp − ν) /Tehot]}, where Isate is the electron saturation current, p is the ratio of the hot electron current to the total, and Vp is the plasma potential. The algorithm for probe analysis partitions the sweep voltage into three intervals and uses different models and fitting techniques in each interval. The procedure’s sensitivity to different operator inputs is evaluated using factorial experiments...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis {{and other}} kinds of mycobacteriosis are serious {{illnesses}} for which early diagnosis is critical for disease control. Sputum sample analysis is a <b>common</b> <b>manual</b> technique employed for bacillus detection but current sample-analysis techniques are time-consuming, very tedious, subject to poor specificity and require highly trained personnel. Image-processing and pattern-recognition techniques are appropriate tools for improving the manual screening of samples. Here we present a new technique for sputum image analysis that combines invariant shape features and chromatic channel thresholding. Some feature descriptors were extracted from an edited bacillus data set to characterize their shape. They were statistically represented by using a Gaussian mixture model representation and a minimal error Bayesian classification procedure was employed for the last identification stage. This technique constitutes a step towards automating the process and providing a high specificity. © 2006 The Authors.
