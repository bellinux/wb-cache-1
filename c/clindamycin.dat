5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> {{preparations}} for oral administration include capsules (containing <b>clindamycin</b> hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing <b>clindamycin</b> palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored for administration of <b>clindamycin</b> to children, {{due to its}} extremely foul taste and odor. <b>Clindamycin</b> is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing <b>clindamycin</b> phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing <b>clindamycin</b> hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{combination}} acne treatments containing <b>clindamycin</b> {{are also}} marketed, such as single-product formulations of <b>clindamycin</b> with benzoyl peroxide—sold as BenzaClin (Sanofi-Aventis), Duac (a gel form made by Stiefel), and Acanya, among other trade names—and, in the United States, {{a combination of}} <b>clindamycin</b> and tretinoin, sold as Ziana. In India, vaginal suppositories containing <b>clindamycin</b> in combination with clotrimazole are manufactured by Olive Health Care and sold as Clinsup-V. In Egypt, vaginal cream containing <b>clindamycin</b> produced by Biopharmgroup sold as Vagiclind indicated for vaginosis.|$|E
5|$|The topically used <b>clindamycin</b> {{phosphate}} is a phosphate-ester prodrug of <b>clindamycin.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic {{produced by the}} actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of <b>clindamycin</b> was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966. It {{has been on the}} market since 1968.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and <b>clindamycin,</b> which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown <b>clindamycin</b> reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> is used {{primarily}} to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, <b>clindamycin</b> {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of <b>clindamycin</b> phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E
5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, <b>clindamycin</b> {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. <b>Clindamycin</b> {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to <b>clindamycin</b> as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E
5|$|Most aerobic Gram-negative {{bacteria}} (such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) {{are resistant}} to <b>clindamycin,</b> as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which <b>clindamycin</b> is a first-line drug of choice.|$|E
5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition {{commonly associated with}} <b>clindamycin,</b> but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well. Overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, which is inherently resistant to <b>clindamycin,</b> results {{in the production of}} a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of <b>clindamycin</b> and quinine {{is the standard}} treatment for severe babesiosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> and {{adapalene}} {{in combination}} {{are also more}} effective than either drug alone, although adverse effects are more frequent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> {{has been}} proven to {{decrease}} the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to {{about a third of}} the risk of untreated women.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> is {{available}} as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and topical use (The exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not {{available as a}} generic in the USA).|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> {{may also}} be used to treat toxoplasmosis, and, in {{combination}} with primaquine, is effective in treating mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>clindamycin</b> in {{conjunction}} with benzoyl peroxide is more effective {{in the treatment of}} acne than the use of either product by itself.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> has a {{primarily}} bacteriostatic effect. It is {{a bacterial}} protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, {{in a similar}} way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the 50S rRNA of the large bacterial ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> is {{marketed as}} generic and under trade names {{including}} Cleocin HCl, Dalacin, Lincocin (Bangladesh), Dalacin, and Clindacin. Combination products include Duac, BenzaClin, Clindoxyl and Acanya (in combination with benzoyl peroxide), and Ziana (with tretinoin).|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> may {{be useful}} in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); many strains of MRSA are still {{susceptible}} to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA is becoming increasingly resistant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> may {{prolong the}} effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its {{similarity}} to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means {{they should not be}} given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{recommended}} that combinations of cheaper or more cost-effective drugs (such as co-trimoxazole with rifampicin or <b>clindamycin)</b> be tried before linezolid {{in the treatment}} of SSTIs when susceptibility of the causative organism allows it.|$|E
5|$|The X-ray crystal {{structures}} of <b>clindamycin</b> bound to ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) derived from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Haloarcura marismortui have been determined; {{the structure of}} the closely related antibiotic lincomycin bound to the 50S ribosomal subunit of Staphylococcus aureus has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{veterinary}} uses of <b>clindamycin</b> {{are quite}} similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, {{for which it is}} the preferred drug in dogs and cats. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clindamycin</b> {{was first}} made in 1967. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.06 to 0.12 USD per pill. In the United States it costs about 2.70 USD a dose.|$|E
5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or <b>clindamycin</b> are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies. First-generation cephalosporins {{may be used in}} those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin. Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, <b>clindamycin,</b> erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include <b>clindamycin,</b> erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus <b>clindamycin</b> early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine. Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include <b>clindamycin,</b> erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} ACT {{is based on}} the level of {{resistance}} to the constituents in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives are not appropriate for monotherapy. As second-line antimalarial treatment, when initial treatment does not work, an alternative ACT known to be effective in the region is recommended, such as artesunate plus tetracycline or doxycycline or <b>clindamycin,</b> and quinine plus tetracycline or doxycycline or <b>clindamycin.</b> Any of these combinations is to be given for 7 days. For pregnant women, the recommended first-line treatment during the first trimester is quinine plus <b>clindamycin</b> for 7 days. Artesunate plus <b>clindamycin</b> for 7 days is indicated if this treatment fails. For travellers returning to nonendemic countries, atovaquone/proguanil, artemether/lumefantrineany and quinine plus doxycycline or <b>clindamycin</b> are recommended.|$|E
25|$|C. difficile colitis is {{associated}} most strongly {{with the use}} of the following antibiotics: fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and <b>clindamycin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{of choice}} for the {{treatment}} of bacterial vaginosis include metronidazole and <b>clindamycin.</b> The treatment {{of choice for}} bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women include metronidazole oral twice daily for seven days, or metronidazole gel intravaginally once daily for five days, or <b>clindamycin</b> intravaginally at bedtime for seven days. For pregnant women, the treatment of choice is metronidazole oral three times a day for seven days. Data does not report routine treatment of male sexual partners.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial vaginosis: The most {{commonly}} used antibiotics are metronidazole, available in both pill and gel form, and <b>clindamycin</b> available in both pill and cream form.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} with the antibiotics metronidazole or <b>clindamycin.</b> They {{can be either}} given by mouth or applied inside the vagina. About 10% to 15% of people, however, do not improve with the first course of antibiotics and recurrence rates of up to 80% have been documented. Recurrence rates are increased with sexual activity with the same pre-/posttreatment partner and inconsistent condom use although estrogen-containing contraceptives decrease recurrence. When <b>clindamycin</b> is given to pregnant women symptomatic with BV before 22 weeks of gestation the risk of pre-term birth before 37 weeks of gestation is lower.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotic {{treatment}} {{should cover}} both S.nbsp&pyogenes and S.nbsp&aureus. This may include {{a combination of}} cephalosporins, penicillins or vancomycin. The addition of <b>clindamycin</b> or gentamicin reduces toxin production and mortality.|$|E
25|$|Group B Streptococcus screen. If positive, {{the woman}} {{receives}} IV penicillin or ampicillin while in labor—or, {{if she is}} allergic to penicillin, an alternative therapy, such as IV <b>clindamycin</b> or IV vancomycin.|$|E
