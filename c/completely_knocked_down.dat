25|$|Olympique Lyonnais began {{play at the}} Gerland in 1950 {{and have}} {{remained}} at the stadium since. The stadia originally had a cycling track, but was removed to increase the seating capacity to 50,000. In 1984, minor renovations {{were made to the}} stadium by architect Rene Gagis. This included construction of the Jean Bouin and Jean Jaurès stands. Further renovations were needed to prepare the stadium for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as by that time FIFA had mandated that all stadiums used for international matches, including the World Cup, had to be all-seated. The north and south stands, known as the Jean Jaurès and Jean Bouin stand, respectively, were <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> and rebuilt, and the athletics track that had remained, even after the cycling track had been removed, was taken out. The renovations were done by architect Albert Constantin. The new incarnation of Gerland has a maximum capacity of 40,500.|$|E

50|$|The Ontos crews {{liked the}} vehicle, and its commanders praised it. The {{relatively}} light {{weight of the}} M50s meant that they could also go where tanks got bogged down. The Ontos, with its lower ground pressure, could drag timbers up to the tanks to help get them unstuck. In one operation, the Ontos was the only tracked vehicle light enough to cross a pontoon bridge. In the Battle of Hue, Regimental Commander Colonel Stanley S. Hughes felt the Ontos was the most effective of all Marine supporting arms. Its mobility made it less vulnerable than tanks, which suffered heavy losses, while at ranges of 300 to 500 yd, its recoilless rifles could knock holes in or <b>completely</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> walls. The appearance of an Ontos was sometimes {{enough to make the}} enemy break and run, and anecdotal accounts describe the enemy fleeing occupied buildings when an Ontos's spotting round entered a window. In Operation Desoto, the introduction of the large CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter made possible moving a platoon 25 mi south of Quan Ngai City carrying Ontos in slings underneath the aircraft.|$|R

2500|$|... 4-door {{sedan and}} station wagon Rebels from CKD (<b>Completely</b> <b>Knocked</b> <b>Down)</b> kits were {{assembled}} by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Australian models {{were made with}} a RHD version of the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash and two-dial instrument pack rather than the North American dash and rectangular speedo. The dash and cluster were reused for all subsequent models, including the Matador. The cars were built with right-hand drive and the body had the engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors installed in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly in Australia. Australian models had to have aftermarket amber rear indicator lights fitted in the boot (trunk) lid to 1969 and amber lenses fitted behind the clear reverse lenses on 1970 models, as flashing red indicators were barred in Australia. Also in Australia, numerous other parts and components such as brakes, seats, carpet, lights, heaters, etc. were sourced locally to gain tariff concessions. As AMI also assembled Toyota vehicles, some parts used on the AMI Rebels were sourced from Toyota.|$|E

40|$|SPIN 90 /WISH (SH 3 protein {{interacting}} with Nck, 90 kDa/Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) interacting SH 3 protein) regulates actin polymerization through its interaction with various actin-regulating proteins. It is highly {{expressed in the}} brain, but {{its role in the}} nervous system is largely unknown. We report that it is expressed in dendritic spines where it associates with PSD- 95. Its overexpression increased the number and length of dendritic filopodia/spines via an N-WASP-independent mechanism, and <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> of its expression with small interfering RNA reduced dendritic spine density. The increase in spinogenesis is accompanied by an increase in synaptogenesis in contacting presynaptic neurons. Interestingly, PSD- 95 -induced dendritic spinogenesis was <b>completely</b> abolished by <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> of SPIN 90 /WISH. Finally, in response to chemically induced long-term potentiation, SPIN 90 /WISH associated with PSD- 95 and was redistributed to dendritic spines. Our results suggest that SPIN 90 /WISH associates with PSD- 95, and so becomes localized to dendritic spines where it modulates actin dynamics to control dendritic spinogenesis. They also raise the possibility that SPIN 90 /WISH is a downstream effector of PSD- 95 -dependent synaptic remodeling...|$|R

40|$|Chromophore-assisted laser {{inactivation}} (CALI) is a light-mediated {{technique that}} offers precise spatiotemporal control of protein inactivation, enabling {{better understanding of}} the protein's role in cell function. EGFP has been used effectively as a CALI chromophore, and its cotranslational attachment to the target protein avoids having to use exogenously added labeling reagents. A potential drawback to EGFP-CALI is that the CALI phenotype can be obscured by the endogenous, unlabeled protein that is not susceptible to light inactivation. Performing EGFP-CALI experiments in deficient cells rescued with functional EGFP-fusion proteins permits more complete loss of function to be achieved. Here, we present a modified lentiviral system for rapid and efficient generation of knockdown cell lines complemented with physiological levels of EGFP-fusion proteins. We demonstrate that CALI of EGFP-CapZβ increases uncapped actin filaments, resulting in enhanced filament growth and the formation of numerous protrusive structures. We show that these effects are <b>completely</b> dependent upon <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> the endogenous protein. We also demonstrate that CALI of EGFP-Mena in Mena/VASP-deficient cells stabilizes lamellipodial protrusions...|$|R

50|$|The {{rules of}} this game are {{slightly}} more complicated than the European version. Each bowler will roll the ball twice in each frame regardless {{of the number of}} pins <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> on each roll. When a bowler’s turn is completed, the next bowler will not receive a “Full House” to bowl at: rather, the next bowler must attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the pins that were left by the previous bowler. For example, if the first bowler is only able to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> seven pins, the second bowler must attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the remaining two pins. Should the second bowler be unsuccessful in <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> both of these pins in the allotted two rolls, the third bowler will attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the remaining pins.

40|$|Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) {{regulate}} {{virtually all}} biological processes. PTKs phosphorylate substrates in a sequence-specific manner and relatively short peptide sequences determine selectivity. Here, we developed {{new technology to}} determine PTK activity profiles using peptide arrays. The zebrafish is an excellent model system to investigate signaling in the whole organism, given its wealth of genetic tools, including morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> technology. We used zebrafish embryo lysates to determine PTK activity profiles, thus providing the unique opportunity to directly compare the effect of protein <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> on PTK activity profiles {{on the one hand}} and phenotypic changes on the other. Methodology. We used multiplex arrays of 144 distinct peptides, spotted on a porous substrate, allowing the sample to be pumped up and down, optimizing reaction kinetics. Kinase reactions were performed using complex zebrafish embryo lysates or purified kinases. Peptide phosphorylation was detected by fluorescent anti-phosphotyrosine antibody binding and the porous chips allowed semi-continuous recording of the signal. We used morpholinos to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> protein expression in the zebrafish embryos and subsequently, we determined the effects on the PTK activity profiles. Results and Conclusion. Reproducible PTK activity profiles were derived from one-day-old zebrafiish embryos. Morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> of the Src family kinases, Fyn and Yes, induced characteristic phenotypes and distinct changes in the PTK activity profiles. Interestingly, the peptide substrates that were less phosphorylated upon Fyn and Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> were preferential substrates of purified Fyn and Yes. Previously, we demonstrated that Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> phenocopied Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> Interestingly, Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> induced similar changes in the PTK activity profile as Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> The control Nacre/Mitfa <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> did not affect the PTK activity profile significantly. Our results indicate that the novel peptide chip technology can be used to unravel kinase signaling pathways in vivo...|$|R
