40|$|Understanding the {{likelihood}} {{and extent of}} introgression of novel alleles in hybrid zones requires comparison of lifetime fitness of parents and hybrid progeny. However, fitness differences among <b>cross</b> <b>types</b> can vary depending on biotic conditions, thereby influencing introgression patterns. Based on past work, we predicted that increased competition would enhance introgression between cultivated and wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus) by reducing fitness advantages of wild plants. To test this prediction, we established a factorial field experiment in Kansas, USA where we monitored the fitness of four <b>cross</b> <b>types</b> (Wild, F 1, F 2, and BCw hybrids) under different levels of interspecific and intraspecific competition. Intraspecific manipulations consisted both of density of competitors and of frequency of crop-wild hybrids. We recorded emergence of overwintered seeds, survival to reproduction, and numbers of seeds produced per reproductive plant. We also calculated two compound fitness measures: seeds produced per emerged seedling and seeds produced per planted seed. <b>Cross</b> <b>type</b> and intraspecific competition affected emergence and survival to reproduction, respectively. Further, <b>cross</b> <b>type</b> interacted with competitive treatments to influence all other fitness traits. More intense competition treatments, especially related to density of intraspecific competitors, repeatedly reduced the fitness advantage of wild plants when considering seeds produced per reproductive plant and per emerged seedling, and F 2 plants often became indistinguishable from the wilds. Wild fitness remained superior when seedling emergence was also considered as par...|$|R
40|$|International audienceReproductive {{incompatibilities}} called cytoplasmic incompatibilities {{are known}} to affect {{a large number of}} arthropod species and are mediated by Wolbachia, a maternally transmitted microorganism. The crossing relationships between strains of potential hosts define their compatibility types and it is generally assumed that differences between strains of Wolbachia induce different <b>crossing</b> <b>types.</b> Among all the described host species, the mosquito, Culex pipiens, displays the greatest variability of cytoplasmic incompatibility <b>crossing</b> <b>types.</b> We analysed mitochondrial bacterial DNA variability in Culex pipiens in order to investigate some possible causes of incompatibility <b>crossing</b> <b>type</b> variability. We sequenced fragments of the ftsZ gene, and the A + T-rich control region of the mtDNA. We also sequenced the second subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COII) gene, in Culex pipiens and a closely related species, C. torrentium, in order to verify the usefulness of the A + T-rich region for the present purposes. No variability was found in the Wolbachia ftsZ gene fragment, and very limited variation of the mitochondrial marker whatever the compatibility type or the origin of the host. A low variability was found in the A + T-rich region and comparison of divergence of the A + T-rich region and COII gene between C. pipiens and C. torrentium did not reveal any special constraints affecting this region. In contrast to observations in other host species, variability of incompatibility <b>crossing</b> <b>types</b> is not due to multiple infections by distantly related Wolbachia strains...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that nonhuman {{primates}} differ from most nonprimate mammals in the predominant use of the forward <b>cross</b> <b>type</b> locomotion, {{as opposed to the}} backward <b>cross</b> <b>type,</b> while walking. In this study, we investigated the development of the sequence of movenent of the four limbs, {{both on and off the}} ground, and the effect of weight load on it. We also tried to account for the sequence of movenent of the four limbs in human quadrupedal walking. Through the comparative study of animal and human quadrupedal walking, we clarified the functions of fore and hind limbs during quadrupedal walking, and the evolution of locomotion. The subjects were 15 infants under one year old, 90 children aged from 1 to 5 years, and 20 adults. We observed two kinds of quadrupedal locomotion: "creeping on hands and knees" and "walking on hands and feet". The children over 3 years of age and the adults were requested to perform these two kinds of locomotion on a downward slope (15 °), which would necessitate the support of the body by the forelimbs more than on level ground. Body weight was measured on each of the fore and hind limbs while th e subjects assumed various postures. Cinematograms were recorded on VTR. The sequence of movement of the four limbs was determined after repeated viewings of the VTR. We found that on a flat surface the bb-pattern (the backward <b>cross</b> <b>type</b> of limb movement that takes place both on and off the ground) was obvious in the creeping of infants and in the walking of subjects of all ages. The fb-pattern (the sequence of limb movement characterized by the forward <b>cross</b> <b>type</b> of locomotion off the ground and the backward <b>cross</b> <b>type</b> on the ground) was also observed in the creeping of children and adults. In walking, the body weight fell more heavily on the forelimbs than on the hindlimbs in static standing posture, especially in the creeping of children and adults. On the slope, twice as many children showed the bb-pattern while creeping than displayed it on the level ground. From these results, the following can be concluded concerning the movement of the four limbs in human beings. Humans, by nature, possess the motor program for the backward <b>cross</b> <b>type</b> of locomotion. In the pre-bipedal period, fore and hind limbs seem to have the same function. However, after humans master bipedal walking, the function of limbs in creeping may differenti ate: forelimbs function to orient, and hindlimbs are for propulsion. However, this functional division between the fore and hind limbs is not apparent in those subjects walking on hands and feet after the achievement of bipedal walking. There may be an evolutionary continuum between walking on hands and feet in human beings and the quadrupedal walking of nonprimate mammals...|$|R

We investigated early fitness consequences of intraspecific exotic gene flow in the wild by assessing differences in survival among native, non-local, and F 1 intraspecific hybrid seedlings naturally established within two native pine relicts (one of Pinus pinaster and the other of P. sylvestris) surrounded by non-local plantations. We obtained broad-scale temporally sequential genotypic samples of a cohort of recruits in each pine relict, from seeds before dispersal to established seedlings months after emergence, tracking temporal changes in the estimated proportion of each parental <b>cross</b> <b>type.</b> Results show significant proportions of exotic male gametes before seed dispersal in the two pine relicts. Subsequently to seedling establishment, the frequency of exotic male gametes became non-significant in P. pinaster, and dropped by half in P. sylvestris.

Seedling mortality resulted in small late sample sizes, and temporal differences in exotic gene flow estimates were not significant, so we could not reject the null hypothesis of invariant early viability across parental <b>cross</b> <b>types</b> in the wild...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} {{of elderly people}} is rapidly growing {{and in terms of}} safety, senior pedestrians represent one of the most vulnerable group. The pedestrian crossing speed is a significant input parameter in traffic engineering, which can have effect on pedestrians’ safety, especially of older population.
