25|$|The {{displacer}} is a special-purpose piston, used in Beta and Gamma type Stirling engines, to {{move the}} working gas {{back and forth between}} the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers. Depending on the type of engine design, the displacer may or may not be sealed to the cylinder, i.e. it may be a loose fit within the cylinder, allowing the working gas to pass around it as it moves to occupy the part of the cylinder beyond.|$|E
25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E
25|$|Stirling engines, {{especially}} those that run on small temperature differentials, are quite large {{for the amount of}} power that they produce (i.e., they have low specific power). This is primarily due to the heat transfer coefficient of gaseous convection, which limits the heat flux that can be attained in a typical <b>cold</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger to about 500W/(m2·K), and in a hot heat exchanger to about 500–5000W/(m2·K). Compared with internal combustion engines, this makes it more challenging for the engine designer to transfer heat {{into and out of the}} working gas. Because of the thermal efficiency the required heat transfer grows with lower temperature difference, and the heat exchanger surface (and cost) for 1kW output grows with (1/ΔT)2. Therefore, the specific cost of very low temperature difference engines is very high. Increasing the temperature differential and/or pressure allows Stirling engines to produce more power, assuming the heat exchangers are designed for the increased heat load, and can deliver the convected heat flux necessary.|$|E
50|$|Using the entropy form of {{thinking}} {{from the previous}} subsection, an object which is considered hot (whose entropy is large) can transfer heat (and entropy) to a <b>colder</b> <b>heat</b> bath, thus lowering its own entropy. This process results in cooling.|$|R
5|$|Electricity power {{stations}} are often {{located on the}} coast or beside an estuary so that the sea {{can be used as}} a <b>heat</b> sink. A <b>colder</b> <b>heat</b> sink enables more efficient power generation, which is important for expensive nuclear power plants in particular.|$|R

After repeated topical application of capsaicin, {{the skin was}} tested for whealing with <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> stimuli. Capsaicin pretreatment prevented the urticarial responses for 4 - 7 days.

2500|$|Since the Stirling {{engine is}} a closed cycle, it {{contains}} a fixed mass of gas called the [...] "working fluid", most commonly air, hydrogen or helium. In normal operation the engine is sealed and no gas enters or leaves the engine. No valves are required, unlike other types of piston engines. The Stirling engine, like most heat engines, cycles through four main processes: cooling, compression, heating and expansion. This is accomplished by moving the gas {{back and forth between}} hot and <b>cold</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers, often with a regenerator between the heater and cooler. The hot heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat source, such as a fuel burner, and the <b>cold</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat sink, such as air fins. A change in gas temperature causes a corresponding change in gas pressure, while the motion of the piston causes the gas to be alternately expanded and compressed.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{essential}} that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature, when compressed, to release heat through the [...] "hot" [...] heat exchanger (the condenser). Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the <b>cold</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger (the evaporator). In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the required pressure difference, and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid. Thus, as with all heat pumps, the coefficient of performance (amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.|$|E

60|$|Each {{succeeding}} day {{and night}} Cameron felt himself more and more drawn to this strange man. He found that after hours of burning toil he had insensibly grown nearer to his comrade. He reflected that {{after a few weeks}} in the desert he had always become a different man. In civilization, in the rough mining camps, he had been a prey to unrest and gloom. But once down on the great billowing sweep of this lonely world, he could look into his unquiet soul without bitterness. Did not the desert magnify men? Cameron believed that wild men in wild places, fighting <b>cold,</b> <b>heat,</b> starvation, thirst, barrenness, facing the elements in all their ferocity, usually retrograded, descended to the savage, lost all heart and soul and became mere brutes. Likewise he believed that men wandering or lost in the wilderness often reversed that brutal order of life and became noble, wonderful, super-human. So now he did not marvel at a slow stir stealing warmer along his veins, and at the premonition that perhaps he and this man, alone on the desert, driven there by life's mysterious and remorseless motive, were to see each other through God's eyes.|$|E

60|$|As regards Redclyffe being {{precisely}} like an Englishman, {{we cannot}} but {{think that the}} good Warden was mistaken. No doubt, there was a common ground; the old progenitor (whose blood, moreover, was mixed with a hundred other streams equally English) was still there, under this young man's shape, but with a vast difference. Climate, sun, <b>cold,</b> <b>heat,</b> soil, institutions, had made a change in him before he was born, and all the life that he had lived since (so unlike any {{that he could have}} lived in England) had developed it more strikingly. In manners, I cannot but think that he was better than the generality of Englishmen, and different from the highest-mannered men, though most resembling them. His natural sensitiveness, a tincture of reserve, had been counteracted by the frank mixture with men which his political course had made necessary; he was quicker to feel what was right at the moment, than the Englishman; more alive; he had a finer grain; his look was more aristocratic than that of a thousand Englishmen of good birth and breeding; he had a faculty of assimilating himself to new manners, which, being his most un-English trait, was what perhaps chiefly made the Warden think him so like an Englishman. When an Englishman is a gentleman, to be sure, it is as deep in him as the marrow of his bones, and the deeper you know him, the more you are aware of it, and that generation after generation has contributed to develop and perfect these unpretending manners, which, at first, may have failed to impress you, under his plain, almost homely exterior. An American often gets as good a surface of manners, in his own progress from youth, through the wear and attrition of a successful life, to some high station in middle age; whereas a plebeian Englishman, who rises to eminent station, never does credit to it by his manners. Often you would not know the American ambassador from a duke. This is often merely external; but in Redclyffe, having delicate original traits in his character, it was something more; and, we are bold to say, when our countrymen are developed, or any one class of them, as they ought to be, they will show finer traits than have yet been seen. We have more delicate and quicker sensibilities; nerves more easily impressed; and these are surely requisites for perfect manners; and, moreover, the courtesy that proceeds on the ground of perfect equality is better than that which is a gracious and benignant condescension,--as is the case with the manners of the aristocracy of England.|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} Korean Medicine doctors consider <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> pattern identification when prescribing herbal treatment for a disease. Methods: A survey was sent by e-mail to 15, 841 members of the Association of Korean Medicine for whom member information was registered. Of these, 699 (4. 4 %) members participated in the survey. The survey included questions regarding the frequency of use of <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> pattern identification in deciding a herbal treatment prescription, the diseases for which <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> pattern identification-related herbal treatment was most efficacious, the type of herbal treatment prescribed, and the duration of the treatment. Results: Of the 699 respondents, 591 (84. 5 %) reported that they considered <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> when prescribing herbal treatment. The diseases for which consideration of <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> patterns was effective were, in order, menopausal disorder (124, 18. 3 %), chronic rhinitis (98, 14. 5 %), dyspepsia (94, 13. 9 %), hwa-byung (92, 13. 6 %), diarrhea (83, 12. 3 %), dysmenorrhea (61, 9. 0 %), headache (59, 8. 7 %), inflammation in the digestive tract (58, 8. 6 %), coldness in hands and feet (58, 8. 6 %), and atopic dermatitis (55, 8. 1 %). The typical treatment duration differed widely for different diseases: atopic dermatitis was most frequently treated for > 2 months (38, 34. 5 %), whereas diarrhea was most frequently treated for ≤ 10 days (73, 43. 6 %). Conclusion: These findings indicate that <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> pattern identification is a useful tool employed by Korean Medicine doctors. This study may provide a basis for clinical research investigating the effect of pattern identification-based treatment of diseases...|$|R

40|$|Extreme <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> waves, characterised by {{a number}} of cold or hot days in succession, place a strain on people’s {{cardiovascular}} and respiratory systems. The increase in deaths due to these waves may be greater than that predicted by extreme temperatures alone. We examined <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> waves in 99 US cities for 14 years (1987 – 2000) and investigated how the risk of death depended on the temperature threshold used to define a wave, and a wave’s timing, duration and intensity. We defined <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> waves using temperatures above and below <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> thresholds for two or more days. We tried five cold thresholds using the first to fifth percentiles of temperature, and five heat thresholds using the ninety-fifth to ninety-ninth percentiles. The extra wave effects were estimated using a two-stage model to ensure that their effects were estimated after removing the general effects of temperature. The increases in deaths associated with cold waves were generally small and not statistically significant, and there was even evidence of a decreased risk during the <b>coldest</b> waves. <b>Heat</b> waves generally increased the risk of death, particularly for the hottest <b>heat</b> threshold. <b>Cold</b> waves of a colder intensity or longer duration were not more dangerous. Cold waves earlier in the cool season were more dangerous, as were heat waves earlier in the warm season. In general there was no increased risk of death during cold waves above the known increased risk associated with cold temperatures. <b>Cold</b> or <b>heat</b> waves earlier in the cool or warm season may be more dangerous because of a build up in the susceptible pool or a lack of preparedness for cold or hot temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{classification}} {{is a key}} {{approach in}} Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and {{it is used to}} classify the patients for intervention selection accordingly. TCM <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> patterns, two main patterns of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had been explored with systems biology approaches. Different regulations of apoptosis were found to be involved in <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> classification in our previous works. For this study, the metabolic profiling of plasma was explored in RA patients with typical TCM <b>cold</b> or <b>heat</b> patterns by integrating liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) platforms in conjunction with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Three main processes of metabolism, including amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid were focused on for function analysis. The results showed that 29 and 19 differential metabolites were found in <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> patterns respectively, compared with healthy controls. The perturbation of amino acid metabolism (increased essential amino acids), carbohydrate metabolism (galactose metabolism) and lipid metabolism, were found to be involved in both <b>cold</b> and <b>heat</b> pattern RA. In particular, more metabolic perturbations in protein and collagen breakdown, decreased glycolytic activity and aerobic oxidation, and increased energy utilization associated with RA cold pattern patients. These findings may be useful for obtaining a better understanding of RA pathogenesis and for achieving a better efficacy in RA clinical practice...|$|R
