50|$|The {{ring was}} a {{descendant}} of the Arkwright water frame of 1769 and creates yarn in a continuous process. The yarn is coarser, has a greater twist, and is stronger, making it more suitable for warp. Ring spinning is slow due to the distance the thread must pass around the ring. Similar methods have improved on this including flyer and bobbin and <b>cap</b> <b>spinning.</b>|$|E

Cornelia paused to admire the clean court and the small caged birds sleeping on their perches, the boxes of veronica in bloom, of oleander, and of tamarisk, which freshened the air of the court and lent a romance to the lamplight, the cooks in their paper caps and white blouses appearing at odd moments from an Avernus behind; while the prompt 'v'la!' of teetotums in mob <b>caps,</b> <b>spinning</b> down the staircase in answer to the periodic clang of bells, filled her with wonder, and pricked her conscience with thoughts of how seldom such transcendent nimbleness was attempted by herself in a part so nearly similar.|$|R
30|$|A 300  MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer, {{equipped}} with a 4  mm wide-bore MAS probe, was used to run solid-state spectra of humic samples. Each fine-powdered sample (5  mg) was packed into a 4  mm zirconium rotor, stoppered by a Kel-F <b>cap</b> and <b>spun</b> {{at a rate of}} 13, 000 [*]±[*] 1  Hz. In particular, 13 C NMR spectra were acquired through the cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CPMAS) technique, by using 2  s of recycle delay, 1  ms of contact time, 30  ms of acquisition time and 4000 scans.|$|R
40|$|Precessional {{dynamics}} are exploited in {{the operation}} of high frequency magnetic devices such as magnetic disk drives, non reciprocal microwave devices and spin transfer oscillators. The trajectory of the precession and its damping are of crucial importance. This thesis presents the characterisation of a variety of magnetic thin film structures performed with a range of phase sensitive techniques. It is possible to obtain new insight by utilising the chemical and site specificity of X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) to isolate the precession in different chemical species or at distinct sites in the crystal structure of a chosen material. X-ray Ferromagnetic Resonance (XFMR) combines XMCD and Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) phenomena in a technique capable of measuring the FMR response of an alloy or multilayer with both chemical and site specificity. To complement the XFMR technique a low temperature Time-Resolved Magneto Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE) setup has been developed. This allowed for the characterisation of samples at temperatures in the range 4 K to room temperature. A frequency swept Vector Network Analyser FMR (VNA-FMR) setup was developed to allow for a fast method for determining the resonance condition and damping of a range of ferromagnetic thin film samples. In addition a TR-X-ray Photoemission Electron Microscopy (TR-XPEEM) setup has been established which allows images to be obtained with magnetic contrast. The combination of the above techniques has lead to studies on rare earth <b>capped</b> <b>spin</b> valve free layers and the measurement of spin pumping in industrially relevant spin valves.

40|$|A {{formalism}} {{is presented}} for radiation transfer in two normal polarization modes in finite and semiinfinite plane parallel uniform atmospheres with {{a magnetic field}} perpendicular {{to the surface and}} arbitrary propagation angles. This method is based on the coupled integral equations of transfer, including emission, absorption, and scattering. Calculations are performed for atmosphere parameters typical of X-ray pulsars. The directionality of the escaping radiation is investigated for several cases, varying the input distributions. Theoretical pencil beam profiles and X-ray pulse shapes are obtained assuming the radiation is emitted from the polar <b>caps</b> of <b>spinning</b> neutron stars. Implications for realistic models of accreting magnetized X-ray sources are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{geometry of the}} Kerr ergosurface on constant Boyer-Lindquist (BL), Kerr, and Doran time slices is characterized. Unlike the BL slice, which had been previously studied, the other slices (i) do not have conical singularities at the poles (except the Doran slice in the extremal limit), (ii) have finite polar circumference in the extremal limit, and (iii) for sufficiently large spin parameter fail to be isometrically embeddable as a surface of revolution above some latitude. The Doran slice develops an embeddable polar <b>cap</b> for <b>spin</b> parameters greater than about 0. 96.

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of automatic machinery, there was little difficulty in attaining a straight fibre, as long wool was always used, and the sliver was made up by hand, using combs. The introduction of Richard Arkwright's water frame in 1771, and the later introduction of <b>cap</b> and mule <b>spinning</b> machines, required perfectly prepared slivers. Many manufactories used one or more preparatory combing machines (called gill-boxes) before worsting, to ensure straight fibres and to distribute the lubricant evenly.|$|R

A 36,000-volt ignition coil, usually located at the front right of the engine, provided electrical power to the center of the distributor <b>cap,</b> where a <b>spinning</b> rotor directed the power to each of the individual cylinders' spark plug wires.

40|$|Spin-flip {{mechanism}} in Ag nanowires with MgO surface protection layers {{has been investigated}} by means of nonlocal spin valve measurements using Permalloy/Ag lateral spin valves. The spin flip events mediated by surface scattering are effectively suppressed by the MgO <b>capping</b> layer. The <b>spin</b> relaxation process {{was found to be}} well described in the framework of Elliott-Yafet mechanism and then the probabilities of spin-filp scattering for phonon or impurity mediated momentum scattering is precisely determined in the nanowires. The temperature dependent spin-lattice relaxation follows the Bloch-Grüneisen theory and falls on to a universal curve for the monovalent metals as in the Monod and Beuneu scaling determined from the conduction electron spin resonance data for bulk.

30|$|Molecular {{distribution}} of compost organic carbon was evaluated by 13 C-CPMAS-NMR spectroscopy. The 13 C-CPMAS-NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AVANCE™ 300 (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany), {{equipped with a}} 4 -mm wide bore MAS probe, operating at a 13 C resonating frequency of 75.475  MHz. Compost samples (100 to 150  mg) were packed in 4 -mm zirconia rotors with Kel-F <b>caps</b> and <b>spun</b> at 13 [*]±[*] 1  kHz. To account for possible inhomogeneity of the Hartmann-Hahn condition at high rotor spin rates, a 1 H ramp sequence was applied in CP experiments during a contact time (CT) of 1  ms. The 13 C-CPMAS experiments implied a collection of 6, 000 scans with 2, 266 data points over an acquisition time of 25  ms and a recycle delay of 2.0  s. The Bruker Topspin 1.3 software was used to collect and process the NMR spectra. All free induction decays (FIDs) were transformed by applying a 4  k zero filling and a line broadening of 100  Hz. The areas for different 13 C resonances were assigned according to previous reports [4, 28, 43] into six integrating regions as follows: 0 to 45  ppm (alkyl C), 46 to 60  ppm (methoxyl C), 61 to 110  ppm (O-alkyl C), 111 to 145  ppm (aromatic C or aryl C), 146 to 165  ppm (phenolic C or O-aryl C) and 166 to 195  ppm (carboxylic C). The area of each spectral region was divided by {{the sum of all}} spectral areas in order to obtain a relative percentage.|$|R
30|$|By doping foreign {{elements}} such as nitrogen and boron into the graphite lattices of CNM, Wang et al. [42], Ayala et al. [43], and Koós et al. [44] induced crystal and electronic changes to the structures of CNM [42 – 44]. It is noted that as support for palladium nanoparticles, helical CNM show excellent properties in electro-catalytic applications [45, 46]. According to Franceschini et al. [47] and Mandumpal et al. [48], the introduction of nitrogen restrains the aggregation of vacancies, resulting in defects and dislocations, as well as amplified curvature of graphite planes. The results of both experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that compared to pure CNT, nitrogen-doped CNT show enhanced field emission properties {{and there is a}} shift of the dominant emission towards lower energies [49 – 51]. Through theoretical studies of heteroatom-substituted graphite systems, Hagiri et al. suggested that different heteroatom arrangements cause different spin-stable singlet and triplet states and that the substituted nitrogen atom as a <b>spin</b> <b>cap</b> induces the π electron excess [52]. When it comes to CNT utilization, high incorporation of nitrogen is desirable in promoting porosity and electrochemical reactivity of CNT. On the other hand, if CNT are supposed to be applied in semiconductor technology, low nitrogen-doping density is necessary.|$|R
40|$|When a star is tidally {{disrupted}} by a supermassive black hole (BH), {{roughly half of}} its mass falls back to the BH at super-Eddington rates. Being tenuously gravitationally bound and unable to cool radiatively, {{only a small fraction}} f_in few 1 e 4 K, converting the emission to optical/near-UV wavelengths where photons more readily escape due to the lower opacity. This can explain the unexpectedly low and temporally constant effective temperatures of optically-discovered TDE flares. For BHs with relatively high masses M_BH > 1 e 7 M_sun the ejecta can become ionized at an earlier stage, or for a wider range of viewing angles, producing a TDE flare which is instead dominated by thermal X-ray emission. We predict total radiated energies consistent with those of observed TDE flares, and ejecta velocities that agree with the measured emission line widths. The peak optical luminosity for M_BH < 1 e 6 M_sun is suppressed due to adiabatic losses in the inner disk wind, possibly contributing to the unexpected dearth of optical TDEs in galaxies with low mass BHs. In the classical picture, where f_in ~ 1, TDEs de-spin supermassive BHs and <b>cap</b> their maximum <b>spins</b> well below theoretical accretion physics limits.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the dependence of}} the seed [Ta/Pt, Ta/Au] and capping [Pt/Ta, Au/Ta] layers on spin pumping effect in the ferromagnetic 3 nm thick Co thin film using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The data is fitted with Kittel equation to evaluate damping constant and g-factor. A strong dependence of seed and <b>capping</b> layers on <b>spin</b> pumping has been discussed. The value of damping constant {alpha} {{is found to be}} relatively large i. e. 0. 0326 for the Ta{ 3 }/Pt{ 3 }/Co{ 3 }/Pt{ 3 }/Ta{ 3 } {nm} multi-layer structure, while it is 0. 0104 for Ta{ 3 }/Co{ 3 }/Ta{ 3 } {nm}. Increase in {alpha} is observed due to Pt layer that works as a good sink for spins due to high spin orbit coupling. In addition, we measured the effective spin conductance = 2. 0 e 18 m- 2 for the trilayer structure Pt{ 3 }/Co{ 3 }/Pt{ 3 } {nm} {{as a result of the}} enhancement in {alpha} relative to its bulk value. We observed that the evaluated g-factor decreases as effective demagnetizing magnetic field increases in all the studied samples. The azimuthal dependence of magnetic resonance field and line width showed relatively high anisotropy in the trilayer Ta{ 3 }/Co{ 3 }/Ta{ 3 } {nm} structure. Comment: 16 pages, four figure...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{point contact}} {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to study the spin-dependent properties of rare earth-transition metal compounds and transition metal thin films and bi-layers. The transport spin polarisation of Cu, Co and Fe has been measured using point contact Andreev reflection (PCAR), and found to be in good agreement with previous results. In addition, bi-layers of Co/Y and Co/Cu {{have been used to}} demonstrate suppression of the spin polarisation of the Co underlayer via a nonmagnetic <b>capping</b> layer. The <b>spin</b> diffusion length of Cu has been estimated to be larger than 600 nm. The spin polarisation of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) deposited RFe 2 (R = Dy,Y,Er) Laves phase intermetallic films was determined, and found to be close to that of Fe. This suggests that the spin transport behaviour in these materials is dominated by the Fe sub-lattice. Preliminary evidence for spin transfer torque effects in an RFe 2 multilayer and tri-layer is also presented and discussed. Point contact measurements of an ErFe 2 /YFe 2 multilayer at 4. 2 K show a step in the differential resistance at a positive current value. It is suggested that {{this is due to the}} formation of a nano-domain beneath the tip. Measurements of a DyFe 2 /YFe 2 /DyFe 2 tri-layer show peaks in differential resistance for negative applied currents. This is tentatively attributed to the generation of spin waves within the YFe 2 layer. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The interface of Fe/GaAs {{system and its}} influence on the static magnetic properties in magnetic ultrathin films were studied by means of FMR and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Studies were performed on high quality single crystalline magnetic films. It will be shown that in ultrathin magnetic films magnetic properties are governed {{by a combination of}} interface and bulk effects. Static and dynamic magnetic properties of magnetic single and double layers were studied using Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) and Time Resolved Magneto-optic Kerr Effect (TRMOKE) {{in a wide range of}} microwave frequencies. Magnetic damping was studied in Au/Fe/GaAs structures as a function of the thickness of magnetic Fe layer and as a function of the <b>capping</b> Au layer. <b>Spin</b> currents generated by spin pump/spin sink effect structures were extensively investigated in magnetic doublelayer. Pure spin current driven dynamics in magnetic doublelayers was observed using TRMOKE technique. The spin diffusion and spin accumulation analysis was applied to explain spin momentum propagation in the normal metal. Spin diffusion length in Au was measured via direct observation of magnetic moment transfer. Spin pump/spin sink theory was tested for antiparallel driving of two magnetic layers of the magnetic doublelayer structure. This extreme condition was achieved via patterning sample into a coplanar waveguide. Results are in good agreement with simulations based on theory, which includes spin pump/spin sink model together with diffusive transport of accumulated spin momentum through the non-magnetic layer. Au/Fe/Au/Fe/GaAs magnetic double layer structure was used to study spin pump/spin sink effect in case of non-collinear orientation of magnetic moments.

30|$|Total {{organic carbon}} (OC), {{nitrogen}} (TN), and hydrogen (H) contents {{were determined by}} dry combustion using an automatic CHN analyzer (Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA). The oxygen (O) content was obtained by difference after deducting the ash content (2.1 %). The C functionality distributions of the humic acid samples were determined by solid-state CP-MAS 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. The spectra were acquired with an Avance 500  MHz (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) spectrometer equipped with a 4 -mm-wide bore MAS probe and operating at 13 C and 1 H frequencies of 125  MHz and 500  MHz, respectively. The samples (100 to 200  mg) were packed in 4 -mm zirconia rotors with Kel-F <b>caps,</b> which were <b>spun</b> at 13 [*]±[*] 1  kHz. The spectra were acquired by the ramped CP-MAS method, with linear amplitude variation of the 1 H pulse. The experiments were carried out using a cross-polarization time of 1.0  ms, an acquisition time of 25  ms, a cycle delay of 2  s and a high-power two-pulse phase modulation (TPPM) proton decoupling of 70 KHz. The Bruker Topspin 1.3 software (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to collect and process the spectra. All the free induction decays (FIDs) were transformed by applying a 4  k zero filling and a line broadening of 75  Hz. The spectra were normalized by area and integrated in the following 13 C chemical shift intervals: 190 to 160  ppm (carbonyls of ketones, quinones, aldehydes, and carboxyls), 160 to 140  ppm (phenols and O-substituted aromatic C), 140 to 110  ppm (unsubstituted aromatic C and olefinic C), 110 to 95  ppm (anomeric C), 95 to 65  ppm (O-alkyl systems), 65 to 45  ppm (methoxy substituent; N-alkyl groups), and 45 to 0  ppm (alkyl C, mainly CH 2 and CH 3). The relative areas of the alkyl (45 to 0  ppm) and aromatic (160 to 110  ppm) components were summed to represent the proportion of hydrophobic C in the humic samples (degree of hydrophobicity, HB). Similarly, the summation of the relative areas in intervals related to polar groups (190 to 160  ppm and 110 to 45  ppm) indicates the degree of C hydrophilicity (HI); the HB/HI ratio was then calculated.|$|R
