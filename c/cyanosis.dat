5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as <b>cyanosis</b> of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|In large doses, {{silver and}} {{compounds}} containing {{it can be}} absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to argyria, which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a person's health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for <b>cyanosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, <b>cyanosis,</b> and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} used system for classifying the severity of croup is the Westley score. It is primarily used for research purposes rather than in clinical practice. It {{is the sum of}} points assigned for five factors: level of consciousness, <b>cyanosis,</b> stridor, air entry, and retractions. The points given for each factor is listed in the adjacent table, and the final score ranges from 0 to 17.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritation—though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and <b>cyanosis.</b> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as <b>cyanosis</b> (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be <b>cyanosis</b> (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E
25|$|When {{the oxygen}} supply is depleted, the skin color turns blue (called <b>cyanosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Bluish or purple {{fingernail}} beds may be {{a symptom}} of peripheral <b>cyanosis,</b> which indicates oxygen deprivation.|$|E
25|$|Trinitroaniline is dangerously explosive. Symptoms of {{exposure}} to this compound may include skin and eye irritation, headache, drowsiness, weakness, <b>cyanosis,</b> and respiratory distress.|$|E
25|$|The troops worst {{affected}} had intense <b>cyanosis</b> and frothy exudation {{from the}} mouth and nose; some of the severe casualties who reached casualty clearing stations, had a pallor and collapse associated with phosgene poisoning. In a few cases <b>cyanosis</b> gave place to pallor before the victim died. The troops who died rapidly in the front line, about ninety minutes after {{the beginning of the}} attack, showed deep <b>cyanosis</b> and copious frothing, with paroxysmal coughing prominent in the early stages. The clinical evidence suggested that the gas cloud contained a low proportion of phosgene to chlorine. About twenty civilians were affected by the gas, though none severely, as they had been instructed in gas precautions and had been issued with respirators. The civilians had also protected themselves by closing windows and doors and by filling cracks with wet cloths; many also wore anti-gas helmets indoors.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin level above 10%) include shortness of breath, <b>cyanosis,</b> mental status changes (~50%), headache, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness and loss of hairlines.|$|E
25|$|Silicosis (particularly {{the acute}} form) is {{characterized}} by shortness of breath, cough, fever, and <b>cyanosis</b> (bluish skin). It may often be misdiagnosed as pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pneumonia, or tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conscious}} patient, {{other signs of}} airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and <b>cyanosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary hypertension* is high {{pressure}} in the pulmonary artery. In dogs it {{can be caused by}} heartworm disease, pulmonary thromboembolism, or chronic hypoxemia (low oxygen). It can result in right-sided heart disease (cor pulmonale). Signs include difficulty breathing, <b>cyanosis,</b> and exercise intolerance.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{approach}} to evaluation begins by {{assessment of the}} airway, breathing, and circulation followed by a medical history and physical examination. Signs that represent significant severity include hypotension, hypoxemia, tracheal deviation, altered mental status, unstable dysrhythmia, stridor, intercostal indrawing, <b>cyanosis,</b> tripod positioning, pronounced use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes) and absent breath sounds.|$|E
25|$|Tetralogy of Fallot* is a {{congenital}} heart {{defect in}} dogs that includes four separate defects: pulmonic stenosis, a ventricular septal defect, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. Keeshonds and Bulldogs are predisposed. Signs include <b>cyanosis</b> and exercise intolerance. Polycythemia is often present and, if severe, {{needs to be}} controlled with phlebotomy or drugs to suppress red blood cell production.|$|E
25|$|Genetically induced chronic {{low-level}} methemoglobinemia may {{be treated}} with oral methylene blue daily. Also, vitamin C can occasionally reduce <b>cyanosis</b> associated with chronic methemoglobinemia but has no role in treatment of acute acquired methemoglobinemia. Diaphorase normally contributes {{only a small percentage}} of the red blood cell's reducing capacity, but can be pharmacologically activated by exogenous cofactors (such as methylene blue) to 5 times its normal level of activity.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately {{paralysis}} {{becomes so}} severe that an animal is unable to stand or even lift its head. The breathing becomes slow, exaggerated and gasping. A foul odor on the breath can signal aspiration pneumonia. Although pain is not regarded as being a feature of tick paralysis animals {{would appear to be}} in severe distress. Finally, the mucous membranes develop a bluish hue (<b>cyanosis)</b> and a state of coma indicates that death is imminent.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam {{when taken}} during late in pregnancy, the third trimester, causes a {{definite}} {{risk to the}} neonate including a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including hypotonia, and reluctance to suck, to apnoeic spells, <b>cyanosis,</b> and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth.|$|E
25|$|Deoxygenated {{hemoglobin}} is {{the form}} of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen. The absorption spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ. The oxyhemoglobin has significantly lower absorption of the 660nm wavelength than deoxyhemoglobin, while at 940nm its absorption is slightly higher. This difference {{is used for the}} measurement of the amount of oxygen in a patient's blood by an instrument called a pulse oximeter. This difference also accounts for the presentation of <b>cyanosis,</b> the blue to purplish color that tissues develop during hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|When {{journalists and}} {{physicians}} began {{focusing on the}} narcotic contents of the patent medicines, some of their makers began replacing the opium tincture laudanum with acetanilide, a particularly toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic as well as antipyretic properties that had been introduced into medical practice under the name Antifebrin by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886. But this ingredient change probably killed more of the nostrum's users than the original narcotics did, since acetanilide not only caused an alarming <b>cyanosis</b> due to methemoglobinemia but was later discovered to cause liver and kidney damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{occasional}} {{reports of}} acetanilide-induced <b>cyanosis</b> prompted {{the search for}} supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives, such as phenacetin. After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was ultimately established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (known in the United States as USAN: acetaminophen) in the human body, {{and that it was}} this metabolite that was responsible for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. Acetanilide is no longer used as a drug in its own right, although the success of its metabolite – paracetamol (acetaminophen) – is well known.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some medical}} {{evidence}} of various malformations, e.g., cardiac or facial deformations {{when used in}} early pregnancy; however, the data is not conclusive. The data are also inconclusive on whether benzodiazepines such as clonazepam cause developmental deficits or decreases in IQ in the developing fetus when taken by the mother during pregnancy. Clonazepam, when used late in pregnancy, may result {{in the development of}} a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include hypotonia, apnoeic spells, <b>cyanosis</b> and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{lipophilic}} {{and rapidly}} penetrate membranes, so rapidly penetrate the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam in late pregnancy in especially high doses {{may result in}} floppy infant syndrome. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result {{in the development of}} a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include hypotonia, and reluctance to suckle, to apnoeic spells, <b>cyanosis,</b> and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. These symptoms may persist for hours or months after birth.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines such as {{diazepam}} are lipophilic {{and rapidly}} penetrate membranes, so rapidly cross {{over into the}} placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines including diazepam in late pregnancy, especially high doses, can result in floppy infant syndrome. Diazepam when taken late in pregnancy, during the third trimester, causes a definite risk of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate with symptoms including hypotonia, and reluctance to suck, to apnoeic spells, <b>cyanosis,</b> and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of diphtheria usually begin two {{to seven days}} after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (<b>cyanosis),</b> sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making {{it very hard to}} breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|Another {{death was}} {{confirmed}} on 24 August 2009. Death toll now increased to 69. The patient, a 38-year-old teacher, {{who was also}} obese, tested positive for H1N1 by a private clinic. Tamiflu was not administered but only gave her symptomatic treatment. Five days later, on 18 August, she {{was admitted to the}} hospital after suffering from breathing difficulties and <b>cyanosis.</b> She was referred to KL Hospital and Tamiflu was administered. However, the woman died on 19 August due to pneumonia with AVDS. One more death was confirmed on 25 August 2009. Confirmed by the Mortality Review Committee, the 3-year-old boy who had febrile convulsion and cough was hospitalised on 12 August. The boy was then transferred to ICU after his condition deteriorate and tamiflu was administered. He tested positive for the flu on 17 August. However, he died on the next day due to H1N1 encephalitis with Cerebral oedema and multiorgan failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety profile}} of {{clonazepam}} during pregnancy {{is less clear}} than that of other benzodiazepines, and if benzodiazepines are indicated during pregnancy, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam may be a safer choice. The use of clonazepam during pregnancy should only occur if the clinical benefits are believed to outweigh the clinical risks to the fetus. Caution is also required if clonazepam is used during breastfeeding. Possible adverse effects of use of benzodiazepines such as clonazepam during pregnancy include: miscarriage, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, floppy infant syndrome, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines include hypertonia, hyperreflexia, restlessness, irritability, abnormal sleep patterns, inconsolable crying, tremors or jerking of the extremities, bradycardia, <b>cyanosis,</b> suckling difficulties, apnea, risk of aspiration of feeds, diarrhea and vomiting, and growth retardation. This syndrome can develop between 3 days to 3 weeks after birth and can have a duration of up to several months. The pathway by which clonazepam is metabolized is usually impaired in newborns. If clonazepam is used during pregnancy or breast feeding, {{it is recommended that}} serum levels of clonazepam are monitored and that signs of central nervous system depression and apnea are also checked for. In many cases, non-pharmacological treatments, such as relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and avoidance of caffeine, can be an effective and safer alternative to the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety in pregnant women.|$|E
500|$|The venom of this elapid, Laticauda colubrina, {{is a very}} {{powerful}} neurotoxic protein, with a subcutaneous LD50 in mice of [...] 0.45mg/kg body weight. The venom is an α-neurotoxin that disrupts synapses by competing with acetylcholine for receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, similar to erabutoxins and α-bungarotoxins. In mice, lethal venom doses caused lethargy, flaccid paralysis, and convulsions in quick succession before death. Dogs injected with lethal doses produced symptoms consistent with fatal hypertension and <b>cyanosis</b> observed in human sea snake bite victims.|$|E
500|$|Diagnosis {{is made by}} {{studying}} {{the cause of the}} injury, physical examination and chest radiography. [...] Typical signs and symptoms include direct effects of the physical trauma, such as chest pain and coughing up blood, as well as signs that the body is not receiving enough oxygen, such as <b>cyanosis.</b> [...] The contusion frequently heals on its own with supportive care. Often nothing more than supplemental oxygen and close monitoring is needed; however, intensive care may be required. For example, if breathing is severely compromised, mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Fluid replacement may be required to ensure adequate blood volume, but fluids are given carefully since fluid overload can worsen pulmonary edema, which may be lethal.|$|E
500|$|The main toxic {{substance}} {{found in the}} parotoid gland and skin of the common toad is called bufotoxin. It was first isolated by Heinrich Wieland and his colleagues in 1922 and they succeeded in identifying its structure about 20 years later. [...] Meanwhile, other workers succeeded in isolating the same compound and its parent steroid bufotalin from the Japanese toad (Bufo japonicus). By 1986, researchers at the Arizona State University had succeeded in synthesizing the toad venom constituents bufotalin, bufalitoxin and bufotoxin. The chemical formula of bufotoxin is C40H60N4O10. Its physical effects resemble those of digitalis which in small doses increases the strength with which the heart muscle contracts and which {{is used in the}} treatment of congestive heart failure. The skin of one toad contains enough toxin to cause serious symptoms or even death in animals and man. Clinical effects include severe irritation and pain to eyes, mouth, nose and throat, cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms, paralysis and seizures, increased salivation, vomiting, hyperkalemia, <b>cyanosis</b> and hallucinations. There is no known anti-venom. Treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions, prevention of absorption and electrocardiography to monitor the condition. Atropine, phenytoin, cholestyramine and lidocaine may prove useful in its management.|$|E
500|$|Presentation may be subtle; {{people with}} mild {{contusion}} {{may have no}} symptoms at all. However, pulmonary contusion is frequently associated with signs (objective indications) and symptoms (subjective states), including those indicative of the lung injury itself and [...] of accompanying injuries. [...] Because gas exchange is impaired, signs of low blood oxygen saturation, such as low concentrations of oxygen in arterial blood gas and <b>cyanosis</b> (bluish color of the skin and mucous membranes) are commonly associated. [...] Dyspnea (painful breathing or difficulty breathing) is commonly seen, and tolerance for exercise may be lowered. Rapid breathing and a rapid heart rate are other signs. [...] With more severe contusions, breath sounds heard through a stethoscope may be decreased, or rales (an abnormal crackling sound in the chest accompanying breathing) may be present. People with severe contusions may have bronchorrhea (the production of watery sputum). Wheezing and coughing are other signs. Coughing up blood or bloody sputum is present in {{up to half of}} cases. Cardiac output (the volume of blood pumped by the heart) may be reduced, and hypotension (low blood pressure) is frequently present. The area of the chest wall near the contusion may be [...] tender or painful due to associated chest wall injury.|$|E
500|$|Vascular malformations in {{the lungs}} may cause a number of problems. The lungs {{normally}} [...] "filter out" [...] bacteria and blood clots from the bloodstream; AVMs bypass the capillary network of the lungs and allow these to migrate to the brain, where bacteria may cause a brain abscess and blood clots may lead to stroke. HHT {{is the most common}} cause of lung AVMs: out of all people found to have lung AVMs, 70–80% are due to HHT. Bleeding from lung AVMs is relatively unusual, but may cause hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or hemothorax (blood accumulating in the chest cavity). Large vascular malformations in the lung allow oxygen-depleted blood from the right ventricle to bypass the alveoli, meaning that this blood does not have an opportunity to absorb fresh oxygen. This may lead to breathlessness. Large AVMs may lead to platypnea, difficulty in breathing that is more marked when sitting up compared to lying down; this probably reflects changes in blood flow associated with positioning. Very large AVMs cause a marked inability to absorb oxygen, which may be noted by <b>cyanosis</b> (bluish discoloration of the lips and skin), clubbing of the fingernails (often encountered in chronically low oxygen levels), and a humming noise over the affected part of the lung detectable by stethoscope.|$|E
