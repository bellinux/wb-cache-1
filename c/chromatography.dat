5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas <b>chromatography</b> and liquid <b>chromatography</b> are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer <b>chromatography.</b> Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas <b>chromatography,</b> the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas <b>chromatography</b> coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid <b>chromatography</b> (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E
40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} the isolation and characterization of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) from fetal cotyledonary tissue (FCT) and maternal caruncular tissue (MCT) collected from fallow deer (Dama dama) pregnant females. Proteins issued from FCT and MCT were submitted to affinity <b>chromatographies</b> by using Vicia villosa agarose (VVA) or anti-bovine PAG- 2 (R# 438) coupled to Sepharose 4 B gel. Finally, they {{were characterized by}} SDSPAGE and N-terminal microsequencing. Results: Four distinct fallow deer PAG (fdPAG) sequences were identified and submitted to Swiss-Prot database. Comparison of fdPAG with PAG sequences identified in other ruminant species exhibited 64 to 83 % identity. Additionally, alpha-fetoprotein was identified in fetal and maternal tissues.

Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E
