This led to growing interest in finding natural food additives with {{a broad spectrum of}} antibacterial activity to replace those synthetic chemical additives. Essential oils have been shown to possess antibacterial activities, thus present a great potential as natural antibacterial agents. In this study, essential oil was extracted from dried <b>clove</b> <b>buds</b> (Syzygium aromaticum) using steam distillation. The effect of different grinding methods and distillation times on essential oil yield was investigated. The antibacterial activity of clove oil was evaluated using disc diffusion and broth dilution method. The presence of eugenol in clove oil was validated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The highest essential oil yield was obtained using dried <b>clove</b> <b>buds</b> ground with mortar and pestle at 5 hours distillation time. Clove oil showed highest inhibitory effect against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, followed by Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Essential oil extracted for 7 hours from dried <b>clove</b> <b>buds</b> ground with mortar and pestle showed the highest antibacterial activity.

40|$|Syzygium aromaticum (<b>clove</b> <b>bud)</b> is {{a highly}} {{recognized}} spice {{all over the world}} for its medicinal and culinary qualities. This experimental study evaluates the effect of a methanolic extract of this Syzygium aromaticum on the histology of the testis and sperm parameters of adult male wistar rats in varying doses. Sixteen adult male wistar rats of close weight range were assigned into four groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 of four animals each. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were treated with 50 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml and 200 mg/ml of the extract respectively while the Group 1 served as the control group within an experimental period of twenty-one days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration, the animals were sacrificed for the tissue harvesting and proper investigation. The sperm parameters evaluation revealed that the mean sperm count of the control group is lower than those of the other groups while the level of sperm count and sperm viability of treated animals increased in a dose dependent fashion. The histological findings revealed tissues of Group 4 had shrinkage, fibrosis and degeneration of the testicular tissues when compared to other groups. This study thereby suggests that moderate intake of Syzygium aromaticum (<b>clove</b> <b>bud)</b> could influence the sperm count by increasing it and yet preserve the testicular tissues but excessive intake of it could cause damages to the testicular tissues and so it should be advised against befor...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{attempted}} {{to identify and}} standardize the different phytochemical by modern analytical techniques and to summarize the UV, TLC, FTIR characters of the plants; Eugenia caryophyllus (clove), Acorus Calamus (vekhand), Myristica fragrans (Nutmeg) and Citrus aurantium(Orange peel) which ultimately results in compilation of analytical data for these crude drugs which are very much used in herbal cosmetics. The methanolic extracts of Clove, Acorus, Nutmeg, Orange peel were prepared by ultrasonic bath extraction method and labeled as DSC, DSA, DSN and DSO respectively for further studies. Preliminary pytochemical screening of extracts were also performed. Asarones were detected in Acorus extract by subjecting the TLC to UV light and observing blue fluorescence. Volatile oil was isolated from <b>clove</b> <b>buds</b> by using Clevenger’s apparatus which was subjected for the FTIR analysis, which indicates the peak for presence of phenol compound. For nutmeg and orange peel samples the presence of myristicine, elemicine in nutmeg extract was confirmed by Rf values...|$|R
40|$|Since long times, human employs {{medicinal}} plants to treat illnesses, using frequently oily or aqueous preparations. Such uses {{are one of}} the most important principles of green chemistry which called „green solvents‟. Within the context of clean and green pharmaceutical industry, ethnopharmacological preparations must to be investigated to reduce toxicity of chemicals and solvents. „Dawilou ‟ is an ancient preparation used in Constantine as an Algerian Traditional Medicine (ATM); it is an aqueous herbal mixture of four spices: lesser galangal rhizome, ginger rhizome, cinnamon bark and <b>clove</b> <b>buds.</b> It is used to prevent or treat cold disease and to give some energy to workers in ancient times. The decoction was studied for its qualitative chemical composition using phytochemical screening; it was found that the extract is rich in chemical constituents: phenolics, terpenoids and alkaloids. Biological activity of „Dawilou ‟ against clinical isolated bacteria was investigated also and found to have moderate activity in vitro because of bacterial nature. So, the in vivo study is necessary to complete the study and evaluate immunostimulating activity of the extract which is empirically proved...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop new compounds with potential biological activity from readily accessed natural products, in particular eugenol. Eugenol has been reported to posses antioxidant and anticancer properties. In an attempt to enhance  intrinsic activity of this natural compound, some derivatives were possible to synthesize. The main aim of this preliminary research was to isolate eugenol from clove oil and made its sulfonic and amine derivatives through chemical transformation. Clove oil was extracted from <b>clove</b> <b>buds</b> with dichloromethane and followed by isolation of eugenol using column chromatography to afford eugenol (73 %). Eugenol has been reported to posses antioxidant and anticancer properties. In an attempt to enhance intrinsic activity of this natural compound, some derivatives were possible to synthesize. Eugenol was transformed to its sulfonic derivative in moderate yield by treatment with chlorosulfonic acid and to its amine by reduction of its nitro derivative. This transformation was rapidly confirmed by GC-MS analysis which showed significance molecular ion at m/z 244 corresponding to molecular formula C 10 H 12 SO 5. and at m/z 179 corresponding to molecular formula C 10 H 11 O 2 NH 2.   Keywords: Chemical Transformation, Eugenol, 4 -Allyl- 2 -methoxy- 6 -sulfonicphenol and 4 -Allyl- 2 -methoxy- 6 -aminopheno...|$|R
