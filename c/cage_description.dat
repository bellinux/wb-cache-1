30|$|As a {{model for}} a large WWTP with 170, 000 {{population}} equivalents, the WWTP Langwiese was in the focus of our study, also situated at the Schussen River upstream of the WWTP Eriskirch (Fig.  8). At the WWTP Langwiese, an additional powdered activated carbon filter was put into operation after the biological treatment and before the final sand filter in September 2013. At that WWTP, we exposed 1 -year-old rainbow trout in cages (for <b>cage</b> <b>description</b> see [30]) 100  m upstream the WWTP effluent and downstream of it (mixture of 50  % effluent and 50  % Schussen water) in the Schussen River. Trout were fed every second day with a comparable amount of food as the trout at the WWTP Eriskirch received in 2  days. The exposure experiments at the WWTP Langwiese were performed in spring 2013 prior to the upgrade with the powdered activated carbon filter and in spring 2014 after the upgrade.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was identify the land use in the range of 500 meters on the margins of São José dos Dourados River in order to collaborate in the selection of the capable places for the fish breeding in floating net <b>cages</b> exploration. The <b>description</b> of the land use and the degradation level classes was possible by the use of multitemporal and multisource data. The results shows that pasture area continues occupying the main percentage of the anthropic use of the study area and the riparian vegetation still represents a discontinue distribution and inexpressive rates, contributing for the silting and eutrophication of the UHE Ilha Solteira reservoir. The SPRING was efficient to generate the data that will supports the selection of the locals for the installation of the floating net cages for the fish breeding exploration. Pages: 953 - 96...|$|R
500|$|At {{around the}} same time, Cage began {{studying}} {{the writings of the}} Indian art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. Among the ideas that influenced <b>Cage</b> was the <b>description</b> of the rasa aesthetic and of its eight [...] "permanent emotions". These emotions are divided into two groups: four white (humor, wonder, erotic, and heroic—"accepting one's experience", in Cage's words) and four black (anger, fear, disgust, and sorrow). They are the first eight of the navarasas or navrasas ("nine emotions"), and they have a common tendency towards the ninth of the navarasas: tranquility. Cage never specified which of the pieces relate to which emotions, or whether there even exists such direct correspondence between them. He mentioned, though, that the [...] "pieces with bell-like sounds suggest Europe and others with a drum-like resonance suggest the East". (A short excerpt from Sonata II, which is clearly inspired by Eastern music: [...]) Cage also stated that Sonata XVI, the last of the cycle (...) , is [...] "clearly European. It was the signature of a composer from the West." ...|$|R
