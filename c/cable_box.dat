5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the <b>cable</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
25|$|There was a {{controversy}} with moving broadcasts to Fox Sports Florida since Orlando's largest cable TV provider, Bright House Networks, did not carry the network. Pressure increased for the cable provider {{to pick up}} FS Florida {{in time for the}} 2007–08 NBA season but this did not happen. The Magic persisted with airing games on FS Florida into the 2008–09 season despite Bright House's refusal to pick up the channel in all of its affiliates. Recently, Bright House and FS Florida came to an agreement on January 1, 2009 and have begun airing the channel as part of its standard cable package. However, Bright House airs the channel using a digital signal that only allows customers who own the Digital <b>cable</b> <b>box</b> to receive the channel. The customers do not have to pay any additional costs to get the channel with their Digital <b>cable</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An {{addressable}} <b>cable</b> <b>box</b> is {{one that}} can be controlled by the local cable company. Addressability is the process by which (optionally encrypted) messages are sent from the cable provider for a particular <b>cable</b> <b>box</b> via the cable signal. The cable company can [...] "address" [...] a particular customer's <b>cable</b> <b>box</b> to command it to activate or deactivate the descrambling of selected premium or pay-per view channels. The system can also send messages. This function affords the cable company the ability to add or delete descrambling on the channels that come in through the coaxial cable line. It also allows them to remotely disable the box, for reasons such as non-payment of the cable bill or theft of the unit itself. Such commands are referred to as bullets and are a transmitted message which affects the <b>cable</b> <b>box</b> program effectively disabling or [...] "killing" [...] it. [...] "Bullets" [...] do not affect the electronics inside converters or descramblers, only the programming. Non-addressable boxes are [...] "bulletproof", as they are unable to detect such messages.|$|E

50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>box</b> is a metal {{enclosure}} (found in {{the vicinity}} of a house that has cable service) that connects a house or building to the cable provider. This is traditionally the demarcation point and signifies where the service provider's responsibility ends and the customer's responsibility (for cabling and connections) begins. The box is usually located near the connection points for other service connections (electric or telephone). Other locations of the <b>cable</b> <b>box</b> include centralized locations (apartment buildings), lawns, or telephone poles.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to estimate the 1999 energy consumption of set-top boxes and telephony products in the U. S. residential sector. Results of this study will be used to identify new energy conservation opportunities and to align programs with those opportunities. We conducted a bottom-up analysis for set-top boxes and telephony products using our own power measurements and stock and usage estimates from secondary sources. The most common set-top boxes in U. S. homes in 1999 were analog <b>cable</b> <b>boxes,</b> digital <b>cable</b> <b>boxes,</b> wireless receivers, and game consoles. According to these measurements, analog <b>cable</b> <b>boxes</b> and wireless receivers draw between 10 and 15 watts, while digital <b>cable</b> <b>boxes</b> draw between 20 and 25 watts in both the Active and Standby modes. Video games used less than 2 watts in Standby mode, and about 8 watts when Active. We estimate that set-top boxes accounted for 0. 7 % of residential electricity use in 1999. Our investigation of telephony products included answering machines, cordless phones, cordless phone answering machine combination units, and mobile phone chargers. Answering machines, cordless phones, and combination units use between 2 and 3 watts in both the Active and Standby modes. Mobile phone chargers use about 1 watt in standby. We estimate that these telephony products account for 0. 5 % of U. S. residential electricity consumption. Together, set-tops and telephony constituted 1. 2 % of U. S. residential electricity consumption in 1999. Standby power use accounted for about 60 % of this energy use. The combined total energy use of the products investigated for this study and those researched previously for this series of reports account for about 6. 6 % of residential electricity use in the U. S...|$|R
