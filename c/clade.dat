5|$|Historically, Struthiosaurinae {{has been}} {{considered}} a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae by Walter P. Coombs in 1978 and Tatyana Tumanova in 1987, or a sister <b>clade</b> to Edmontoniinae, Panoplosaurinae, Stegopeltinae, and Sauropeltinae by Tracy L. Ford in 2000. Kirkland and his colleagues followed Ford in using Struthiosaurinae as a <b>clade</b> of basal nodosaurids, but concluded that the only other subfamily of Nodosauridae was Nodosaurinae. According to Kirkland et al., Acanthopholinae was not an acceptable classification for the new <b>clade</b> of previously unrecognized nodosaurids because of the instability of Acanthopholis. Struthiosaurinae was decided on as {{the name of the}} <b>clade,</b> as it was the next published term after Acanthopholinae. To ensure the group was rendered valid, Kirkland et al. redefined Struthiosaurinae as the most inclusive <b>clade</b> containing Europelta but not Cedarpelta, Peloroplites, Sauropelta, or Edmontonia. This definition includes the genera Anoplosaurus, Europelta, Hungarosaurus and Struthiosaurus inside the newly defined group. Below is a cladogram from before the recognition of the <b>clade</b> Struthiosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|In Parrish's phylogenetic analysis, Aetosaurus {{was found}} to be the most basal member of the <b>clade,</b> the {{earliest}} to diverge after the most recent common ancestor. After Aetosaurus, there is a polytomy of three smaller clades in which it is unknown which <b>clade</b> diverged first from the group. Within this polytomy there was Neoaetosauroides, a <b>clade</b> containing Aetosauroides and Stagonolepis, and another polytomy that included Longosuchus, Desmatosuchus, and a <b>clade</b> containing Paratypothorax and Typothorax.|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California <b>clade,</b> and that common ravens in the California <b>clade</b> are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic <b>clade.</b> Ravens in the Holarctic <b>clade</b> are more closely related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California <b>clade.</b> Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E

40|$|Since flight imposes {{physical}} {{constraints on}} the attributes of a flying organism, {{it is expected that}} the distribution of body sizes within <b>clades</b> of small-bodied flying vertebrates should share a similar pattern that reflects these constraints. We examined patterns in similarities of body mass distributions among five <b>clades</b> of small-bodied endothermic vertebrates (Passeriformes, Apodiformes + Trochiliformes, Chiroptera, Insectivora, Rodentia) to examine {{the extent to which these}} distributions are congruent among the <b>clades</b> that fly as opposed to those that do not fly. The body mass distributions of three <b>clades</b> of small-bodied flying vertebrates show significant divergence from the distributions of their sister <b>clades.</b> We examined two alternative hypotheses for similarities among the size frequency distributions of the five <b>clades.</b> The hypothesis of functional symmetry corresponds to patterns of similarity expected if body mass distributions of flying <b>clades</b> are constrained by similar or identical functional limitations. The hypothesis of phylogenetic symmetry corresponds to patterns of similarity expected if body mass distributions reflect phylogenetic relationships among <b>clades.</b> Empirically, the <b>clades</b> with the most similar body mass distributions are the Passeriformes and Chiroptera, a resul...|$|R

Within this <b>clade,</b> S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group.

5|$|Despite {{now having}} {{established}} a taxonomic grouping for the Liliaceae family that is genetically monophyletic, {{compared to the}} prior longstanding polyphyletic assemblages under this name, the morphology remains diverse, and there exists within the Liliaceae <b>clade</b> a number of subclades. There appeared to be two major clades, the first and largest of these consisted of three subclades: Clintonia—Medeola—Gagea, Lilium Fritillaria—Notholirion, and Tulipa—Erythronium. The second smaller <b>clade,</b> Streptopus—Tricyrtis contained elements of Dahlgren's Uvulariaceae. The position of Calochortus remained problematic, being considered a sister <b>clade</b> to Liliaceae, as treated by Tamura, but further analysis suggested {{it was in fact}} sister to Tricyrtis, although it is now considered separate once again (see Table 3).|$|E
5|$|Gymnopils maritimus {{is clearly}} a {{different}} species from other members of its <b>clade,</b> despite their close relation.

40|$|A {{major goal}} of {{evolutionary}} biology and ecology {{is to understand}} why species richness varies among <b>clades.</b> Previous {{studies have suggested that}} variation in richness among <b>clades</b> might be related to variation in rates of morphological evolution among <b>clades</b> (e. g., body size and shape). Other studies have suggested that richness patterns might be related to variation in rates of climatic-niche evolution. However, few studies, if any, have tested the relative importance of these variables in explaining patterns of richness among <b>clades.</b> Here, we test their relative importance among major <b>clades</b> of Plethodontidae, the most species-rich family of salamanders. Earlier studies have suggested that climatic-niche evolution explains patterns of diversification among plethodontid <b>clades,</b> whereas rates of morphological evolution do not. A subsequent study stated that rates of morphological evolution instead explained patterns of species richness among plethodontid <b>clades</b> (along with "ecological limits" on richness of <b>clades,</b> leading to saturation of <b>clades</b> with species, given limited resources). However, they did not consider climatic-niche evolution. Using phylogenetic multiple regression, we show that rates of climatic-niche evolution explain most variation in richness among plethodontid <b>clades,</b> whereas rates of morphological evolution do not. We find little evidence that ecological limits explain patterns of richness among plethodontid <b>clades.</b> We also test whether rates of morphological and climatic-niche evolution are correlated, and find that they are not. Overall, our results help explain richness patterns in a major amphibian group and provide possibly the first test of the relative importance of climatic niches and morphological evolution in explaining diversity patterns...|$|R

5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the tribe to which O.polius belongs. He used both morphological data and molecular characters from the IRBP gene. In {{all of his}} analyses, O.polius {{was found to be}} part of <b>clade</b> D, one of four large groups within Oryzomyini, as the sister group to a <b>clade</b> containing all the other species of <b>clade</b> D. <b>Clade</b> D was supported by two shared derived (synapomorphic) molecular characters and by seven morphological synapomorphies—the tail has a different color above and below; the parietal bone extends {{to the side of the}} skull; the incisive foramina (openings in the palate) extend back between the first molars; the posterolateral palatal pits (perforations of the palate near the third molars) are complex; the sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate) are large; the pattern of the arterial circulation in the head is derived; and the posteroloph (a crest at the back) is present on the third upper molar. Two other molecular synapomorphies supported the <b>clade</b> of all members of <b>clade</b> D except O.polius, coupled with three morphological traits—in these species, but not in O.polius, the first upper molar has an additional small root at the outer (labial) side; the first lower molar has additional small roots; and the second upper molar has the mesoflexus (one of the valleys between the cusps and crests) divided in two.|$|E
