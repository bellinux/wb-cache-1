The table below lists some of the preemergence corn herbicide products that <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> postemergence, {{as well as the}} recommended maximum plant heights or growth stages at application.

The Concept Association Network (<b>CAN)</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to the ranking results to improve some poor detected concepts according to their relationship to other concepts. • F A FIU-UM- 3 -brn 3 : MCA+KF+SF+CAN- Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) based ranking using KF features and shot-based features(SF). <b>CAN</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to the ranking results of this round as well. • F A FIU-UM- 4 4 : LR+KF+CAN- Logistic Regression (LR) using KF features. <b>CAN</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to the ranking results of this round as well. In Runs 2, 3, and 4, each of them uses a different learning algorithm to train the model and predict testing instances. KF features are used in all these runs, but SF features are used only in Run 3. Additional training labels provided by NIST are also used in Run 3 (called “brn ” in the name) as a trial. The Concept Association Network (<b>CAN)</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to all these runs to utilize the correlation between the concepts to improve the concepts with poor performance by the concepts with good performance. Finally, the results of these three runs are fused together to generate Run 1 as the best run. From the submission results, Run 1 does perform the best among all the four runs...|$|R
