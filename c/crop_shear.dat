The assumption of linearity is no longer valid if the mill is operated in a wider working range. In a reversing mill this is especially the case when the plate enters and leaves the mill stand from pass to pass. A non-linear control strategy is proposed to improve the regularity of the thickness {{at the ends of}} the plate in order to decrease the amount of the plate to be cut off by the <b>crop</b> <b>shear.</b> The performance of the controller is examined using an advanced simulation model of a finishing mill.

In {{order to be}} resistant to geometric distortion attacks, the matched feature points determined by the scale-invariance feature transform (SIFT) are used for image restoration to reduce the synchronization errors caused by geometric distortion attacks. An adaptive embedding scheme is applied in discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain of each subimage. The watermark detection decision {{is based on the}} number of matched bits between the retrieved and original watermark in the embedding image blocks. Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking is robust to common signal processing attacks and geometric distortion attacks, including rotation, scaling, <b>cropping,</b> <b>shearing</b> and some combined attacks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Cropping is {{a cutting}} process whereby {{opposing}} aligned blades create a shearing failure by exerting opposing forces normal to {{the surfaces of}} a metal sheet or plate. Building on recent efforts to quantify cropping, this paper formulates a plane strain elastic-plastic model of a plate subject to shearing action by opposing rigid platens. Shear failure {{at the local level}} is modeled by a cohesive zone characterized by the peak shear traction and the energy dissipated by shear failure process at the microscopic level. The model reveals the interplay between shear cracking and the extensive plastic shearing accompanying the cutting process. Specifically, it provides insight into the influence of the material’s microscopic shear strength and toughness on the total work of cropping. The computational model does not account for deformation of the cropping tool, friction between sliding surfaces and material temperature and rate-dependence.

40|$|Shear cutting {{is common}} within several sheet metal {{industry}} processing steps, e. g. in {{cut to length}} lines, slitting lines, end <b>cropping.</b> <b>Shearing</b> is fast and cheap relative to competing cutting methods like laser and plasma cutting, but involves large forces on the equipment that increase with increased sheet material strength. Accurate shear experiments are a prerequisite to increase the knowledge of shearing parameters, improve industrial shearing, and provide data for validation of numerical shear models. Here, the two shear parameters clearance and clamp configuration, identified {{as important to the}} shear results, were studied in an experimental set-up with well defined tool movement and high measurability of tool position and force. In addition to force measurements, the sheared edge geometry was characterized. Steels of low, medium, and high strength were selected for the study. Throughout the experimental study, the shear tool penetration before fracture decreased with increased material strength. The required shear force decreased and the force attempting to separate the two shear tools increased when one side of the sheet was left unclamped and free to move. Further, the maximum shear force increased with decreased clearance. Clearance changes were small and moreover continuously measured during all shear experiments...|$|R

Shear strength at high soil bulk density grassland was studied {{to improve the}} traction performance and develop the <b>crop</b> yield. <b>Shear</b> force and shear displacement are tested at different vertical loads. Results indicated that with the increasing of shear displacement, shear force was found to show a parabolic trend of first increasing then decreasing. Moreover, larger vertical load would lead to steeper shear force curve against shear displacement. It also should be noted that, the maximum shear stress showed a parabolic increase trend following the increasing of the normal stress.

50|$|Weakening {{slightly}} after peaking in intensity, Cyclone Litanne {{continued to}} the west, making landfall near Brickaville in east-central Madagascar at 1600 UTC on March 15. This occurred months after cyclones Daisy and Geralda affected {{the same general}} area. Four hours before landfall, the storm had peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). A strengthening trough turned Litanne southward over the eastern portion of the country, and the storm dropped heavy rainfall. Flooding was limited, although high winds severely damaged the rice <b>crop.</b> Increasing wind <b>shear</b> removed the convection, causing quick weakening. On March 17, Litanne emerged from southeastern Madagascar into the Indian Ocean as a tropical depression, {{and the next day}} transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after being absorbed by a nearby trough. Five days later after accelerating to the southeast, the storm dissipated about 2000 km south of where it first developed.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effects of day and night cropping on the meat quality characteristics of impala. Emphasis was placed on the influence of the cropping method on muscle pH 45 (45 minutes post mortem), pHu (ultimate pH), pH decline, and the related influence on drip loss, cooking loss, toughness and colour of the meat in the M. longissimus lumborum. Measurements taken from 16 animals cropped at night were compared to those taken from 24 animals cropped in daytime. A mean PH 45 of 6. 67 ± 0. 11 was recorded for the night cropped animals compared to a mean pH 45 of 6. 55 ± 0. 23 for the day cropped animals. A mean pHu of 5. 39 ± 0. 08 for animals cropped at night was recorded compared to a mean pHu of 5. 45 ± 0. 11 for the animals cropped in the day. Regression analysis showed the rate of pH decline to be slower in the night cropped animals compared to those cropped in the day. This persisted when the pH values were adjusted to correct for ambient temperature. The cooling rate of the M. longissimus lumborum was twice as fast in the night <b>cropped</b> group. <b>Shear</b> force values and drip losses respectively, for the night-cropped animals were 19. 11 ± 5. 68 g/mm 2 and 2. 93 ± 1. 59 %, whereas for the day cropped animals the values were 23. 42 ± 8. 13 g/mm 2 and 4. 15 ± 2. 34 %.

Sendo assim, este trabalho objetivou-se, estudar o comportamento da palha da cana-de-açúcar quanto ao corte, em função de sua umidade, espessura de sua camada e do ângulo oblíquo da lâmina. Para a coleta de dados foram utilizados um transdutor de força, acoplado á base das lâminas, e um sistema automático de coleta de dados, que trabalhou com taxa de aquisição de 9600 Hz. Os resultados demonstraram diferença significativa na força requerida quando se varia o ângulo oblíquo da lâmina e tendência linear desta força, com o aumento da quantidade de palha, entre 4 e 16 t ha- 1. Verificou-se, também, que o requerimento de força e a demanda de energia, quando se variou a umidade da palha, apresentaram comportamento exponencial sendo que, acima de 28 %, em base seca, as diferenças para a força de corte requerida e para a demanda de energia passaram a não ser mais significativas. A força máxima de corte apresentou tendência linear e inversamente proporcional ao ângulo oblíquo da lâmina.

40|$|Crop {{residues}} {{in conservation}} tillage systems {{are known to}} cause both {{a reduction in the}} erosive runoff power and an increase in the topsoil erosion resistance. In this study, the relative importance of both mechanisms in reducing soil loss by concentrated flow erosion is examined. Therefore, a method to calculate the effective flow shear stress responsible for soil detachment {{in the presence of a}} residue cover is applied. The determination of effective flow shear stress is based on the recalculation of the hydraulic radius for residue treatments. The method was tested in a laboratory flume by comparing soil detachment rates of identical pairs of soil samples that only differ in the presence or absence of <b>crop</b> residues. This <b>shear</b> stress partitioning approach and a soil detachment correction were then applied to a dataset of soil detachment measurements on undisturbed topsoil samples from a no-till field plot on a loess-derived soil, sampled during one growing season. Results indicate that only a small fraction (10 % on average) of the difference in soil detachment rate between conventional and conservation tillage can be attributed to the dissipation of shear forces on the residues. The remaining decrease in soil detachment during concentrated runoff after a two-year application of conservation tillage can be explained by the increased dry bulk density and root and crop residue content in the topsoil that reduces soil erodibility. After correcting for the presence of residues, the temporal variability in soil detachment rates (Dr) during concentrated flow for a given flow shear stress (τ) for both treatments can be predicted fairly well (R 2 = 0 · 87) from dry soil bulk density (DBD, representing consolidation effects), soil moisture content (SMC, representing antecedent rainfall conditions), the dry mass of organic material (OM, representing root growth and residue decomposition) and saturated soil shear strength σs, sat using an equation of the form: This study is the first to show that the effect of conservation tillage on soil detachment rates is a result of soil property modifications affecting soil erodibility, rather than a result of the surface residue decreasing flow erosivity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Shearing is {{the process}} where sheet metal is {{mechanically}} cut between two tools. Various shearing technologies are commonly used in the sheet metal industry, for example, in cut to length lines, slitting lines, end <b>cropping</b> etc. <b>Shearing</b> has speed and cost advantages over competing cutting methods like laser and plasma cutting, but involves large forces on the equipment and large strains in the sheet material. The constant development of sheet metals toward higher strength and formability leads to increased forces on the shearing equipment and tools. Shearing of new sheet materials imply new suitable shearing parameters. Investigations of the shearing parameters through live tests in the production are expensive and separate experiments are time consuming and requires specialized equipment. Studies involving {{a large number of}} parameters and coupled effects are therefore preferably performed by finite element based simulations. Accurate experimental data is still a prerequisite to validate such simulations. There is, however, a shortage of accurate experimental data to validate such simulations. In industrial shearing processes, measured forces are always larger than the actual forces acting on the sheet, due to friction losses. Shearing also generates a force that attempts to separate the two tools with changed shearing conditions through increased clearance between the tools as result. Tool clearance is also the most common shearing parameter to adjust, depending on material grade and sheet thickness, to moderate the required force and to control the final sheared edge geometry. In this work, an experimental procedure that provides a stable tool clearance together with accurate measurements of tool forces and tool displacements, was designed, built and evaluated. Important shearing parameters and demands on the experimental set-up were identified in a sensitivity analysis performed with finite element simulations under the assumption of plane strain. With respect to large tool clearance stability and accurate force measurements, a symmetric experiment with two simultaneous shears and internal balancing of forces attempting to separate the tools was constructed. Steel sheets of different strength levels were sheared using the above mentioned experimental set-up, with various tool clearances, sheet clamping and rake angles. Results showed that tool penetration before fracture decreased with increased material strength. When one side of the sheet was left unclamped and free to move, the required shearing force decreased but instead the force attempting to separate the two tools increased. Further, the maximum shearing force decreased and the rollover increased with increased tool clearance. Digital image correlation was applied to measure strains on the sheet surface. The obtained strain fields, together with a material model, were used to compute the stress state in the sheet. A comparison, up to crack initiation, of these experimental results with corresponding results from finite element simulations in three dimensions and at a plane strain approximation showed that effective strains on the surface are representative also for the bulk material. A simple model was successfully applied to calculate the tool forces in shearing with angled tools from forces measured with parallel tools. These results suggest that, with respect to tool forces, a plane strain approximation is valid also at angled tools, at least for small rake angles. In general terms, this study provide a stable symmetric experimental set-up with internal balancing of lateral forces, for accurate measurements of tool forces, tool displacements, and sheet deformations, to study the effects of important shearing parameters. The results give further insight to the strain and stress conditions at crack initiation during shearing, and {{can also be used to}} validate models of the shearing process...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the sheet}} metal industry, {{different}} shear cutting technologies {{are commonly used}} in several processing steps, e. g. in cut to length lines, slitting lines, end <b>cropping</b> etc. <b>Shearing</b> has speed and cost advantages over competing cutting methods like laser and plasma cutting, but involves large forces on the equipment and large strains in the sheet material. Numerical models to predict forces and sheared edge geometry for different sheet metal grades and different shear parameter set-ups are desirable. For new sheet metal grades, numerical shear models are efficient for finding appropriate shear parameters {{without the need for}} time consuming and expensive live tests in the production. In order to allow for validation of numerical models, accurate experimental data is wanted. Many industrial equipments for shearing give some measure of applied force, but due to machinery friction losses, measured forces are always higher than the forces acting on the sheet. Shearing also generates a force that attempts to separate the two shear tools with changed shear conditions through increased clearance between the shear tools as result. Clearance is also the most common shear parameter to adjust, depending on material grade and sheet thickness, in order to moderate the required force and to control the final sheared edge geometry. Sheared edges have four characteristic zones, rollover, shear, fracture and burr zones. Burrs and rough fracture zones complicate the following processing through inadequate tolerances that may imply additional machining and sharp edges that may damage equipment or even cause injuries. Well defined shears and accurate measurements are important for the understanding of shear parameters. In this work, an experimental procedure with high measurability and consistent and predictable output, is designed, built and evaluated. Important shear parameters and demands on the experimental set-up are identified in a perturbation analysis performed with use of finite element method. Considering the perturbation analyses results, experimental set-up requirements are formulated. Based on magnitude of the force changes obtained as result of perturbed input parameters in the analyses, force measurements with one percent accuracy are considered necessary. Since a clearance change of one percentage point results in approximately one percent change in forces, the target experimental clearance stability is an order of magnitude lower, i. e. the clearance should remain within 0. 1 % or 5 μm at the sheet thicknesses sheared. With respect to high clearance stability and accurate force measurements, a symmetric experiment with two simultaneous shears and internal balancing of forces attempting to separate the shear tools, is constructed. Besides a stable clearance, the experiment features high accuracy force measurements without external friction losses through 20 strain gauges mounted on the set-up. Since clearance and clamping of the sheet are identified as important to the shear results, these parameters are selected for further experimental studies through shearing of three material grades with various strength. Judging by the result, shear tool penetration before fracture decreases with increased material strength. When one side of the sheet is left unclamped and free to move, the required shear force decreases but instead the force attempting to separate the two shear tools increase. Further, the maximum shear force increases and the rollover decreases with decreased clearance. In general terms, results from the study are promising for use in validation of numerical shear models.
