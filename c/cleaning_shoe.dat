50|$|The Opti-Fan system {{compensates}} automatically {{for continuous}} uphill or downhill gradients in combines. When driving downhill, material moves against gravity {{and therefore more}} slowly over the grainpan and top sieve, causing it to remain longer in the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> and the layer thickness to increase. More ‘material other than grain' (MOG) remains in the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> as the set cleaning fan speed is insufficient to clear the crop. Driving uphill causes the material layer to decrease as it moves more quickly out of the shoe under gravity. The air flow from the fan is too high for the thin layer of material which results in the material travelling too quickly over the top causing increased grain losses. The fan speed control system senses the combine’s angle of ascent or descent and automatically adjusts the cleaning fan speed to compensate. The operator sets the level-field fan speed and the system reduces the speed when travelling uphill and increases it downhill to optimise the material layer thickness on the cleaning shoe.Opti-fan system was awarded with a Silver Medal at Agritechnica in 2009.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural crop {{residues}} (e. g., straw and stover) are a current focus for bioenergy feedstocks, with new technologies being developed {{to improve the}} economics of bioenergy production. Among the emerging technologies focused on feedstock engineering is the selective harvest concept. Due {{to the complexity of}} the biomass separations required for addressing the challenges and requirements of selective harvest, high fidelity models and advanced experimental methods that allow observation and measurement of the physical system are needed. These models and methods were developed and include computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to simulate the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> of a grain combine and a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique to quantitatively and qualitatively characterize the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> performance. While these techniques alone can be sufficient engineering and analysis tools for developing selective harvest technologies, this paper presents a new methodology, Virtual Engineering (VE), that integrates the CFD and PIV data into a virtual environment, where the data is coupled with the geometric model of a grain combine to provide a virtual representation of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> performance. Using VE visualization capabilities, the CFD and PIV data can be viewed {{in the context of the}} physical system for an interactive evaluation of characteristics and performance. This paper also discusses the concepts of additional VE tools that are being developed to provide necessary visualization, simulation and integration functionality...|$|E
40|$|The {{tailings}} return {{system is}} an important functional part of modern combine harvesters, but published research on tailings return systems is very scarce. The tailings return system is intended to take crop material that is not completely threshed and/or not completely cleaned from the combine <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> {{back to the main}} threshing cylinder. Returning the tailings is regular practice on modern combine harvesters, but is not necessary and may be detrimental in some crops and conditions. The primary objective of this thesis is to research the function of the tailings return system with emphasis on developing a tailings rethresher. A tailings rethresher rethreshes the material from the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> and returns it only to the cleaning section of the combine for re-processing. There are several potential advantages to rethreshing returning the tailings only to the cleaning section of the combine: 1.) Threshed grain in the tailings will not be exposed to the main threshing cylinder to be potentially damaged. 2.) The combine could be simplified and reduced in cost. 3) The rethresher will effectively reduce the loading of the main threshing cylinder, adding threshing capacity to the combine. 4.) Returning tailings to the cleaning system offers some advantages in distributing the load on the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> for more efficient operation.; 5.) With the addition of an innovative bypass system, tailings can be returned to the cleaning system without rethreshing. Rethreshing is not necessary in many crops. This thesis addresses the data collected in the field and its implications. The function of the tailings returns has been further quantified in this study. The information is directed toward development of an improved tailings rethresher/returns system. Fourteen field studies were performed to measure tailings flow rate and composition and grain purity and damage in four different crops and numerous different conditions. Two prototype rethreshers were constructed and laboratory tested. One prototype was installed on a combine for lab testing, but it was not field tested...|$|E

40|$|The {{cleaning}} {{process on}} a combine harvester {{is a complex}} process that is influenced by {{a wide range of}} parameters such as machine settings, field and crop-related parameters, etc. Because of the high time pressures combine drivers have to deal with, optimal settings for the cleaning section are usually only estimated once for each crop. As a consequence, differences in temporal and site-specific conditions are neglected. No recent literature is available that considers the interaction between the settings of the cleaning section (like e. g. fan speed, lower sieve opening and upper sieve opening) and the material other than grain (MOG) content in the grain bin, which is, however, an important performance parameter of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe.</b> In this study, a combine harvester was equipped with extra sensors that could contain valuable information necessary to predict the performance of the cleaning section. A nonlinear genetic polynomial regression technique was used to rank the pool of potential sensors as possible regression variables for a prediction model of the MOG content in the grain bin. This model is important for the automation of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe.</b> Results showed that the MOG content in the grain bin is influenced non-linearly by differences in the amount of biomass on the sieve section and the fan speed, which are also correlated with each other. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Emerging identity-preserved grain markets {{depend on}} {{avoidance}} of commingling grain at harvest. Knowledge of where grain resides in a combine, cleaning labor requirements, and resulting purity levels would assist producers. Measurements {{were made of}} grain and other material residing in different areas of rotary- and cylinder-type combines in replicated clean-outs during corn and soybean harvest and also in preliminary clean-outs during oat harvest. Concentration of the prior (i. e. commingled) grain was measured in the first grain harvested of the subsequent crop. Total material remaining in the combine ranged from 84 to 186 lb, 61 % of which was whole grain. The greatest amounts of corn and soybean material (17 to 74 lb) {{were found in the}} grain tank and rock trap. Intermediate amounts were found in the head or feederhouse, elevators, and at times the cylinder/rotor (soybeans), the unloading auger (soybeans, oats), and rear axle/chopper area. The least amounts were found in the <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> and straw walkers (cylinder-type machine). Time spent to clean the combine varied from about two hours to seven hours. Cleaning the head, grain tank, threshing rotor/cylinder, and <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> required more time than other areas. Immediately after cleaning, small amounts of prior (commingled) grain and foreign material, 0. 2 to 2. 5 lb, were found in the first bushel of subsequent grain harvested. Following clean-outs, commingled grain levels dropped below 0. 5 % after 20 bu were harvested. Over 14 lb of wheat were found during the first clean-out of a combine following 50 ac of oat harvest (no physical clean-out prior to oat harvest) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an interactive}} engineering design {{tool for the}} placement of baffles in air systems. This design tool integrates together the needed design analysis tools into a single interactive environment. This design tool has three primary components: (1) a CFD model of air flow through the system, (2) a virtual environment, and (3) a baffle placement and remeshing scheme. The CFD model {{used in conjunction with}} the design tool should be fast, accurate, and answer the current questions associated with the air system. The virtual environment includes an intuitive user interface and a graphical representation of the model. The design tool should also incorporate an easy baffle placement and remeshing scheme to easily allow the creation new CFD models for analysis. This allows users to design baffle configurations in a virtual environment and complete analysis through the integration of analysis tools through this single design tool. In the work presented in this thesis the design tool is demonstrated on two examples: an engine platform and a <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoe</b> in a combine. Current methods for design and decision-making processes for baffle placement within these types of air systems are inefficient and time consuming. Often CFD models of air systems are large and complex and require several days to complete an analysis. Under the current process, analysts are required to create new full-scale CFD models for each design iteration. Designers then {{have to wait for the}} results to come back before determining if another modification to the air system design is necessary. This can be extremely time consuming if a suitable solution is not immediately found. Introduction of the design tool developed in this thesis into the design and decision-making process simplifies and improves the overall process and the roles of those involved...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundWomen {{living in}} {{agricultural}} areas may experience high pesticide exposures compared {{with women in}} urban or suburban areas because of their proximity to farm activities. ObjectiveOur objective was to review {{the evidence in the}} published literature for the contribution of nonoccupational pathways of pesticide exposure in women living in North American agricultural areas. MethodsWe evaluated the following nonoccupational exposure pathways: paraoccupational (i. e., take-home or bystander exposure), agricultural drift, residential pesticide use, and dietary ingestion. We also evaluated the role of hygiene factors (e. g., house <b>cleaning,</b> <b>shoe</b> removal). ResultsAmong 35 publications identified (published 199522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2013), several reported significant or suggestive (p < 0. 1) associations between paraoccupational (n = 19) and agricultural drift (n = 10) pathways and pesticide dust or biomarker levels, and 3 observed that residential use was associated with pesticide concentrations in dust. The 4 studies related to ingestion reported low detection rates of most pesticides in water; additional studies are needed to draw conclusions about the importance of this pathway. Hygiene factors were not consistently linked to exposure among the 18 relevant publications identified. ConclusionsEvidence supported the importance of paraoccupational, drift, and residential use pathways. Disentangling exposure pathways was difficult because agricultural populations are concurrently exposed to pesticides via multiple pathways. Most evidence was based on measurements of pesticides in residential dust, which are applicable to any household member and are not specific to women. An improved understanding of nonoccupational pesticide exposure pathways in women living in agricultural areas is critical for studying health effects in women and for designing effective exposure-reduction strategies.

Diderot, with his usual eagerness to guide a friend's course, wrote him a letter urging that his many obligations, and even his grievances in respect of Madame d'Epinay, bound him to accompany her, as he would thus repay the one and console himself for the other. [...] "She is going into a country where she will be like one fallen from the clouds. She is ill; she will need amusement and distraction. As for winter, are you worse now than you were a month back, or than you will be at the opening of the spring? For me, I confess that if I could not bear the coach, I would take a staff and follow her on foot."[309] Rousseau trembled with fury, and as soon as the transport was over, he wrote an indignant reply, in which he more or less politely bade the panurgic one to attend to his own affairs, and hinted that Grimm was making a tool of him. Next he wrote to Grimm himself a letter, not unfriendly in form, asking his advice and promising to follow it, but hardly hiding his resentment. By this time he had found out the secret of Madame d'Epinay's supposed illness and her anxiety to pass some months away from her family, and the share which Grimm had in it. This, however, does not make many passages of his letter any the less ungracious or unseemly. [...] "If Madame d'Epinay has shown friend' ship to me, I have shown more to her.... As for benefits, first of all I do not like them, I do not want them, and I owe no thanks for any that people may burden me with by force. Madame d'Epinay, being so often left alone in the country, wished me for company; it was for that she had kept me. After making one sacrifice to friendship, I must now make another to gratitude. A man must be poor, must be without a servant, must be a hater of constraint, and he must have my character, before he can know what it is for me to live in another person's house. For all that, I lived two years in hers, constantly brought into bondage with the finest harangues about liberty, served by twenty domestics, and <b>cleaning</b> my own <b>shoes</b> every morning, overloaded with gloomy indigestion, and incessantly sighing for my homely porringer.... Consider how much money an hour of the life and the time of a man is worth; compare the kindnesses of Madame d'Epinay with the sacrifice of my native country and two years of serfdom; and then tell me whether the obligation is greater on her side or mine." [...] He then urges with a torrent of impetuous eloquence the thoroughly sound reasons why it was unfair and absurd for him, a beggar and an invalid, to make the journey with Madame d'Epinay, rich and surrounded by attendants. He is particularly splenetic that the philosopher Diderot, sitting in his own room before a good fire and wrapped in a well-lined dressing-gown, should insist on his doing his five and twenty leagues a day on foot, through the mud in winter.[310] ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{human race}} would fain be wits, And {{millions}} miss {{for one that}} hits. Young's universal passion, pride,[1] Was never known to spread so wide. Say, Britain, could you ever boast Three poets in an age at most? Our chilling climate hardly bears A sprig of bays in fifty years; While every fool his claim alleges, As if it grew in common hedges. What reason can there be assign'd For this perverseness in the mind? Brutes find out where their talents lie: A bear {{will not attempt to}} fly; A founder'd horse will oft debate, Before he tries a five-barr'd gate; A dog by instinct turns aside, Who sees the ditch too deep and wide. But man we find the only creature Who, led by Folly, combats Nature; Who, when she loudly cries, Forbear, With obstinacy fixes there; And, where his genius least inclines, Absurdly bends his whole designs. [...] Not empire to the rising sun By valour, conduct, fortune won; Not highest wisdom in debates, For framing laws to govern states; Not skill in sciences profound So large to grasp the circle round, Such heavenly influence require, As how to strike the Muse's lyre. [...] Not beggar's brat on bulk begot; Not bastard of a pedler Scot; Not boy brought up to <b>cleaning</b> <b>shoes,</b> The spawn of Bridewell[2] or the stews; Not infants dropp'd, the spurious pledges Of gipsies litter'd under hedges; Are so disqualified by fate To rise in church, or law, or state, As he whom Phoebus in his ire Has blasted with poetic fire. What hope of custom in the fair, While not a soul demands your ware? Where you have nothing to produce For private life, or public use? Court, city, country, want you not; You cannot bribe, betray, or plot. For poets, law makes no provision; The wealthy have you in derision: Of state affairs you cannot smatter; Are awkward when you try to flatter; Your portion, taking Britain round, Was just one annual hundred pound; Now not so much as in remainder, Since Cibber[3] brought in an attainder; For ever fix'd by right divine (A monarch's right) on Grub Street line. [...] Poor starv'ling bard, how small thy gains! How unproportion'd to thy pains! And here a simile comes pat in: Though chickens take a month to fatten, The guests in less than half an hour Will more than half a score devour. So, after toiling twenty days To earn a stock of pence and praise, Thy labours, grown the critic's prey, Are swallow'd o'er a dish of tea; Gone to be never heard of more, Gone where the chickens went before. How shall a new attempter learn Of different spirits to discern, And how distinguish which is which, The poet's vein, or scribbling itch? Then hear an old experienced sinner, Instructing thus a young beginner. [...] Consult yourself; and if you find A powerful impulse urge your mind, Impartial judge within your breast What subject you can manage best; Whether your genius most inclines To satire, praise, or humorous lines, To elegies in mournful tone, Or prologue sent from hand unknown. Then, rising with Aurora's light, The Muse invoked, sit down to write; Blot out, correct, insert, refine, Enlarge, diminish, interline; Be mindful, when invention fails, To scratch your head, and bite your nails. [...] Your poem finish'd, next your care Is needful to transcribe it fair. In modern wit all printed trash is Set off with numerous breaks and dashes. [...] To statesmen would you give a wipe, You print it in Italic type. When letters are in vulgar shapes, 'Tis ten to one the wit escapes: But, when in capitals express'd, The dullest reader smokes the jest: Or else perhaps he may invent A better than the poet meant; As learned commentators view In Homer more than Homer knew. [...] Your poem in its modish dress, Correctly fitted for the press, Convey by penny-post to Lintot,[4] But let no friend alive look into't. If Lintot thinks 'twill quit the cost, You need not fear your labour lost: And how agreeably surprised Are you to see it advertised! The hawker shows you one in print, As fresh as farthings from the mint: The product of your toil and sweating; A bastard of your own begetting. [...] Be sure at Will's,[5] the following day, Lie snug, and hear what critics say; And, if you find the general vogue Pronounces you a stupid rogue, Damns all your thoughts as low and little, Sit still, and swallow down your spittle; Be silent as a politician, For talking may beget suspicion; Or praise the judgment of the town, And help yourself to run it down. Give up your fond paternal pride, Nor argue on the weaker side: For, poems read without a name We justly praise, or justly blame; And critics have no partial views, Except they know whom they abuse: And since you ne'er provoke their spite, Depend upon't their judgment's right. But if you blab, you are undone: Consider what a risk you run: You lose your credit all at once; The town will mark you for a dunce; The vilest dogg'rel Grub Street sends, Will pass for yours with foes and friends; And you must bear the whole disgrace, Till some fresh blockhead takes your place. [...] Your secret kept, your poem sunk, And sent in quires to line a trunk, If still you be disposed to rhyme, Go try your hand a second time. Again you fail: yet Safe's the word; Take courage and attempt a third. But first with care employ your thoughts Where critics mark'd your former faults; The trivial turns, the borrow'd wit, The similes that nothing fit; The cant which every fool repeats, Town jests and coffeehouse conceits, Descriptions tedious, flat, and dry, And introduced the Lord knows why: Or where we find your fury set Against the harmless alphabet; On A's and B's your malice vent, While readers wonder whom you meant: A public or a private robber, A statesman, or a South Sea jobber; A prelate, who no God believes; A parliament, or den of thieves; A pickpurse at the bar or bench, A duchess, or a suburb wench: Or oft, when epithets you link, In gaping lines to fill a chink; Like stepping-stones, to save a stride, In streets where kennels are too wide; Or like a heel-piece, to support A cripple with one foot too short; Or like a bridge, that joins a marish To moorlands of a different parish. So have I seen ill-coupled hounds Drag different ways in miry grounds. So geographers, in Afric maps, With savage pictures fill their gaps, And o'er unhabitable downs Place elephants for want of towns. [...] But, though you miss your third essay, You need not throw your pen away. Lay now aside all thoughts of fame, To spring more profitable game. From party merit seek support; The vilest verse thrives best at court. And may you ever have the luck To rhyme almost as ill as Duck;[6] And, though you never learn'd to scan verse Come out with some lampoon on D'Anvers. A pamphlet in Sir Bob's defence Will never fail to bring in pence: Nor be concern'd about the sale, He pays his workmen on the nail.[7] Display the blessings of the nation, And praise the whole administration. Extol the bench of bishops round, Who at them rail, bid ---- confound; To bishop-haters answer thus: (The only logic used by us) What though they don't believe in ---- Deny them Protestants--thou lyest. [...] A prince, the moment he is crown'd, Inherits every virtue round, As emblems of the sovereign power, Like other baubles in the Tower; Is generous, valiant, just, and wise, And so continues till he dies: His humble senate this professes, In all their speeches, votes, addresses. But once you fix him in a tomb, His virtues fade, his vices bloom; And each perfection, wrong imputed, Is fully at his death confuted. The loads of poems in his praise, Ascending, make one funeral blaze: His panegyrics then are ceased, He grows a tyrant, dunce, or beast. As soon as you can hear his knell, This god on earth turns devil in hell: And lo! his ministers of state, Transform'd to imps, his levee wait; Where in the scenes of endless woe, They ply their former arts below; And as they sail in Charon's boat, Contrive to bribe the judge's vote; To Cerberus they give a sop, His triple barking mouth to stop; Or, in the ivory gate of dreams,[8] Project excise and South-Sea[9] schemes; Or hire their party pamphleteers To set Elysium by the ears. [...] Then, poet, if you mean to thrive, Employ your muse on kings alive; With prudence gathering up a cluster Of all the virtues you can muster, Which, form'd into a garland sweet, Lay humbly at your monarch's feet: Who, as the odours reach his throne, Will smile, and think them all his own; For law and gospel both determine All virtues lodge in royal ermine: I mean the oracles of both, Who shall depose it upon oath. Your garland, in the following reign, Change but the names, will do again. [...] But, if you think this trade too base, (Which seldom is the dunce's case) Put on the critic's brow, and sit At Will's, the puny judge of wit. A nod, a shrug, a scornful smile, With caution used, may serve a while. Proceed no further in your part, Before you learn the terms of art; For you can never be too far gone In all our modern critics' jargon: Then talk with more authentic face Of unities, in time and place: Get scraps of Horace from your friends, And have them at your fingers' ends; Learn Aristotle's rules by rote, And at all hazards boldly quote; Judicious Rymer[10] oft review, Wise Dennis,[11] and profound Bossu.[12] Read all the prefaces of Dryden, For these our critics much confide in; Though merely writ at first for filling, To raise the volume's price a shilling. [...] A forward critic often dupes us With sham quotations peri hupsous: And if we have not read Longinus, Will magisterially outshine us. Then, lest with Greek he overrun ye, Procure the book for love or money, Translated from Boileau's translation,[13] And quote quotation on quotation. [...] At Will's you hear a poem read, Where Battus[14] from the table head, Reclining on his elbow-chair, Gives judgment with decisive air; To whom the tribe of circling wits As to an oracle submits. He gives directions to the town, To cry it up, or run it down; Like courtiers, when they|$|R
