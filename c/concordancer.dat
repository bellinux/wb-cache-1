40|$|Language {{teaching}} {{is one of}} the major areas of application of corpus linguistics. It is common to distinguish direct and indirect applications of corpus studies in teaching (Leech 1997). Indirect application is usually associated with the use of <b>concordancers</b> in lexicography, material development and academic research, whereas direct application refers to classroom concordancing. In this talk I will look at direct classroom applications of corpora and <b>concordancers.</b> I will look at classroom concordancing from two perspectives – teacher and learner - considering ways in which <b>concordancers</b> can be used by teachers to illustrate some particularly challenging phenomena in academic writing, and the ways in which students can develop learner autonomy through the use of <b>concordancers...</b>|$|R

DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a <b>concordancer</b> to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a <b>concordancer</b> to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found.

40|$|URL] The “use” of corpora and <b>concordancers</b> in {{translation}} teaching has grown increasingly attractive {{since the mid}} 1990 s’ with an abundant literature advocating their use and promoting their benefits in the translation classroom. In translator training, efforts are being made to incorporate the use of corpora and <b>concordancers</b> in masters’ programmes and to offer specific modules on corpora for translation {{as the use of}} translation memory (TM) systems within Computer-Aided Translation (CAT) courses still dominates. In the translation profession, while TM systems are part of the everyday working environment, the same cannot be said of corpora and <b>concordancers</b> even though the most recent surveys show that professional translators would like {{to learn more about the}} potential of corpora for translation. Overall, the “usefulness” of corpora and corpus technology at the different stages of the translation process remains poorly documented {{in translation}} but a growing number of empirical studies has started to show concern as it has now become of paramount importance to assess the extent to which corpora are of added value for translation quality in both professional and academic environments...|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{language}} learners using a <b>concordancer,</b> to autonomously investigate vocabulary and structure in a target language was suggested over 30 years ago. Since then, some research has explored this idea further, {{but the potential}} benefit of concordancers {{in the hands of}} learners is still largely unexplored – especially with regards to structure. This study investigates what learners are able to accomplish when asked to investigate an English corpus with a <b>concordancer</b> in order to correct grammar errors in an essay. The study was conducted after only 30 minutes of training on a <b>concordancer.</b> Participants reactions to the software and to analyzing the target language autonomously are also shared. While participants’ reactions were mixed with regards to using a concordacer for error correction, all participants expressed an interest in using a <b>concordancer</b> during their writing process – something which was {{beyond the scope of this}} study – but which suggests a potential value for learner exposure to concordancers for autonomous language investigation...|$|E
40|$|Concordancing {{is a way}} of {{handling}} a collection of texts in order to process it in linguistic terms. The progress of corpus studies shed light on the formation of electronic (computerised) text analysis and along with it: on concordancing. The growing need for new tools and devices didn’t have to wait for long, the quick spread and development of computer systems and networks made it possible even for an everyday user to reach larger corpora {{with the help of a}} single personal computer or laptop. This opened a new chapter in the study of computational linguistics. Today, there is a huge number of concordancers on the market with a spectrum of functions (besides basic functions), but there is a developing need to enhance the functionality of these programmes (in textual, statistic and design terms), mainly because of the continuously growing use of concordances in classrooms. There are a lot of different functions with which a simple <b>concordancer</b> can be upgraded. Some of them can be easily implemented, the rest needs some professional insight not only in programming, but in linguistic terms as well. This is the reason why we started to create Niobe <b>Concordancer,</b> the follower and hopefully a would-be successor of Sisyphus <b>Concordancer.</b> This <b>concordancer</b> will confidently be able to show the way of prospective plans of expanding the functionality of <b>concordancer</b> applications. egyetemiangol nyelv és irodalo...|$|E

40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{set out to}} {{determine}} whether a parallel corpus and a <b>concordancer</b> would be appropriate tools to supplement a teaching programme of German at the beginners' level in an unsupervised environment.

It is shown that these tools can be of great benefit for beginners. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES I describe a pilot study involving a beginner student of German who undertook a supplementary unsupervised programme of learning German using a <b>concordancer</b> and a parallel corpus.

The main goal of the <b>concordancer</b> is to provide the user with a reference tools for correct collocation use so as to assist second language learners to acquire the most eminent characteristic of native-like writing. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the monolingual and parallel corpora {{which can be}} accessed through two <b>concordancers</b> on the server nl. ijs. si. Twelve monolingual corpora contain Slovene language texts, one contains Japanese and one English texts, and comprise reference corpora, such as Gigafida for written contemporary Slovene, IMP for historical Slovene, and GOS for spoken Slovene and specialised corpora, such as the corpus of texts from the informatics domain and the corpus of Slovene tweets. The five parallel corpora contain Slovene texts sentence aligned with, variously, English, Japanese, French, German, and Italian from domains such as EU law, literature and journalism. Although most of the corpora have been produced in the past, they have now been newly annotated, some have been extended with additional texts, and a few are completely new. The texts in the corpora are supplied with meta-data, while their word tokens are either manually or automatically annotated with at least lemmas and morphosyntactic descriptions. Most of the corpora are freely available through two web <b>concordancers,</b> the noSketch Engine and CUWI. These two corpus analysis tools support searching large annotated corpora, various types of search result display, the possibility to filter the searches according to meta-data, and saving the search results locally.

40|$|While {{the issues}} of {{receptive}} and productive vocabulary knowledge have been discussed in many vocabulary studies, language learners and practitioners have also tried to reduce {{the discrepancy between the}} two types of vocabulary knowledge. At the same time, with the development of new technology of the Internet, web based concordancers became easily accessible for the language learners. However, there has been little research on investigating the effect of the <b>concordancer</b> with empirical data. The current research, therefore, explores the effects of the concordanccer, an application of the corpus-based language instruction, on ESL learners’ productive vocabulary knowledge. Korean undergraduate students at an American public university were recruited, randomly assigned to an experimental group (<b>concordancer</b> group, n= 10) or a control group (thesaurus group, n= 11) for a series of writing practice, and their vocabulary errors in writing samples were statistically compared. The results indicate that the <b>concordancer</b> is an effective vocabulary reference and learning tool, and it is more effective in improving grammar knowledge of vocabulary than the lexical knowledge. The discussion includes suggestions for the future research of corpus-based language learning in assessing ESL productive vocabulary knowledge. clos...|$|E
