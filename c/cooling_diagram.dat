40|$|International audienceThe {{shape memory}} alloys {{based on the}} ternary system Cu-Al-Ni are able to produce a memory effect at high temperatures. However, if the {{material}} undergoes an accidental overheating, a transformation process leads to progressive loss of its characteristics. In this study, the effect of ageing on the metastable beta(1) (austenite) phase of a Cu- 13. 3 %Al- 4 %Ni shape memory alloy was investigated. In addition, the effects of heating rate between 450 and 580 A degrees C on the structural transformations of austenite after cooling to room temperature were studied. Observation by transmission electron microscopy of the structure that has undergone an isothermal ageing shows that the precipitation process depends on the maximum ageing temperature. Furthermore, calorimetric analysis shows that precipitates dissolution is possible when rapid heating between 450 and 580 A degrees C. This behaviour is observed on the <b>cooling</b> <b>diagram</b> which shows a martensitic transformation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} cosmological low mass (low virial temperature) objects {{and the formation of}} the first luminous objects. First, the `cooling diagram' for low mass objects is shown. We assess the cooling rate taking into account the contribution of H_ 2, which is not in chemical equilibrium generally, with a simple argument of time scales. The reaction rates and the cooling rate of H_ 2 are taken from the recent results by Galli & Palla (1998). Using this <b>cooling</b> <b>diagram,</b> we also estimate the formation condition of luminous objects taking into account the supernova (SN) disruption of virialized clouds. We find that the mass of the first luminous object is several times 10 ^ 7 solar mass, because smaller objects may be disrupted by the SNe before they become luminous. Metal pollution of low mass (Ly-alpha) clouds also discussed. The resultant metallicity of the clouds is about 1 / 1000 of the solar metallicity. Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures, To appear in ApJ...|$|E

We carry out numerical simulations for the plain carbon steels C 1080 and C 100 W 1. The results suggest that the austenite-pearlite phase change may be described decently by the Additivity Rule, except for the incubation time. On the other hand, using a rate law to describe the martensite formation is preferable to the Koistinen-Marburger formula, which leads to unphysical oscillations of the cooling curves in simulated CCT-diagrams.

Investigations are carried out by fluxing the melt with B 2 O 3 and without any fluxing material. The isothermal experiments allow us to determine the complete time–temperature-transformation diagram with a minimum crystallization time of about 200 s for the fluxed melt and about 130 s for the unfluxed Pd 43 Ni 10 Cu 27 P 20 melt.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} in situ detection of phase transformations in weld metals. In order to obtain favourable mechanical properties of a material it is useful to map its phase transformation behaviour. Cooling rate and chemical composition are factors of great influence to the transformation behaviour. For a given composition, a continuous <b>cooling</b> transformation (CCT) <b>diagram</b> can be used to illustrate this behaviour for a number of cooling rates. Usually these diagrams are constructed from data obtained through dilatometry, which is an expensive and, in the case of welding, not always accurate method. The aim of this work was to develop a new methodology and a set of tools for the construction of weld metal CCT-diagrams. The methodology is based on analysis of weld thermal histories acquired from temperature measurements in the fusion zone. The temperature was measured with thermocouples, logged with LabView and analysed numerically. The microstructure was characterised with light optical microscopy and field emission gun scanning electron microscopy. Hardness testing was performed using the Vickers technique. A description of the methodology is given and the results of an analysis of two low alloy weld metals are reported for the purpose of demonstration. Through the demonstration it becomes clear that the two central parts of the methodology, microstructural characterisation and thermal analysis, in combination offers the information needed to produce continuous <b>cooling</b> transformation <b>diagrams.</b> Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
