A survey of relevant literature has shown that the equipment most affected by smoke particles and gases are electronic boards. Smoke causes electronic boards to malfunction in four ways: loss of metallic contact due to chemical <b>corrosion,</b> increased short <b>circuiting</b> between the conductors, loss of mechanical contact conductivity, and reduced capacity for movement in electromechanical systems as a result of particle deposits. These effects can occur over different timescales: – In the short term, malfunctions that have critical impact in terms of plant safety occur – such as electrical short circuiting and increased contact resistance, – Mid to longer term, corrosion effects can appear. A test procedure based on the repeatability of a 20 -minute duration cable fire was set up. Temperature and smoke composition in terms of both gaseous products and soot were controlled. Tests were performed on boards designed to sum test and regulation signals, or to control an analog chain fitted with relays.

The impellers of the pump circulating MEA solution devoid of adsorbed CO 2 (hereinafter referred to as Lean MEA) was free from such damage. The Rich MEA pump impellers used in the pumps were satisfactorily performing the operation since 10 years. The problem of severe damage came to light only when new impellers replaced the old impellers as routine maintenance practice by the plant people with in one year of operation, on the contrary to those impellers, which have performed well for decade of service life. The damaged impellers and also the Rich MEA and Lean MEA solutions were subjected to investigation for determining the cause of failure. Metallography, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive spectroscopy were carried out on the damaged impellers. Some of the corrosion product found on the Rich MEA and Lean MEA impellers were characterized by chemical analysis. Electrochemical corrosion experiments were carried out on {{the old and new}} pump and impeller materials in Rich and Lean MEA solutions to determine the <b>corrosion</b> rates. Open <b>Circuit</b> Potential measurements were carried out in these solutions under dynamic condition. The results of the investigation indicated that the severe damage to the Rich MEA impeller was due to graphitic corrosion. The graphitic corrosion is imparted by anion impurity build up in Rich MEA solution and also through galvanic corrosion effected by electrical coupling of the new impeller to the old casing of the Rich MEA pump body...|$|R
