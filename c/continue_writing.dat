5|$|Written by Marc Platt, this {{unsolicited}} {{story was}} submitted to script editor Robert Holmes in late 1975 {{and dealt with}} a sentient star using the Time Lord libraries {{as a means of}} invading Gallifrey. Holmes felt that it lacked action and drama, and was in need of a proper antagonist. Even so, Robert Holmes thought that Fires of the Starmind had more potential than most of the other amateur submissions and he encouraged Marc Platt to <b>continue</b> <b>writing.</b> Fires of the Starmind was rejected on 15 December.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia. Godwin was further {{inspired}} by her mother's determination to <b>continue</b> <b>writing</b> after having a second child. According to Godwin, {{much of her time}} growing up was spent in the newsroom, where her mother worked. She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish the things her mother could not. As Cole's salary increased {{and he was able to}} support the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not writing at all.|$|E
5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay {{received}} numerous {{letters from}} fans of Allah jang Palsoe, spurring him to <b>continue</b> <b>writing.</b> Considering the play {{too difficult for}} native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, {{was inspired by a}} friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading Allah jang Palsoe.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Cooder {{recorded}} Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down {{after being}} {{inspired by a}} headline about bankers and other affluent people profiting from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late-2000s. Released in August to critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to <b>continue</b> <b>writing</b> more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore. In June 2012, he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter's road trip across the United States, speaking out to people in towns {{about the state of}} the nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Eisenberg {{reunited with}} Woody Harrelson for the magician heist film thriller Now You See Me, playing a world-famous {{close-up}} magician and street performer recruited into a secret group of elite magicians {{to pull off}} bank heists with magic tricks, redistributing the money from a wealthy businessman (Michael Caine) to victims of his corrupt capitalist schemes. That year he announced his plan to <b>continue</b> <b>writing,</b> for both stage and screen, as well as continuing to act. He debuted his second play, The Revisionist, and starred in Richard Ayoade's drama, The Double (2013), which was shot in 2012.

5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to <b>continue</b> <b>writing</b> in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E

5|$|The {{resignation}} in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who {{had been}} elected governor of New Hampshire, left a brief interim opening to be filled by the state legislature. With Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose John Page to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce {{was elected to the}} full term, to commence in March 1837, becoming at age 32 one of the youngest members in Senate history to that point. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while Jane continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring a sinecure as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to <b>continue</b> <b>writing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Once again, rumors swirled {{about the}} band's {{imminent}} demise.

They had previously pitched the series, unsuccessfully, to DC before writing Outcasts.

He joined the Nightcrawlers Car Club and became secretary of the group in 1956.

25|$|The band {{recorded}} and completed their Terry Date-produced album, tentatively titled Eros, in 2008, {{and it was}} expected to be released in early 2009.

Vega, a close friend of the band, had previously filled in for Cheng during tours in 1999.

25|$|Within a {{few years}} Burnett became well known in Washington society and hosted a {{literary}} salon on Tuesday evenings, often attended by politicians, {{as well as local}} literati. Swan's practice grew and had a good reputation, but his income lagged behind hers, so she believed she had to <b>continue</b> <b>writing.</b> Unfortunately she was often ill and suffered from the heat of D.C., which she escaped whenever possible. In the early 1880s she became interested in Christian Science as well as Spiritualism and Theosophy. These beliefs would have an effect on her later life as well as being incorporated into her later fiction. She was a devoted mother and took great joy in her two sons. She doted on their appearance, continuing the practice of curling their long hair each day, which became the inspiration for Little Lord Fauntleroy.|$|E
