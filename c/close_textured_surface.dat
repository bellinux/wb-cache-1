40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} demonstrated that <b>textured</b> <b>closed</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{which are made}} out of perfect electric conductors (PECs) can mimic highly localized surface plasmons (LSPs). Here, we propose an effective medium which can accurately model LSP resonances in a two-dimensional periodically decorated PEC cylinder. The accuracy of previous models is limited to structures with deep-subwavelength and high number of grooves. However, we show that our model can successfully predict the ultra-sharp LSP resonances which exist in structures with relatively lower number of grooves. Such resonances are not correctly predictable with previous models that give some spurious resonances. The success of the proposed model is indebted to the incorporation of an effective surface conductivity which is created at the interface of the cylinder and the homogeneous medium surrounding the structure. This surface conductivity models the effect of higher diffracted orders which are excited in the periodic structure. The validity of the proposed model is verified by full-wave simulations...|$|R
30|$|<b>Textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{are widely}} used in {{engineering}} components as they can improve tribological properties of sliding contacts, while the detailed behaviors of nanoscale reciprocating sliding contacts of <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> are still lack of study. By using multiscale method, two dimensional nanoscale reciprocating sliding contacts of <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> are investigated. The influence of indentation depth, texture shape, texture spacing, and tip radius on the average friction forces and the running-in stages is studied. The {{results show that the}} lowest indentation depth can make all the four <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> reach steady state. Surfaces with right-angled trapezoid textures on the right side are better for reducing the running-in stage, and surfaces with right-angled trapezoid textures on the left side are better to reduce wear. Compared with other <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the total average friction forces can be reduced by 82.94 %– 91.49 % for the case of the contact between the tip with radius R[*]=[*] 60 r 0 and the isosceles trapezoid <b>textured</b> <b>surface.</b> Besides, the total average friction forces increase with the tip radii due to that bigger tip will induce higher contact areas. This research proposes a detailed study on nanoscale reciprocating sliding contacts of <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces,</b> to contribute to design <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces,</b> reduce friction and wear.|$|R

In order to meet these requirements, we adopted surface engineering approach, namely, a functionalization of tool surfaces by textures.

The aim {{is to be able}} to measure the <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> with a high degree of accuracy. For this, we use a color digital sensor and principles of color photometric stereo. This method uses a single color image, instead of a sequence of gray-scale images, to recover the surface of the three dimensions. It can thus be integrated into dynamic systems where there is significant relative motion between the object and camera.

30|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} the Si texture surface {{as a part}} of paraboloid and developed a model for surface reflection of paraboloid texture surfaces. This model was used to predict the reflectance as a function of wavelength and h/D ratio for the paraboloid <b>textured</b> Si <b>surface.</b> This model considers the reflection from the entire solar spectrum, bulk absorption, and the contribution of the rear surface to light trapping. In the case of parabola, there is more possibility that the light could be concentrated inside the Si solar cell compared to the hemispherical, random pyramidal, and regular pyramidal <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces.</b> For hemispherical or pyramidal <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the maximum h/D value can reach 0.5, whereas in paraboloid <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the maximum h/D value can reach a maximum of 4 or even more by anisotropic chemical etching.|$|R

40|$|Background: {{standing}} on <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> or wearing <b>textured</b> shoe insoles can alter balance performance. This evidence, although inconclusive, offers a potential intervention for improving balance in older adults. This study explored {{the effect of}} {{standing on}} <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> on double-limb balance in older adults and changes in muscle activity as a possible mechanism of effect. Methods: 50 healthy older adults (29 female, age mean [1 SD] 75. 1 [5. 0]) stood quietly in six conditions—eyes open and closed on two different <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> and a smooth surface control. Mediolateral sway, anterior-posterior sway and centre of pressure velocity were extracted from a force platform and lower limb muscle activity collected using surface electromyography (EMG) over 30 s. Results: for mediolateral range with eyes closed, there was a statistically significant effect of texture (F [2, 47] = 3. 840, P = 0. 033). This was attributed to a 9. 2 % decrease with Texture 1 compared with Control. No such effects were seen in any other balance variable or lower limb EMG activity for either visual condition. Conclusion: the results suggest an effect of standing on <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> on mediolateral sway in older adults, supporting further work to develop the therapeutic benefits of <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> as an intervention to improve balance...|$|R

The fluid dynamic models of four <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> are constructed in various profile geometries. Computational fluid dynamics {{is used to}} study the friction factors and drag reduction properties with various flow speeds on the <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The friction coefficient varieties in the interface between the fluid and the <b>textured</b> <b>surface</b> are examined according to the simulation of the four geometries with V-shaped, saw tooth, rectangular, and semi-circular sections.

Moreover, the simulation results of the velocity, shear stress, energy, and turbulence effect on the V-shaped groove surface are presented in comparison with those of the smooth surface to illustrate the drag reduction mechanism. The results indicate that the peaks of the V-shaped grooves inhibit the lateral movement of the turbulent flow and generate the secondary vortex, which {{plays a key role in}} the impeding momentum exchange, thereby decreasing turbulent bursting intensity and reducing shear stress in the near-wall flow field. The kinetic energy and turbulence analysis shows that the vortex in the near-wall flow field on the <b>textured</b> <b>surface</b> is more stable compared to that on the smooth surface.|$|R
