40|$|International audienceInterlayer shear {{weakness}} zone (ISWZ) is {{a widespread}} zonal weak geotechnical system with variable thickness in rock masses, representing a potential threat to the overall stability of structure constructed on or within the rock mass due to their relatively poor mechanical properties. Its shear behaviour depends on both the interlayer soil and the interlayer soil/host rock interface (soil/rock interface). In this study a dynamic approach is adopted by treating ISWZ as an unfilled joint (rock/rock interface) that is increasingly filled with <b>interlayer</b> soil <b>of</b> variable thickness. Based on the available experimental data, a simple shear strength model is developed, capable of describing both the shear behaviours <b>of</b> <b>interlayer</b> soil and soil/rock interface.

In order to evaluate the variation <b>of</b> <b>interlayer</b> spacings, the method required only relative values of Fourier coefficients, without he correction for instrumental broadening, which {{was the source of}} one of the moist critical problems previously. Instead of Ka radiation, K/ 3 radiation was used to record line profiles ince difficulties associated with the separation of Kal and Kaz radiations could not be overcome satis-factorily.

It {{has been suggested that}} the sites of layer charge deficiencies may also have an influence upon the amount of hydration that can take place in the <b>interlayers</b> <b>of</b> expandable clay minerals. If the interlayer cation-to-layer bonds are considered as ideally electrostatic, the magnitude of the forces resisting expansion may be expressed as a form of Coulomb's law. If this effect is significant, expandable structures in which the charge-deficiency sites are predominantly in the tetrahedral sheet should have less pronounced swelling properties than should structures possessing charge deficiencies located primarily in the octahedral sheet. Three samples that differed in location of layer charge sites were selected for study. An important selection criterion was a non-correlation between tetrahedral charge sites and high surface-charge density, and between octahedral charge sites and low surface-charge d nsity. The effects <b>of</b> differences in <b>interlayer</b> cation composition were eliminated by saturating portions of each sample with the same cations. Equilibrium (001) d values at controlled constant humidities were used as a measure of the relative degree <b>of</b> <b>interlayer</b> hydration. Although no correlation could be made between the degree <b>of</b> <b>interlayer</b> hydration and total surface-charge d nsity, the investigation does not eliminate total surface-charge density as being significant to the swelling properties of three-sheet clay-mineral structures. The results do indicate a correlation between more intense xpandability and predominance ofcharge deficiencies inthe octa-hedral sheet.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{effects of}} pH and {{time on the}} {{formation}} of hydroxy-Al, Fe, and Mg interlayer were compared for montmorillonite and vermiculite. The stability <b>of</b> <b>interlayers</b> was evaluated by sequentially increasing the severity of dissolution treatments and by subjecting the inter-layers to an HC 1 treatment. The interlayer formation and stability were evaluated by X-ray diffraction analysis and CEC measurements. In montmorillonite, aluminum interlayers were formed at all pH levels. Systems equilibrated in acid media exhibited the greatest degree <b>of</b> <b>interlayering</b> and the resulting material showed the essential X-ray diffraction characteristics of chlorite. However, the amount <b>of</b> <b>interlayers</b> decreased after six months and one year. Those inter-layers formed in alkaline media exhibited increased interlayering after one year. Boiling Na₂CO₃ and particularly boiling NaOH generally removed part <b>of</b> <b>interlayers.</b> This removal was more pronounced for neutral and alkaline media than for acid media. The interlayer formed in alkaline conditions showed the highest stability to HC 1 treatment, whereas that formed in acid medium was the least stable. In vermiculite, aluminum interlayers were also greater for acid than for alkaline media. In contrast to montmorillonite, the amount <b>of</b> <b>interlayer</b> in vermiculite in acid media increased with time. For alkaline media there was some increase in the inter-layering after six months followed by decrease after one year. As the severity of dissolution treatments increased the degree of collapse increased. However, chloritic components, in addition to dominant collapsible components, were evident after NaOH treatment for systems formed at intermediate pH levels. The stability to the HC 1 treatment decreased toward alkaline media. Moderate amounts <b>of</b> iron <b>interlayers</b> were formed in montmorillonite at all pH levels. The interlayers did not inhibit expansion on solvation but the systems exhibited moderate resistance to collapse. Diffraction patterns were characterized by diffuse peaks and plateaus suggesting mixed layer systems. Some reorganization or decrease <b>of</b> <b>interlayers</b> occurred after equilibration for one year. The interlayers were partially removed by dissolution treatments. Interlayers formed at intermediate pH values were, presumably, more stable than those formed in other media. Iron interlayers from all media exhibited a high stability to the HC 1 treatments. Iron interlayers in vermiculite were favored by alkaline environments. Formation was greatest after ten days and less after six months or one year. Iron removal and particularly boiling NaOH treatments resulted in resolution of collapsible and non-collapsible components. In the latter case, definite chlorite lines were observed. The interlayer from alkaline media exhibited somewhat higher stability to sequential treatments than those from other media. The HC 1 treatments removed more interlayer from acid media than from alkaline media. Magnesium interlayers in montmorillonite and vermiculite were formed only in alkaline environments (pH > 10). After ten days, in both systems, the degree <b>of</b> <b>interlayers</b> formation decreased as the pH increased. The montmorillonite system showed only a slight dissolution <b>of</b> <b>interlayers</b> after 6 months and one year, whereas a strong interlayer decrease was observed for the vermiculite system. The interlayered montmorillonite formed at an initial pH of 11 became nearly amorphous to X-ray diffraction following a 6 -month period. The boiling NaOH treatment produced a partial resolution of the montmorillonite system into collapsible and non-collapsible components. In vermiculite, the second dithionite-citrate removed most <b>of</b> the <b>interlayers</b> and induced {{a high degree of}} collapse and a high CEC. The boiling NaOH treatment resolved a small 14 A[superscript °] component in addition to a dominant 10 A[superscript °] component after K-saturation.
