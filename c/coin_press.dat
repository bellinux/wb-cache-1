2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} God created {{humanity}} {{from one person}} in [...] to teach that Providence considers one who destroys a single person as one who has destroyed an entire world, and Providence considers one who saves a single person as one who has saved an entire world. And God created humanity from one person {{for the sake of}} peace, so that none can say that their ancestry is greater than another's. And God created humanity from one person so that heretics cannot say that there are many gods who created several human souls. And God created humanity from one person to demonstrate God's greatness, for people stamp out many coins with one <b>coin</b> <b>press</b> and they all look alike, but God stamped each person with the seal of Adam, and not one of them is like another. Therefore, every person is obliged to say, [...] "For my sake the world was created.". It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Meir used to say that the dust of the first man (from which [...] reports God made Adam) was gathered {{from all parts of the}} earth, for [...] says of God, [...] "Your eyes did see my unformed substance," [...] and [...] says, [...] "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth.".|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} {{that housed the}} mint was the first designed by Alfred B. Mullett after he became Supervising Architect of the Department of the Treasury.

[...] The simple Renaissance Revival-style stone facade has pairs of round-headed windows and a center portico. It is now the home of the Nevada State Museum. Although the mint has not struck United States coins since 1893, <b>Coin</b> <b>Press</b> No. 1 (the original <b>coin</b> <b>press</b> from the mint) is still in the building and used to strike commemorative medallions with the [...] "CC" [...] mint mark.

50|$|Mestrelle {{offered his}} {{services}} to the English court, and he was authorised by Elizabeth {{to set up the}} first <b>coin</b> <b>press</b> in England. Machine-struck, or milled, coinage was hitherto unknown in England, as all previously produced coins had been hammered. By June 1560 he was beginning to assemble the material needed for his machinery, and soon started working at the Tower Mint with the mint official William Blunt to produce coins which met all the necessary standards. Mestrelle's machinery began producing coins sometime after 8 November 1560, initially producing shillings, groats and half groats. During 1561 a number of gold half-pounds and crowns were also minted, though {{it is not clear whether}} these were pattern coins or coins minted for circulation, but it has been suggested these coins were minted in conjunction with the queen's visit to the mint.|$|E
50|$|Before milled coinage gained {{precedence}} in Europe, {{the irregular}} and crude hammered coinage was {{relatively easy to}} counterfeit and subject to clipping, an act which involved removing valuable metal {{from the edge of}} a coin before placing it back into circulation. In the sixteenth century, the French engineer Aubin Olivier introduced to France the <b>coin</b> <b>press,</b> to which he added a split collar capable of creating edge lettering. In order to remove the newly struck coin, the collar had to be disassembled, which was a time-consuming process. In addition, the upper coinage die was prone to strike the collar on its descent, causing expensive damage. Peter Blondeau addressed those concerns when, in 1649, he was summoned to the Royal Mint in England to modernise minting operations there. Blondeau introduced a method for edge lettering which he claimed was considerably faster and less costly than the earlier, well-known technology, but he maintained secrecy in regards to the device.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855, {{he resumed}} {{the work of}} his father, {{including}} engravings for French postage stamps. Barre, unlike his father, did not work well with Anatole Hulot the contractor responsible for printing the stamps. Hulot was an expert at electroplating, and utilized that technique to make the printing plates for the stamps. To compete with this technique for the reproduction of images on the printing plates, Barre embarked on striking tests with coining presses between 1858 and 1859. He produced, on the order of the Committee on Coins, test types of the Ceres stamp. In the end, Hulot retained the contract by lowering his prices. In 1861, thanks to the delay of Hulot, the technique of using the <b>coin</b> <b>press,</b> however, allowed Barre to take the contract to produce printing plates of the first postage stamps of Greece. [...] Barre had designed the drawing and the dies for the new Hermes type, a few months prior. In 1876, he provided the same work for the creation of two additional stamps.|$|E
