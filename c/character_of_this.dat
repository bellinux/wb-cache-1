With the course passing over numerous different surfaces, including tram tracks and cobblestones, the peloton collectively protested racing this course, and as such it was neutralized, with everyone receiving {{the same time as}} the stage winner and no points were awarded for the points classification as had been planned. There were also parked cars at the side of the road in many places, forcing the riders into narrow tunnels to get through them.|$|E

5|$|Samarium is a {{rare earth}} metal having a {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those of}} zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close-packed (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions.|$|E

In Plautus there almost always a break (diaeresis) {{in the middle of the}} line. Unless the diaeresis (central break) is omitted, then by Meyer's law there is always a short syllable in the penultimate place before the break. At the end of the line there is always a stress on the penultimate element.|$|E

25|$|Arnobius {{writes that}} Fontus {{was the son}} of Janus and Juturna. The name itself proves that this is a {{secondary}} form of Fons modelled on Janus, denouncing the late <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> myth: it was probably conceived because of the proximity of the festivals of Juturna (11 January) and the Agonium of Janus (9 January) {{as well as for the}} presence of an altar of Fons near the Janiculum and the closeness of the notions of spring and of beginning.|$|E

25|$|The first, {{descriptive}} task naturally {{requires a}} clarification of one's terms, above all, the word religion. Historians of religion have long underscored the problematic <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> term, noting that its usage {{over the centuries}} has changed in significant ways, generally {{in the direction of}} reification. The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary. With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology {{over the course of the}} 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be measured, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians. Factor analysis was also brought into play by both psychologists and sociologists of religion, in an effort to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other postmodern viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|Masks in Mexico {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of dance, ceremony, festivals and theatre, with their wearing not {{separate}} from the event in which they are used. The most common uses are with traditional dances, which are a form of theater, with characters, storyline and music, but the performers are not professionals. The purpose of the masks it convert participants into other beings or characters. This element is so important in many events that if a dancer does not use a mask, he often wears dark glasses to indicate that he is not his normal self. A double sense of masking is to use dark glasses over a mask. With few exceptions, dances are performed by males, who play female roles wearing masks. The reason for this is that it was not considered proper for women in Europe to act or dance, a prohibition brought to Mexico by the Spanish. One important <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> type is La Malinche, in dances about the Conquest.|$|E
25|$|According to Spink, the {{paintings}} in this cave, including the intrusive standing Buddhas on the pillars, were {{added in the}} 5th century. Above the pillars and also behind the stupa are colorful paintings of the Buddha with Padmapani and Vajrapani next to him, they wear jewels and necklaces, while yogis, citizens and Buddhist bhikshu are shown approaching the Buddha with garlands and offerings, with men wearing dhoti and turbans wrapped around their heads. On the walls are friezes of Jataka tales, but likely from the Hinayana phase of early construction. Some of the panels and reliefs inside as well as outside Cave 10 do not make narrative sense, but are related to Buddhist legends. This lack of narrative flow may be because these were added by different monks and official donors in the 5th century wherever empty space was available. This devotionalism and the worship hall <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cave is the likely reason why four additional shrinelets 9A, 9B, 9C and 9D were added between Cave 9 and 10.|$|E

500|$|The {{reign of}} Andriamasinavalona is remembered in Madagascar as {{a golden age}} of prosperity, justice, {{abundance}} and harmony. He is described in oral histories as a talented politician and kind and just ruler. His name is often traditionally invoked in Imerina when paying tribute to the ancestors or making a binding pledge. Regarding Andriamasinavalona's legacy, Ellis (1832) remarked, [...] "The <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> chieftain is held in the highest veneration and esteem. He {{is said to have}} exercised great care over his district, and to have introduced many important improvements. His memory, laws and customs are still held in the greatest respect, and his name is always mentioned in the public kabarys with a degree of reverence." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Sustain us, Lord {{with your}} word,), is a chorale fantasia. A {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} instrumental concerto is a four-note trumpet signal, which {{is derived from the}} beginning of the chorale melody, as if to repeat the words [...] "" [...] (Sustain us, Lord) again and again. The motif consists of the three notes of the A minor chord in the sequence A C A E, with the higher notes on the stressed syllables, the highest one on [...] "Herr". The cantus firmus of the chorale is sung by the soprano, while the other voices sing in imitation, embedded in the independent concerto of the orchestra. The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff notes that the trumpet fanfare [...] "underlines the combative, dogmatic <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> late devotional song of Luther's".|$|E
500|$|The {{division}} of the legislature into an upper and lower house wasn't questioned either, despite the obscure origins of the English House of Lords and its role as {{the representative of the}} hereditary nobility. Americans had seldom known any but bicameral legislatures, both in Britain and in most state governments. The main exceptions to this were the dysfunctional Confederation Congress and the unicameral Pennsylvania legislature, which was seen as quickly vacillating between partisan extremes after each election. Experience had convinced the delegates that an upper house was necessary to tame the passions of the lower classes against the interests of wealthy merchants and landowners. Since America had no native hereditary aristocracy, the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> upper house was designed to protect the interests of this wealthy elite, the [...] "minority of the opulent," [...] against the interests of the lower classes, who constituted the majority of the population.|$|E
