5|$|Exceptions {{to these}} naming {{patterns}} {{are found in}} languages that designate the move by making reference to a location, such as the Norwegian brassespark (Brazilian kick). This exception is most significant in Spanish, where a fierce controversy exists between Chile and Peru—as part of their historic sports rivalry—over the naming of the bicycle kick; Chileans know it as the chilenita, while Peruvians <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> chalaca. Regardless, the move is also known in Spanish by the less tendentious names of tijera and tijereta—both {{a reference to the}} manoeuvre's scissor-like motion.|$|E
5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I came to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain {{was not involved in}} the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E
5|$|Noted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as {{a notable}} {{achievement}} in cinema; Eisenstein {{went so far}} as to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> greatest film ever made. The film inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy film, The Wizard of Oz, in 1939. Another animation pioneer, Max Fleischer, decided to produce his animated feature film Gulliver's Travels in order to compete with Snow White. The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, directed by Bob Clampett, parodies Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.|$|E

It is a heap of stones and men, with a vast {{confusion}} of languages; and were the steeple not sanctified, nothing liker Babel.

It is the general mint of all famous lies, which are here like the legends of popery, first coined and stamped in the church.|$|E

25|$|It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} term missionary position arose in connection with Christian missionaries, who supposedly encouraged the sexual position in new converts in the colonial era.

When it was learned that Dodge had already reserved the Diplomat {{name for a}} planned two-door hardtop body style, Nash delved into its own past, and resurrected the Rambler name from an 1897 prototype and its first production model, in 1902. Rambler {{was also one of}} the popular early American automobile brands.|$|E

It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis of Biogenesis; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that living matter may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of Abiogenesis.|$|E
