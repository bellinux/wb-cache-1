This is helpful as calculating the free energy of solvation directly is extremely difficult. The free energy of solvation can be converted to a solubility value using various formulae, the most general case being shown below, where the numerator is the free energy of solvation, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in kelvins.|$|E
2500|$|The album's opener, [...] "Doll", {{involves}} {{the fear of}} entering into situations unprepared.

[...] "My Hero" [...] criticizes idolatry and instead extolls friends who are ordinary heroes, which has been considered a statement on fame and partially inspired by former bandmate Kurt Cobain. On the record's closing track, [...] "New Way Home," [...] Grohl longs for his hometown and recalls the drive there on Highway 99.

2500|$|For a given robot {{the only}} {{parameters}} necessary to completely locate {{the end effector}} (gripper, welding torch, etc.) of the robot are the angles {{of each of the}} joints or displacements of the linear axes (or <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> for robot formats such as SCARA). However, there are many different ways to define the points. The most common and most convenient way of defining a point is to specify a Cartesian coordinate for it, i.e. the position of the 'end effector' in mm in the X, Y and Z directions relative to the robot's origin. In addition, depending on the types of joints a particular robot may have, the orientation of the end effector in yaw, pitch, and roll and the location of the tool point relative to the robot's faceplate must also be specified. For a jointed arm these coordinates must be converted to joint angles by the robot controller and such conversions are known as Cartesian Transformations which may need to be performed iteratively or recursively for a multiple axis robot. The mathematics of the relationship between joint angles and actual spatial coordinates is called kinematics. See robot control ...|$|E
