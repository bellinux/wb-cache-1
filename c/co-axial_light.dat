40|$|Purpose: We report our {{experience}} with laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) urological procedures in children less than 5 years of age. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (11 procedures) underwent LESS through the umbilicus. Seven patients underwent nephrectomy and three patients underwent pye-loplasty (one simultaneous bilateral). R-port port (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Ireland) {{was used in}} nine cases, in one case, the Gelpoint access port (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) was used. The Olympus Endoeye camera with <b>co-axial</b> <b>light</b> cable was used. The hilum was secured in all cases with Hem-o-Lok clips (Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) except in one case in which an Endo GIA stapler (Covidien Surgical, Norwalk, CT, USA) was used. Results: All procedures were technically successful. Accessory port (3 mm) was used in 3 patients. Mean age in nephrectomized patients was 3. 14 ± 1. 7 years, the mean oper-ative room time (ORT) was 97. 5 ± 12. 54 minutes. In the pyeloplasty group, mean ORT was 192 ± 47. 16 minutes and mean age was 2. 43 ± 2. 3 years. Bilateral pyeloplasty was done in a 4 -month-old infant. The ORT {{in this case was}} 180 minutes. A follow-up reno-gram done in the pyeloplasty patients (n= 2) showed good drainage. Mean length of stay was 3. 6 days (range, 3 to 6 days). The analgesic requirement was 23. 86 mg (range, 12. 5 to 50 mg) of diclofenac sodium. Conclusions: LESS is technically feasible in patients as young as 4 months of age. It has the potential to offer better cosmesis. This needs to be proved in further comparative studies. Development of miniature instruments will further the growth of LESS in this age group...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{real-time}} depth recovery system using Light Fall-off Stereo (LFS). Our system contains two <b>co-axial</b> point <b>light</b> sources (LEDs) synchronized {{with a video}} camera. The video camera captures the scene under these two LEDs in complementary states(e. g., one on, one off). Based on the inverse square law for light intensity, the depth can be directly solved using the pixel ratio from two consecutive frames. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach {{with a number of}} real world scenes. Quantitative evaluation shows that our system compares favorably to other commercial real-time 3 D range sensors, particularly in textured areas. We believe our system offers a low-cost high-resolution alternative for depth sensing under controlled lighting. 1...|$|R
40|$|In current image-processing {{algorithms}} for face {{detection performance}} {{is not completely}} reliable, especially in situations with variable lighting, and with low-resolution images. One possible approach to implement face detection {{is the use of}} the &quot;redeye&quot; effect: the reflection produced by human eyes when exposed to <b>co-axial</b> infrared (IR) <b>light.</b> We investigated the effectiveness of the red-eye technique for variability in: skin tone, eye color, pose, angle of IR illumination, scene illumination, and the effect of shine from glasses. Algorithms were developed to detect eye locations from a single IR image. Image processing steps involved: normalization, blurring, dynamic threshold calculation, and candidate eye position validation. Average eye position estimation accuracy approaches 80 to 85 percent...|$|R
