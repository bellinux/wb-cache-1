5|$|At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has {{introduced}} the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, counters 6A, allowing passengers {{to check in}} and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are <b>currently</b> <b>available</b> at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only <b>currently</b> <b>available</b> in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, {{they would have to}} go to an airline representative at the counters.|$|E

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with <b>currently</b> <b>available</b> resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using <b>currently</b> <b>available</b> resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E

5|$|Although the European Space Agency's current Gaia {{mission was}} not {{expected}} to produce good results for stars brighter than the approximately V=6 saturation limit of the mission's instruments, actual operation has shown good performance on objects to about magnitude +3. Forced observations of brighter stars mean that final results should be available for all bright stars and a parallax for Betelgeuse will be published {{an order of magnitude}} more accurate than <b>currently</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E

5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, <b>currently</b> <b>available,</b> data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is <b>currently</b> <b>available</b> in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E

Project Glass is a research and development program by Google to develop an augmented reality head-mounted display (HMD).

5|$|Many <b>currently</b> <b>available</b> {{pharmaceuticals}} {{are derived}} from the secondary metabolites plants use {{to protect themselves from}} herbivores, including opium, aspirin, cocaine, and atropine. These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry in ways similar to that of insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the special}} edition's footage was first seen when the film made its {{broadcast}} television debut on CBS in 1989, but two additional sequences concerning Burke's transmission to the colony about the derelict, and the Jorden family's subsequent discovery of the same, {{were added to the}} initial Laserdisc release. According to Cameron, the visual effects for the scene were incomplete, so {{he went back to the}} Skotak brothers and had them finish the sequences. All <b>currently</b> <b>available</b> versions {{of the special}} edition contain these scenes.|$|E

The Fiddlers Three public house, located at Albion Street, is another older stone building with modern catering facilities.

5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. <b>Currently</b> <b>available</b> drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than NAP.|$|E

No surface details can be resolved from Earth or its orbit with any instrument <b>currently</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E
