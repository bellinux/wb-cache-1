5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault of the warehouse was filmed by three separate units. Kono's fight sequence was included to assert to the audience {{that she would be}} a valuable asset to the team. In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a shipping container was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The car would swerve away. The second take saw the car crash into the container with O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part of the sequence, McGarrett jumps over the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car. To make the scene a reality, the film crew made a three-part <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> to ensure no harm came to O'Loughlin.|$|E
25|$|The snowy {{territory}} of the final scene was shot in Stockholm, Sweden, and a <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> was created combining Stockholm's background and the Sydney Opera House. A slightly different ending was shot after the original but was not chosen as the director felt {{that it did not}} fit the film. The alternative ending became available on the DVD of Sunshine.|$|E
25|$|The most {{difficult}} {{task for the}} special effects artists to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation - to make {{the interaction between the}} humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, than running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing {{the other part of the}} frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte. The Dunning process, invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lighting, filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> in the camera. It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} shot {{digitally}} on the HDCAM format and was mostly handheld (aside {{from a few}} static <b>composite</b> <b>shots).</b>|$|R
25|$|With the {{resulting}} aliasing, and the progressive scan {{transfer of the}} video to DVD, this has created a number of visual flaws throughout the widescreen release. In particular, quality has been noted to drop significantly in <b>composite</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|R
500|$|For {{the first}} time in their career, Genesis filmed promotional videos for their songs. The first to be filmed was the title track, which {{features}} the band playing to the song together around a piano, including <b>composite</b> <b>shots</b> of a miniature Collins hopping around on a piano and a guitar. The group also produced promotional films of [...] "Ripples..." [...] and [...] "Robbery, Assault and Battery".|$|R
500|$|One of {{the first}} scenes Asylum was given was the scene {{depicting}} the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland [...] was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a computer generated (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames. Another <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> {{is used in the}} scene in which Chelsea is hit by a speedboat. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.|$|E
5000|$|In the Spring 2006 he co-authored the vaudevillian {{production}} [...] "Point Of Revue", a <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> of African American {{through a}} collection of short plays and original songs, with a several artists including Kia Corthron, Don Cheadle and Lynn Nottage.|$|E
50|$|The movie {{includes}} {{scenes from}} numerous shuttle missions, {{beginning with the}} dawn landing of Discovery at Kennedy Space Centers Shuttle Landing Facility upon the conclusion of STS-51-A. A <b>composite</b> <b>shot,</b> the finished sequence is composed of footage from Discoverys landing, radio transmissions from Challengers 1984 landing on STS-41-B, and runway approach footage filmed from a fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
50|$|After the {{completion}} of principal shooting, a special effects team of eighty people at ILM studios in northern California worked eight months in producing 160 <b>composite</b> <b>shots</b> of the dragon. Chris Walas sculpted and operated the dragon head used for close-up shots. The model was animated {{by a combination of}} radio controls, cable controls, air bladders, levers and by hand, thus giving the illusion of a fully coordinated face {{with a wide range of}} expression. Real WW2 era flamethrowers were used for the dragons fire breathing effects.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{incorporated}} over 1400 <b>composite</b> effect <b>shots.</b> It featured Brittney Powell, Tom Konkle, David Beeler, Benton Jennings, Mary Cseh, Steve Tom, Jim Woods, Mark Teich, Ransford Doherty. A single {{season and}} eleven episodes were filmed. [...] A 3D {{version of the}} show was released in 2010.|$|R
25|$|The {{station and}} nearby MetLife Plaza were a regular CG <b>composite</b> as {{location}} <b>shots</b> between scenes in ABC series Ugly Betty.|$|R
50|$|The snowy {{territory}} of the final scene was shot in Stockholm, Sweden, and a <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> was created combining Stockholm's background and the Sydney Opera House.

5000|$|Time Sculpture is a British {{television}} and cinema advertisement launched in 2008 to promote Toshiba's high-definition television upscaling {{technology in the}} United Kingdom. The piece, which comprised a series of short sequences of movements composited into a single sixty-second continuous loop, {{is the first in}} the [...] "Projects" [...] line of commercials, created by advertising agency Grey London with the intention of breaking a world record with each successive element. Time Sculpture holds the Guinness World Record for the greatest number of moving image cameras in a <b>composite</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Concentration {{of force}} into a smaller area was {{initially}} attained by replacing the single metal (usually steel) {{shot with a}} <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> using two metals, a heavy core (based on tungsten) inside a lighter metal outer shell. These designs were known either as armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR), high-velocity armor-piercing (HVAP) and [...] "hartkern" [...] (hard core) (resp. by the British, US and Germans). On impact, the core had a much more concentrated effect than plain metal shot of the same weight and size. However, the air resistance and other effects {{were the same as}} for the shell of identical size.|$|E
40|$|In {{next-generation}} virtual 3 D simulation, training, {{and entertainment}} environments, intelligent visualization interfaces must respond to user-specified viewing requests so users can follow salient {{points of the}} action and monitor the relative locations of objects. Users {{should be able to}} indicate which object(s) to view, how each should be viewed, cinematic style and pace, and how to respond when a single satisfactory view is not possible. When constraints fail, weak constraints can be relaxed or multi-shot solutions can be displayed in sequence or as <b>composite</b> <b>shots</b> with simultaneous viewports. To address these issues, we have developed CONSTRAINTCAM, a real-time camera visualization interface for dynamic 3 D worlds. It has been studied in an interactive testbed in which users can issue viewing goals to monitor multiple autonomous characters navigating through a virtual cityscape. CONSTRAINT~AMâ€™S real-time performance in this testbed is encouraging...|$|R
5000|$|The {{overall length}} of the 37mm M-74 AP-T (Armor-Piercing shot with Tracer) and M-51 APCBC-T (Armor-Piercing <b>Composite</b> Ballistic-Capped <b>shot</b> with Tracer) armor-piercing {{projectiles}} used in the M3A1, M5A1, and M6 tank and antitank guns (37 x 223R mm), was too great to permit their use in the M4 gun. The 37 mm (1.46 in) M80 AP-T shot was developed and standardized.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, Aardman {{have used}} stop-motion for their {{animated}} features, {{but it is}} complex to render water with this technique, and using real water can damage plasticine models. It would have been expensive to <b>composite</b> CGI into <b>shots</b> that include water, {{of which there are}} many in the movie, so they chose to make Flushed Away their first all-CGI production. This is the third of three Aardman-produced films released by DreamWorks. Aardman's experience with DreamWorks during the making of the film led to a split between the two studios.|$|R
5000|$|The glowing-eye effect, {{when the}} {{children}} used their mental powers, was achieved by creating animated overlays of a bright white iris; this created a bright glowing iris with a black pupil when optically printed into the film. This technique was used mostly on freeze frames to create the required effect; the only sequence of live motion processed in this way was the scene in which David tells Alan Bernard to [...] "leave us alone" [...] where the eye effect appears as David speaks. The other time David's eyes go from normal to glowing on screen (after one of the girl children is nearly run down by a car), a two shot of the girl and David, is a <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> split by a slightly jagged black line; the half with the girl is live motion, {{and you can see}} her hair moving in the breeze, whereas the half with David is a freeze frame with the eye effect added.|$|E
50|$|A {{buffering}} material, such as granulated plastic, sawdust, {{or similar}} material can be {{mixed with the}} shot to fill the spaces between the individual pellets. When fired, the buffering material compresses and supports the shot, reducing the deformation the shot pellets experience under the extreme acceleration. Antimony-lead alloys, copper plated lead shot, steel, bismuth, and tungsten <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> all have a hardness {{greater than that of}} plain lead shot, and will deform less as well. Reducing the deformation will result in tighter patterns, as the spherical pellets tend to fly straighter. One improvised method for achieving the same effect involves pouring molten wax or tar into the mass of shot. Another is a partial ring cut around the case intended to ensure that the shot comes out tightly bunched along with the portion of the case forward of the cut, creating a 'cut-shell'. This can be dangerous, as it is thought to cause higher chamber pressuresâ€”especially if part of the shell remains behind in the barrel and is not cleared before another shot is fired.|$|E

5000|$|A warlike people, the Scythians were {{particularly}} {{known for their}} equestrian skills, and their early use of <b>composite</b> bows <b>shot</b> from horseback. With great mobility, the Scythians could absorb the attacks of more cumbersome footsoldiers and cavalry, just retreating into the steppes. Such tactics wore down their enemies, making them easier to defeat. The Scythians were notoriously aggressive warriors. They [...] "fought to live and lived to fight" [...] and [...] "drank the blood of their enemies and used the scalps as napkins."Ruled by small numbers of closely allied Ã©lites, Scythians {{had a reputation for}} their archers, and many gained employment as mercenaries. Scythian Ã©lites had kurgan tombs: high barrows heaped over chamber-tombs of larch-wood - a deciduous conifer that may have had special significance as a tree of life-renewal, for it stands bare in winter. Burials at Pazyryk in the Altay Mountains have included some spectacularly preserved Scythians of the [...] "Pazyryk culture" [...] - including the Ice Maiden of the 5th century BC.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sudden death}} of the show's star George Reeves in June 1959 was {{not the end of}} the series either, in the producers' eyes. When Jack Larson {{returned}} from Europe after the death of Reeves, producers suggested the series could continue as [...] "Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen," [...] with more focus on Larson continuing his character, playing opposite a [...] "Superman" [...] who would be a <b>composite</b> of stock <b>shots</b> of George Reeves and a look-alike stunt double to be filmed from behind. Larson rejected the distasteful idea out of hand, and the series was truly over.|$|R
50|$|Alex Cox had {{attempted}} to get a Repo Man sequel, titled Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday, produced in the mid-'90s, but the project fell apart, with the script adapted into a graphic novel of the same name. For his next micro-feature, he wrote a fresh attempt at a Repo follow-up, although it contained no recurring characters, so as to preserve Universal's rights to the original. Repo Chick was filmed entirely against a green screen, with backgrounds of digital <b>composites,</b> live action <b>shots,</b> and miniatures matted in afterwards, to produce an artificial look. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival on 9 September 2009.|$|R
5000|$|While {{it proved}} fairly popular with consumers, {{attracting}} over 500,000 views on video sharing website YouTube {{in its first}} week, reactions to the commercial from critics was mixed. Many comparisons were made with other [...] "bullet time" [...] works such as The Matrix, and criticisms were leveled that the piece lacked a [...] "big idea". However, others were more complimentary; Noel Bussey of Campaign magazine commented: [...] "Brave, interesting and expertly realised, this is {{a breath of fresh}} air, and a call to arms from an agency that has struggled with having a reputation for not doing interesting creative." [...] The publication later went on to name it one of the top ten advertisements of 2008. This was not the last honour Time Sculpture would receive from the advertising industry; {{over the next few months}} it received honours from at the D&AD Awards, the Clio Awards, and the Midsummer Awards. In 2009, it was recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records for having used the highest number of moving image cameras in a <b>composite</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The next {{sequence}} {{begins with}} shots of buildings and {{a shot of}} a sunset reflected in the glass of a skyscraper. The sequence uses time-lapse photography of the activity of modern life. The events captured in this sequence involve people interacting with modern technology. The first shots are traffic patterns as seen from skyscrapers at night. This {{is followed by a}} <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> of the moon passing behind a skyscraper. The next shots are closer shots of cars on a highway. The sun rises over the city and we see people hurrying to work. The film shows at regular speed the operation of machines packaging food. People are shown sorting mail, sewing jeans, manufacturing televisions and doing other jobs with the use of modern technology. A shot of hot dogs being sent down rows of conveyors is followed by a shot of people moving up escalators. The frenetic speed and pace of the cuts and background music do not slow as shots of modern leisure are shown. People eat, play, shop and work at the same speed. The sequence begins to come full circle as the manufacture of cars in an assembly line factory is shown.|$|E

50|$|Brady's Bend, {{also known}} as Bradys Bend, is named for Captain Samuel Brady (1756-1795), famed {{frontier}} scout {{and the subject of}} many legends. The photo is a <b>composite</b> of three <b>shots</b> taken about 1,400 ft. above sea level. Near this location on the Allegheny River in Western Pennsylvania June 1779â€”in what was then Seneca territory - Brady led a force seeking to redress the killing of a settler and her four children, and the taking of two children as prisoners. The force surrounded a party of seven Indiansâ€”apparently both Seneca and Munsee - killing their leader (a Munsee warrior) and freeing the two children.|$|R
40|$|In media production, previsualization is an {{important}} step. It allows the director and the production crew to see {{an estimate of the}} final product during the filmmaking process. This work focuses on a previsualization system for <b>composite</b> <b>shots</b> which involve real and virtual content. It shows the camera operator a correct perspective view of how the real objects in front of him look placed in a virtual space. The aim is to simplify the workflow, reduce production time and allow more direct control of the end result. The real scene is shot with a 3 D scene capture device, which combines an RGB color camera with time-of-flight depth camera. The deviceâ€™s pose is tracked using a motion capture system. Depth-based segmentation is applied to remove the background and content outside the desired volume, the captured geometry is aligned with a stream from the RGB color camera and a dynamic point cloud of the remaining real scene contents is created. The virtual objects are then also transformed into the coordinate space of the tracked camera, and the resulting composite view is rendered accordingly. The prototype camera system is implemented as a self-contained unit with local processing. A prototype system was constructed from a Microsoft Kinect v 2, providing depth and color information of the real scene and a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 as a processing and display device. Both instruments were attached to a camera shoulder mount, with optical markers fixed to the body of the camera. The pose of the camera in 3 D space is tracked with a Natural Point OptiTrack motion capture system, which streams the location information to the Surface device over a wireless 802. 11 n channel. At its current state, the system is running at 15 frames per second with a resolution of 1024 x 768. Subjectively, the frame rate is already smooth enough for the operator to feel as if using a regular camera. Further improvements are targeted in the processing speed and the image quality provided by the system. The image suffers from some depth capture related artifacts which influence the depth segmentation, and therefore adaptive filtering methods based on edge-aware bilateral filtering have been investigated. The tested filtering has improved the quality significantly, while more effort has to be put in implementing the filtering in an efficient way...|$|R
50|$|The {{producers}} used Asylum Visual Effects {{to create}} digital effects for Friday the 13th. Although director Marcus Nispel is {{a proponent of}} practical effects, Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members {{to work on the}} visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film.One of the first scenes Asylum was given was the scene depicting the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a computer generated (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames. Another <b>composite</b> <b>shot</b> is used in the scene in which Chelsea is hit by a speedboat. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.|$|E

50|$|A 6-pounder gun {{accounted}} for the first Tigers disabled in North Africa; two Tigers falling to towed 6 pounder AT Guns, 48 RTR knocked out the first Tigers by the Western Allies in tank vs. tank action with their Churchills destroying two Tiger I (the same unit also knocked out the first Panther tanks by the Western Allies in May 1944 in Italy). The North Irish Horse knocked out and captured Tiger 131 after the crew had abandoned it following it receiving several hits. The situation was somewhat improved {{by the development of}} more sophisticated ammunition {{in the form of the}} Armour-Piercing, <b>Composite</b> Rigid (APCR) <b>shot</b> and the Armour-Piercing, Discarding Sabot (APDS) shot, which was available from 1944 and made it effective in fighting the Tiger I and Panther tanks frontally.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process is}} also {{commonly}} used when duplication of an element which cannot be physically duplicated is required; motion control {{is the primary}} method of featuring multiple instances of the same actor in a shot that involves camera movement. For this technique, the camera typically films exactly the same motion {{in exactly the same}} location while the actor performs different parts. A blank take (with no actor in the shot) is sometimes also taken to give compositors a reference of what parts of the shot are different in each take. This, in common film-making language, is also known as shooting a [...] "plate". In today's film, the reference take is also useful for digital manipulation of the shots, or for adding digital elements. A simple duplication shot confines each [...] "copy" [...] of an element to one part of the screen. It is far more difficult to <b>composite</b> the <b>shots</b> when the duplicate elements cross paths, though digital technology has made this easier to achieve. Several basic camera tricks are sometimes utilized with this technique, such as having the hand of a body double enter a shot to interact with the actor while the duplicate's arm is to be off-screen. For the sake of compositing, the background elements of the scene must remain identical between takes, requiring anything movable to be locked down; the blank reference take can aid in resolving any discrepancies between the other shots.|$|R
40|$|The book {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the principles of the techniques, and examples of their applications to a range of materials and engineering problems. It contains 20 papers from leading international experts in residual stress analysis, covering the theoretical basis of stress analysis by diffraction methods, the practical implementation of the methods, and examples of key areas of application. Applications include the determination of internal stresses in weldments, in <b>composite</b> materials, following <b>shot</b> peening, and in ceramics. Problems in making measurements on textured samples are discussed. The book will be useful for engineers and scientists who work in any field where residual stresses are of importance, and for anyone involved with the application of neutron or synchrotron radiation for stress management. As the techniques become a basic component of the measurement toolkit for stress analysis, an appreciation of the practicalities and limitations of these methods in practice will be important throughout a range of engineering and scientific fields...|$|R
