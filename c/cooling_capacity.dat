5|$|Titan's {{components}} are air-cooled by heat sinks, {{but the air}} is chilled before being pumped through the cabinets. Fan noise is so loud that hearing protection is required for people spending more than 15 minutes in the machine room.

5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity,</b> one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E

25|$|The {{modified}} aircraft {{known as}} the Douglas World Cruiser (DWC), powered by a 420hp Liberty L-12 engine, also {{was the first major}} project at Douglas for Jack Northrop. Northrop designed the fuel system for the series. The conversion involved incorporating a total of six fuel tanks in wings and fuselage. For greater range, the total fuel capacity went from 115 gallons (435 liters) to 644 gallons (2,438 liters). Other changes from the DT involved having increased <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity,</b> as well as adding two separate tanks for oil and water. To ensure a more robust structure, a tubular steel fuselage, strengthened bracing, a modified wing of 49ft (15 m) wingspan and larger rudder were required. The dual cockpits for the pilot and copilot/crewman were also located more closely together with a cutout in the upper wing to increase visibility.|$|E

2500|$|The Evolution Series {{locomotives}} {{are visually}} {{similar to the}} AC4400CW, although small differences are evident. [...] The most noticeable difference is the radiator section {{at the rear of}} the locomotive is larger to accommodate the GEVO's Air to air intercoolers. As with the AC6000CW the radiators project beyond the end of the hood, though not to the same extent, as the Evolution Series protrudes only a few inches out. Also, unlike previous GE locomotives, the grilles under the radiator are at two different angles. The increase in radiator size is due to the necessity for greater <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> in the locomotive in order to reduce emissions. [...] The other major difference between the Evolution Series and earlier models are the vents below the radiators, which are larger than those on previous GE locomotives.

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{describes}} {{experimental study}} and performance improvement of 2 stage Gifford-McMahon (G-M) type pulse tube cryocooler for cryopump. The {{objective of this}} study is to improve the efficiency of 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler for substituting 2 stage G-M cryocooler used in cryopump. The target <b>cooling</b> <b>capacities</b> are 5 W at 20 K and 35 W at 80 K for the 1 st and the 2 nd stage, respectively. These values are good <b>cooling</b> <b>capacities</b> for vacuum level in medium size ICP 200 cryopump. Design of the 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler is conducted by FZKPTR(Forschungs Zentrum Karlsruhe Pulse Tube Refrigerator) program. In order to improve the performance of 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler, U-type pulse tube cryocooler is fabricated and connecting tubes are minimized for reducing dead volumes and pressure losses. Also, to get larger capacities, orifice valves and double inlet valves are optimized and the compressor of 6 kW is used. On the latest unit, the lowest temperatures of 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler are 42 K (1 st stage) and 8. 3 K (2 nd stage) and the <b>cooling</b> <b>capacities</b> are 40 W at 82. 9 K (1 st stage) and 10 W at 20. 5 K (2 nd stage) with 6. 0 kW of compressor input power. This pulse tube cryocooler is suited for commercial medium size cryopump. In performance test of cryopump with 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler, pumping speed for gaseous nitrogen is 4, 300 L/s and the ultimate vacuum pressure is 7. 5 × 10 - 10 mbar. 1...|$|R
