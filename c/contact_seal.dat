A linear, circular, or contoured brush seal system is a <b>contact</b> <b>seal</b> consisting of the bristle pattern and hardened interface. When compared to a labyrinth seal, the brush seal system is superior and features low leakage, dynamic stability, and permits compliant structures. But in turn, the system usually requires a hardened smooth interface and permits only limited pressure drops. Wear life and wear debris for operations with static or dynamic excitation are largely undetermined. A seal system involves control of fluid within specific boundaries. The brush and rub ring (or rub surface) form a seal system. Design similitudes, a bulk flow model, and rub ring (interface) coatings are discussed. The bulk flow model calculations are based on flows in porous media and filters. The coatings work is based on experience and expanded to include current practice...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Thales Cryogenics (TCBV) has an {{extensive}} background {{in developing and}} delivering long life cryogenic coolers for military, civil and space programs. This cooler range is based on two main compressor concepts: close tolerance contact seals (UP) and flexure bearing (LSF/LPT) compressors. With both concepts Thales Cryogenics has achieved excellent lifetime results. New market developments require more compact linear cryocoolers with long lifetimes. In this paper the development of two new compact linear cryocoolers will be outlined. Both coolers are initially designed for a ¼” IDCA cold finger and operation between 77 °K and 120 °K. The first cooler type, which is the UP 8497, uses a long-life fully miniature close tolerance <b>contact</b> <b>seal</b> compressor with an expected lifetime of 15, 000 hours minimum. The second type, which is the LSF 9997, uses an extremely reliable compressor, {{which is based on}} the proven flexure bearing technology with an expected lifetime of well over 25, 000 hours. The differences in cooler concepts will be described, including design and application tradeoffs. Furthermore, experimental results will be shown and discussed. Also, the expected lifetimes of both concepts and the roadmap towards even more improvements regarding the reliability of both concepts of Stirling coolers will be discussed. Finally, the development of miniature drive electronics suitable for this new generation of compact coolers will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no <b>contact,</b> <b>seal</b> life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|E

40|$|Design {{approach}} for maximising <b>contacting</b> filament <b>seal</b> performance retention Ingo HJ Jahn Good sealing {{is a key}} requirement for modern efficient turbomachinery such as steam and gas turbines. A class of seals that promise better performance, compared to conventional labyrinth <b>seals,</b> are <b>contacting</b> filament <b>seals</b> such as brush, leaf, or finger seal. When new, these filament seals offer better performance; however, if poorly designed they wear excessively, resulting in leakages higher than a comparable labyrinth seal.

Following this approach ensures the seal performs well, the seal retains its performance, and performance is retained if the operating cycle is altered. In the approach, the seals are described by four generic properties (stiffness, blow-down, cross-coupling, and build clearance), which are then used for a performance evaluation based {{on a number of}} test cycles. Once the ideal seal properties for a given operating cycle have been identified, a seal to match these can be designed.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{is presented to}} predict the oil film thickness in an axial <b>sealing</b> <b>contact</b> based on grease properties and operating conditions.

The results show that, depending on the operating conditions, an oil film is present in the <b>sealing</b> <b>contact</b> for a certain period of time. The oil film thickness decreases in time due to the decreasing oil supply from the grease reservoir and oil loss from the contact due to centrifugal forces. Seal pumping has only a small effect and the seal material and geometry are therefore not important for the predicted time until the mixed lubrication regime is reached.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in brush seal {{gas turbine engine}} applications show the promise that carefully designed bristle packs can also function as oil and oil mist seals. Because brush <b>seals</b> are primarily <b>contact</b> <b>seals,</b> oil temperature rise and coking become major concerns in addition to leakage performance. Although individual bristles form very small bearing surfaces, hydrodynamic forces generated by viscous sealing medium combined with high surface speeds may easily lift the compliant bristle pack off the shaft surface.

Balancing these two conflicting performance criteria depends on good understanding of the bristle hydrodynamic lift. This work presents an analytical solution to bristle lift forces based on long bearing assumptions.

40|$|LectureThe use of CO 2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) {{has been}} around since the early 70 ?s and was {{developed}} to enable oil extraction from declining fields. The process involves injecting CO 2 from either natural or man-made sources into the ground to free up trapped crude oil that would otherwise not be possible to obtain. This process significantly improves the lifetime production of oil from mature fields. Moving the CO 2 from one field to another is accomplished through a series of pipelines and pumps using centrifugal technology. In the early days of this process, pumps were sealed using double pressurized mechanical seals. This particular sealing arrangement was selected because of the very poor lubricating qualities of CO 2, the desire for high reliability, and the lack of capability to seal this fluid in the liquid state using a single seal. The downside to this arrangement was the cost and complexity.

40|$|Lecturepg. 33 Sealing {{volatile}} high-pressure fluids {{has always}} been a challenge unless the temperature is cold enough to produce a true liquid state around the seal. Even handling true liquids having low boiling points can result in low life expectancy due to the flashing of the fluid as it approaches atmospheric pressure and is heated by the seal faces. As pressure levels and temperatures increase above cryogenic, {{there is a need for}} technologies other than conventional <b>contacting</b> <b>seals.</b> Fluids handled in a supercritical state are particularly difficult since they are not in a true liquid state to begin with, and lubricity of the ?dense phase vapor? is extremely poor. API 682, Second Edition, (2002) recognizes the use of noncontacting dual unpressurized seals for this type of service. This paper will present the application of a dual unpressurized seal with noncontact lift-off faces to a high-pressure volatile fluid. This application required a high-energy pump at an elevated speed to create the pressure and flow required by the process. The alternative to this pump was a reciprocating compressor, which had been used on previous process units. Compared with the pump compressor option would have been significantly more expensive to purchase and would have resulted in increased maintenance over the life of the process unit. The pump selected was a nine-stage barrel pump rotating at 6686 rpm driven by an electric motor through a gearbox. The fluid being pumped was ethylene. Suction pressure was 950 psig. The ethylene was chilled to an operating temperature of 50 F so that the pump could develop the head necessary to produce the required discharge pressure of 4450 psig. The seals selected have now run for over two years with no failures. This includes several issues with the pump during which the pump was disassembled to correct vibration problems. At these times, the seals were removed from the pump and were not even reconditioned but were just reinstalled.

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contaminants outside the bearing system. These systems are often lubricated with grease; the grease {{acts as a}} lubricant for the bearing and seal and improves the sealing efficiency. In this thesis, the influence of lubricating grease on bearing seal performance is studied. Rheological properties of the grease, i. e. shear stress and normal stress difference, are evaluated and related to the lubricating and sealing performance of the sealing system. This includes the seal, grease and counterface. The grease velocity profile in the seal pocket in-between two sealing lips {{is dependent on the}} rheological properties of the grease. The velocity profile in a wide pocket is evaluated using a 1 -dimensional model based on the Herschel-Bulkley model. The velocity profile in a narrow pocket, where the influence of the side walls on the velocity profile is significant, is measured using micro particle image velocimetry. Subsequently, the radial migration of contaminants into the seal pocket is modelled and related to the sealing function of the grease. Additionally, also migration in the axial direction is found {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>sealing</b> <b>contact.</b> Experimental results show that contaminant particles in different greases consistently migrate either away from the <b>sealing</b> <b>contact</b> or towards the <b>sealing</b> <b>contact,</b> also when the pumping rate of the seal can be neglected. Lubrication of the <b>seal</b> lip <b>contact</b> is dependent on several grease properties. A lubricant film in the <b>sealing</b> <b>contact</b> may be built up as in oil lubricated seals but normal stress differences in the grease within the vicinity of the contact may result in an additional lift force. The grease, which is being sheared in the vicinity of the contact, will also contribute to the frictional torque. It is important to maintain a lubricant film in the <b>sealing</b> <b>contact</b> to minimize friction and wear. Here the replenishment of oil separated from the grease, also referred to as oil bleed, is of crucial importance. A model is presented to predict this oil bleed based on oil flow through the porous grease thickener microstructure. The model is applied to an axial <b>sealing</b> <b>contact</b> and a prediction of the film thickness as a function of time is made. The work presented in the thesis gives a significant contribution to a better understanding of the influence of lubricating grease on the sealing system performance and seal lubrication conditions.
