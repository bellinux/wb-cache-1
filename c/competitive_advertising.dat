Bush, the race was expected to be more competitive than in 2004 in light of Bush's waning popularity. The website Moveon.org identified Donnelly as a top contender to defeat a Republican incumbent in the house, and began running its [...] "Red-Handed" [...] ads against Chocola early in the campaign. Chocola still maintained a significant money advantage over Donnelly, but in 2006, Donnelly had enough to maintain a <b>competitive</b> <b>advertising</b> presence throughout the campaign. The campaign was heated, with the DCCC sponsoring ads attacking Chocola as being beholden to moneyed interests in the insurance, pharmaceutical, and energy industries. Chocola returned fire by attacking Donnelly over a late tax filing and by attempting to link him to liberal House leader Nancy Pelosi.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that recall will be lower when consumers have afterwards seen an ad for a competing brand in the same product class.

50|$|Repetition {{improves}} {{brand name}} recall when presented alone. When <b>competitive</b> <b>advertising</b> was presented {{it was shown}} that repetition provided no improvement in brand name recall over a single exposure. The competitive ads interfered with the added learning from repetition. However, when target brand name was shown using varying ad executions interference was reduced. Presenting ads in multi modalities (visual, auditory) will reduce possible interference because there are more associations or paths to cue recall than if only one modality had been used. This is the principle of multimedia learning. Also, interference is increased when competing ads are presented in the same modality. Therefore, by presenting ads in multiple modalities the chance that the target brand has unique cues is increased.|$|E

5000|$|The danger {{may arise}} however of an {{overestimation}} {{of the possibilities}} of change, given that 'we do not in any meaningful sense intend or choose our birth, our parents, our bodies, our language, our culture, our thoughts, our dreams, our desires, our death, and so on'. In the [...] PsyBlog-Understand Your Mind , Dr. Jeremy Dean states that [...] "the dark side of hope is that claims about potential improvement can, and are, grossly exaggerated, in order to prise open our wallets. Similarly a bright and breezy approach to potential change may lead {{us to believe that}} changing ourselves is easy, when often it requires considerable, sometimes monumental, effort". The 'Twelve-step [...] "Traditions"...have fostered a notion of individual self-mastery or self-control as limited...use of the Serenity Prayer encourages individuals to accept what they cannot change, to find courage to change what they can change, and to seek wisdom in discerning the difference'.

50|$|A {{revenue stream}} is {{an amount of}} money coming into a {{business}} or organisation from a particular source. A revenue model describes how a business generates revenue streams from its products and services. They are resultantly a key aspect of the revenue model. They are generated {{through the use of}} the revenue model components listed in the section above. Businesses continually seek for new ways of generating revenues, thus new revenue streams. Finding a new revenue stream has gradually taken on a distinct and specialized meaning in certain contexts to mean a new, novel, undiscovered, potentially lucrative, innovative, and creative means of generating income or exploiting a potential. This approach in particular can especially be applied to new technology and internet businesses which find extremely innovative ways of generating revenues, often ways which seemed not to be possible. As a result, technology-based businesses are constantly updating their revenue models in order to remain <b>competitive.</b> <b>Advertising</b> {{can be seen as a}} component of the revenue model, however, when the business is advertising its own products, this would result as a cost for the business which is the exact opposite of revenue. On the other hand, advertising can lead to an increase in sales thus revenue over a period of time. For the majority of businesses which will add value to a product or service that will be purchased by a customer, advertising is often a component of their business plan. Expenditure for this particular component is forecasted as it can generate greater revenues over periods of time.|$|E
