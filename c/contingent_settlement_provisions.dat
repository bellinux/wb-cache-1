40|$|Determining with {{certainty}} how the tax authorities will treat a particular financial instrument issued is not straightforward, and this poses {{a risk to}} corporate taxpayers tasked with generating shareholder value and predictable shareholder returns. The tax classification of financial instruments, as either debt or equity instruments, may have a profound impact from a corporate taxation perspective and the reclassification of financial instruments by a tax authority, in an unanticipated manner, can alter expected tax consequences. Previous studies have placed less emphasis on the potential discrepancies between the debt or equity classification of financial instruments from a tax-versus-corporate-reporting perspective {{and the reasons for}} such potential discrepancies. This study aims to identify potential factors, giving rise to divergent financial instrument classifications between tax and financial reporting, in order to gain insight into the reasons for the potential divergence. The research objectives of the study are to determine whether there is incongruity between the tax and accounting classification of selected financial instruments; to identify the factors giving rise to a possible incongruent outcome; and to evaluate the reasons for incongruity, in order to gain insight into the differing objectives of taxation and corporate reporting. Case studies were obtained from the technical department of a large accountancy firm in South Africa to analyse specific fact patterns. It was found that incongruence exists between the financial reporting and taxation classification of financial instruments {{from the perspective of the}} issuer of those instruments. This incongruence was attributed to the impact of <b>contingent</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>provisions</b> and the rules-based approach adopted by tax authorities, as opposed to the principle or substance-based approach favoured by financial reporting. The incongruence noted suggests that, based on their differing objectives, financial reporting favours the classification of financial instruments as debt whilst taxation favours the classification of financial instruments as equity. Although the approaches currently followed by financial reporting and taxation are different, recent taxation amendments have incorporated financial reporting guidance into the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. Future research can be conducted to determine the impact of aligning financial reporting and taxation principles on tax certainty from a taxpayer perspective.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>provisions</b> of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC or Convention), and the {{potential}} and actual role that they play in oceans governance. The study focuses {{not only on the}} traditional role of dispute settlement mechanisms in peacefully settling disputes, but also on their potential for contribution to good oceans governance in many ways. The jurisprudence generated so far under the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>provisions</b> of the LOSC can be called neither a complete success nor a total failure. Part XV of the Convention, dealing with dispute settlement procedures, has made a promising start with the inaugural jurisprudence under the prompt release and provisional measures proceedings. However, besides the general beneficial influence of the jurisprudence on oceans governance, a few detrimental developments have also been identified from the perspective of oceans governance. The present thesis demonstrates that a lot of hope had been pinned on the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>provisions</b> at the time when the LOSC was drafted. However, most of these hopes have not yet found expression, and if the limited use of dispute settlement procedures continues, it is unlikely that Part XV will fulfil those hopes in the future. Nevertheless, this thesis argues along more optimistic lines, and expresses a realistic hope that the actual role of dispute settlement in oceans governance will improve in the future. The thesis concludes that {{the success or failure of}} the dispute settlement mechanisms mostly depends upon their actual use made by states. Further, the dispute settlement mechanisms once invoked must be able to settle disputes objectively on the basis of law, equity and justice and uphold the principles and provisions of the LOSC. It is hoped that states will have recourse to Part XV more often for the purpose of settling their disputes peacefully, and that the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>provisions</b> will in turn fulfil their mandate. Only then will the world witness the dispute settlement mechanisms playing a real and beneficial role in oceans governance, concurrently with other oceans governance institutions and arrangements...|$|R

Although international investment law protects a government’s right to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as environmental protection, the investor-State dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>provision</b> allows foreign investors to seek compensation for a country’s law and policies contrary to their interests.

40|$|In a {{progressive}} income tax system {{with an individual}} tax unit, high-rate taxpayers {{have an incentive to}} split income with lower-rate family members to minimise the family’s total tax burden. This raises equity and neutrality concerns. Adopting a spousal tax unit limits the gains from income splitting, but the individual is the better choice on privacy, autonomy, equality, definitional, marriage neutrality and work incentive grounds. Once the individual is chosen as the income tax unit, the control model provides a strong policy basis for attributing both earned and unearned income to individuals. Income splitting, however, undermines this model as well as the individual tax unit. This thesis focuses on the UK’s approach to income-splitting in family businesses. The relevant UK income tax rules, particularly the <b>settlements</b> <b>provisions,</b> are inadequate for the task. Various possible reforms are examined. Incorporating a transfer pricing or ‘reasonableness’ test into the <b>settlements</b> <b>provisions</b> would strengthen these rules, but would make taxpayer compliance with an uncertain regime even more difficult. Another option is to expand the scope of employment tax by moving the borderline between employees and the self-employed or companies. Deeper structural reforms could be made to enhance the neutrality of taxation on different legal forms of economic activity. This would reduce the incentives to incorporate for tax savings, including from income splitting. Integration of income tax and NICs is one such option; a dual income tax is another. A TAAR or GAAR also could be pursued. Ultimately, some combination of these various reform options could provide a partial solution to this challenging issue.

Perspectives on the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, {{this article}} evaluates the largely ignored <b>settlement</b> notice <b>{{provision}}.</b> The provision mandates that notice of every class action settlement within CAFA 2 ̆ 7 s purview {{must be provided}} to appropriate federal and state officials. The relevant federal official is the U. S. Attorney General. As for the states, the relevant official {{is the one who}} has primary regulatory or supervisory responsibility with respect to the defendant, or who licenses or otherwise authorizes the defendant to conduct business in the State, or, by default, the AG of any state in which any class member lives. Some legal scholars have begun to ask whether CAFA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>settlement</b> notice <b>provision</b> will awaken a sleeping giant. The scant existing commentary is of two minds. This perhaps reflects the juxtaposition of the lofty goal of aggressive AG monitoring against the fact that the AGs lack a precise mandate for official review, let alone any additional resources for the endeavor. At this early juncture, {{it is too soon to}} tell whether the CAFA <b>settlement</b> notice <b>provision</b> will have a significant impact on private settlements of class actions, let alone any wider impact in motivating state AGs to police more aggressively certain types of misconduct. To the extent that the provision does have a marked effect, it will most likely be due to the increased availability of information and to the facilitation of coordinated efforts on behalf of groups of state AGs. In order to assess the overall effect, it is necessary to delve beneath the layer of formal activity to probe the informal bargaining and negotiation taking place at the behest of state AGs. The <b>settlement</b> notice <b>provision</b> also provides a window on an even grander topic: CAFA as regulatory policy. As if through a refracting lens, the view of CAFA is transformed by the angle from which it is viewed. The Article sets forth a series of progressively unfolding dyads in order to highlight the state/federal, ex ante/ex post, and public/private dimensions of regulatory policy implicated by CAFA.

These arguments are tested on a new dataset that includes information on ratifications of more than 200 global environmental agreements in 1950 - 2006. We find that specific obligations, assistance, and dispute settlement have the expected effects. Surprisingly, our results show that the presence (or absence) of monitoring and enforcement has no effect on participation. The latter finding suggests that monitoring and enforcement through mechanisms operating outside of treaties rather than through treaty obligations themselves are likely to play a significant role. ...|$|R
