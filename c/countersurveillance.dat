500|$|Before joining Section D, Adam Carter was an MI6 {{officer who}} {{specialised}} in the Middle East. Oliver Mace (Tim McInnerny), {{chairman of the}} Joint Intelligence Committee, describes Carter as a [...] "loose cannon". He is a fluent Arabic speaker and has good <b>countersurveillance</b> skills. In one past operation, Adam worked a case in Damascus to recruit Syrian intelligence officer Farook Sukkarieh as a double agent {{to work with the}} Israelis and stop a string of suicide attacks. He used Farook's wife, Fiona (Olga Sosnovska) as a way in. Fiona and Adam subsequently fell in love and started an affair. When Farook discovered this, he had Adam brutally tortured. After he escaped, Adam framed Farook, persuading the Syrians that he was a traitor, and Farook was supposedly hanged for this. Adam subsequently married Fiona and together they had a son, Wes.|$|E

A team led by Danny Hunter (David Oyelowo) attempts to bug his home, only to find it impossible because of the home's high-tech <b>countersurveillance</b> equipment. What MI5 does find is that Osbourne abuses his wife Claire (Debra Stephenson); believing Claire is vulnerable for recruitment, Section D start [...] "Operation Greensleeves" [...] and tasks a [...] "runner" [...] to befriend her before recruiting. However, vetting did not {{pick up on the}} runner's alcoholism after she becomes involved in a road traffic accident while inebriated. Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) appoints Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) and junior administrative officer Helen Flynn (Lisa Faulkner) to step in and pose as a married couple who are substitute tutors at the same Romford community college Claire is attending.|$|E

50|$|<b>Countersurveillance</b> {{refers to}} {{measures}} undertaken to prevent surveillance, including covert surveillance. <b>Countersurveillance</b> may include electronic {{methods such as}} bug sweeping, the process of detecting surveillance devices, including covert listening devices, visual surveillance devices as well as <b>Countersurveillance</b> software to thwart unwanted attempts by cyber crooks to access computing and mobile devices for various nefarious reasons (e.g. theft of financial, personal or corporate data). More often than not, <b>countersurveillance</b> will employ a set of actions (countermeasures) that, when followed, {{reduce the risk of}} surveillance. <b>Countersurveillance</b> {{should not be confused with}} sousveillance (inverse surveillance) as the latter does not necessarily aim to prevent or reduce surveillance.|$|E

5000|$|With such an {{increase}} in data collection and surveillance many individuals are now attempting to reduce the concerns that have alongside it. <b>Countersurveillance</b> {{is perhaps the most}} significant concept focused on the tactics to prevent dataveillance.

5000|$|The United States {{military}} {{refers to}} electronic <b>countersurveillance</b> as [...] "technical surveillance counter-measures" [...] (TSCM) and relates it to signal intelligence and electronic countermeasures.|$|E
50|$|TSCM (technical {{surveillance}} counter-measures) is {{the original}} United States Federal government abbreviation denoting the process of bug-sweeping or electronic <b>countersurveillance.</b> It is related to ELINT, SIGINT and electronic countermeasures (ECM).|$|E
5000|$|... "Drycleaning" [...] is a <b>countersurveillance</b> {{technique}} for discerning how many [...] "tails" [...] (following enemy agents) an agent is being followed by, and by moving about, seemingly oblivious to being tailed, perhaps losing {{some or all}} of those doing surveillance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Countersurveillance</b> is the {{practice}} of avoiding surveillance or making surveillance difficult. Developments {{in the late twentieth}} century have caused counter surveillance to dramatically grow in both scope and complexity, such as the Internet, increasing prevalence of electronic security systems, high-altitude (and possibly armed) UAVs, and large corporate and government computer databases.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Liddy {{joined forces with}} former Niles, Illinois, {{policeman}} and co-owner of The Protection Group, Ltd., Thomas E.

50|$|Kim Philby was an {{effective}} Soviet agent {{while in the}} British counterintelligence service, warning the Soviets of <b>countersurveillance,</b> while casting suspicion on loyal officers.

50|$|These skills include camouflage, {{land and}} water navigation, {{understanding}} the difference between concealment from view and cover from small arms' fire, using the terrain and its features to mask ground movement, obstacle crossing, selecting good firing positions, lying-up positions, camping positions, effective observation, camouflage penetration, <b>countersurveillance,</b> detecting enemy-fire directionality and range, survival, evasion, and escape techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Another technique, for hiding {{content that}} will resist casual examination, {{is to reduce}} the message to a {{photographic}} transparency or negative, perhaps the size of the dot over the letter [...] "i" [...] in this article. Such a technique needs both a laboratory and considerable technical skill, and is prone to damage and to accidentally falling off the paper. Still, it does have a <b>countersurveillance</b> value.|$|E
50|$|Although {{nominally}} {{part of the}} Interior Ministry, the CSO under Yahya {{was largely}} autonomous, and is composed of two main parts; the Central Security Forces (CSF) and the Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU). The CSF are paramilitary police that secure official buildings and infrastructure, as well as managing the dense network of security checkpoints on Yemen's highways. The CSF is also beginning to undertake covert <b>countersurveillance</b> at likely terrorist targets.|$|E
50|$|Teaching <b>countersurveillance</b> {{techniques}} to agents is a calculated risk. While {{it may be}} perfectly valid for an agent to abort a drop or other relatively innocent action, even {{at the cost of}} destroying valuable collected material, it is much more dangerous to teach the agent to elude active surveillance. The ability to elude professional counterintelligence personnel following the agent, for example, may confirm the counterintelligence organization's suspicion that they are dealing with a real agent.|$|E
50|$|More {{challenging}} {{versions are}} reminiscent of passing a baton in a relay race, and would be most commonly done with small objects such as a photographic film cartridge. In this more dangerous method, the transfer is from hand to hand, or from hand into a pocket. While this technique obviously takes better manual dexterity and is more prone to error, it has the <b>countersurveillance</b> advantage that the operatives are not carrying anything after the transfer, and can blend into a crowd even more easily.|$|E
5000|$|A CIA report {{describes}} {{the use of}} a mannequin ("Jack-in-the-Box") as a <b>countersurveillance</b> measure, intended to {{make it more difficult for}} the host country's counterintelligence to track the movement of CIA agents posing as diplomats. A [...] "Jack-in-the-Box" [...] - a mannequin representing the upper half of a human - would quickly replace a CIA agent after he left the car driven by another agent and walked away, so that any counterintelligence officers monitoring the agent's car would believe that he's still in the car.|$|E
50|$|Four Americans {{died in the}} 2012 Benghazi attack: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and two CIA operatives, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former Navy SEALs. Stevens is {{the first}} U.S. {{ambassador}} killed in an attack since Adolph Dubs was killed in 1979. Senior intelligence officials later acknowledged that Woods and Doherty were contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency, not the State Department as previously identified, and were part of Global Response Staff (GRS), a team that provides security to CIA case officers and <b>countersurveillance</b> and surveillance protection.|$|E
50|$|It is known, {{although}} not acknowledged by the US Government, that the CIA runs {{at least two}} operations training facilities. One is known as The Farm, at Camp Peary, Virginia. The other is known as The Point at Harvey Point, North Carolina. While the course outline has never been revealed, it is believed to include such things as surveillance, <b>countersurveillance,</b> cryptography, paramilitary training {{as well as other}} tradecraft. The course is believed to be slightly less than a year and runs at irregular intervals depending on circumstances. Operations training is delivered by experienced operations officers.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{decision}} is made to make a formal recruitment, the case officer gets the developmental accustomed to meeting in more obscure places and at more unusual times. These can have the function of <b>countersurveillance,</b> during which additional officers may be watching the meeting, and the travel to it, for evidence of [...] "country A" [...] counterintelligence interest. Without the developmental fully realizing it, he is being drawn into increasingly treasonous activity, which would be {{harder and harder to}} explain were he caught. It is considered important for the case officer to offer money, perhaps dismissed as covering expenses, but really as a means of compromising the developmental.|$|E

Edklinth, along with his assistant Monica Figuerola, begins a clandestine investigation into the Section. After Figuerola confirms the allegations, Edklinth contacts the Justice Minister and the Prime Minister who approve a full investigation by Constitutional Protection, and later invite Blomkvist to a confidential meeting {{in which they are}} to share information. They agree to Blomkvist's deadline—he intends to publish his findings about the state's manipulation of Salander's constitutional rights on 15 July, the third day of her trial, and the government agree to arrest any identified ringleaders of the Section at the same time.|$|E
50|$|During the {{preparation}} phase they maintained absolute secrecy; never say {{anything on the}} phone, making sure they were not followed, and didn't even tell their closest family what they were doing. Each big heist was usually preceded by months or at least weeks of detailed planning, preparations and surveillance. The surveillance/stakeouts were usually done on foot or {{from the back of}} small closed vans. When renting cars, apartments etc. they used stolen identities and false driver licenses, taking care to avoid using the stolen identities in ways that would be noticed by the victim (such as spending the victim's money). They used professional <b>countersurveillance</b> techniques as routine, including spotting of unmarked police cars, evasive driving, calling between payphones etc.|$|E
50|$|Agent {{training}} often includes {{techniques of}} tradecraft such as clandestine communications, including cryptography, {{the use of}} one-time pads, the construction of concealment devices, and the employment of dead drops. Other elements of tradecraft include elicitation, surveillance and <b>countersurveillance,</b> photography and the emplacement of audio devices, sensors, or other transmitters. Case officers generally train agents one at a time, in isolation, including only those elements of tradecraft needed to penetrate the target at hand. Case officers will also teach agents how to develop cover for status, and cover for action, meaning how to establish credible pretexts for their presence and behavior while engaged in collection activities. A well-trained and competent agent can conduct his or her clandestine tasks while under close surveillance, and still evade detection. More advanced agent training can include resistance to interrogation.|$|E
5000|$|Signals intelligence, or SIGINT, is {{a common}} tool in espionage, {{although}} it has been hard to apply to anti-terrorism activities. The National Security Agency (NSA), the organization formally responsible for SIGINT within the United States intelligence community, was used to targeting conventional military communications systems, while terrorists lacked dedicated communications systems, confronting the NSA with the prospect of [...] "picking out the needles of terrorist transmissions in the haystack". While some information has been gained, SIGINT is only effective against cells if the group is unaware they are being monitored. Once known communication methods have been compromised, terrorists switch to other means. Terrorists may employ various <b>countersurveillance</b> techniques, including the use of non-electronic messengers to avoid interception, employ encrypted message systems, or exploit public Internet connections such as Internet cafes.|$|E

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The {{efficient}} use of new {{information and communication technologies}} can be of crucial importance in emergency response and crisis communications. New media applications are able to perform a range of functions such as facilitating two-way communication, enabling citizens and first respondents to request/offer assistance, enhance campaigning activities for fund raising purposes, and enable individuals/groups to efficiently organize for action. Likewise, social networking, crowdsourcing, and data mining technologies offer new means through which different stakeholders, such as officials, responders, citizens, can gather and disseminate information so as to optimize emergency response. Yet, new media technologies, and particularly social media, may often be misused, either intentionally or unintentionally in ways that can impede efficient communication during emergencies and crises. The present “Report on the adverse use and reliability of new media” (D 2. 3) aims to provide an overview the adverse use of new media by scammers, hackers, terrorist groups, ordinary citizens, as well as, at times, government authorities and companies. The report also aims to provide an in-depth discussion of an issue that users of new media technologies face in the utilization of such technologies during crises and emergencies: reliability of information. Following a brief introduction (Chapter 1), the report will comprise three chapters. In Chapter 2, the report will focus on types of misuse of new media and their management. The first two sections of Chapter 2 will consider misuse of new media technologies along two axes: types of misuse and players in misuse. In the first section of the chapter, the report will focus on are misrepresentation, rumor spreading, propaganda, surveillance and censorship, and lateral surveillance. After discussing these misuse types, the section to follow will proceed with an analysis of key “players” in misuse of new media technologies. Using examples from case studies of emergencies and crises conducted by the COSMIC team in Deliverable 2. 2., as well as examples form other recent emergencies and crises (such as the Arab Spring and Hurricane Katrina) the chapter will describe the role that scammers, hackers, government authorities, and private corporations may play both as misusers and responders, depending on the circumstances. In the final section of Chapter 2, the report will discuss how different stakeholders try to manage misuse of new media. In terms of management of misuse, the report distinguished between external threats as those that come from the outside a given system or organization and internal threats that come from within an organization. In this section, particular {{attention has been paid to}} the concept of sousveillance, which can be defined as surveillance from below (performed by the public on institutions) as an approach that can increase the accountability of powerful players and prevent abuse of power. Also, the report discussed new <b>countersurveillance</b> techniques that can protect citizens’ right to privacy and free speech at times of crises (specifically political crises). Finally, discussion of management of internal threats underlined how datamining techniques can be used for early detection and prevention of misuse during times of crises. An important lesson learned from the discussion on Chapter 2 is that in many cases, while trying to respond to potential misuses of information, various stakeholders, including government authorities, may themselves hinder effective utilization of new media technologies for crises communication. Hence, a proper approach to management of misuse of new media technologies should definitely involve multitude of stakeholders, and particularly supranational organizations, that can provide a system of checks and balances. The focus of Chapter 3 was dissemination of misinformation via new media technologies at times of crises and techniques that can be used by various stakeholders (including citizens and mainstream journalists) to verify information. In this chapter, specific attention was paid to primary data collected from Internet users about reliability of information during the Gezi Protests that took place in Turkey in 2013. The findings from these data suggest that while Internet users are aware of the potential pitfalls of relying on the Internet for information about crises and emergencies, they often see the Internet as a more viable choice for up to date information when compared to mainstream media. Moreover, the data suggests that a considerable proportion of users engage in techniques to actively verify the information they receive. However, some of these techniques may end up amplifying the problem of dissemination of misinformation. As such, development and widespread adoption of technologies that can assist stakeholders in information verification is needed. Given this need, Chapter 3 concludes with an overview of some of the technologies (e. g., Semantically Interlinked Online Communities-SIOC), applications (e. g., Hoodcast) and techniques (crowdsourcing) that can be viable options to assist not only citizens but all stakeholders who utilize new media for getting information during times of emergencies and crises. Based on these analyses, the last chapter (Conclusion) provides a summary of key insights regarding misuse of new media technologies during crisis, management of misuse and information verification. Also, the last chapter proposes a set of principles that can guide future efforts to alleviate the adverse uses of new media described in the report...|$|E
