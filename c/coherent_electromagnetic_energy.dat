The two propulsion types are (1) Gravimagnetic Systems — multipurpose propulsion systems which utilize the "gravitational " effects of <b>coherent</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> configurations, and (2) Field Resonance Systems- deep-space propulsion systems which initiate extreme but localized changes in the nonlinear coordinate transformation properties of space-time ("hyperspace jumps").

40|$|If {{sufficient}} justification {{exists to}} start {{the development of a}} field physics laboratory, attention might well be given to the development of two advanced types of field-independent propulsion systems. These are gravimagnetic systems and field resonance systems. The first are multipurpose propulsion systems employing the 'gravitational' effects of <b>coherent</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> configurations. The second are deep-space propulsion systems which artificially generate an energy pattern that matches precisely, or resonates with, a virtual pattern associated with a distant space-time point. A new model of space-time/field interactions is used in the present paper to describe the potential characteristics of electromagnetic/gravitational field interactions and the performance capabilities of these two propulsion systems...|$|E
40|$|In a {{conventional}} material, the coherent Cerenkov radiation {{due to a}} moving charged particle {{is associated with a}} velocity threshold, a forward-pointing radiation cone, and a forward direction of emission. We describe different behavior for the Cerenkov radiation in a photonic crystal. In particular, this radiation is intrinsically coupled with transition radiation and is observable without any threshold. Within one particle-velocity range, we found a radiation pattern with a backward-pointing radiation cone. In another velocity range, backward-propagating Cerenkov radiation can be expected. Potential applica-tions include velocity-sensitive particle detection and radiation generation at selectable frequencies. When a charged particle travels inside a medi-um, it can drive the medium to emit <b>coherent</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> called Cerenkov radia-tion (CR) (1).

40|$|A {{model for}} recording, processing, presentation, and {{analysis}} of radar images in digital form is presented. The observed image is represented as having two random components, one which models the variation due to the <b>coherent</b> addition of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> scattered from different objects in the illuminated areas. This component {{is referred to as}} fading. The other component is a representation of the terrain variation which can be described as the actual signal which the radar is attempting to measure. The combination of these two components provides a description of radar images as being the output of a linear space-variant filter operating on the product of the fading and terrain random processes. In addition, the model is applied to a digital image processing problem using the design and implementation of enhancement scene. Finally, parallel approaches are being employed as possible means of solving other processing problems such as SAR image map-matching, data compression, and pattern recognition...|$|R

40|$|We present general {{analytic}} {{solutions for}} optical <b>coherent</b> control of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>energy</b> propagation in plasmonic nanostructures. Propagating modes are excited with tightly focused ultrashort laser pulses that are shaped in amplitude, phase, and polarization (ellipticity and orientation angle). We decouple {{the interplay between}} two main mechanisms which are essential for the control of local near-fields. First, the amplitudes and the phase difference of two laser pulse polarization components are used to guide linear flux to a desired spatial position. Second, temporal compression of the near-field at the target location is achieved using the remaining free laser pulse parameter to flatten the local spectral phase. The resulting enhancement of nonlinear signals from this intuitive analytic two-step process is compared to and confirmed {{by the results of}} an iterative adaptive learning loop in which an evolutionary algorithm performs a global optimization. Thus, we gain detailed insight into why a certain complex laser pulse shape leads to a particular control target. This analytic approach may also be useful {{in a number of other}} coherent control scenarios. © 2009 Optical Society of America.

40|$|It was {{recently}} shown that so-called coherence vortices, singularities of the two-point correlation function, generally occur in partially <b>coherent</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> beams. We study the three-dimensional structure of these singularities {{and show that}} in successive cross sections of a beam a rich variety of topological reactions takes place. These reactions involve, apart from vortices, the creation or annihilation of dipoles, saddles, maxima and minima of the phase of the correlation function. Since these reactions happen generically, i. e., under quite general conditions, these observations have implications for interference experiments with partially <b>coherent,</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> beams. © 2013 Optical Society of America...|$|R
