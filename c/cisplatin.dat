5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, <b>cisplatin</b> and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either <b>cisplatin</b> or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (<b>cisplatin,</b> carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|Platinum {{is used in}} {{catalytic}} converters, laboratory equipment, {{electrical contacts}} and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects. Compounds containing platinum, such as <b>cisplatin,</b> oxaliplatin and carboplatin, are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly <b>cisplatin</b> and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and <b>cisplatin</b> is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus <b>cisplatin,</b> irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{has a long}} history of academic research, and in 2013–14 spent $528 million toward it. In 1877, botany professor William J. Beal performed the first documented genetic crosses to produce hybrid corn, which led to increased yields. MSU dairy professor G. Malcolm Trout invented the process for the homogenization of milk in the 1930s. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed <b>cisplatin,</b> a leading cancer fighting drug. Albert Fert, an Adjunct professor at MSU, was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Peter Grünberg.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} non-essential heavy metals {{have one or}} more toxic forms. Kidney failure and {{fatalities}} have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements (~15 to 300g in total consumed {{over a period of}} two months to three years). Exposure to osmium tetroxide (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage and can lead to respiratory failure and death. Indium salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. <b>Cisplatin</b> (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison. Bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess; insoluble uranium compounds, as well as the dangerous radiation they emit, can cause permanent kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs <b>cisplatin,</b> oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Electrolyte disturbance: <b>Cisplatin</b> {{can cause}} hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and {{hypocalcaemia}}. The hypocalcaemia seems {{to occur in}} those with low serum magnesium secondary to <b>cisplatin,</b> {{so it is not}} primarily due to the <b>cisplatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} adding cetuximab to conventional chemotherapy (<b>cisplatin)</b> versus <b>cisplatin</b> alone. This study found no improvement in survival or disease-free survival {{with the addition of}} cetuximab to the conventional chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Intraperitoneal {{chemotherapy}} {{has also}} been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with <b>cisplatin</b> and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched. <b>Cisplatin</b> and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: irinotecan combined with <b>cisplatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Cisplatin</b> – Also a {{chemotherapeutic}} drug.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>cisplatin</b> {{is used in}} Auger therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cisplatin</b> is {{particularly}} effective against testicular cancer; the cure rate was improved from 10% to 85%.|$|E
25|$|Larger early-stage tumors (IB2 and IIA {{more than}} 4nbsp&cm) may {{be treated with}} {{radiation}} therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires adjuvant radiation therapy), or <b>cisplatin</b> chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy. When <b>cisplatin</b> is present, it {{is thought to be}} the most active single agent in periodic diseases. Such addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to chemoradiation seems not only to improve survival but also reduces risk of recurrence in women with early stage cervical cancer (IA2-IIA).|$|E
25|$|Transplatin, the trans {{stereoisomer}} of <b>cisplatin,</b> has formula trans- {{and does}} not exhibit a comparably useful pharmacological effect. Two mechanisms have been suggested to explain the reduced anticancer effect of transplatin. Firstly, the trans arrangement of the chloro ligands is thought to confer transplatin with greater chemical reactivity, causing transplatin to become deactivated before it reaches the DNA where transplatin exerts its pharmacological action. Secondly, the stereo-conformation of transplatin is such that it is unable to form the characteristic 1,2-intrastand d(GpG) adducts formed by <b>cisplatin</b> in abundance.|$|E
25|$|Hemolytic anemia can be {{developed}} after several courses of <b>cisplatin.</b> It is suggested that an antibody reacting with a cisplatin-red-cell membrane is responsible for hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). <b>Cisplatin</b> and derivatives include <b>cisplatin,</b> carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>cisplatin</b> is {{frequently}} designated as an alkylating agent, {{it has no}} alkyl group and it therefore cannot carry out alkylating reactions. It is correctly classified as alkylating-like.|$|E
25|$|Relative to <b>cisplatin,</b> the {{greatest}} benefit of carboplatin is its reduced side effects, particularly {{the elimination of}} nephrotoxic effects. Nausea and vomiting are less severe and more easily controlled.|$|E
25|$|The {{former is}} more {{accepted}} {{owing to the}} similarity of the leaving groups with its predecessor <b>cisplatin,</b> while the latter hypothesis envisages a biological activation mechanism to release the active Pt2+ species.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{depends on}} the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or {{carboplatin}} or oxaliplatin) every three weeks with fluorouracil (5-FU) either continuously or every three weeks. In more recent studies, addition of epirubicin was better than other comparable regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible; in this case, <b>cisplatin</b> and 5-FU are used. Ongoing trials compare various combinations of chemotherapy; the phase II/III REAL-2 trial – for example – compares four regimens containing epirubicin and either <b>cisplatin</b> or oxaliplatin, and either continuously infused fluorouracil or capecitabine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cisplatin</b> {{combination}} chemotherapy is {{the cornerstone}} of treatment of many cancers. Initial platinum responsiveness is high but the majority of cancer patients will eventually relapse with cisplatin-resistant disease. Many mechanisms of <b>cisplatin</b> resistance have been proposed including changes in cellular uptake and efflux of the drug, increased detoxification of the drug, inhibition of apoptosis and increased DNA repair. Oxaliplatin is active in highly cisplatin-resistant cancer cells in the laboratory; however, there is little evidence for its activity in the clinical treatment of patients with cisplatin-resistant cancer. The drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer; the mechanism for this activity is unknown.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cisplatin,</b> a platinum-based compound, was {{discovered}} by a Michigan State University researcher, Barnett Rosenberg, working under an NCI contract. This was yet another serendipitous discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing {{to try to explain}} this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental artifact — the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an electrolysis product of the platinum electrode rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of <b>cisplatin.</b> This drug was pivotal in the cure of testicular cancer. Subsequently, Eve Wiltshaw and others at the Institute of Cancer Research in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of carboplatin, a <b>cisplatin</b> derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} {{reported}} a case wherein 2 courses of adjuvant therapy with <b>cisplatin</b> and paclitaxel, followed by oral gefitinib, were used after complete resection. The patient {{had had no}} recurrence 34 months later.|$|E
25|$|Carboplatin is less potent than cisplatin; {{depending}} on the strain of cancer, carboplatin may only be 1/8 to 1/45 as effective. The clinical standard of dosage of carboplatin is usually a 4:1 ratio compared to cisplatin; that is, for a dose that usually requires a particular dose of <b>cisplatin,</b> {{four times as much}} carboplatin is needed to achieve the same effectiveness. The stable property of carboplatin is a mixed blessing: once uptake of the drug occurs, its retention half-life is considerably longer than <b>cisplatin,</b> but it is also this inertness that causes carboplatin to go right through the human body, and up to 90% of the carboplatin given can be recovered in urine.|$|E
25|$|Carboplatin is used {{to treat}} a number of forms of cancer. This {{includes}} ovarian cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, brain cancer, and neuroblastoma. It {{may be used for}} some types of testicular cancer but <b>cisplatin</b> is generally more effective.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cisplatin</b> is a {{chemotherapy}} medication used {{to treat}} a number of cancers. This includes testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, brain tumors and neuroblastoma. It is used by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel-based {{chemotherapy}} {{has shown}} a very good response in locally advanced head and neck cancer. Docetaxel is the only taxane approved by US FDA for head and neck cancer, in combination with <b>cisplatin</b> and fluorouracil for the induction treatment of inoperable, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck.|$|E
25|$|Nausea and vomiting: <b>cisplatin</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} emetogenic {{chemotherapy}} agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, etc.) in combination with corticosteroids. Aprepitant combined with ondansetron and dexamethasone has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just ondansetron and dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|RCTs may be {{unnecessary}} for {{treatments that}} have dramatic and rapid effects {{relative to the}} expected stable or progressively worse natural course of the condition treated. One example is combination chemotherapy including <b>cisplatin</b> for metastatic testicular cancer, which increased the cure rate from 5% to 60% in a 1977 non-randomized study.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cisplatin</b> is {{administered}} intravenously as short-term infusion in normal saline {{for treatment of}} solid malignancies. It is used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g., small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck and ovarian cancer), lymphomas, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, and germ cell tumors.|$|E
25|$|Advanced-stage tumors (IIB-IVA) {{are treated}} with {{radiation}} therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. On June 15, 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved {{the use of a}} combination of two chemotherapy drugs, hycamtin and <b>cisplatin,</b> for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment. Combination treatment has significant risk of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia side effects.|$|E
25|$|Before 1970, {{survival}} rates from testicular cancer were low. Since {{the introduction of}} adjuvant chemotherapy, chiefly platinum-based drugs like <b>cisplatin</b> and carboplatin, the outlook has improved substantially. Although 7000 to 8000 new cases of testicular cancer occur in the United States yearly, only 400 men are expected to die of the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} of the trans effect is the {{synthesis}} of <b>cisplatin.</b> Starting from PtCl42−, the first NH3 ligand is added to any of the four equivalent positions at random. However, since Cl− has a larger trans effect than NH3, the second NH3 is added trans to a Cl− and therefore cis to the first NH3.|$|E
