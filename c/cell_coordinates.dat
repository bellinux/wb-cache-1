30|$|Ways for {{interference}} mitigation {{are also}} classified into inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) and base station cooperation (BSC). In ICIC, neighboring cells use the orthogonal bandwidth {{and avoid the}} performance degradation of cell-edge users in each cell [8]. In [9], the dynamical management of bandwidth and cluster size results in improved frequency utilization efficiency. On the other hand, in BSC, the neighboring cells share the same bandwidth and cooperate {{with each other to}} make the interference beneficial [10]. Since a number of <b>cells</b> <b>coordinate</b> in BSC, the construction of groups in which <b>cells</b> <b>coordinate</b> greatly affects the performance. In both schemes, grouping cells that use the same bandwidth is essential to better performance.|$|R

5000|$|The {{notion of}} the {{abstract}} cell complex defined by E. Steinitz {{is related to the}} notion of an abstract simplicial complex and it differs from a simplicial complex by the property that its elements are no simplices: An n-dimensional element of an abstract complexes must not have n+1 zero-dimensional sides, and not each subset of the set of zero-dimensional sides of a cell is a cell. This is important since the notion of an abstract cell complexes {{can be applied to the}} two- and three-dimensional grids used in image processing, which is not true for simplicial complexes. A non-simplicial complex is a generalization which makes the introduction of <b>cell</b> <b>coordinates</b> possible: There are non-simplicial complexes which are Cartesian products of such [...] "linear" [...] one-dimensional complexes where each zero-dimensional cell, besides two of them, bounds exactly two one-dimensional cells. Only such Cartesian complexes make it possible to introduce such coordinates that each cell has a set of coordinates and any two different cells have different coordinate sets. The coordinate set can serve as a name of each cell of the complex which is important for processing complexes.|$|E

40|$|Given {{a finite}} graph (network), let every node (cell) {{represent}} an individual dynamics {{given by a}} system of ordinary differential equations, and every arrow (edge) encode the dynamical influence of the tail node on the head node. We have then defined a coupled cell system {{that is associated with}} the given network structure. Subspaces that are defined by equalities of <b>cell</b> <b>coordinates</b> and left invariant under every coupled cell system respecting the network structure are called synchrony subspaces. They are completely determined by the network structure and form a complete lattice under set inclusions. We analyze the transition of the lattice of synchrony subspaces of a network that is caused by structural changes in the network topology, such as deletion and addition of cells or edges, and rewirings of edges. We give sufficient, and in some cases both sufficient and necessary, conditions under which lattice elements persist or disappear...|$|E
40|$|We survey recent {{results on}} {{patterns}} of synchrony in lattice differential equations on a square lattice. Lattice differential equations consist of choosing a phase space R m for each {{point in a}} lattice and a system of differential equations {{on each of these}} phase spaces such that the whole system is translation invariant. The architecture of a lattice differential equation is the specification of which sites are coupled to which (nearest neighbor coupling is a standard example). A polydiagonal is a finite-dimensional subspace obtained by setting coordinates in different phase spaces equal. A polydiagonal ∆ has k colors if points in ∆ have at most k unequal <b>cell</b> <b>coordinates.</b> A pattern of synchrony is a polydiagonal that is flow-invariant for every lattice differential equation with a given architecture.

40|$|The largest {{available}} cellular level connectivity map, of a 0. 1 mm {{sample of}} the mouse retina Inner Plexiform Layer, was analysed using network models and visualized using spectral graph layouts and observed <b>cell</b> <b>coordinates.</b> This allows key nodes in the network {{to be identified with}} retinal neurons. Their strongest synaptic links can trace pathways in the network, elucidating possible circuits. Modular decomposition of the network, by sampling signal flows over nodes and links using the InfoMap method, shows discrete modules of cone bipolar cells that form a tiled mosaic in the retinal plane. The highest flow nodes, calculated by InfoMap, proved to be the most useful landmarks for elucidating possible circuits. Their dominant links to high flow amacrine cells reveal possible circuits linking bipolar through to ganglion cells and show an Off-On discrimination between the Left-Right sections of the sample.
