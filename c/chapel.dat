40|$|The {{original}} {{copy of this}} dissertation is held in the University's Main Library and may be accessed upon requestThe work is an examination of medieval <b>chapels</b> in Devon which {{can be regarded as}} distinct from parish churches. The topic, which covers the period between 1044 and 1550, is set in a general historical context. A wide range of documentary sources has been used in identifying an estimated total of 1, 300 medieval <b>chapels</b> in Devon, the principal source being the episcopal registers. Others include early charters, surveys of church property, antiquarian studies, visual sources, modern historical sources, and some evidence from archaeology and place-names. A database of identified medieval <b>chapels</b> in Devon has enabled analysis of the material and provides the basis of a gazetteer of <b>chapels,</b> included {{at the end of the}} dissertation. The origin and development of <b>chapels</b> is discussed in the context of canon law, which conferred upon them subordinate status in order to protect the financial interests of parish churches. A discussion of sources forms the second chapter. The categories of <b>chapels</b> and the range of people served by them are introduced before turning to the functions of <b>chapels</b> and activities in them. Worship and the liturgy were of primary importance but some <b>chapels</b> had additional social roles, especially <b>chapels</b> associated with cults or public services. A discussion of topographical factors and the location of <b>chapels</b> follows, in which comparison is made with Lincolnshire. In the final chapter, patrons, staff and people are considered and an increase in lay initiatives in matters relating to the Church is demonstrated, especially from the late-fourteenth century. The study shows that <b>chapels</b> provided a variety of religious outlets and served a wide range of people, and demonstrates their great social significance before the Reformation. The work provides the first comprehensive list and study of <b>chapels</b> in any English county...|$|R
