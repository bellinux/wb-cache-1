40|$|Speed profile {{optimization}} {{plays an}} important role in optimal train control. Considering the characteristics of an electrical locomotive with regenerative braking, this paper proposes a new algorithm for target speed profile approximation. This paper makes the following three contributions: First, it proves that under a certain calculation precision, there is an optimal coast-brake switching region—not just a point where the train should be switched from <b>coasting</b> <b>mode</b> to braking mode. This is very useful in engineering applications. Second, the paper analyzes the influence of regenerative braking on the optimal coast-brake switching region and proposes an approximate linear relationship between the optimal switching region and the regeneration efficiency. Third, the paper presents an average speed equivalent algorithm for local speed profile optimization in steep sections. In addition, this paper simplifies the proof of the optimality of smooth running on a non-steep track in two steps. The effects on energy consumption from two important factors (optimal coast and running time) are systematically analyzed. Extensive simulations verify these points of view and demonstrate that the proposed approximation approach is computationally efficient and achieves sufficient engineering accuracy...|$|R

The {{evolution}} of coastal management [...] Current policy, legislative and reporting framework for coastal management in NSW: a review [...] Principles of public participation [...] Case studies [...] A model for monitoring and evaluating public participation [...] Conclusion. Everybody wants {{access to the}} coast. The NSW coast is where people want to live, do business, create development and where people want to recreate (Holliday 1998). [...] This thesis is about coastal management in NSW, Australia. Specifically, it's {{a study of the}} role that individuals and community groups have in the decision-making process for issues affecting the coastal zone and its management. The current international benchmark for coastal management is the concept of "integrated coastal management (ICM) " (Cicin-Sain and Knecht, 1998). This implies a particular "focus on the interactions between the various activities and resource demands that occur within the coastal zone and between coastal zone activities in other regions (OECD 1993). " Stewardship, that is, a sense of public ownership, responsibility and involvement in decision-making of natural resources {{and the manner in which}} they are utilised or protected, is a key component of ICM today and for the future. [...] In this thesis, I argue that the current planning and management system for coastal management in New South Wales is not adequately equipped to monitor and evaluate public involvement / participation in the development and review of coastal management policies and programs. The current system, although responding to change, is off-track and there is a grave danger that a cynical and badly consulted public will lose interest in the management and protection of this precious resource. I will present a case that argues for the development of a model that monitors and evaluates public participation in coastal planning and management policies and programs, and recommend that it becomes imbeded within the New South Wales Coastal Policy as a tool that can be used by individuals, community groups and government to more effectively manage our <b>coasts.</b> <b>Mode</b> of access: World Wide Web. vii, 144 leaves ill., map...|$|R

40|$|Determination of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) {{distribution}} in the coastal waters {{is important to understand}} the coastal environmental conditions. This study was conducted to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of Chl-a along coastal waters of east Peninsular Malaysia and factors influencing its variability using Chl-a data derived from Aqua MODIS satellite (1 km spatial resolution) from January 2006 to December 2012. Chl-a variability was described using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. In-situ data (temperature, salinity, density and nitrate) and rainfall data from the Department of Meteorology were analyzed using spatial interpolation to determine factors influencing the distribution of Chl-a. The seasonal progressions of Chl-a showed high value during northeast monsoon along the coast. This variability was described by four modes of the EOF analysis. The first mode (72. 08 % of total variance) indicated seasonal cycle with high variability along the <b>coast.</b> Second <b>mode</b> (17. 03 % of variance) explained the northeast monsoon with high variability from river mouth to the south. Third mode (2. 39 % of variance) indicated variability during southwest monsoon along the coast and much higher to the south. Mode 4 (1. 93 % of variance) explained the inter-monsoon period observed along the northern and southern coastline.

40|$|Suspended {{particulate}} matter (SPM) measurements obtained along a cross-section {{in the central}} English Channel (Wight-Cotentin transect) indicate that the area may be differentiated into: (1) an English coastal zone, associated with the highest concentrations; (2) a French coastal zone, with intermediate concentrations; and (3) the offshore waters of the Channel, characterised by a very low suspended-sediment load. The SPM particle-size distribution was modal close to the English <b>coast</b> (main <b>mode</b> 10 – 12 ?m); {{the remainder of the}} area was characterised by flat SPM distributions. Examination of the diatom communities in the SPM suggests that material resuspended in the intertidal zone and the estuarine environments was advected towards the offshore waters of the English Channel. Considerable variations in SPM concentrations occurred during a tidal cycle: maximum concentrations were sometimes up to 3 times higher than the minimum concentrations. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the SPM concentration time series indicates that, although the bottom waters were more turbid than the surficial waters, this was not likely {{to be the result of}} in situ sediment resuspension. Instead, the observed variations appear to be controlled mainly by advective mechanisms. The limited resuspension was probably caused by: (1) the limited availability of fine-grained material within the bottom sediments; and (2) ‘bed-armouring’ processes which protect the finer-grained fractions of the seabed material from erosion and entrainment within the overlying flow during the less energetic stages of the tide...|$|R
40|$|The {{causes of}} the California drought during November-April winters of 2011 / 12 - 2013 / 14 are {{analyzed}} using observations and ensemble simulations with seven atmosphere models forced by observed SSTs. Historically, dry California winters are most commonly associated with a ridge off the west coast but no obvious SST forcing. Wet winters are most commonly associated with a trough off the west coast and an El Nino event. These attributes of dry and wet winters are captured {{by many of the}} seven models. According to the models, SST forcing can explain up to a third of California winter precipitation variance. SST forcing was key to sustaining a high pressure ridge over the west coast and suppressing precipitation during the three winters. In 2011 / 12 this was a response to a La Nina event, whereas in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 it appears related to a warm west-cool east tropical Pacific SST pattern. All models contain a mode of variability linking such tropical Pacific SST anomalies to a wave train with a ridge off the North American west <b>coast.</b> This <b>mode</b> explains less variance than ENSO and Pacific decadal variability, and its importance in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 was unusual. The models from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP 5) project rising greenhouse gases to cause changes in California all-winter precipitation that are very small compared to recent drought anomalies. However, a long-term warming trend likely contributed to surface moisture deficits during the drought. As such, the precipitation deficit during the drought was dominated by natural variability, a conclusion framed by discussion of differences between observed and modeled tropical SST trends...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the Gulf of Guinea, intraseasonal {{variability}} {{is large}} at the equator {{and along the}} coast. Current data on the continental slope near 7. 5 ° S show very energetic biweekly oscillations at 1300 m depth. A high resolution primitive equation numerical model demonstrates that this deep variability is forced by equatorial winds, through the generation of equatorial Yanai waves that propagate eastward and at depth, and then poleward as coastally-trapped waves upon reaching the coast of Africa. Intraseasonal variability is intensified {{along the coast of}} the Gulf of Guinea, especially in the 10 – 20 day period range and at depths between 500 and 1500 m. The kinetic energy distribution is well explained at first order by linear theory. Along the equator, eastward intensification of energy and bottom intensification are in qualitative agreement with vertically propagating Yanai waves, although the signal is influenced by the details of the bathymetry. Along the <b>coast,</b> baroclinic <b>modes</b> 3 to 5 are important close to the equator, and the signal is dominated by lower vertical modes farther south. Additional current meter data on the continental slope near 3 ° N display an energy profile in the 10 – 20 day period band that is strikingly different from the one at 7. 5 ° S, with surface intensification rather than bottom intensification and a secondary maximum near 800 m. The model reproduces these features and explains them: the surface intensification in the north is due to the regional wind forcing, and the north-south asymmetry of the deep signal is due to the presence of the zonal African coast near 5 ° N. A 4 years time series of current measurements at 7. 5 ° S shows that the biweekly oscillations are intermittent and vary from year to year. This intermittency is not well correlated with fluctuations of the equatorial winds and {{does not seem to be}} a simple linear response to the wind forcing...|$|R
