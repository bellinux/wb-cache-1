5000|$|In {{the past}} four years, the number of American Humane <b>Certified</b> <b>animals</b> has jumped more than 1,000%. Over 1 billion animals are now American Humane Certified. As of July 2012, it claimed to include 100 major producers, {{representing}} approximately 500 farms, [...] and more than 135 million animals. The auditing is done by American Humane, with the USDA also auditing the certifications to ensure compliance. The label informs purchasers that American Humane {{has found that the}} animals were not subjected to unnecessary pain, distress, or fear while being raised. Part of what the program demands is the implementation of minimum space requirements per animal on a farm or in farming facilities. American Humane currently certifies approximately 90 percent of cage-free eggs sold in the U.S.|$|E
40|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have appeared}} in the clinical literature over a period of many decades 1 that alcohol beverage consumption by pregnant women may introduce a risk to normal fetal deve-lopment. However, only during the last 10 years has a concerted scientific effort been made to re-evaluate this possibili-ty. In 1973 Jones and Smith 2 described a pattern of prenatal growth deficiency indicated by smaller than normal birth size and morphological anomalies in-cluding microcephaly, distortion of facial features, occasional cleft palate and defects in cardiac and limb struc-ture in babies born to alcoholic women. They named this clinical picture the 'fetal alcohol syndrome ' (FAS). Subsequently, studies were initiated in our laboratories to examine the hypothesis that an experimental model of FAS could be induced in the offspr-ing of beagle dogs. Initial success in this publication in 1976. 3 More extensive data and refinement of this model were recently described. 4 The remainder of this article will constitute a basic sum-mary about this FAS model. <b>Certified</b> <b>animals</b> are bred at the occurrence of the first estrus cycle in the females which are then randomly placed in either an 'experimental' (ethonol-treated) group or a 'control' (sucrose-treated) group. Experimental animals receive a measured quantity of 25 per cent, w/v, aqueous solution of ethanol by gastric intubation through-out gestation (about 63 days) or some segment thereof. In a given dosage group essentially one-half of an as-signed daily dose of ethanol is adminis-tered at approximately 12 -hour inter-vals.

40|$|AbstractThe {{paucity of}} dogs {{dedicated}} to animal-assisted therapy (AAT) for disabled people creates long waiting lists worldwide and compromises {{the health of}} the few <b>certified</b> <b>animals</b> by demanding too much work from them at times, thus jeopardizing their future as service dogs. In an attempt to obviate this situation, a mathematical model has been conceived to select animals endowed with a set of specific inborn skills from a population of sheltered dogs. The model is able to select dogs capable of creating a special bond with humans and able to work anywhere and with any human partner or team; it represents a rapid, inexpensive and coherent method and has been validated after 1 year of observation. The algorithm consists of three steps. Step A is a test assessing the aggressiveness and temperament of animals and selection occurs based on a binary criterion (yes or no). Step B is a test comprising three items and selects animals able to interact with humans; dogs have to fulfil two conditions to pass on to Step C. Step C is a test evaluating the animal's ability to respond appropriately to easy commands (trainability) given by different partners; dogs have to fulfil two interrelated conditions judged more flexibly than in test B. The aims of the Ethotest are: (a) to prevent aggressive animals from entering animal-assisted activity and/or Therapy programmes; (b) to select dogs with the right aptitude and especially to restrict selection to dogs that offer consistent responses; (c) to include both male and female purebreds or mix breeds older than 1 year of age; (d) to identify animals able to work with different partners. Moreover, the aim of this contribution is to share with the scientific community an easy method to select shelter dogs as safe companion animals...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} on-farm quality {{assurance}} schemes for red meat producers across Australia {{were developed in}} the late 1990 s in response to increasing global demands for greater accountability within the whole food. The Cattlecare and Flockcare schemes were introduced in 1996 and 1998, respectively, to provide mechanisms for producers to demonstrate that their livestock were free of potential chemical residues, {{and that they had}} taken measures to prevent injury or stress to livestock. These schemes were independently audited codes of practice. After several years there was some dissatisfaction with the levels of adoption of these schemes, especially Flockcare. By 2001 just over 5 % of all cattle producers and just over 1 % of all sheep producers had implemented on-farm quality assurance. This covered nearly 16 % of all cattle and 2 % of all sheep in Australia, indicating that the larger than average producers were implementing quality assurance. Based on previous studies and anecdotal evidence that there were few current benefits for producers, the aims of this study were to identify the reasons for slow uptake and to quantify factors affecting implementation of on-farm quality assurance in the red meat industry. Surveys of "adopters" and "nou-adopters" of these schemes were developed and implemented in 2000 and 2001. Producers were approached initially by phone and given the options of completing the survey over the phone, by mail or by fax. Three hundred and forty-seven Cattlecare producers (9 % of all certified Cattlecare producers) and 142 Flockcare producers (22 % of certified Flockcare producers) across Australia were initially approached. A total of 382 adopter surveys were completed. The level of interest from adopters was remarkable, with a 75 % completion rate from telephone approaches and only 9 direct refusals. These producers had over 1. 3 million cattle and 0. 9 million sheep covered by quality assurance schemes. This represented 5 % of the total cattle population (27 % of certified cattle) and less than 1 % of all sheep (26 % of certified sheep) in Australia at that time. There was an extremely large variation in the size of properties surveyed, which reflected the structure of the industry. The producers were asked about what motivated them to implement quality assurance, what were the problems, where could it be improved, how much time and money had they invested specifically into implementing quality assurance, what benefits had they gained (financial and other), how it had changed their management or product offered for sale, and their opinion on various issues associated with quality assurance and food safety. In addition 133 non-adopter surveys were also completed to provide a control data set. These producers had over 0. 12 million cattle and 0. 48 million sheep on their properties. In general, it was much harder to persuade these producers to participate. It was estimated that about 60 % of producers approached refused to participate. These producers were asked similar questions; except that they were asked to estimate (if they could) how much time and money it would take to implement quality assurance. Unfortunately, most of these producers were uninterested or knew little about quality assurance and were reluctant to estimate these values, so the data for these producers was very limited. Analysis of the adopter data indicated the adoption rates between regions and schemes were significantly different. A benefit cost analysis was completed for the adopters based on estimated time and money invested into quality assurance and the tangible benefits gained from selling <b>certified</b> <b>animals.</b> The resulting net benefits were calculated as annual equivalent annuities. Only about 30 % of adopters had gained any tangible benefit, and only half of these (15 % of the total analysed producers) had a positive net benefit, and these were all cattle producers. Description of time, effort and money spend by adopting producers was most representative using median values due to the extreme data from some producers. Overall, implementation took a median of 13 days in the initial year and 6 days in subsequent years per property, and the median cost was $ 1, 200 in the initial year and $ 500 in subsequent years. This investment of time and money equated to a median cost of $ 875 per year. The median net financial loss per year from adopting quality assurance was $ 660 per property or $ 2 per 100 DSE of livestock managed. Producers indicated that they were implementing quality assurance to gain financial and market benefits; but, with only 15 % of producers gaining a positive net benefit, some producers were disappointed with the schemes. However they did report improvements in product (15 % of producers) or management practices (90 % had at least one). Improvements in product included livestock were free from chemical residues, cattle were dehorned and yards had been improved so bruising was reduced. Improvements in management practices included improved record keeping, chemical control and livestock handling. While producers mostly believed {{it was the right thing}} to do for the industry, they indicated that they would need to be rewarded for their efforts at some stage. Adopters and non-adopters had different motives for implementing quality assurance. Peer pressure, market advantage and increased returns (27 %, 26 % and 18 % of producers, respectively) were cited as the three major prompts for adopters. All the other categories of reasons for adoption were not business-based, but more emotional. Non-adopters, however, cited increased returns, market advantage and supply chain pressure (44 %, 7 % and 6 %, respectively) as possible prompts to implement quality assurance. Difficulties in adoption actually experienced by adopters were also different to the difficulties anticipated by non-adopters. Paperwork, actually getting to implementing it and the extra time demands (19 %, 13 % and 12 %, respectively) were the major difficulties for adopters, while time, in costs and paperwork (19 %, 16 % and 12 %, respectively) were the anticipated difficulties for non-adopters. Twenty-four percent of adopters had not had any difficulties, while 16 % of non- adopters anticipated no difficulties. Simplification of initial paperwork, increased demand for quality assured livestock and a need to promote the schemes and the associated benefits to producers were the three highest ranking categories of suggested improvements by adopters. Non-adopters indicated similar issues but in a different order - a need to promote the schemes and the associated benefits to producers, simplification of initial paperwork and the process of implementation. Grouping producers based on inputs, attitudes, investment or any combination of these indicators failed to provide a statistically significant prediction of the net benefit or loss for a new adopter. The only way to identify or predict which producers would gain a positive net benefit was to focus on the methods of selling livestock. Selling direct to processors either over the hook, with forward contracts or privately appeared to be the only way to gain financial benefits from implementing quality assurance on-farm...|$|E

40|$|Attitudes towards beef {{animal welfare}} (AW) and Willingness to Pay (WTP) for AW {{certification}} are investigated among consumers in two Spanish and two French regions located {{on both sides}} of the Pyrenees (n= 1213). Attitudes were measured through a scale of 11 animal practices, on which, consumers report their degree of concern and trust on the supply chain compliance. Attitudes significantly differed across regions, especially with respect to those AW practices carried out by farmers, while trust lies behind concerns. Three segments based on individual consumer attitudes are defined by opposing those consumers who are more concerned and who trust more on the compliance with AW standards (n= 264, 22 %) to those less concerned and who are more uncertain about stakeholders´ compliance with AW rules (n= 356, 29 %). Consumer location, gender, age and education significantly differed across attitudinal clusters. Results from a contingent valuation survey show that WTP for <b>certified</b> <b>animal</b> friendly beef ranged between 20. 6 % and 22. 6 % over the average market price of standard beef, in Spain and France, respectively. Both, consumers’ socio demographic characteristics and habits regarding beef meat purchasing and attitudes towards farmers influenced this WTP (the more consumers trust in farmers’ involvement in animal welfare, the highest is their WTP), while a negative overall attitude significantly reduced WTP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The residents performances on the computer were compared with those obtained by other training groups: medical students with no surgical background, senior surgeons with experience in the laparoscopy field and non medical students with referred ability in videogames. The residents were also sent to a well <b>certified</b> live <b>animal</b> laboratory where they could perform a cholecystectomy in a pig. Their operation was assessed by two independent observers using a new scoring methods for assessing the operative errors. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences among the groups could be seen only after several tasks sessions and in the more surgical specific tasks. The first data analysis shows a fair correlation between the residents rank positions after the training tasks on the simulator and those obtained in the surgical operation. CONCLUSION: Even if the data are not conclusive and the surgical simulators must develop greater levels of fidelity and operational diversity, the potential value of simulation in the educational surgical field appears to be impressive.
