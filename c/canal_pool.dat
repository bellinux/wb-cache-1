40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new method to tune robust distant {{downstream}} PI controllers for an irrigation <b>canal</b> <b>pool.</b> The method emphasizes {{the role of}} gain and phase margins in the controller design, by linking the selection of these robustness indicators to the time domain specifications. This leads to link the frequency domain approach used by automatic control engineers to the time domain approach used by hydraulic engineers. The maximum error corresponding to an unpredicted perturbation is shown to be directly linked to the gain margin and the settling time to the phase margin of the controlled system. The tuning method gives analytical expressions for the controller parameters as function of physical parameters of the <b>canal</b> <b>pool</b> {{in order to satisfy}} desired performance requirements. The model is first expressed in terms of dimensionless variables, in order to get generic tuning formulas.

This paper focuses on short <b>canal</b> <b>pools</b> where the interactions are stronger between <b>canal</b> <b>pools.</b> Could this procedure be better if gate openings were used as control action variables and the interconnected system were modeled for the controller? Model predictive controllers (MPCs) were developed using the discharge and the gate opening as control action variable and tested experimentally using the laboratory canal of the Technical University of Catalonia. It was found that for centralized MPCs for short <b>canal</b> <b>pools,</b> the use of gate opening as control action variable is more beneficial than discharge.

CAP carries water from the Colorado River at Lake Havasu toTucson. The CAP canal system is a 540 km long system of conveyance system aqueducts, tunnels, pumping plants,pipelines and a large reservoir (just north of Phoenix, AZ). Water is pumped uphill from the Colorado River. This study was conducted for the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which starts at the after bay of the Bouse Hill Pumping Plant and extends to the fore bay of the Salt-Gila Pumping Plant, which is {{just south of the}} Salt River, east of Phoenix. Additional pumping plants downstream lift water uphill to Tucson. The canal between adjacent pumping plants defines a canal segment. A sloping lined canal with check structures carries water between power plants. The canal between adjacent check structures defines a <b>canal</b> <b>pool.</b> The Pumping Plants use electric motors to power the pumps. Power outages could cause the canal to overtop at the fore bay of these power plants, since the flow in the canal would not stop with a power outage. The check structures in between the power plants can be closed with battery-operated electric motors. This was intended to contain water within each <b>canal</b> <b>pool,</b> if power is lost. Stopping the pumping plants and closing the check gates causes surge waves in the canal.

The observers are based on an analytically approximate model of canal hydrodynamics. Each observer is insensitive to one fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. Design of observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality (LMI) method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the attacker’s goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also comment on the criticality of sensor measurements {{for the purpose of}} detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a successful deception attack.

40|$|The {{first rule}} {{regarding}} irrigation district canal automation {{is that there}} is no single "best " method of automation. As an example, the cost of automating a small lateral structure with a computerized gate is similar to the cost of automating a regulating gate on a large canal, although the respective justifiable budgets may be $ 1000 versus $ 100, 000 per structure. The locations of buffer reservoirs, the ability to allow water to spill at the ends of canals, the storage capacity of <b>canal</b> <b>pools,</b> and the topography will also play key roles in deciding if automation is desirable, and what type of automation should be used. These typical engineering considerations must also be coupled with recognition of the limitations and abilities of irrigation district staff regarding maintenance and troubleshooting of sophisticated controls.

Environmental pressures and the increased competition for the scarce water resources make on-farm irrigation management changes inevitable. There is a definite limit to on-farm improvements unless the main item, water, arrives in a flexible and farmer-controllable fashion.
