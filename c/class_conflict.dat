5|$|The other {{important}} contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> {{and to see the}} modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, the Great War {{had been}} ongoing {{for almost two}} years, during which anarchists had taken part in anti-war {{movements}} across Europe, issuing numerous anti-war statements in anarchist and leftist publications. In February 1915, a statement was issued by an assembly of anarchists from various regions, including England, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Russia, France, and the Netherlands. The document was signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} the current system of society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a defensive and offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> and the liberation of oppressed populaces as a means by which to resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E

5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

50|$|In {{her second}} novel, The Last English Plantation, Shinebourne sets her story in 1956 when the {{political}} fractures of the 1960s began to show. This time, she chooses {{a much younger}} female protagonist, a 12-year-old, June Lehall, as she prepares to venture out of her rural community {{to go to an}} urban secondary school. Like Sandra Yansen in Timepiece, she also experiences the culture shock of confronting the intense race and <b>class</b> <b>conflicts</b> that colonialism bred in the country. We see June enter school and getting swept up in the race and <b>class</b> <b>conflicts</b> between her classmates. She has to learn to fight her own battles and struggles to survive. In Timepiece, Sandra does not go through anything like this in Georgetown where these conflicts exist more under the surface.|$|R

25|$|Nationalism was contested by the pro-Russian element {{and by the}} internationalism of {{the labor}} movement. The result was a {{tendency}} to <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> over nationalism, but the early 1900s the working classes split into the Valpas (class struggle emphasis) and Mäkelin (nationalist emphasis).|$|E
25|$|This {{was also}} a period of social {{upheaval}} in Ireland, with frequent strikes {{as well as other}} manifestations of <b>class</b> <b>conflict.</b> In this regard, the IRA acted to a large degree as an agent of social control and stability, driven by the need to preserve cross-class unity in the national struggle, and on occasion being used to break strikes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics have}} seen social {{commentary}} {{in much of}} Romero's work. They view Night of the Living Dead as a film made {{in reaction to the}} turbulent 1960s, Dawn of the Dead as a satire on consumerism, Day of the Dead as a study of the conflict between science and the military, and Land of the Dead as an examination of <b>class</b> <b>conflict.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{play was}} his first comedy. The play theme is from recent {{political}} incidents in Hamburg, Germany. Holberg ridicules the political involvement {{of a group of}} craftsmen. Some interpreters see a clear anti-democratic tendency in the play, but there is also ambiguity in the way the story of <b>class</b> <b>conflicts</b> and political rebellion is told.|$|R
50|$|The storyline was {{becoming}} increasingly complicated and contrived, and viewers began turning the show off in droves. However, in 1992, new executive producer Linda Gottlieb and head writer Michael Malone would rejuvenate the series, largely {{by returning to}} its roots of social <b>class</b> <b>conflicts</b> with stories such as gang rape and refueling the rivalry between Viki and Dorian.|$|R
50|$|The songs tell {{personal}} stories {{of life in}} the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, sheep shearing, wanderings, war stories, the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, <b>class</b> <b>conflicts</b> between the landless working class and the squatters (landowners), and bushrangers such as Ned Kelly, as well as love interests and more modern fare such as trucking.|$|R
25|$|Other post-processualists have instead {{taken the}} view of {{sociologist}} Karl Marx (1818–1883) that <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> was the force for this social change. In this manner they share similarities with Marxist archaeologists. A minority of post-processualists, such as Julian Thomas have however argued that human agency is not a useful aspect for looking at past societies, thereby accepting a culturally determinist position.|$|E

25|$|The {{new system}} of Vocational Panels used to {{nominate}} candidates for the Seanad was inspired by Roman Catholic social teaching of the 1930s, {{and in particular the}} 1931 papal encyclical Quadragesimo anno. In this document Pope Pius XI argued that the Marxist concept of <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> should be replaced with a vision of social order based on the co-operation and interdependence of society's various vocational groups.|$|E
5000|$|This {{statement}} is {{a foundation of}} Marx's historical materialism insofar as it specifies what the <b>class</b> <b>conflicts</b> in civil society are ultimately about: an economy of time, which compels some to do work of which part {{or all of the}} benefits go to someone else, while others can have leisure-time which in reality depends on the work efforts of those forced to work.|$|R

50|$|Two {{years after}} World War II, peace still is in {{uncertain}} balance. People are in suspense {{and in several}} nations <b>class</b> <b>conflicts</b> are being incited to mutual hatred.

Working people are exploited and incited to discord.|$|R
25|$|During the French Mandate, the {{district}} of Hama contained within its bounds the municipality of Hama and 114 villages. By an estimate in 1930, only four of these villages were owned outright by local cultivators, while sharing ownership of two villages with a notable family. Thus, the hinterland was owned by landowning elites. Starting in the late 1940s, significant <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> erupted as agricultural workers sought reform in Hama.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} socialist parties {{initially}} supported the war {{when it began}} in August 1914. But European socialists split on national lines, {{with the concept of}} <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> held by radical socialists such as Marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support for war. Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{intention}} of resolving internal <b>class</b> <b>conflict,</b> the Velasco government determined to lessen Peru's dependency on the outside world. The two most important components of the strategy were a drive to promote rapid industrialization and an attack on the role of foreign firms. In contrast to the industrialization strategies of most other Latin American countries, the intention of the Velasco regime was to industrialize without welcoming foreign investment.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 19th century, Chorzów {{experienced}} a revival of Polish national feelings. Ethnic tensions were mixed with the religious and <b>class</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Karol Miarka was the editor of Polish books and newspapers including Katolik (The Catholic) published in Królewska Huta since 1868, Poradnik Gospodarski since 1879. He was also the founder of several organizations: Upper Silesian Union, Upper Silesian Peasants Union. Juliusz Ligoń was a Polish activist and poet.|$|R
25|$|Insurrectionary anarchism is {{a revolutionary}} theory, {{practice}} and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes {{the theme of}} insurrection within anarchist practice. It opposes formal organizations such as labor unions and federations {{that are based on}} a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists support informal organization and small affinity group based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent <b>class</b> <b>conflict,</b> and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.|$|E
25|$|In other cities, <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> {{was more}} evident. Over {{a quarter of}} London's {{population}} had left the city by November 1940. Civilians left for more remote areas of the country. Upsurges in population in south Wales and Gloucester intimated where these displaced people went. Other reasons, including industry dispersal {{may have been a}} factor. However, resentment of rich self-evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social order. The total number of evacuees numbered 1.4 million, including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families. Reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children. Far from displaying the nation's unity in time of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. Within four months, 88% of evacuated mothers, 86% of small children, and 43% of school children had been returned home. The lack of bombing in the Phoney War contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again.|$|E
25|$|Massachusetts also endured <b>class</b> <b>conflict</b> {{during this}} period. In the 1912 general strike in Lawrence, {{almost all of}} the town's mills were forced to shut down as a result of strife over wages that {{sustained}} only poverty. The Commonwealth was confronted with issues of worker conditions and wages. For example, when the legislature decreed that women and children could work only 50 hours per week, employers cut wages proportionally. Eventually, the demands of the Lawrence strikers were heeded, and a pay increase was made.|$|E
5000|$|Marx {{saw that}} each stage or epoch {{created a new}} [...] class or {{invention}} {{that would lead to}} its downfall. However the downfall would not be an automatically negative event, since with each step humanity at large would benefit. Each passing stage would therefore raise the standard of living of the masses {{while at the same time}} be doomed to its own downfall because of internal contradictions and <b>class</b> <b>conflicts.</b>|$|R

50|$|He {{also had}} an {{integration}} theory. He believed that early civilizations were not stratified based on property. They were only stratified based on unequal political power, not because of unequal access to resources. He believed there were no true <b>class</b> <b>conflicts,</b> but only power struggles between the political elite in early civilizations. The integration part of this theory was that monuments were created through volunteering, not the leaders forcing it upon the populace.|$|R
