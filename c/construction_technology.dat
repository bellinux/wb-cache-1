40|$|Purpose - The {{users of}} <b>construction</b> <b>technologies</b> such as {{builders}} and trades {{people have been}} acknowledged as sources of potentially important innovations. These innovations {{may be in the}} form of safer, less labour intensive, or cheaper methods and processes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess whether the Australian construction industry is providing an environment where user-based innovation is being supported and implemented. Design/methodology/approach - An explorative study was undertaken to provide an insight into actual experiences of the implementation of user-based innovation. The data were collected through faceto- face semi-structured interviews providing case studies on multiple aspects of the implementation of innovative <b>construction</b> <b>technologies.</b> The cases involved a cross section of advances, including product, tool, and system technologies. Findings - The main motivation behind developing the technologies was problem solving. The associated industries of manufacturing and retail, as well as consultants within the construction industry present the greatest barriers to implementation. Originality/value - This research provides a better understanding of the factors that are preventing the successful implementation of user-based innovative <b>construction</b> <b>technologies</b> in small firms...|$|R
