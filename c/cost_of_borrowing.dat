40|$|This paper {{examines}} how net income, non－performing loans, and operational fixed－assets of main bank {{are associated with}} the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms. Results <b>of</b> this study indicate that the association between non－performing loans and the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms is statistically positive and the association between operational fixed－assets and agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms is statistically negative. This implies that non－performing loans and operational fixed－assets of main bank are significantly associated with the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms. Specifically, non－performing loans increase the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms, whereas operational－fixed assets decrease the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms. These results suggest that non－performing loans and operational fixed－assets are significantly associated with not only banks themselves but also the agency <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms.

25|$|Adjustable rates {{transfer}} part of {{the interest}} rate risk from the lender to the borrower. They can be used where unpredictable interest rates make fixed rate loans difficult to obtain.

25|$|MMT economists {{regard the}} concept of the money multiplier, where a bank is {{completely}} constrained in lending through the deposits it holds and its capital requirement, as misleading. Rather than being a practical limitation on lending, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> funds from the interbank market (or the central bank) represents a profitability consideration when the private bank lends in excess of its reserve and/or capital requirements (see interaction between government and the banking sector).|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} {{inflation}} {{have also been}} associated with a growth in Iran's money supply. The Central Bank's {{data suggest that the}} money supply growth has been about 40% annually. The rapid growth of money supply came from high demands for borrowing capital at the rate of 12% the banks offer, imposed by the Government to make credit accessible to average Iranians and small entrepreneurs. However, this rate is lower than the rate of inflation. This makes the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> less than free market cost as determined by supply and demand, based on the inflation rate and investment risk.|$|E

Further, the empirical analysis based on the primary (survey) data has analysed and established that microfinance models of lending offer considerably lower <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> than those in regular models of direct lending by banks.

2500|$|Borrow cost is the {{fee paid}} to a {{securities}} lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> {{the stock is}} usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account - in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted {{for less than a}} 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become [...] "hard to borrow" [...] as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> these stocks can become significant - in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) Krispy Kreme stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock {{over the course of the}} year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply. This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant convenience yield for holding the stock (similar to additional dividend) - for instance, put-call parity relationships are broken and the early exercise feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become rational to exercise early, which otherwise would not be economical.|$|E

2500|$|This vision {{produces}} a core proposition in textbook neoclassical economics, i.e., that the income earned by each [...] "factor of production" [...] (essentially, labor and [...] "capital") {{is equal to}} its marginal product. Thus, with perfect product and input markets, the wage (divided by {{the price of the}} product) is alleged to equal the marginal physical product of labor. More importantly for the discussion here, the rate of profit (sometimes confused with the rate of interest, i.e., the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> funds) is supposed to equal the marginal physical product of capital. (For simplicity, abbreviate [...] "capital goods" [...] as [...] "capital.") A second core proposition is that a change in the price of a factor of production will lead to a change in the use of that factor [...] an increase in the rate of profit (associated with falling wages) will lead to more of that factor being used in production. The law of diminishing marginal returns implies that greater use of this input will imply a lower marginal product, all else equal: since a firm is getting less from adding a unit of capital goods than is received from the previous one, the rate of profit must increase to encourage the employment of that extra unit, assuming profit maximization.|$|E
