40|$|The SLC Control {{system at}} SLAC {{has evolved into}} a {{powerful}} tool for operation of the accelerator and for troubleshooting the unique problems encountered in extracting maximum performance from the SLC. The evolution has included the development of many custom applications and user interface features generated from accelerator operator and accelerator physicist requests. These applications are written and maintained primarily by the Controls Software Engineering group, and not by the users themselves. The process of developing and supporting user requested control systems applications at SLAC is described, including the effects of organizational structure, formal and informal procedures, and control system architecture. The SLC Control System in general terms [1] consists of: • a SLC Control Program (SCP) that operators use from an X-windows <b>compatible</b> <b>terminal.</b> The terminal may be equipped with a touch-sensitive screen to address the SCP's menu. • the database describing accelerator devices. • a host VAX which runs the SCP, database and other applications. • standard SLC 80386 microprocessors that run the Intel RMX operating system, and are geographically distributed throughout the accelerator to control and monitor devices...|$|E
40|$|The Automation Technology Branch of NASA's Langley Research Center is {{employing}} {{increasingly complex}} degrees of operator/robot cooperation (telerobotics). A good {{relationship between the}} operator and computer is essential for smooth performance by a telerobotic system. ESG (Expert Script Generator) is a software package that automatically generates high-level task objective commands from the NASA Intelligent Systems Research Lab's (ISRL's) complex menu-driven language. ESG reduces errors and makes the telerobotics lab accessible to researchers who {{are not familiar with}} the comprehensive language developed by ISRL for interacting with the various systems of the ISRL testbed. ESG incorporates expert system technology to capture the typical rules of operation that a skilled operator would use. The result is an operator interface which optimizes the system's capability to perform a task remotely in a hazardous environment, in a timely manner, and without undue stress to the operator, while minimizing the chance for operator errors that may damage equipment. The intricate menu-driven command interface which provides for various control modes of both manipulators and their associated sensors in the TeleRobotic System Simulation (TRSS) has a syntax which is both irregular and verbose. ESG eliminates the following two problems with this command "language": 1) knowing the correct command sequence to accomplish a task, and 2) inputting a known command sequence without typos and other errors. ESG serves as an additional layer of interface, working in conjunction with the menu command processor, not supplanting it. By specifying task-level commands, such as GRASP, CONNECT, etc., ESG will generate the appropriate menu elements to accomplish the task. These elements will be collected in a script file which can then be executed by the ISRL menu command processor. In addition, the operator can extend the list of task-level commands to include customized tasks composed of sub-task commands. This mechanism gives the operator the ability to build a task-hierarchy tree of increasingly powerful commands. ESG also provides automatic regeneration of scripts based on system knowledge of telerobotic environment updates. The commands generated by ESG may be displayed at the terminal screen and/or stored. ESG is implemented as a rule-based expert system written in CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System). The system consists of a knowledge-base of task heuristics, a static (unchanged during execution) database which describes the physical features of objects, and a dynamic (may change as a result of task achievement) database which maintains changes in the environment. Capabilites are provided for adding new environmental objects and for modifying existing objects and configuration data. Options are available for interactively viewing both the static and dynamic attribute values of database items. Execution of the ESG may be suspended to allow access to system-level functions. ESG was implemented on a VAX 11 / 780 with the VMS 4. 7 operating system using a VT 100 <b>compatible</b> <b>terminal.</b> Its source code is 47 % CLIPS and 53 % C-language, with a memory requirement of approximately 205 KB.

5000|$|This {{code was}} {{originally}} used to mark deleted characters on punched tape, since any character could {{be changed to}} all ones by punching holes everywhere. If a character was punched erroneously, punching out all seven bits caused this position to be ignored or deleted, a computer version of correction fluid. In hexadecimal, this is 7F to rubout 7 bits, and FF to rubout 8 bits. For teleprinters like the Teletype Model 33, lines were commonly ended by the three characters CR, LF, and rubout, with the rubout allowing time for the print mechanism to physically move to the left margin. On VT100 <b>compatible</b> <b>terminals,</b> this is the character generated by the key labeled Delete, which transmits a delete character (octal 177, hexadecimal 7F) to the host system.
