Once these rumors reached Congress, the Mint sent out press releases debunking this myth. Despite the Mint's denial, there were rumors into the 1950s {{that there had been}} a secret deal at the Yalta <b>Conference</b> <b>to</b> honor Stalin on a U.S. coin.

5|$|In December 1997, Suharto for {{the first}} time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later {{revealed}} to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E

All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill-advised, and so convened the Washington Naval <b>Conference</b> <b>to</b> discuss arms limitations, which produced the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February 1922. Under the terms of Article II of the treaty, South Carolina and her sister Michigan were to be scrapped. The ship was decommissioned on 15 December, but was not formally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register until 10 November 1923.

Substitute Henrik Larsson set up Juliano Belletti to score the winner for Barcelona. Wenger used his post-match press <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> criticise referee Terje Hauge for sending off Lehmann, a view later shared by club captain Henry and FIFA president Sepp Blatter.|$|E
