25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was a pleasure to watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the <b>cutting</b> <b>board,</b> a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. Just before we went to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E

40|$|Biofilm {{formation}} on {{food processing}} surfaces {{has been well}} documented. Plastic <b>cutting</b> <b>boards</b> used in the foodservice/commercial food preparation kitchen setting would be ideal surfaces for a biofilm to form. The purpose of this experiment {{was to determine if}} biofilms were capable of forming on <b>cutting</b> <b>boards</b> that were used in a foodservice/commercial food preparation kitchen. Three 25 cm 2 surface areas were randomly selected on 15 plastic <b>cutting</b> <b>boards</b> (n = 45) from a food preparation kitchen to be swabbed before and after proper cleaning and sanitizing. Swabs were diluted in buffered peptone water, serial dilutions made on Plate Count Agar and incubated for 48 hours at 37 °C. The average aerobic plate count for the plastic <b>cutting</b> <b>boards</b> before sanitation was 1. 31 x 10 E 4 + 2. 00 x 10 E 4 CFU/ 25 cm 2. After sanitation of the plastic <b>cutting</b> <b>boards,</b> the average aerobic plate count was 1. 35 x 10 E 3 + 1. 91 x 10 E 3 CFU/ 25 cm 2. The results indicate that plastic <b>cutting</b> <b>boards,</b> even after cleaning and sanitizing, can support biofilms when they are heavily scarred and discolored...|$|R
2500|$|Bobby Flay: Flay {{entered into}} {{a bit of a}} rivalry with Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto during the show's special New York Battle. Flay complained that his side of the kitchen was poorly laid out (it was noted in an Iron Chef America [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] episode that the kitchen was hastily set up in the {{provided}} forum). [...] At one point Flay received an electric shock, transmitted by a wet floor and faulty wiring, when he grabbed a metal pan on the range. When Flay stood on his <b>cutting</b> <b>board</b> {{at the end of the}} battle, Morimoto declared that Flay was [...] "not a chef" [...] for disregarding the cleanliness of one's <b>cutting</b> <b>board.</b> Morimoto won, but Flay was offered a rematch. He accepted, and got his revenge, in the 21st Century Battle in Japan, where, at battle's end, he tossed the <b>cutting</b> <b>board</b> off the counter before climbing on it, so as not to offend Morimoto again. [...] Flay is now an Iron Chef alongside Morimoto on Iron Chef America. This rivalry was revisited for a third time with Morimoto defeating Flay during the Holiday Ice Battle (November 2009- Iron Chef America) ...|$|E
2500|$|Godamba roti {{is another}} variety of roti that {{is found in}} many {{restaurants}} in Sri Lanka. Plain godamba roti is eaten with curry or {{it can also be}} wrapped around a savory filling. To prepare one needs to [...] mix together the flour, salt and the tablespoon of oil and rub together. [...] Then lukewarm water is added, mixed and kneaded for approximately 10 minutes. The next step is making balls and spreading a layer of oil on the outer layer of the flour ball. [...] On a <b>cutting</b> <b>board</b> or flat surface, the balls are flattened with the fingers or palms. The shape may be square, round or oval. After flattening, place the spread-out roti on a hot square pan. The roti is left to cook on the pan until it becomes golden brown. Then it is flipped to the other side. Once both sides are golden brown, the godamba roti is ready to be consumed.|$|E
2500|$|Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay then {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of Nilsen's arrest and his [...] "calm, matter-of-fact" [...] confessions, before reading to the court several statements volunteered by Nilsen following his arrest. In one of these statements, Nilsen had stated: [...] "I have no tears for my victims; I have no tears for myself, nor those bereaved by my actions". Jay admitted it was unusual for anyone accused of such horrific crimes to be so forthcoming in providing information; conceding upon questioning by the defence counsel that Nilsen not only provided most of the evidence against himself, but also encouraged the discovery of evidence which could contradict {{his own version of}} events. Following the testimony of DCI Jay, Detective Superintendent Chambers recited Nilsen's formal confession to the court. This testimony included graphic descriptions of the ritualistic and sexual acts Nilsen performed with his victims' bodies, his various methods of storage of bodies and/or body parts, dismemberment and disposal, and the problems decomposition — particularly regarding colonies of maggots — afforded him. Several members of the jury were visibly shaken throughout much of this testimony; others looked at Nilsen with incredulous expressions on their faces as Nilsen listened to the testimony with apparent indifference. This testimony lasted until the following morning, when the prosecution included several exhibits into evidence. This included the cooking pot in which Nilsen had boiled the heads of the victims killed at Cranley Gardens, the <b>cutting</b> <b>board</b> Nilsen had used to dissect John Howlett, and several rusted catering knives which had formerly belonged to victim Martyn Duffey.|$|E
