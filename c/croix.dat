5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. <b>Croix</b> Railroad's proposed line from the St. <b>Croix</b> River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located.

5|$|The fur {{trade was}} in decline {{by the late}} 1830s. The American Fur Company went {{bankrupt}} in 1842, though the Missouri Fur Company and other operations kept the trade from collapsing entirely. As this trade declined the lumber industry began to grow substantially {{in areas such as}} the Saint <b>Croix</b> Valley where valuable white pine was plentiful. New saw mills appeared in Marine and Stillwater. Lumber was typically cut during winter and sent downstream in the spring. In 1848, businessman Franklin Steele built the first private sawmill on the Saint Anthony Falls (which would later become the town of Saint Anthony) opening commercial lumbering on the Mississippi River. More sawmills quickly followed. Soon the Saint <b>Croix</b> and Mississippi Rivers in Minnesota had become major conduits for lumber headed for Saint Louis and other destinations.|$|E
5|$|This {{operation}} consisted {{mainly of}} a series of marches from Carrefour de la <b>Croix</b> to Camp Bois-l'Évêque. The battalion arrived at Camp Bois de L' Eveque on 18 August 1918.

A hurricane in 1989 destroyed her home in St. <b>Croix.</b> While in New York, inquiring about the costs of rebuilding, she suffered six successive heart attacks and underwent an angioplasty.

5|$|Following heavy {{damage to}} the coral reef around Curaçao, workers placed reef balls to assist in {{replenishing}} the damaged structure. In Puerto Rico, workers quickly responded to power and water outages. Similarly on Saint <b>Croix,</b> power systems were quickly restored. On November23, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area. This allocated federal funding for loans to public and private entities and provided 75percent {{of the cost of}} debris removal. By December10, nearly 3,000residents had applied for assistance, mostly on St. <b>Croix.</b> In response, the federal government provided about $480,000 to the affected people. The United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $185,000, mostly directed toward the United Nations Development Programme, for aid to other islands in the eastern Caribbean. Other agencies, including the Caribbean Development Bank, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, and the European Union, provided $1.1million in assistance.|$|E
