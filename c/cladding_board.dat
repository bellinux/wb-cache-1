40|$|One {{reason for}} the {{decreased}} durability of modern claddings {{is considered to be}} the use of deformation-sensitive cladding boards. At {{the end of the nineteenth}} century cladding boards were about 40  mm thick, whereas present-day instructions recommend about 20  mm thick boards for claddings. The first aim of the study was to compare the cupping sensitivity of heat-treated and non-heat-treated cladding boards during cyclic moisture conditions. The second aim was to investigate the progress of the moisture profile in wooden <b>cladding</b> <b>board</b> as a result of short-term single-sided water soaking. The third aim was to investigate the development of swelling stresses in the tangential direction in spruce (Picea abies) as a function of water soaking time in order to provide basic data. The cupping studies were conducted with full-scale test walls in laboratory conditions with specimens made of heat-treated and non-heat-treated timber. The moisture distribution study was based on a theoretical approach, after which the modeling results were compared to those of previously published studies. Experimental swelling stress results were compared to the theoretical calculations obtained from different models. On the basis of the cupping results, the thickness and heat-treatment of the board affected both the rate and the extent of curving during cyclic moisture conditions. The species of wood was also found to be an important consideration for selecting stable boards for the cladding. On the basis of the moisture distribution results, the transverse moisture profile could be predicted using a transport model in which air pressure and other resistance factors were compensated using an apparent surface emission coefficient. The modeling results were almost identical to the experimental observations. On the basis of the swelling stress study it appears that the magnitude of the swelling stresses in spruce samples in the tangential direction was approximately 1. 2  MPa. reviewe...|$|E

The proposed antenna will be designed on single sided FR 4 sheet or copper <b>clad</b> <b>board.</b> We have also proposed various designs on the radiating patch using seven segment patterns. The main idea behind using concept of seven segment type patterns is that, using the same antenna we can get various designs which can be operated at different frequencies. We can connect the various segments using switch and then using the same antenna we can get various alpha-numeric design...|$|R
50|$|Though tobacco barn designs varied greatly {{there were}} {{elements}} {{that were found}} in many US tobacco barns. Design elements which were common include: gabled roofs, frame construction, and some system of ventilation. The venting can appear in different incarnations but commonly hinges would be attached {{to some of the}} <b>cladding</b> <b>boards,</b> so that they could be opened. Often the venting system would be more elaborate, including a roof ventilation system. In addition, tobacco barns do cross over into other barn styles of their day. Some common types of barn designs integrated into tobacco barns include, English barns and bank barns.|$|R

50|$|Design {{elements}} {{which were}} common to American tobacco barns include: gabled roofs, frame construction, and some system of ventilation. The venting can appear in different incarnations but commonly hinges would {{be attached to}} some of the <b>cladding</b> <b>boards,</b> so that they could be opened. Often the venting system would be more elaborate, including a roof ventilation system. The interior would have its framing set up in bents about ten to fifteen feet apart so that laths with tobacco attached to them could be hung for drying. There is no one design that typifies tobacco barns but they share some common elements not seen in other barns. However, tobacco barns do cross over into other barn styles of their day. Some common types of barn designs integrated into tobacco barns include, English barns and bank barns.|$|R

40|$|The wood {{moisture}} content (MC) {{is vital for}} the wood performance and durability in external applications. Moisture pins sensors are widely used for measuring the MC of wood materials by measuring the electrical resistance of the material. The pin sensors are durable and respond quickly {{to changes in the}} moisture conditions in the wood. This paper presents a laboratory study of moisture pins used in an extensive field investigation on wood claddings. Attempts were made to use moisture pins for monitoring the moisture profile in the <b>cladding</b> <b>boards.</b> The quality of these measurements is evaluated and compared with gravimetric measurements. The paper also discusses the accuracy of moisture pins measurements. In order to monitor the wood cladding MC fluctuations resulting from the quick response to the ambient climate, the MC measurements in external applications should be continuous. The laboratory measurements conclude that continuous measurements of the moisture profile was not possible for coated wood cladding. 1...|$|R
