This paper argues that the institutions that once produced a specific kind of catch-up economics in Czarist Russia still remain largely the same. Unless negotiations between Moscow and Brussels take into consideration such fundamental institutional incompatibility, attempts at harmonization, expressed by Brussels as an attempt tp spread Western values, will be doomed to fail. A cynical conlusion views potential convergence as adaptation by Brussels to traditional Russian institutional patterns of rule evasion, rather than a Westernization of Russi...|$|R

The other experiments are: simulation of Russia’s WTO accession and creation of the <b>Common</b> European <b>Economic</b> <b>Space.</b> Change in the tariffs associated with the possible WTO accession is so small relative to the existing level of tariffs, that it does not give a significant change in the Russian economic environment. Significant changes are associated with the creation of the CEES as a free trade area between Russia and the enlarged Europe.

40|$|We present {{macroeconomic}} {{model that}} describes evolution of macroeconomic variables and macroeconomic waves on <b>economic</b> <b>space.</b> Risk ratings of economic agents play role of their coordinates on <b>economic</b> <b>space.</b> Aggregation of <b>economic</b> variables like Assets and Investment, Credits and Loans of economic agents at point x define corresponding macroeconomic variables as functions of time t and coordinates x on <b>economic</b> <b>space.</b> Evolution of macroeconomic variables {{is determined by}} economic and financial transactions between economic agents. Such transactions can occur between economic agents with any coordinates x and y and that reflect non-local "action-at-a-distance" character of internal macroeconomic interactions. For instance, Buy-Sell transactions between points x and y on <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> define dynamics of Assets at point x and Investment at point y. Aggregates of transactions between economic agents at point x and y on <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> define <b>economic</b> fields as functions of two coordinates. To describe dynamics of economic fields on <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> we derive hydrodynamic-like equations. For simple models of interactions between economic fields we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form and obtain wave equations for their perturbations. Economic field waves propagate on <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> and their amplitudes can grow up as exponent in time and may disturb economic stability. Diversities of macroeconomic and financial waves on <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> in simple models uncover importance of wave processes for macroeconomic modeling and forecasting.

We use risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on <b>economic</b> <b>space.</b> Aggregates of <b>economic</b> or financial variables like Investment, Assets, Demand, Credits and etc. of economic agents near point x define corresponding macroeconomic variables as functions of time t and coordinates x on <b>economic</b> <b>space.</b> Parallels between multi-agent and multi-particle systems on <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> allow describe transition from economic kinetic-like to economic hydrodynamic-like approximation and derive macroeconomic hydrodynamic-like equations on <b>economic</b> <b>space.</b> <b>Economic</b> or financial transactions between economic agents determine evolution of macroeconomic variables This paper describes local macroeconomic approximation that takes into account transactions between economic agents with coordinates near same point x on <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> only and describes interaction between macroeconomic variables by linear differential operators. For simple model of interaction between macroeconomic variables as Demand on Investment and Interest Rate we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form. For perturbations of these macroeconomic variables we derive macroeconomic wave equations.

40|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> of {{the region}} is the medium of {{relations}} of economic entities located on its territory. It is characterized by heterogeneity, due to the structured interaction of endogenous factors of production and the asynchrony of economic processes. The territorial structure of the <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> can correspond to several models, but a centre-periphery model can be considered the most widespread. The research relevance consists in {{the essence of the}} heterogeneity of the <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> {{of the region}} as one of its main properties, reflecting its differentiation. The authors analyze the approaches to interpreting the heterogeneity of the <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> in the works of Russian and foreign economists and identify the main types of territorial models of the <b>economic</b> <b>space.</b> The algorithm for detecting the heterogeneity of <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> of a region based on a centre-periphery model is presented.

The approbation of this method of revealing the territorial structure of the <b>economic</b> <b>space</b> is carried out according to the data of the socio-economic development of the Rostov region, in which three spatially expressed hierarchical units are distinguished: the center, the periphery, and the semi-periphery.

40|$|This book {{makes an}} {{essential}} {{contribution to understanding}} the dynamics of contemporary immigrant inflows and integration in Europe. Though embracing a Continent-wide outlook on migration processes, it accounts, in particular, for Southern and Eastern European perspectives. This is accomplished by analysing the long-term transition countries undergo from net emigration to net immigration, as well as developments in their migrant inflows, integration and policy. Balance is achieved between describing the common European experience and the intra- and inter-regional differences characterising migration’s underlying factors and trends. This volume is one of few attempts to conceive of the ‘Old Continent’ as a <b>common</b> <b>economic</b> and cultural <b>space</b> that fully incorporates its eastern part, while still viewing post-enlargement Europe as an area that – despite nation-specific histories – maintains a high degree of social and political coherence. The book is very comprehensive, with deep insights into aspects of immigration throughout different periods and changing socio-economic environments. Contents come from new empirical evidence, specially designed and collected. A great asset is the mix of authors, representing several academic centres across Europe yet pursuing a common vision of European migration, past, present and future. Dit boek analyseert de instroom en integratie van immigranten in Europa, waarbij alle aspecten van de immigratie gedurende uiteenlopende perioden en in veranderende sociaaleconomische omstandigheden aan bod komen. Daarbij wordt Europa beschouwd als één economische en culturele entiteit, met een grote mate van onderlinge sociale en politieke samenhang. De auteur heeft echter ook oog voor de regionale verschillen die bepalend zijn voor de onderliggende factoren en trends...|$|R
