5000|$|To {{experimentally}} {{find the}} curve resistance {{of a certain}} railroad freight car with a given load on its axles (partly due to {{the weight of the}} freight) the same car was tested both on a curved track and on a straight track. The difference in measured resistance(at the same speed) was assumed to be the curve resistance. [...] To get an average for several cars of the same type, and to reduce the effect of aerodynamic drag, one may test a group of the same type of cars coupled together (a short train without a locomotive). The curved track used in the experiments was the <b>circular</b> <b>test</b> track of the National Scientific Investigation Institute of Railroad Transport (ВНИИЖТ). A single test run can find the train resistance (force) at various velocities by letting the rolling stock being tested coast down from a higher speed to a low speed, while continuously measuring the deceleration and using Newton's second law of motion (force = acceleration*mass) to find the resistance force that is causing the railroad cars to slow. [...] In such calculations, one must take into account the moment of inertia of the car wheels by adding an equivalent mass (of rotating wheels) to the mass of the train consist. Thus the effective mass of a rail car used for Newton's second law, is larger than the car mass as weighed on a car weighing scale. This additional equivalent mass is tantamount to having the mass of each wheel-axle set be located at its radius of gyration See [...] "Inertia Resistance" [...] (for automobile wheels, but it's the same formula for railroad wheels).|$|E

Exploratory analysis of the {{potential sources of}} correlation was performed by fitting the mean model described above, assuming the data were independent and examining the residuals of that model for the various sources of correlation.

40|$|Abstract <b>Circular</b> motion <b>test</b> {{data and}} {{uncertainty}} analysis results of {{investigations of the}} hydrodynamic characteristics of ship maneuvering are presented. The model ships used were a container ship and two tankers, and the measured items were the surge and sway forces, yaw moment, propeller thrust, rudder normal and tangen-tial forces, pitch and roll angles, and heave. The test parameters were the oblique angle and yaw rate for the conditions of a hull with a rudder and propeller in which the rudder angle was set to zero and the propeller speed was set to the model self-propulsion conditions. Carriage data showing {{the accuracy of the}} towing conditions in the <b>circular</b> motion <b>test</b> are also presented. It was confirmed that the uncertainties in the hydrodynamic forces such as the surge and sway forces, yaw moment, rudder tangential and normal forces, and propeller thrust were fairly small. The reported uncertainty analysis results of the <b>circular</b> motion <b>test</b> data may be beneficial in validating data quality and in discussing reliability for simulation of ship maneuvering performance...|$|R
40|$|In {{the conduct}} of {{empirical}} macroeconomic research, unit root, cointegration, common cycle, and related test statistics are often constructed using logged data, {{even though there is}} often no clear reason, at least from an empirical perspective, why logs should be used rather than levels. Unfortunately, it is also the case that standard data transformation tests, such as those based on Box-Cox transformation, cannot be shown to be consistent unless the assumption is made concerning whether the series being examined is I(0) or I(1), so that a sort of <b>circular</b> <b>testing</b> problem exists. In this paper, we discuss two quite different but related issues that arise in the context of data transformation. First, we address the <b>circular</b> <b>testing</b> problem that arises when choosing data transformation and order of integratedness. In particular, we propose a simple randomized procedure, coupled with simple conditioning, for choosing between levels and log-levels specifications in the presence of deterministic and/or stochastic trends. Second, we note that even if pre-testing is not undertaken to determine data transformation, {{it is important to be}} aware of the impact that incorrect data transformation has on tests frequently used in empirical works. For this reason, we carry out a series of Monte Carlo experiments illustrating the rather substantive effect that incorrect transformation can have on the finite sample performance of common feature and cointegration tests. These Monte Carlo findings underscore the importance of either using economic theory as a guide to data transformation and/or using econometric tests such as discussed in this paper as aids when choosing data transformation. common cycles; common trends; nonlinear transformation; non stationarity; randomised procedure;...|$|R

30|$|With {{the same}} approach, the linear mixed models {{were used to}} {{estimate}} the mean macular sensitivity {{as a function of}} retinal thickness, BCVA, fixation stability, fixation location, age, gender, and ethnicity in eyes with uveitis and without macular edema comparing to healthy participants. The linear mixed model included random intercepts for subject, visits, eye, and <b>circular</b> <b>test</b> pattern. Age was treated as a categorical variable with levels: age < 30, ≥ 30 to < 40, ≥ 40 to < 50, and ≥ 50  years. The relationship between the mean macular sensitivity and retinal thickness was estimated separately for retinal thickness ≤ 280 and > 280  μm. To consider the effect of uveitis on the function of retina, an interaction term for disease presence (including those with macular edema and those without) and retinal thickness was considered in the model.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} work {{carried out}} to develop methods of verifying that machine tools are capable of machining parts to within specification, immediately before carrying out critical material removal operations, and with negligible impact on process times. A review of machine tool calibration and verification technologies identified that current techniques were not suitable due to requirements for significant time and skilled human intervention. A ‘solution toolkit’ is presented consisting of a selection <b>circular</b> <b>tests</b> and artefact probing which are able to rapidly verify the kinematic errors {{and in some cases}} also dynamic errors for different types of machine tool, as well as supplementary methods for tool and spindle error detection. A novel artefact probing process is introduced which simplifies data processing so that the process can be readily automated using only the native machine tool controller. Laboratory testing and industrial case studies are described which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{implementation}} of robust tracking controllers for linear feed drive high speed machine tools are the primary objectives of this work. Cutting forces and friction forces limit tracking accuracy and their influences are minimised through robust controller design. This paper discusses the design and tracking performances of a traditional cascade and a sliding mode controller for a X-Y milling table. <b>Circular</b> <b>tests</b> are performed at selected tracking speeds and circle radii for tracking performance analysis. The tracking error for cascade P/PI controller {{is proportional to the}} reference tracking speed and is inversely proportional to the velocity gain value of the position loop controller. Speed and acceleration feedforward further reduce this tracking error. Quadrant glitches, a product of nonlinear friction at the points of velocity reversal, are observed. Sliding mode controller exhibits better tracking accuracy and dynamic stiffness and yields a significant reduction of the quadrant glitches. ...|$|R

40|$|Didymella {{species are}} common plant {{pathogens}} affecting mainly cereal crops {{in countries with}} temperate climates, and their airborne spores are also a potential human allergen. A 5 -y monitoring study was carried out at an urban site in the UK to establish the most likely exposure {{time in order to}} alert people sensitised to spores of this genus. Didymella ascospores occurred in air with a bimodal pattern, with peak concentrations occurring at 03 : 00 and 22 : 00. The majority of ascospores were observed from 20 : 30 to 07 : 30 according to a multivariate regression tree analysis. Similarly, <b>circular</b> <b>tests</b> indicated that the maximum hourly concentrations occurred in the morning hours. The highest ascospore concentrations were observed in very humid conditions occurring after rainfall. The observations taken from an urban site were delayed in relation to the time of ascospore release previously reported from field sites. Thus, there is a high possibility of regional transport of ascospores in the atmosphere from remote sources...|$|R
