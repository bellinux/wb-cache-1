40|$|The Kauffman bracket skein module K(M) of a 3 -manifold M {{is defined}} over {{formal power series}} in the {{variable}} h by letting A=e^h/ 4. For a compact oriented surface F, it is shown that K(F × I) is a quantization of the -characters of the fundamental group of F, corresponding to a geometrically defined Poisson bracket. Finite type invariants for unoriented knots and links are defined. Topologically free Kauffman bracket modules are shown to generate finite type invariants. It is shown for compact M that K(M) can be generated as a module by cables on a finite set of knots. Moreover, if M contains no incompressible surfaces, the module is finitely generated.

40|$|International audienceContext: Advances in {{customization}} {{have highlighted}} {{the need for}} tools supporting variable content document management and generation in many domains. Current tools allow the generation of highly customized documents that are variable in both content and layout. However, most frameworks are technology-oriented, and their use requires advanced skills in implementationrelated tools, which means their use by end users (i. e. document designers) is severely limited. Objective: Starting from past and current trends for <b>customized</b> <b>document</b> authoring, {{our goal is to}} provide a document generation alternative in which variants are specified at a high level of abstraction and content reuse can be maximized in high variability scenarios. Method: Based on our experience in Document Engineering, we identified areas in the variable content document management and generation field open to further improvement. We first classified the primary sources of variability in document composition processes and then developed a methodology, which we called DPL - based on Software Product Lines principles - to support document generation in high variability scenarios. Results: In order to validate the applicability of our methodology we implemented a tool - DPLfw - to carry out DPL processes. After using this in different scenarios, we compared our proposal with other state-of-the-art tools for variable content document management and generation. Conclusion: The DPLfw showed a good capacity for the automatic generation of variable content documents equal to or in some cases surpassing other currently available approaches. To the best of our knowledge, DPLfw is the only framework that combines variable content and document workflow facilities, easing the generation of variable content documents in which multiple actors play different roles...|$|E
40|$|When {{producing}} electronically stored information (ESI) {{in response}} to lawsuits, businesses face several security risks as well as legal requirements they must satisfy. <b>Customized</b> <b>document</b> management programs and e-discovery policies are key tools in protecting against inadvertent disclosure as well as meeting business and legal needs. T he amendments to the US Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP; www. uscourts. gov/rules/EDiscovery_w_Notes. pdf) that {{went into effect in}} 2006 place a substantial burden on nonlegal personnel {{to figure out how to}} implement legal holds for elec-tronically stored information (ESI). The FRCP rules require that organizations respond to law-suits by producing any relevant electronic in-formation stored on any media—in some cases, they must do so in the ESI’s native format. Legal holds must thus halt all deletions and revisions to responsive documents to be produced in federal lawsuits in the US. European Union countries typically don’t comply with the US FRCP rules, but foreign companies that transact business in the US are required to comply with the FRCP rules when involved in US federal lawsuits, even while being careful to abide by the privacy laws within their own countries. Because documents related to lawsuits can be found on anything from hard drives to PDAs to CDs to smart phones and could be stored as electronic communications or even MP 3 s on many disparate devices, 1 businesses run increased risk of failing to provide the required documents {{in response to}} litigation. This can lead to monetary judgments against them or sanctions from the court. Many companies will be involved in lawsuits at some point involving ESI production. 2 Yet, recent studies show that most organizations are unprepared to respond to e-discovery requests for ESI. 3 (E-discovery is the process in which op-posing parties in a lawsuit exchange document...|$|E
