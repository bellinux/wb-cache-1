Different guilds often produced similar goods. “Collective workshops were considered more desirable by more substantial craftsmen themselves”. This would make collective workshops a suitable means of social control. Every member was monitored very closely; there were influential members but no one completely controlled the productivity of other fellow members. Partnerships existed, although it’s unknown how common partnerships occurred. A more modern type of labor division also existed during the Early Modern Period. During this time bleachers, twisters, and dyers craftsmen not only owned their own equipment but their own shops as well.

A model <b>compound</b> (<b>product</b> of condensation of phenylglycidyl ether to N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine) of the epoxy thermoset was synthesized to simplify the study. By reaction with 1, 4 -butanediol, a cleavage of the rho-O-C linkage occurs, leading to formation of phenol. A stagnation of the yield in phenol at about 20 % was observed for the uncatalysed reaction. Different catalysts were checked (sodium methylate, titanium(IV) n-butoxide, lithium perchlorate and p-toluenesulfonic acid). The most efficient of them are p-toluenesulfonic acid (3 w/w%) and sodium methylate (30 w/w%). The disappearance of the initial model compound was also observed, even for a low yield in phenol. The different reaction products were separated and analysed by NMR spectroscopy. The results are in accordance with a reaction scheme based on two mechanisms of rho-O-C linkage cleavage...|$|E

40|$|Product sound usually {{consists}} of a mix of several sources. Models for prediction of sound quality based on combinations of psychoacoustic metrics like loudness, sharpness and roughness have limitations when compound sounds are analysed. When a compound sound is divided into separable sources through auditory streaming such models fail. The character of each source is given by physical properties. The character is usually hard to change without complete redesign of the product. The quality of the final product sound {{is determined by the}} mix of sound sources. Efficient product sound design requires tools for recording or simulation of sources, realistic modelling of transfer functions from source to listener and tools for mixing the sources. With such tools a sound source can be auralised as part of sound environments. Recordings of sound sources in a car were used to get source information. The sound from each source was filtered through idealised transfer functions, mixed and reproduced in a 5. 1 surround sound studio. The resulting sound was evaluated through listening tests.

Few relevant data exist to support recon-structing historical worker exposures to fibers generated by working with this material. Therefore, we re-created 1960 s-era chrysotile-containing joint compound (JCC) and compared its characteristics to a current-day asbestos-free joint compound (JCN). Validation studies showed that a bench-scale chamber with controlled flow dynamics, designed to quantify partic-ulate emissions from joint <b>compound</b> <b>products,</b> provided precise and reliable measurements of generated airborne dust mass, chrysotile fiber concentrations, and corresponding activity-specific emission rates.

40|$|Developing {{manufacturing}} {{techniques of}} compound items {{it is necessary}} to consider the factors influencing the distribution of welding stresses resulting from local heating source in the considered conjugation interface under consideration {{and the nature of the}} changes in it. Using real products in research results in high financial and energy costs as well as possible crashes. Distribution of heat when exposed to a local heating source as well as structural, phase, chemical transformations and other technological factors can be thoroughly studied at simulating materials and processes models. The purpose of this modeling is to develop methodology for calculating the stress-strain state of compound parts structure under the influence of a local heating source using numerical finite element method (FEM). This is accomplished using numerical simulation algorithms, that is the finite element method as the most powerful and functional means of numerical analysis in a wide variety of engineering problems. Classic FEM algorithm is implemented in several steps: sampling the area under consideration, the choice of the variational principle for determining the basic unknown functions, the choice of approximating functions, the implementation of the variational principle, the introduction of boundary conditions, solution of algebraic equations using standard numerical methods. After determining the nodal displacements in accordance with the known theory of elasticity ratios the strain and stress state is calculated. Using finite-element calculations ANSYS system a method that makes it possible to perform with great efficiency modeling the stress-strain state of structural components and to predict the distribution of strains in order to ensure conditions of regulated assembling of <b>compound</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{preparation}} of gold nanomolecules with sizes other than Au 25 (SR) 18, Au 38 (SR) 24, Au 102 (SR) 44, and Au 144 (SR) 60 has been hampered by stability issues and low yields. Here we report a procedure to prepare Au 67 (SR) 35, for either R = −SCH 2 CH 2 Ph or-SC 6 H 13, allowing high-yield isolation (34 %, ∼ 10 -mg quantities) {{of the title}} <b>compound.</b> <b>Product</b> high purity is assessed at each synthesis stage by rapid MALDI−TOF mass-spectrometry (MS), and high-resolution electrospray-ionization MS confirms the Au 67 (SR) 35 composition. Electronic properties were explored using optical absorption spectroscopy (UV− visible−NIR regions) and electrochemistry (0. 74 V spacing in differential-pulsed-voltammetry), modes of ligand binding were studied by NMR spectroscopy (13 C and 1 H), and structural characteristics of the metal atom core were determined by powder X-ray measurements. Models featuring a Au 17 truncated-decahedral inner core encapsulated by the 30 anchoring atoms of 15 staple-motif units have been investigated with first-principles electronic structure calculations. This resulted in identification of a structure consistent with the experiments, particularly, {{the opening of a}} large gap (∼ 0. 75 eV) in the (2 −) charge-state of the nanomolecule. The electronic structure is analyzed within the framework of a superatom shell model. Structurally, the Au 67 (SR) 35 nanomolecule is the smallest to adopt the complete truncated-decahedral motif for its core with a surface structure bearing greater similarity to the larger nanoparticles. Its electronic HOMO−LUMO gap (∼ 0. 75 eV) is nearly double that of the larger Au 102 compound and it is much smaller than that of the Au 38 one. The intermediary status of the Au 67 (SR) 35 nanomolecule is also reflected in both its optical and electrochemical characteristics...|$|E

40|$|When recommending a {{specific}} pharmaceutical, more {{has to be}} taken into account than whether the API is indicated for the illness in question. Based on the preceding discussion, product source can have a tremendous impact on efficacy, on therapeutic success, and on practitioners' credibility in the eyes of their clients. However, product source goes beyond simple credibility, encompassing professional ethics and liability. In answering the Ethical question of the month [...] December 2001 "Should private veterinary practitioners be allowed to produce autogenous vaccines or <b>compound</b> antimicrobial <b>products</b> for use in food producing animals?" Rollin concluded, "one cannot envision a clearer case of unethical behavior. " The reality is that quality assurance, efficacy, potency, and safety are not defined for <b>compounded</b> <b>products,</b> and should veterinarians choose to script or dispense one, the responsibility for its quality, efficacy, potency, and safety falls squarely on their shoulders. Ultimately, this also translates into 100 % liability should an ADR, illness, or lack of effect, befall the patient. While having access to ELDU and <b>compounded</b> <b>products</b> is crucial in facilitating the treatment of the various diseases that veterinarians face, the regulatory freedom that gives them this choice carries heightened responsibilities when electing this option. In a nutshell, ethical and responsible principles of pharmacy dictate that a veterinarian's first choice should be a veterinary-licensed pharmaceutical for the indication in question. Should this not exist, ELDU of a licensed product with clinically derived therapeutic protocols should be the next choice. Compounded pharmaceuticals should only be used when no licensed (those sporting a DIN) product exists, and extreme cautions should be exercised when using transdermal formulations. Liability dictates that this decision be undertaken with informed consent of the owner and with appropriate due diligence when selecting a compounding service provider.
