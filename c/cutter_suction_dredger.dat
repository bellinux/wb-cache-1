40|$|The CSD 650 is {{the largest}} <b>cutter</b> <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> {{produced}} by Damen Dredging Equipment (DDE) in Nijkerk. To provide for {{a wider range of}} clients, the CSD will be used in more coastal conditions. Therefore, it is important to study the behaviour of a <b>cutter</b> <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> in waves. In this context the following research question is formulated: ’What are the operational limits of a CSD 650 in waves and, how do harsh environmental conditions affect the important structural parts of a CSD 650 over time?’ To be able to answer these research questions, the possible failure mechanisms are stated. Secondly, a linear frequency domain model is build that incorporates all forces acting on the CSD. A twelve degree of freedom model is built in MATLAB and uses DELFRAC potential software to calculate the frequency dependent added mass, damping and wave forces. All the other forces on the CSD are stated as linearized inertia, damping or reaction forces. The ladder of the CSD is treated as a Morison element to calculate the wave forces on the ladder as for the hydrodynamic forces. When the whole equation of the system is known, the equation of motion can be solved to get the Response Amplitude Operators of the system. Using transformation matrices the RAOs of the centre of gravity of the barge can be transformed to the RAOs of the spud cage. When the mechanical properties of the spud pole and soil interaction are known, the relation between spud motions and stresses can be determined. This relation allows for calculating a stress RAO for the spud pole. In combination with any given wave spectra, so called stress spectra can be determined. Using the statistical characteristics of these stress spectra, important statistical quantities for the stress response can be derived. Firstly, the probability that a stress cycle amplitude exceeds the yield stress which leads to plastic deformation of the spud pole. With the help of fatigue curves and the Miner rule the fatigue damage, caused by different combinations of significant wave height and peak period, can be calculated with this spectral method. However the model seems to overestimate the values of the fatigue damage and yield stress exceedance probability. It is therefore advised to validate the model with real life measurements.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Cutter</b> <b>suction</b> <b>dredgers</b> (CSD) play a {{major part}} {{in the field of}} {{dredging}} engineering in harbors, fairways, and land reclamation. CSD can continuously mine and transport the slop with good quality while CSD can tackle many types of soil. However, even a component failure, which is connected with parts and components of CSD, can result in no working. Thus, it affects the production capacity and efficiency of dredgers seriously. It is necessary to analyze the failure probability of CSD. The method of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is applied to analyze the failure probability of CSD. The method uses logical reasoning and builds a fault tree model by analyzing the relationship between the basic, intermediate and top events. Based on fault tree model of a variety of events " and " " or " relationship, we can obtain minimal cut sets of that cause the event to failure. Then, get the basic probability of the event. Finally, we can calculate the probability of the top events. Under experiments, the FTA method can accurately calculate the failure probability of CSD, and deduce in reverse order the key events that cause the top event. The study on the key events can reduce the failure probability of CSD, enhance its reliability and safety, and improve the efficiency and productivity indirectly. It will also lay a foundation for product configuration optimization...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{concern about}} global warming and climate change {{intensified}} the research into more efficient ways of operation in the maritime industry. These researches triggered the use of electrical batteries in hybrid systems. Van Oord aims to operate more efficiently, which implies using less fuel and thus emitting less carbon dioxide. A way to achieve {{this might be the}} use of batteries for hybrid power plants on board of their <b>cutter</b> <b>suction</b> <b>dredgers.</b> This will investigate what the potential carbon dioxide reduction of a hybrid system could be. Since the competitiveness of the Van Oord fleet should not be affected a certain cost perspective is taken into account as well. The objective of this thesis is to find a battery capacity that achieves a fuel and running hour reduction {{in such a way that}} it is cost effective. The <b>cutter</b> <b>suction</b> <b>dredger’s</b> operational profile has a fluctuating nature in terms of power demand. In this study several operational profiles are examined and one most representative operational profile is constructed. This operational profile has large peaks and troughs which favours the use of a certain peak shaving system like a battery. Moreover, the average loading of the diesel engines is quite frequently far off the optimal 85 % load. In order to optimise the power demand from the diesel engines and ensuring efficient operation, models are developed to simulate the behaviour of the diesel engine, the battery and the hybrid system as a whole. As a start the effect of transients in the load profile of the diesel engine on its efficiency is investigated. It is found that the efficiency of a larger medium speed diesel engine running on constant speed with a sufficient air excess ratio, is not affected by transients in the load profile. The data collected in this analysis is used to develop a fuel consumption model which estimates fuel consumption as function of the load of the engine. In addition, the diesel engine the battery pack is modelled. The model of the battery pack is based on multi dimensional lookup tables that hold the non-linear relations between terminal voltage, state of charge and current. For the battery a separate lifetime calculation is developed, which estimates the battery lifetime for different charge/discharge profiles. The fuel consumption model and the battery model are tested and perform as intended. In order to combine the fuel consumption model and the battery model, a power management system is developed. This power management system uses binary logic to optimise the system performance. The set-points of the power management system are tuned in an iterative way. Due to a structured simulation approach the simulation results can be converted to trend lines. These trend lines enable the determination of the optimal battery capacity with respect to reduction of fuel consumption, reduction of running hours, investment cost and battery lifetime. The optimal capacity for the battery is 4516 ℎ. With this battery the system is not cost effective. However, technical feasibility is proven and fuel consumption is reduced. A yearly fuel reduction of 75 ton HFO and 142 ton MDO is achieved. This results in a reduction of carbon dioxide of 687 ton annually. With this system every ton of carbon dioxide reduction will cost Van Oord € 575. The performance of the hybrid system can be improved by extending the battery lifetime. This is done by adjusting the power management settings according to the actual residual battery capacity. This method reduces the cost per ton carbon dioxide reduction to € 128. Furthermore the effect of running on MDO instead of HFO is investigated, this results in a marginal improvement in cost perspective. Every ton of carbon dioxide reduction will cost € 554. The actual annual carbon dioxide reduction will not change. Unfortunately the proposed hybrid system will only reduce carbon dioxide emission in a cost effective way when the HFO price rises to € 700 per ton and the battery price per ℎ halves. In combination with a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fuelled power plant the hybrid system can be used. It is proven that energy demand can be stored in and provided by a battery with a reasonable size. Due to the response of a gas engine the battery is not an extra any more, but it becomes a necessity.

40|$|The World Organisation of Dredging Associations (WODA) has {{identified}} underwater sound {{as an environmental}} issue that needs further consideration. A WODA Expert Group on Underwater Sound (WEGUS) was established to provide a guidance paper on dredging sound, impact on aquatic biota and advice on underwater sound monitoring procedures. The paper recommends following a risk based process as this {{would result in a}} more systematic approach to sound impact studies. A critical need is standardization of acoustic terminology and methods and the paper provides suggestions. It is further noted that underwater acoustic models, in combination with measurements provide a pragmatic approach for the assessment of sound distribution. Dredging sounds can be associated with dredging excavation, dredging vessels during transport, and dredged material placement. One or more of four types of dredgers are used: <b>Cutter</b> <b>Suction</b> <b>Dredger,</b> Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger, Grab Dredger, and Backhoe Dredger.

While it is clear that dredging sound has the potential to affect the behavior of aquatic life in some cases, there appears to be minimal risk of injury.

40|$|Optimal cut {{plans for}} cutter suction {{dredgers}} aim to maximize operational efficiency. Maximizing operational efficiency involves minimization of stoppage time resulting from non-productive dredger movements. To automate a systematic search for optimal twodimensional cut plans for cutter suction dredgers two models with an adaptive simulated annealing-based solution approach were developed. The first model, the dredge cut nesting model, optimizes irregular stock cutting problems where stencils represent dredge cuts and sheets represent dredging areas. Stencils are collections of unit dredge cuts with dimensions {{related to an}} effective cutting width which can be achieved with the <b>cutter</b> <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> considered. The objectives of the dredge cut nesting model are to maximize sheet coverage and to minimize stencil overlap. Centroids of unit dredge cuts of final nest layouts are extracted and used as grid nodes in the second model. The second model, the dredger routing model, optimizes asymmetric travelling salesperson problems with turning costs. The objectives of the dredger routing model are to minimize total route length and sum of turning angles, and to maximize average link length. A link consists {{of two or more}} route edges which are aligned with each other to within specified limits. A significant result of this research is that an engineering application of both models showed that two-dimensional cut plans for cutter suction dredgers can be systematically optimized and that dredger routes with minimum turning costs can be found. However, results also showed that the dredger routing model is not yet sophisticated enough to find cut plans for cutter suction dredgers for which overall project execution time is minimal.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} investigating ship emissions, the plume capture and analysis system (PCAS), and its application in measuring airborne pollutant emission factors (EFs) and particle size distributions. The current investigation was conducted in situ, aboard two dredgers (Amity: a <b>cutter</b> <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> and Brisbane: a hopper suction dredger) but the PCAS is also capable of performing such measurements remotely at a distant point within the plume. EFs were measured relative to the fuel consumption using the fuel combustion derived plume CO 2. All plume measurements were corrected by subtracting background concentrations sampled regularly from upwind of the stacks. Each measurement typically took 6 minutes to complete and during one day, 40 to 50 measurements were possible. The relationship between the EFs and plume sample dilution was examined to determine the plume dilution range over which the technique could deliver consistent results when measuring EFs for particle number (PN), NOx, SO 2, and PM 2. 5 within a targeted dilution factor range of 50 - 1000 suitable for remote sampling. The EFs for NOx, SO 2, and PM 2. 5 {{were found to be}} independent of dilution, for dilution factors within that range. The EF measurement for PN was corrected for coagulation losses by applying a time dependant particle loss correction to the particle number concentration data. For the Amity, the EF ranges were PN: 2. 2 - 9. 6 × 1015 (kg-fuel) - 1; NOx: 35 - 72 g(NO 2). (kg-fuel) - 1, SO 2 0. 6 - 1. 1 g(SO 2). (kg-fuel) - 1 and PM 2. 5 : 0. 7 – 6. 1 g(PM 2. 5). (kg-fuel) - 1. For the Brisbane they were PN: 1. 0 – 1. 5 x 1016 (kg-fuel) - 1, NOx: 3. 4 – 8. 0 g(NO 2). (kg-fuel) - 1, SO 2 : 1. 3 – 1. 7 g(SO 2). (kg-fuel) - 1 and PM 2. 5 : 1. 2 – 5. 6 g(PM 2. 5). (kg-fuel) - 1. The results are discussed in terms of the operating conditions of the vessels’ engines. Particle number emission factors as a function of size as well as the count median diameter (CMD), and geometric standard deviation of the size distributions are provided. The size distributions were found to be consistently uni-modal in the range below 500 nm, and this mode was within the accumulation mode range for both vessels. The representative CMDs for the various activities performed by the dredgers ranged from 94 - 131 nm {{in the case of the}} Amity, and 58 - 80 nm for the Brisbane.

40|$|Marine {{contractors}} {{deal with}} {{processes that are}} understood qualitatively but are hard to quantify. The amount of data available for these processes is ever growing, and so too the intrinsic value that lies within this data. Several data driven model approaches {{can be used to}} analyse this process data, one being a Bayesian Network (BN) approach. A BN is a statistical tool that has been used in previous research for predicting processes in the area of Marine Contracting. The BN approach is further explored in this thesis as a way to analyse process data. The objective of the research was to determine how a data driven model approach like the BN approach can be used to effectively analyse process data that drive everyday Marine Contracting practices. To this end, first a theoretical study was performed. Then the BN method is applied to three processes that are dealt with on a regular basis in the marine contracting practice. The first process concerns the wear of <b>cutter</b> <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> tools. The pickpoints that are used for cutting soil wear down depending on various parameters. Being able to predict this wear process is of high importance for any soil cutting project. The BN proved to have some predictive skill though the errors were quite large. This research it could not conclude if the predictive skill is an improvement on the currently used methods for geology- or wear prediction. The second process is the cliff erosion at the island of Lolland (Denmark). As part of a large tunnel construction project an erosion cliff is to be constructed with the purpose of supplying adjacent coast {{with a certain amount of}} sediment. The erosion cliff will be constructed in two phases. Using a data driven model approach, the first phase can be used as a pilot in which various construction configurations are monitored. This process data can then be used to feed a data driven model, like a BN, to optimise the construction of the second phase. The third process is the wave overtopping of coastal structures. A database with quite a lot of well-defined overtopping cases is readily available for feeding a data driven model approach. Several other calculation methods, based on the same data, are readily available as well. Due to time constraints, the actual validation of an overtopping BN and the comparison with other overtopping methods is has not been completed for this research. Concluding, the benefit of using a data modelling approach like the BN approach for the Marine Contracting industry lies mostly in the collection, storage and management of data. Well-defined instances (sets of process parameter values related to one single case) needed for feeding a BN is the most vital aspect of its benefit. These instances give a good handle on large quantities of available data. A BN’s main strength is that its structure in combination with the properly managed data is capable of holistically capturing highly complex processes.

40|$|Structural {{vibrations}} are a {{known cause}} of damage to offshore structures and equipment. A <b>Cutter</b> <b>Suction</b> <b>Dredger</b> (CSD) is a dredge vessel known to vibrate heavily during operation. Primary cause of these vibrations is the cutting process, performed to cut and excavate soil from the seabed. A component prone to damage is the cutter ladder, {{a component of the}} CSD used to position the cutter head at the seabed. Cutter ladders are known to suffer from failures including large cracks in the structural members, of which the cause is sometimes unclear. Current methods for developing a cutter ladder involve detailed quasi-static finite element modeling for strength analysis and sometimes modal analysis to identify natural frequencies and mode shapes. Structural vibrations due to dynamic loading are usually not taken into account. In 2015 Boskalis performed extensive vibration measurements on its Taurus II CSD, hereby setting the stage for research into the dynamics of cutter ladders. By taking a closer look at dynamics of the cutter ladder, a cause for structural damage might be identified. This thesis therefore aims to investigate the vibrations of a cutter ladder as a possible cause for damage. In order to obtain knowledge about the dynamic behavior of the cutter ladder in operation, data obtained during the vibration measurements were investigated using operational modal analysis. This investigation gave further insight in how to approach the development and validation of a vibration model. A vibration model using finite beam elements was developed {{to take a closer look}} at the characteristics of the cutter ladder structure. This vibration model was obtained through simplification of a detailed plate-element model, which was developed in an earlier project. The dynamic characteristics of the obtained vibration model where validated to the detailed plate element model by comparison of modal analysis results. It was chosen to update the vibration model using the measurements obtained on the cutter ladder, as it was hereby possible to investigate the influence of dynamic parameters on which uncertainties exist, such as the water added mass surrounding the structure, the damping and the stiffness parameters at the boundary conditions. Use was made of the transmissibility of vibrations between the locations where measurements were obtained. Measured transmissibility was compared to modeled transmissibility, as in this manner it was possible to look into dynamic behavior of the cutter ladder, apart from the external loading. The model was updated by varying various dynamic parameters on which uncertainties existed, including water added mass, damping and stiffness parameters at the boundary conditions. Investigating the data obtained during measurements showed that the forced vibrations caused by the cutting process dominate the dynamic behavior in the cutter ladder. Natural vibrations of the cutter ladder were found to be minor. Updating the model revealed that the water surrounding the structure has a significant influence on the dynamic behavior. In vertical direction, a quantity of water close to the weight of the cutter ladder itself had to be added to have the vibration model meet the design parameters. Quite an amount of structural damping had to be added too, for which the cause is again sought for in the water surrounding the structure. Using transmissibility functions as design parameters was found to yield accurate results, especially at the sections where no external loading was introduced. It is recommended to continue investigating the influence of the forced vibrations on the fatigue life of the cutter ladder on a more local scale, as this might provide new insights for future cutter ladder designs.
