5|$|Filming resumed on August 3, 2006 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for 70 {{days off}} the California coast, {{as all the}} {{shooting}} required in the Caribbean had been conducted in 2005. Davy Jones's Locker was shot at Utah, and it was shot in a monochromatic way to represent its different feeling from the usual colorful environment of a pirate. The climactic battle was shot in a former air hangar at Palmdale, California, where the cast had to wear wetsuits underneath their costumes on angle-tipped ships. The water-drenched set was kept in freezing temperatures, to make sure bacteria did not <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> and infect the crew. A second unit shot at Niagara Falls. Industrial Light & Magic did 750 effects shots, while Digital Domain also took on 300. They spent just five months finishing the special effects. The film posed numerous challenges in creating water-based effects.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over the moat. Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Valdés' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While the sleeves of musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the rampart, Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over the moat and began to climb the rampart, starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the rampart, crossed the moat and also started to <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized and stood on the barricaded streets.|$|E

25|$|The City Hall was at 295 Concord Avenue (Concord is the town's main north-south street). It {{is open to}} {{the public}} 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Visitors are invited to <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> and sign the town's guestbook. City Hall was built in the early 1900s as a {{community}} church. Later it was a Baptist church. From 1914 to 1946 it was the Evangelical church, from 1946 to 1968 the Evangelical United Brethren church, and from 1968 until closing in 1997 it was the Tenney United Methodist Church. The building was purchased by the city for $11 in 1999, and in 2006-07 underwent significant renovation and expansion.|$|E
25|$|In February 2002, Takahashi {{released}} his debut album, the self-produced Sepia, of which only 200 copies were produced. Over {{the next five}} years, Takahashi performed concerts and released albums based in Sapporo, such as in January 2004, when he performed street lives five times per week. In May 2007, he {{released his}} second album, Mugon no Bōryoku, limited to 500 copies. The album was relatively popular in Sapporo, charting at number 1 for three weeks at the Sapporo Stellar Place HMV's in-store independent releases charts. This lead him to hold his first solo concert, to 200 people at the Sapporo Colony.

25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs.

At the first session, both Mercedes drivers were fastest, with Nico Rosberg being three-tenths {{of a second}} faster than teammate Lewis Hamilton. The Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{was the only other}} car to <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> one second of the Mercedes. The other Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel set the slowest lap time, as a gearbox problem prevented him from driving more than four laps. The McLaren of Fernando Alonso suffered from gearbox issues as well, but the Spaniard was able {{to get back on track}} for the later part of the session. The team had brought a new aerodynamics package to Spielberg, which was tested by Alonso in free practice, who described it as [...] "an improvement to the car".|$|E

They repeatedly comb through the crime scene and conduct arrests and interrogations throughout the neighborhood, but they fail to find anything new. A frustrated Bayliss snaps at Pembleton, prompting Pembleton to request a new partner, but Gee refuses and remains confident Bayliss will solve the Watson case. Elsewhere, while Bolander (Ned Beatty) prepares for a date with medical examiner Blythe (Wendy Hughes), he complains to his neighbor Lorenzo Molera (Luis Guzmán) about noise he is making while doing his carpenter work. The two end up bonding over beers, with both confiding in each other about their ex-wives. Inside Molera's room is a coffin he built for a customer, which Bolander insists is bad luck. Bolander's date with Blythe goes well, but he nervously rejects an invitation back to her apartment when he receives a call about a murder. The call brings him back to Molera, who has been found dead inside his coffin. Bolander tells the investigating police that Molera died of [...] "a broken heart".

500|$|Meanwhile, Brian {{has been}} out of town {{attending}} a seminar on creating a web series and is unaware of what has transpired. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and starts having drinks with her. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for sex, with Ida leaving first, then Brian after telling the barman to bill the drinks to her room. The next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cellphone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After Stewie tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals Ida's name, Brian realizes that he has had sex with Quagmire's transgendered father and vomits for almost 30 uninterrupted seconds before the two of them panic. At the same time, Ida returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she met someone, and when she says it was Brian, whom Quagmire despises, he becomes furious. Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were sticking out from under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off if he goes near Quagmire's house.

2500|$|Outside {{the major}} {{metropolitan}} cities, few stores {{could afford to}} serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations {{that would allow them}} to separate wealthier customers from the [...] "riff raff." [...] One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. [...] This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to <b>come</b> <b>inside.</b> Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack. The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.|$|E

2500|$|Just before 11 on {{the night}} of August 8, 1898, Lt. Atwater thought he saw moving figures in white, {{on the edge of the}} woods 250 yards from the lighthouse. At 1145, with {{moonlight}} breaking through the clouds, he saw several men in the brush on the edge of the woods. Without giving an alarm, he instructed the lookouts to be on heightened vigilance. As he was heading to the yard gate to order the corporal of the guard and sentry to <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> the light-house, those men came running up and announced they had seen Spanish troops in the road. Almost immediately, a volley of gunfire erupted from the surrounding woods. [...] Atwater ordered the lighthouse lamp doused as a signal to the three armed ships lying offshore that the light-house was under attack. The cruiser, , the only ship with an operable searchlight, trained it on the hill where the lighthouse sat in order to direct secondary battery gunfire from Cincinnati, Amphitrite and Leyden on the attacking Spanish troops.|$|E

[...] Just after sundown, Powell made his way through the tunnels to the mess hall and shouted for Myles and Smart. [...] Myles showed up, leading Jones with a knife at his throat. [...] Powell asked what Myles wanted, and received a verbal tirade from Myles, who stalked away, leaving Jones with Alton. [...] Powell was told that Myles wanted at least thirty members of the press to <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> the prison, take pictures of the conditions and speak with the inmates.

2500|$|Several album tracks gained notoriety {{within the}} {{entertainment}} industry, in particular [...] "Would You Mind" [...] {{due to its}} racy composition and explicit sexual content.

She ends the song by requesting that he <b>come</b> <b>inside</b> of her and let his juices flow deep in her passion." [...] Its shock value was considered [...] "enough to make Donna Summer's [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] sound like Christian rock." [...] Its explicit lyrics caused the album to be banned in several conservative countries such as Singapore. The song was used in films such as stoner comedy How High. Its [...] "gravity defying and mouth watering" [...] live rendition was regarded among the most controversial performances of her career. In 2012, it was ranked the steamiest song of her discography; an anecdote saying, [...] "This song is so racy people {{use it as a}} euphemism when talking about what they did the night before when children are present." [...] "Trust a Try" [...] also received critical focus for its innovation, called a [...] "bold musical move" [...] which [...] "begins with the intricacies of a string quartet before falling into metal attack"; thought to be [...] "within spitting distance of the avant-garde." ...|$|E
