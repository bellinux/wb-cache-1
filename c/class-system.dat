For him the English <b>class-system</b> was essentially tripartite — there exists an upper, a middle, and a lower class. Solely by its language {{it is possible to}} identify them. In times past (e.g. in the Victorian and Edwardian periods) this was not the case. In fact the Professor says there are, it is true, a few minor points of life which may serve to demarcate the upper class, but they are minor ones, and he is concerned in this essay only with the linguistic demarcation. This line, for the Professor, is, often, a line between, on one hand, gentlemen and, on the other, persons who, though not gentlemen, must at first sight appear, or would like to appear, as such. Thus, habits of speech peculiar to the lower classes find no place in this article. He also addresses the written language, considering the following points: names on envelopes, etc., beginning of letters, names on cards, postal addresses on envelopes, etc. at the heads of letters, and on cards; finally, letter-endings.|$|E

Each character class has {{a set of}} weapons and abilities unique to that class. This differentiation between classes makes for rock-paper-scissors-esque gameplay that requires teammates {{to work together in}} order to effectively achieve objectives. The <b>class-system</b> also encourages players to vary their selection of classes and utilize certain classes in conjunction with one another to gain the advantage.|$|E
50|$|In {{the strict}} social-system of the Tokugawa-era (1603-1868) {{there was a}} high {{emphasis}} on treating each individual according to what class the individual belonged to. Each of the Ittatsu-ryu form(kata)-series is adapted {{to deal with the}} social status of the individual being restrained. A samurai-lord, (if being arrested for a crime), would have to be restrained in a way that enables the individual to retain his or her dignity. Women, priests (of either shinto or Buddhist faith), samurai, and commoners (considered to be near bottom of the <b>class-system)</b> would have to be restrained in a way that represented their position in the class-hierarchy without disgracing them.|$|E
50|$|Lily returns ashamedly to her Birmingham {{home after}} the failed elopement, {{increasingly}} certain that a woman's role was in the domestic space at home. However, Craigan's illness has made him realise that he needs her perhaps more than she needs him. In this way, this Modernist text encapsulates the changing interwar world in Britain by demonstrating the problems encountered in the British <b>class-system</b> and in its de facto (if no longer de jure) patriarchy; but it also offers an alternative and a sign of hope through it all. Lily embodies that hope and that possibility of a different future, even if the steps to women's emancipation are incremental and not {{as large as the}} juridical changes had hoped.|$|E

The original {{goal of the}} Argonos has been lost over time; no one on board can say for certain of their origins. A <b>class-system</b> has developed in which the commoners and poor serve in the lower levels and provide maintenance for the ship. By contrast, the upper-class maintain positions of power. A Bishop sits {{as the head of}} the Church which wields some influence over the people, and the Bishop himself is a member of the Executive Council which governs the Argonos. When a signal is received, a team aboard the Argonos prepare to make a landing on the first alien planet to be encountered in years.|$|E

Staged on November 27 th, here was the second general election under an amended constitution intended {{to bring about a}} more democratic system of parliament and government. Woven together are interrelated factors which field researchers like us – academics who craft their written studies on encounters, observations, and conversations gathered from a specific people and place – experience and live through in day-to-day work. Highlighted in this paper are our reflections and recollections as Richard, a journalism academic, and Teena, an anthropologist, researching in the field while fielding a political climate of ordinary folks’ frustration. By this, Tongan people saw the nineteenth century <b>class-system</b> instituted in the 1875 constitution was fixed to the modified political structure introduced in 2010. Therefore, the thread interlacing our journal excerpts to an analysis of what is taking hold in Tongan political life is satire and wit, and how humour is manoeuvred to criticise and critique power and authority...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided in six chapters. Chapter I shows that Ibn Khaldun is unique from general line of historians. Upto 14 century, {{the subject of}} history passed through various stages and it was 14 century when history became a science. Many historians of 14 and 15 Chapter 2 deals with the {{intellectual}} development of Ibn Khaldun. It is an established fact that Ibn Khaldun's own personal experience and his observations are basic and major source of his philosophy of history. The rationality in his philosophy comes from his practical life. That is why he prefers 'practical application' upon 'learning from books. ' Other sources includes religious books and secular studies. Chapter 3 discusses the principles of historiography. It is proved that the first principle of historiography is to confirm 'the information' from general condition of the period under discussion This is the major factor that makes history a science otherwise {{it is just a}} repetition of events. The information must be relevant to the topic under writing and the historian must be careful in history writing, as fame and renown depends upon him. The foundation of history is human civilization. Chapter 4 inquires into the development of civilization. Ibn Khaldun supports the idea of the evolution of man that resembles with the ideas presented by Charles Darwin To him, both Bedouins and Sedentary people are natural groups. Each of them have particular qualities. However, Bedouins are superior to sedentary in moral values. All the sedentary groups are product of Bedouin civilization and its groups. Reversion towards bedouinism means to adopt simple way of life and to part off from luxuries In this sense, all the modern nations, that are less-developed arc Bedouin. The most active force in the history is 'Asabiyah' i. e. 'group feeling'. It is a psychological factor that unites a group and leads it towards a goal that is royal authority After achieving royal authority, the conditions change and group feeling ceases to exist in ruling group. The group weakens and is replaced by some other powerful group having group feeling. Same is tile case of civilization. The sciences and crafts are the product of the civilization that depends upon the increasement in population. When a group conquers a civilization it is affected by its sedentary germs and soon it becomes sedentary. When some civilization comes into contacts or elastics with some other civilization, a new civilization is bom out that is the synthesis of two civilizations. No civilization perish completely but the new civilization adopts the components of the old one. A great empire divides into regional states and at a good time, these regional states are again unified in a central power. The urban civilization is the peak of development but it differs into its size and qualities that correspond to population. Ibn Khaldun rejects the ideas of 'ideal state' and 'racial superiority. ' To him, <b>class-system</b> is natural. Chapter 5 gives us a chance to compare Ibn Khaldun with five western philosophers. Like Marx, Ibn Khaldun seems more rational than remaining four i. e. Machievelli, Vico, Voltaire and Toynbee. Chapter 6 is an attempt to apply some of Ibn Khaldun's ideas on contemporary world issues. The most important is fundamentalism Suprisingly, Ibn Khaldun's theory comes true of all modern fundamentalist movements. The end of all such movements is, according to Ibn Khaldun, 'failure'. The next point of discussion is 'terrorism' which never exists. To whom we call terrorism is no more than group fighting. Sex free society, especially, homosexuality causes destruction of human beings and it may be disastrous to West. Dictatorship makes the subjects cowardice and discourages creative activities. Some other contemporary world issues are also discussed in this chapter briefly. The thesis shows that a large part of Ibn Khaldun's ideas is applicable in all times...|$|E
