25|$|Cancer {{immunotherapy}} (Immuno-oncology or Immunooncology) {{is the use}} of {{the immune}} system to treat <b>cancer.</b> <b>Immunotherapies</b> can be categorized as active, passive or hybrid (active and passive). These approaches exploit the fact that cancer cells often have molecules on their surface that can be detected by the immune system, known as tumour-associated antigens (TAAs); they are often proteins or other macromolecules (e.g. carbohydrates). Active immunotherapy directs the immune system to attack tumor cells by targeting TAAs. Passive immunotherapies enhance existing anti-tumor responses and include the use of monoclonal antibodies, lymphocytes and cytokines.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> {{is gaining}} {{momentum}} in the clinic. The current challenge is to understand why a proportion of cancer patients {{do not respond to}} <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy,</b> and how this can be translated into the rational design of combinatorial <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> strategies aimed at maximizing success of immunotherapy. Here, we discuss how tumors orchestrate an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which contributes to their escape from immune attack. Relieving the immunosuppressive networks in cancer patients is an attractive strategy to extend the clinical success of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy.</b> Since the clinical availability of drugs specifically targeting immunosuppressive cells or mediators is still limited, an alternative strategy is to use conventional chemotherapy drugs with immunomodulatory properties to improve <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy.</b> We summarize the preclinical and clinical studies that illustrate how the anti-tumor T cell response can be enhanced by chemotherapy-induced relief of immunosuppressive networks. Treatment strategies aimed at combining chemotherapy-induced relief of immunosuppression and T cell-boosting checkpoint inhibitors provide an attractive and clinically feasible approach to overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy,</b> and to extend the clinical success of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Background: Immunotherapy {{has become}} an {{attractive}} new strategy {{in the treatment of}} cancer. The laboratory and clinical study of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> is rapidly advancing. However, in the clinical setting, the results of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> are mixed. We therefore contend that <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> should be customized to each patient individually based on their immune status and propose an integrative immunotherapy approach with second-generation group-specific component macrophage activating factor (GcMAF) -containing human serum. Patients and Methods: The standard protocol of our integrative <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> is as follows: i) 0. 5 ml GcMAF-containing human serum is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously once or twice per week for the duration of cancer therapy until all cancer cells are eradicated; ii) hyper T/natural killer (NK) cell therap...|$|R

40|$|As {{healthcare}} costs continue to rise, {{there has been}} great interest in understanding and defining the value of current therapeutic strategies {{for the treatment of}} <b>cancer.</b> <b>Cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> has emerged as a clinically beneficial alternative to conventional therapies for a variety of malignancies. Characterized by broad clinical activity, durable response rates, distinct side effects, and unique response kinetics, immune-based agents are vastly different compared with traditional cytotoxic or targeted therapies. To date, however, value assessments in oncology have not focused on the unique aspects of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy,</b> which has resulted in a lack of understanding of the true value of these therapies. Therefore, the Society for <b>Immunotherapy</b> of <b>Cancer</b> (SITC) convened key stakeholders to address the critical issues that define the value of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> in National Harbor, Maryland on November 13, 2016. Organized in collaboration with the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and with over 1500 registrants, this Value of <b>Cancer</b> <b>Immunotherapy</b> Summit united research scientists, academic physicians, industry professionals, health economists, third-party payers, and patients to discuss critical issues surrounding the value framework for <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy.</b> This half-day summit addressed the current landscape of cancer therapy value models, economic outcomes, the current status of predictive biomarkers, as well as presentations from third-party payers, industry representatives, patient outcome experts, and patient advocacy groups to gain their perspectives on the value of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy.</b> Here, we summarize the presentations and the dominant themes from this symposium, with the intention of providing insight on future directions and to develop recommendations to better define the value of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> for patients with cancer...|$|R

50|$|A second poxvirus-based {{technology}} is employed {{in most of}} the company’s <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapies,</b> and was in-licensed as part of a collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Vaccinia-fowlpox-TRICOM is a sequential prime-boost therapy based on vaccinia and fowlpox in combination with three co-stimulatory molecules (TRICOM). The poxvirus-based immunotherapy can be modified to encode different tumor-associated antigens such as Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and/or Mucin 1 (MUC1), which are all tumor markers that are overexpressed in various cancers. This technology forms the basis of the company’s lead oncology product candidates, Prostvac and CV-301. Prostvac is an active immunotherapy candidate, currently the subject of a global Phase 3 clinical study “PROSPECT” in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 80% of Merkel-cell carcinomas {{are caused}} by MCV. The virus is clonally {{integrated}} into the cancerous Merkel cells. In addition, the virus has a particular mutation only when found in cancer cells, but not when it is detected in healthy skin cells. [...] Direct evidence for this oncogenetic mechanism comes from research showing that inhibition of production of MCV proteins causes MCV-infected Merkel carcinoma cells to die but {{has no effect on}} malignant Merkel cells that are not infected with this virus. [...] MCV-uninfected tumors, which account for approximately 20% of Merkel-cell carcinomas, appear to have a separate and as-yet unknown cause. These tumors tend to have extremely high genome mutation rates, due to ultraviolet light exposure, whereas MCV-infected Merkel cell carcinomas have low rates of genome mutation. [...] No other cancers have been confirmed so far to be caused by this virus. Because of the viral origin for this <b>cancer,</b> <b>immunotherapies</b> are a promising avenue for research to treat virus-positive Merkel-cell carcinoma.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this review}} will be {{underlined}} two simple ideas of potential {{interest for the}} design of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapies.</b> One concerns the importance of kinetics, with the key notion that a single cause may trigger two opposite effects with different kinetics. The importance of this phenomenon will be underlined in neurobiology, transcription networks and the immune system. The second idea is that efficient immune responses have been selected against pathogens, throughout evolution. They are never due to a single cell type, but always require multiple, complex cellular cooperations. One cannot recognize this fact and persist in the presently dominant T-cell centered view of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapies.</b> Suggestions will be made to incorporate these simple ideas for improving these therapies...|$|E

40|$|The {{principles}} of cancer immunoediting {{have set the}} foundations for understanding the dual host-protective and tumor sculpting actions of immunity on cancer and establishing the basis for novel individualized <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapies.</b> During cancer immunoediting, the host immune system shapes tumor fate in three phases through the activation of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. In the first phase, Elimination, transformed cells are destroyed by a competent immune system. Sporadic tumor cells that manage to survive immune destruction may then enter an Equilibrium phase where editing occurs. The Escape phase represents {{the third and final}} phase of the process, where immunologically sculpted tumors begin to grow progressively, become clinically apparent and establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This review focuses on important recent developments that have enhanced our understanding of each phase of the cancer immunoediting process, summarizes the discovery of new predictive and prognostic biomarkers and discusses development of novel and objectively effective <b>cancer</b> <b>immunotherapies...</b>|$|E
