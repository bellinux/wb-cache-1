50|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, the noise margin {{is the amount}} by which the signal exceeds the {{threshold}} for a proper '0' or '1'. For example, a digital circuit might be designed to swing between 0.0 and 1.2 volts, with anything below 0.2 volts considered a '0', and anything above 1.0 volts considered a '1'. Then the noise margin for a '0' would be the amount that a signal is below 0.2 volts, and the noise margin for a '1' would be the amount by which a signal exceeds 1.0 volt. In this <b>case</b> <b>noise</b> margins are measured as an absolute voltage, not a ratio. Noise margins for CMOS chips are usually much greater than those for TTL because the VOH min {{is closer to the}} power supply voltage and VOL max is closer to zero.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To achieve small {{delay and}} low {{crosstalk}} for multiple signal nets with capacitive and inductive coupling, we propose {{in this paper}} a novel interconnect structure, staggered twisted-bundle wires where groups of twisted wires are staggered. This new structure {{is different from the}} previously proposed twisted bundle wires with one group of twisted wires and another group of normal wires. Using accurate circuit models and efficient algorithms to find the worst <b>case</b> <b>noise</b> and delay for comprehensive combinations of signal patterns and a range of arrival times, we assume signal and shielding ratio over 1 : 1 for area reduction and compare the aforementioned two structures to coplanar shielding for signal nets. The staggered twisted-bundle has the smallest worst case delay, up to 20 % and 5 % smaller than the coplanar shielding and twisted bundle, respectively. The staggered twisted bundle also has the smallest worst <b>case</b> <b>noise,</b> up to 6 % and 12 % less than coplanar shielding and twisted bundle. Furthermore, the staggered twisted bundle has the smallest delay/noise variation between signal nets. We conclude that without increasing routing area, the staggered twisted bundle is better than the twisted bundle and coplanar shielding in terms of performance and noise. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a cellular multiuser MIMO system depends on various parameters, e. g. the system structure, the transmitter and receiver strategy, the channel state information at the transmitter and the receiver, and the channel properties. Recently, {{the main focus of}} research was on single-user MIMO systems and its capacity and its error performance with spacetime coding. In general, the {{performance of}} the cellular multiuser MIMO system is limited by additive white Gaussian noise, intracell interference from other users within the cell, and by intercell interference from users outside the considered cell. In our analysis, the base applies a MMSE receiver. Therefore, we choose the normalised MSE as the performance metric of the wireless system. We study one point-to-point link, on which interference act. The interference models the different system scenarios and various parameters. Therefore, we consider three scenarios in which the noise is subject to different constraints. A general trace constraint is used in the first scenario. The noise covariance matrix eigenvalues are kept fixed in the second scenario, and in the third scenario the entries on the diagonal of the noise covariance matrix are kept fix. We assume that the receiver as well as the transmitter have perfect channel state information. We solve the corresponding minimax programming problems and characterise the worst <b>case</b> <b>noise</b> and the optimal transmit strategy. In all scenarios the normalised MSE of the MIMO system with worst <b>case</b> <b>noise</b> is equal to the MSE of some MIMO system in which either the channels are orthogonal or the transmit antennas are not allowed to cooperate or in which no channel state information is available at the transmitter. Furthermore, the minimax expressions fulfill a saddle point property. All theoretical results are illustrated by examples and numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Phase-locked loops (PLLs) which employ voltage {{regulators}} for low supply-noise sensitivity often rely upon significant decoupling capacitance to suppress negative (Gnd) supply noise and maintain low jitter. This paper compares various supply regulation techniques {{on the basis}} of their ability to reject noise from both positive and negative supplies.

We point out the need of averaging over the initial phase of the external drive at small frictional inhomogeneity parameter values or analogously low potential asymmetry regimes in obtaining ratchet current.
