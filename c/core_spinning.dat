Textiles have been chemically modified to impart flame/fire retardancy (FR) properties and also {{studies have been done}} on inherently FR fibers. This research focuses on Polysulfonamide (PSA) fiber, an inherently FR fiber developed by Shanghai Textile Research Institute and Shanghai Synthetic Fiber Research Institute. The purpose of this research is to study ways of incorporating PSA into yarns that will utilize the benefits of the PSA fiber while compensating for its limitations. The 100 % PSA yarn and five different percentage variations of PSA/cotton blended yarns were produced by ring spinning. The blending methods were intimate blending and <b>core</b> <b>spinning,</b> with cotton yarns being used as core and PSA fibers as sheath.

40|$|In {{the process}} of flux expulsion, a {{magnetic}} field is expelled from a region of closed streamlines on a T R 1 / 3 m time scale, for magnetic Reynolds number Rm 1 (T being the turnover time of the flow). This classic result applies in the kinematic regime where the flow field is specified independently of the magnetic field. A weak magnetic ‘core’ is left at the centre of a closed region of streamlines, and this decays exponentially on the T R 1 / 2 m time scale. The present paper extends these results to the dynamical regime, where there is competition between {{the process of}} flux expulsion and the Lorentz force, which suppresses the differential rotation. This competition is studied using a quasi-linear model in which the flow is constrained to be axisymmetric. The magnetic Prandtl number Rm/Re is taken to be small, Rm large, {{and a range of}} initial field strengths b 0 is considered. Two scaling laws are proposed and confirmed numerically. For initial magnetic fields below the threshold bcore = O(UR− 1 / 3 m), flux expulsion operates despite the Lorentz force, cutting through field lines to result in the formation of a central core of magnetic field. Here U is a velocity scale of the flow and magnetic fields are measured in Alfv´en units. For larger initial fields the Lorentz force is dominant and the flow creates Alfv´en waves that propagate away. The second threshold is bdynam = O(UR− 3 / 4 m), below which the field follows the kinematic evolution and decays rapidly. Between these two thresholds the magnetic field is strong enough to suppress differential rotation, leaving a magnetically controlled <b>core</b> <b>spinning</b> in solid body motion, which then decays slowly on a time scale of order T Rm...|$|E

30|$|Another fire {{blocking}} technology uses <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> yarn {{to produce}} barrier materials. <b>Core</b> <b>spun</b> yarn (also known as core-sheath yarn) {{begins with an}} inherently fire resistant fiber core (e.g., glass). This core is then coated with a less expensive material (e.g., polyester) that is primarily responsible for the aesthetic and comfort properties.

This type of “grid/lattice” structure ([[URL] 2999]) provides the physical barrier that prevents flame penetration into the more flammable cushioning layer as discussed earlier. The composition of the core and sheath can be tailored to satisfy fabric performance requirements. For example, to further improve fire resistance the sheath layer may contain FR, and to improve strength and durability a polyester or polyamide sheath may be used instead of a cotton or polypropylene.
