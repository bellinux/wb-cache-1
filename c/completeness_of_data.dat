40|$|Background Complete {{and timely}} health {{information}} {{is essential to}} inform public health decision-making for {{maternal and child health}}, but is often lacking in resource-constrained settings. Electronic medical record (EMR) systems are increasingly being adopted to support the delivery of health care, and are particularly amenable to maternal and child health services. An EMR system could enable the mother and child to be tracked and monitored throughout maternity shared care, improve quality and <b>completeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collected and enhance sharing of health information between outpatient clinic and the hospital, and between clinical and public health services to inform decision-making. Methods This study implemented a novel cloud-based electronic medical record system in a maternal and child health outpatient setting in Western Kenya between April and June 2013 and evaluated its impact on improving <b>completeness</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collected by clinical and public health services. The impact of the system was assessed using a two-sample test of proportions pre- and post-implementation of EMR-based data verification.
