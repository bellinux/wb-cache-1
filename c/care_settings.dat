25|$|With a {{contralateral}} (opposite side) autogenous patellar tendon graft, the graft {{includes the}} middle {{section of the}} patellar tendon along with two attached bone plugs one on each end. The contralateral autogenous patellar tendon graft is rarely used as primary revision due to the concern of donor site morbidity. Instead it is primarily considered when a patient is opposed to using an allograft but has already undergone an ACL revision using the ipsilateral patellar tendon. In addition, there are many health <b>care</b> <b>settings</b> around the nation where readily available, safe, and cost effective allograft tissues are not obtainable. In this situation the contralateral autogenous Patellar tendon graft {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|To work in {{the nursing}} profession, all nurses hold one or more {{credentials}} depending on their scope of practice and education. A licensed practical nurse (LPN) (also {{referred to as a}} licensed vocational nurse, registered practical nurse, enrolled nurse, and state enrolled nurse) works independently or with a registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A registered nurse provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health <b>care</b> <b>settings.</b> Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.|$|E

Issues, controversies, and problems such as mapping existing workflows, security, and change management are identified, and solutions are suggested for the process of transforming predominantly paper-based ambulatory care systems into electronic point-of-care (ePOC) systems. A current research and development project, the ePOC PDA project, {{is used as a}} case study to highlight discussion points.

25|$|Metrics {{applicable}} to the ED can be grouped into three main categories, volume, cycle time, and patient satisfaction. Volume metrics including arrivals per hour, percentage of ED beds occupied and age of patients are understood at a basic level at all hospitals as an indication for staffing requirements. Cycle time metrics are the mainstays of the evaluation and tracking of process efficiency and are less widespread since an active effort is needed to collect and analyze this data. Patient satisfaction metrics, already commonly collected by nursing groups, physician groups and hospitals, are useful in demonstrating the impact of changes in patient perception of care over time. Since patient satisfaction metrics are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary process improvement. Health information exchanges can reduce nonurgent ED visits by supplying current data about admissions, discharges, and transfers to health plans and accountable care organizations, allowing them to shift ED use to primary <b>care</b> <b>settings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each year, {{more than}} 2.5 {{million people in}} the United States develop {{pressure}} ulcers. In acute <b>care</b> <b>settings</b> in the United States, the incidence of bedsores is 0.4% to 38%; within long-term care it is 2.2% to 23.9%, and in home care, it is 0% to 17%. Similarly, there is wide variation in prevalence: 10% to 18% in acute care, 2.3% to 28% in long-term care, and 0% to 29% in home care. There is a much higher rate of bedsores in intensive care units because of immunocompromised individuals, with 8% to 40% of those in the ICU developing bedsores. However, pressure ulcer prevalence is highly dependent on the methodology used to collect the data. Using the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) methodology there are similar figures for pressure ulcers in acutely sick people in the hospital. There are differences across countries, but using this methodology pressure ulcer prevalence in Europe was consistently high, from 8.3% (Italy) to 22.9% (Sweden). A recent study in Jordan also showed a figure in this range. Some research shows differences in pressure-ulcer detection among white and black residents in nursing homes.|$|E
500|$|One {{focus of}} {{attachment}} {{research has been}} the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern {{with the effects of}} child care was intense during the so-called [...] "day care wars" [...] of the late-20th century, during which some authors stressed the deleterious effects of day care. As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a child to a specific care-giver. Although only high-quality child <b>care</b> <b>settings</b> are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past.|$|E
