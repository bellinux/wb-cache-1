50|$|Teaspoons {{with longer}} handles, such as iced tea spoons, are {{commonly}} used also for ice cream desserts or floats. Similar spoons include the tablespoon and the dessert spoon, the latter intermediate in size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, used in eating dessert and sometimes soup or cereals. Much less common is the <b>coffee</b> <b>spoon,</b> which is a smaller version of the teaspoon, intended for used with the small type of coffee cup. Another teaspoon, called an orange spoon (in American English: grapefruit spoon), tapers to a sharp point or teeth, and is used to separate citrus fruits from their membranes. A bar spoon, equivalent to a teaspoon, is used in measuring ingredients for mixed drinks.|$|E
5000|$|Poirot reveals in the dénouement that dentist Norman Gale, {{heretofore}} seen as {{a sympathetic}} protagonist with a crush on the novel's ingenue heroine, Jane Grey, {{is none other than}} Anne's new husband. Gale's plans - almost certainly including the eventual murder of Anne herself - had been laid well in advance. Gale brought his dentist's jacket on board—the item which had made Poirot suspicious earlier when reviewing the passengers' list of onboard possessions. In the apparently innocuous moments when he apparently went to the water closet, he actually changed into this jacket to pose as a steward. Under the pretense of delivering a <b>coffee</b> <b>spoon</b> to Miss Giselle he had walked up the aisle and stabbed her with the poisoned thorn. As Poirot puts it: [...] "No one notices a steward particularly." [...] Gale's intention had been to frame the Countess, and the blowpipe found behind Poirot's seat would have been found behind hers had they not switched seats at the last moment. Poirot invites Mr Clancy to the dénouement where he gleefully allows the novelist to see how a real-life detective solves a case, to both men's great enjoyment. Finally, in a single stroke Poirot makes a romantic match by pairing off Jane Grey with the younger archaeologist, who has fallen in love with her.|$|E
5000|$|Frustrated {{with the}} evident artificiality of the blowpipe, an item that {{could hardly have}} been used without being seen by another passenger, Poirot {{suggests}} that the means of delivering the dart may have been something else. Is it the flute of one passenger, or perhaps one of the ancient tubes carried by one of the two French archaeologists (father and son) on board? Or maybe Lady Horbury's long cigarette holder? Why were there two <b>coffee</b> <b>spoons</b> in the victim's saucer? ...|$|R
50|$|The Sprüngli café on Paradeplatz is a {{traditional}} meeting-place of the elderly ladies of Zürich's upper class. Local folklore has it that young men who attend the café alone may signal their availability to these well-to-do women by turning over their <b>coffee</b> <b>spoons</b> in their cups. But according to the company's director, this is a persistent myth reflecting Zurich's more puritanical past, when the Sprüngli café {{was one of the}} few places where upper-class women could talk to strangers without risking their reputation.|$|R

The product designed was required to be congruent with five ideas: 1) the design must imply local culture and unique community heritage; 2) the production must be able to process by elderly citizens; 3) the product can be produced with low cost of production and use mainly local raw materials, 4) the product must be attractive to customers, and 5) The product must come with a beautiful package. The product designed was aimed to enhance the sale of community products which produced by elderly citizens...|$|E

Often the mannequins come to me damaged, missing arms, legs, or features. This metaphor for rejection both fascinates and repels me, but it has propelled me to further explore the use of body parts, resulting in a decomposition of the mannequins. I use found objects, such as antique Victrola horns and telephones to give these women voices again, albeit voices that feel distant, isolated, or faint. I also incorporate objects inspired by poetry, such as the <b>coffee</b> <b>spoons</b> in T. S. Eliott’s The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. Combining objects, mannequins, and literary references, my work is concerned with alienation and inner conflict, and reestablishing inner and outer communication. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Gift-giving {{is part of}} the {{ceremonial}} behaviour in many celebrations associated with rites of passage. In this article I discuss the gifts children recieve at christening parties. Even though some parents emphasize that they do not want "typical" christening presents, like pewter savings-boxes or silver photography frames, they often find that the guests nevertheless have brought such gifts. An explanation for this is that the "typical" christening gifts may be perceived as necessary: without them the christening does not "feel" right. Another common gift is a <b>coffee</b> silver <b>spoon,</b> which is to be followed by others of the same type at future birthdays. These are often godparents' gifts and can thus be considered as a materialised manifestation of a relation that is meant to last. Although the christening of a child is a religious act it is also an event which serves {{to create a sense of}} family community and belonging and to build relations. The gifts the child receive has, like all gifts, a value not only for the gift-receiver but also for the gift-giver...|$|R
