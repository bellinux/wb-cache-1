40|$|Simply turning bags {{of beans}} upside down {{twice a day}} is {{the easiest way to}} stop the larvae of the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> causing damage. With regular {{disturbance}} the larvae soon die of exhaustion. The larvae of the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> (Acanthoscelides obtectus) is responsible for causing large losses of beans in storage. Effective control by small-holder farmers in the Tropics has been difficult. Each adult is able to lay many eggs and, once they hatch, the larvae soon bore into the beans. A recent study has shown that the larvae had to wedge themselves between two beans in order to get enough leverage to start boring. It takes a larva between 24 and 48 hours of continuous scraping to get inside a bean. Researchers from Michigan State University argued that if the larvae were repeatedly dislodged they would be unable to bore effectively into the stored beans and might even die of exhaustion. Beans were put in various containers with adult weevils. The containers were turned regularly for two weeks, {{and at the end of}} that time damage was found to have been reduced by 97 %. Some of the mortality was due to exhaustion, as predicted but some larvae were also crushed as the beans moved. The researchers therefore recommend that bags of beans are turned upside down in the morning and again in the evening. It is possible that the technique might work with other pests of stored beans and grain if those pests need leverage in order to bore successfully.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is {{economically}} and nutritionally an important legume, {{not only in}} Malawi, but {{in many parts of}} Africa and Latin America. Unfortunately, two bruchid species (Acanthoscelides obtectus Say, and Zabrotes subfasciatus Boheman) are known to cause extensive damage in storage, reducing the economic importance, food value and planting value of the crop. The aim {{of this study was to}}: i) ascertain farmers’ perceptions of the importance of bruchids as storage pests, and to identify their preferred varietal traits in dry beans; ii) screen Malawian dry bean landraces for effective and adaptable sources of resistance to the two bruchid species; iii) determine the gene action and inheritance of bruchid resistance. Farmers’ perceptions on the importance of the two bruchid species to beans both in the field and in storage were established using a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) in three extension planning areas (EPAs) in Lilongwe agricultural development division (ADD). Results confirmed that the two bruchid species are important storage pests, causing serious storage losses among smallholder farmers. In the absence of any control measures, farmers indicated that more than 50 % of their stored beans could be lost to bruchids. Indigenous bruchid control measures are not very effective, making it necessary to search for other control methods. It was also clear from the PRA results that breeders need to consider both agronomic and culinary traits in bean cultivar development. This would enhance uptake of newly developed varieties. To address the problem of bruchid damage experienced by smallholder farmers, a total of 135 dry bean genotypes, comprising 77 landraces and 58 improved varieties (obtained from collaborating partners) were tested under laboratory infestation (nochoice test methods) and field infestation (free-choice test methods). The objective of this study was to identify effective sources of resistance to the two bruchid species. Results of the study showed that there was a wide variation among the genotypes for resistance to the two bruchid species. Overall results showed that 88 % of the genotypes ranged from susceptible to highly susceptible to Z. subfasciatus and only 12 % of the genotypes were moderately resistant to resistant. Genotype screening for resistance to A. obtectus showed that only 12. 5 % were resistant, whereas 87. 5 % were moderately to highly susceptible. All of the improved genotypes were 100 % susceptible to A. obtectus in storage. One landrace, KK 35, consistently showed a high level of resistance to both bruchids under laboratory infestation, with results similar to the resistant checks (SMARC 2 and SMARC 4), while another landrace, KK 90, displayed stable resistance under both laboratory and field infestation. However, performance of most genotypes was not consistent with field and laboratory screenings, suggesting that mechanisms of bruchid resistance in the field are different from that in the laboratory and field screening should always be used to validate laboratory screening. Resistance in the field was not influenced by morphological traits. The seed coat played a significant role in conferring resistance to both bruchid species in the laboratory, whereas arcelin did not play any significant role in conferring resistance in the landraces. The inheritance of resistance to A. obtectus was studied in a 6 x 6 complete diallel mating design, involving crosses of selected Malawian dry bean landraces. The F 1 crosses, their reciprocals, and six parents were infested with seven F 1 generation (1 to 3 d old) insects of A. obtectus in a laboratory, no-choice test. There were significant differences among genotypes for general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA). However, SCA accounted for 81 % of the sum of squares for the crosses, indicating predominance of the non-additive gene action contributing to bruchid resistance. A chi-square test for a single gene model showed that 5 of the 13 F 2 populations fitted the 1 : 2 : 1 segregation ratio of resistant, intermediate and susceptible classes, respectively indicating partial dominance. The eight F 2 populations did not conform to the two gene model of 1 : 4 : 6 : 4 : 1 segregation ratio of resistant, moderately resistant, moderately susceptible, susceptible and highly susceptible classes, respectively. Average degree of dominance was in the partial dominance range in five F 3 populations, but in general resistance was controlled by over-dominance gene action in the F 2 populations. The additive-dominance model was adequate to explain the variation among genotypes indicating that epistatic effects were not important in controlling the bruchid resistance. The frequency distribution of the 13 F 3 populations for resistance to A. obtectus provided evidence for transgressive segregation, suggesting that resistance is conditioned by more than one gene. Reciprocal differences were not significant in the F 2 generation seed; but were significant in four crosses in the F 3 generation seed for adult bruchid emergence, suggesting that maternal effects or cytoplasmic gene effects also played a role in the inheritance of resistance to the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil.</b> Through this study, important sources of bruchid resistance in dry bean have been identified in Malawian landraces (KK 35, KK 90 and KK 73). These resistant sources will be used in a breeding programme to develop bruchid resistant bean cultivars, as well as improve resistance in susceptible commercial bean cultivars currently grown by farmers in Malawi...|$|E

Since the biosynthesis of arcelin in resistant genotypes is a simply inherited trait, researchers were able to breed resistance to Z. subfasciatus into experimental lines of domesticated beans.

Although many efforts have been made, a successful breeding of this genetic trait into cultivated genotypes has not yet been achieved. Here, we describe a newly collected wild accession (named QUES) and demonstrate its resistance to both A. obtectus and Z. subfasciatus. Immunological and proteomic analyses of QUES seed protein composition indicated the presence of new Arc and arcelin-like (ARL) polypeptides of about 30 and 27 kDa, respectively. Sequencing of cDNAs coding for QUES APA proteins confirmed that this accession contains new APA variants, here referred to as Arc- 8 and ARL- 8. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis showed the two proteins are closely related to APA components present in the G 12949 wild bean accession, which contains the Arc- 4 variant. The presence of these new APA components, combined with the observations that they are poorly digested and remain very abundant in A. obtectus feces, so-called frass, suggest that the QUES APA locus is involved in the bruchid resistance. Moreover, molecular analysis indicated a lower complexity of the locus compared to that of G 12949, suggesting that QUES should be considered a valuable source of resistance for further breeding purposes...|$|R
