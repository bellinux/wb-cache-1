40|$|Let K be an {{infinite}} field.

In particular, Lie_K is the largest such. Thus, for a given variety <b>of</b> <b>alternating</b> K-algebras, the Jacobi identity becomes equivalent to a categorical condition: it is a law in V if and only if V is a subvariety of a locally algebraically cartesian closed variety <b>of</b> <b>alternating</b> K-algebras. This is based on a result saying that an algebraically coherent variety <b>of</b> <b>alternating</b> K-algebras is either a variety of Lie algebras or a variety of antiassociative algebras over K...|$|R
