40|$|Ephrins {{and their}} {{tyrosine}} kinase receptors {{are involved in}} patterning of axonal connections during development in the nervous system of vertebrates [1]. They {{also play a role}} in neuronal plasticity in the adult brain, with particular reference to the hippocampus [2], in which they also modulate LTP induction [3]. We have raised C 57 /BL 6 mice in an enriched environment, which increases adult hippocampal activity and alters hippocampal-dependent behaviors in rodents [4], to examine whether experience-dependent stimulation induces behavioral ameliorations, modifications in neuronal morphology and variations in the expression of ephrins, such as ephrin-B 2 and eph-B 2 receptor, in such structure. After an eight-week enrichment training, mice were challenged by the context-dependent fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>test</b> and Morris Water Maze, which are behavioral paradigms sensitive to hippocampal modifications [5], and by the cue-dependent fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>test,</b> which mainly relies on amygdala functions. Enriched mice (EM) performed better than non-enriched ones (CM) in the context-dependent fear conditioning and Morris Water Maze tests, but not in the cue-dependent fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>test.</b> After the enrichment period, dendritic arborization and spine density of Golgi-Cox stained CA 1 hippocampal neurons were increased with respect to CM. After the fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>testing</b> however, spine density of EM hippocampal neurons decreased below the level of CM. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a specific higher abundance of ephrin-B 2 and eph-B 2 receptor in the pyramidal layer of the CA 1 area and in cortical layers, but not the amygdala, of EM. We suggest that: hippocampal neuron complexity is enhanced by enrichment along with spatial learning, but is rapidly decreased by an aversive experience; ephrin-B 2 and eph-B 2 receptor are involved in dendritic spine dinamycs during learning...|$|R

Desiccant materials attract moisture based on differences in vapor pressure. Due to their enormous affinity to absorb water and considerable ability to hold water. Due to use of desiccant material load on the cooling coil reduces since moisture is absorbed by desiccant; cooling coil has to take only sensible load. Analysis is done using different desiccant materials and based on the observation, power consumption before and after desiccant is calculated.

Materials and Methods Conditioning to morphine (2. 5 - 10 mg/kg, s. c.) was established in adult male Wistar rats (weighing 200 - 250 g) using an unbiased procedure. Nitric oxide agents were microinjected into the central amygdala prior to naloxone-paired place <b>conditioning</b> <b>testing.</b> Results The results showed that morphine produced a significant dose-dependent place preference in animals. Naloxone (0. 1 - 0. 4 mg/kg, i. p.) injections pre-testing of the response to morphine (7. 5 mg/kg, s. c.) caused a significant aversion at the higher doses (0. 4 mg/kg, i. p.). This response was reversed by micro{{injection of}} L-arginine (0. 3 - 3 µg/rat, intra-central amygdala) prior to naloxone {{on the day of}} the testing. The response to L-arginine was blocked by pre-injection of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (intra-central amygdala). Conclusion A single injection of naloxone on the test day of morphine place conditioning may simply reveal the occurrence of morphine dependence in rats, and that the nitric oxide in the central amygdala most likely plays a key role in this phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|The {{permanent}} occlusion {{of common}} carotid arteries (2 -VO) in rats {{has been shown}} to induce progressive and long-lasting deficits in cognitive performance, however, whether these aberrant behaviors are attributed to visual dysfunction or cognitive impairment and what are the underlying mechanisms, remain controversial. In the present study, vision dominant (Morris water maze) and non-vision dominant (voice-cued fear <b>conditioning)</b> behavioral <b>tests</b> were assigned to comprehensively evaluate the influence of 2 -VO lesion on cognitive behaviors. In the Morris water maze test, escape latencies of 2 -VO rats were markedly increased in both hidden and unfixed visible platform tasks, which were accompanied by severe retinal damage. In the voice-cued fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>test,</b> significant reduction in the percentage of freezing behavior was observed at 60 days after 2 -VO lesion. Chronic lesion by 2 -VO failed to cause noticeable changes in the grey matter, as indicated by intact hippocampal and prefrontal cortical structures, sustained synaptic protein levels and glial cell numbers. In contrast, aberrant arrangement of myelinated axons was observed in the optic tract, but not in the corpus callosum and inner capsule of 2 -VO rats. Concurrently, marked astrocyte proliferation and microglia activation in the optic tract occurred at 3 days after 2 -VO lesion, and continued for up to 60 days. Differently, robust glial activation was observed in the corpus callosum at 3 days after 2 -VO surgery, and then gradually returned to the baseline level at 14 and 60 days. Our study reported for the first time about the effect of 2 -VO on the long-term cognitive impairment in the non-vision dominant fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>test,</b> which may be more applicable than the Morris water maze test for assessing 2 -VO associated cognitive function.

The rats were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: place conditioning without drug treatment before nicotine (0. 5 mg kg - 1, i. p.); place conditioning with oral VCO at 5 mL kg - 1 or the reference drug diclofenac (3. 2 mg kg - 1, i. p.) 30 min prior to each nicotine treatment.

Although lithium may augment the effect of mirtazapine, this augmentation has not been confirmed. Using a contextual fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>test</b> in rats, an animal model of anxiety or fear, we examined the effect of subchronic lithium carbonate (in diet) in combination with systemic mirtazapine on the expression of contextual conditioned fear. Mirtazapine (10 mg/kg) reduced freezing one day after fear conditioning dose-dependently, whereas the anxiolytic-like effect of mirtazapine (10 mg/kg) diminished seven days after fear conditioning. When the interval between fear <b>conditioning</b> and <b>testing</b> was seven days, only the combination of subchronic 0. 2 % Li 2 CO 3 but not 0. 05 % Li 2 CO 3 with acute mirtazapine (10 mg/kg) reduced freezing significantly. These results indicate that subchronic 0. 2 % Li 2 CO 3 treatment enhanced the anxiolytic-like effect of systemic mirtazapine.

40|$|The {{learning}} {{abilities of}} planarian worms (Dugesia tigrina) were assessed {{by using a}} number of Pavlovian conditioning paradigms. Experiment 1 showed that planaria were susceptible to basic conditioning in that they readily developed a conditioned response {{to a change in}} ambient luminance when it was consistently paired with an electric shock over a number of trials.

40|$|Rationale: Huntington's disease (HD) is {{characterized}} by progressive motor dysfunction, emotional disturbances and cognitive deficits. It is a genetic disease caused by an elongation of the polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin gene. Whereas HD is a complex disorder, previous studies in mice models have largely been confined to assessing motor deficits. Objectives: The aim of the present studies is a comprehensive phenotypical assessment of not only motor and gait deficits, but also of emotional and cognitive deficits in adult BACHD mice. Material and methods: 46 male BACHD mice between 9 and 10 months of age were used. Wild type (+/+) and transgenic (+/T) mice were tested for motor deficits on a Rotarod and Catwalk system. Emotional deficits were assessed with the zero-maze and fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>tests.</b> Cognitive deficits in a strategy shifting task were evaluated in a cross-maze test. Results: Comparing +/T and +/+ mice, we replicated the motor deficits in the transgenic mice that were previously described in the Rotarod test. For the first time, motor coordination imbalances in +/T animals are described in the Catwalk gait analysis system. +/T mice showed more anxiety-like behavior in the zero-maze test and a higher freezing response in the fear <b>conditioning</b> <b>test.</b> Reversal and strategy shifting impairments were demonstrated in the cross-maze, indicative of a disturbed prefrontal striatal pathway. Conclusion: The results suggest that BACHD mice represent an animal model {{with a high degree}} of face validity for HD and may be very useful for testing novel therapeutic strategies.
