5000|$|The PM {{was founded}} {{just days after}} a street {{demonstration}} organized by the Russian soviet, described by Duca as an attempted coup spurred on by the socialist Christian Rakovski, supposedly thwarted by a Romanian demonstration of strength. According to Duca, the PM intended to partake in the putsch, but [...] "in the end got scared ... because they sensed that if the Russian revolutionaries are to stage a coup, it would not go in their favor". Diamandy, who was structurally a monarchist, printed a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> addressed <b>to</b> the Romanian proletariat. Afterward, the Laborites portrayed themselves as patriotic resisters, and Lupu even threatened to duel those who questioned his loyalty. The PM continued to have links with the revolutionary activist Ilie Cătărău, who was Lupu's emissary among the Romanian-speakers of the Russian Bessarabia Governorate. He contacted the National Moldavian Party, whose leader Pan Halippa dismissed the PM as irrelevant.|$|R

Guazzo had been sent to Düsseldorf by Duke Charles III of Lorraine (a family with which he had a long running association, having exorcised the Cardinal, Charles of Lorraine) on behalf of his daughter Antoinette (1569-1610), Duke Johann Wilhelm’s wife.|$|R

2500|$|Even as {{continued}} silence {{would seem}} a radical but also inconvenient form of communication, several Western authors recognized the social value of silence. Among those were Jacques Derrida and Søren Kierkegaard. In their view, silence would {{function as a}} precursor for clearer and substantively deeper understanding. Michael Strawser (Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Central Florida), commenting on Jacques Derrida's view of Soren Kierkegaard's meaning of silence, wrote, [...] "What is needed is Kierkegaard's <b>call</b> <b>to</b> silence in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> recognize one's responsibility to the other." [...] Silence is also valued by Perkey Avot, in the Jewish Sages guide for living, and functions as [...] "a safety fence for wisdom".|$|R
40|$|Search based testing {{approaches}} are efficient in test data generation; however {{they are likely}} to perform poorly when applied to programs with state variables. The problem arises when the target function includes guards that reference some of the program state variables whose values depend on previous function calls. Thus, merely considering the target function to derive test data is not sufficient. This paper introduces a testability transformation approach based on the analysis of control and data flow dependencies to bypass the state variable problem. It achieves this by eliminating state variables from guards and / or determining which functions <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> satisfy guards with state variables. A number of experiments demonstrate the value of the proposed approach. 1...|$|R
50|$|Interestingly Mach did {{not have}} a naming service of any sort for its ports. This proved to be a serious problem, because {{programs}} had to know in advance what servers they had <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> ask the kernel to provide a port. This meant that replacing functionality was much more difficult than it should have been; a new printer server needed to sit on the same ports as the old one for instance: there would be no way to run two side by side for development. If ports were instead referred to by name, servers could sit on different ports and simply use the same name. This functionality, provided by a name server, was considered highly important under Spring.|$|R
40|$|Contributions on {{competitive}} strategy and advantage have been long {{concentrated on the}} single firm.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{developing}} world, the notion of the knowledge society has elicited a response especially among higher education institutions (HEIs) and the role of this sector in developing human resources that are able to adapt and compete in such a society has led to the recognition of the government. In the case of the Philippines and Malaysia, for the country to be 'knowledge-'‐economy ready', its HEIs must embrace and facilitate a technology-'‐based orientation. This paper will look at the role of higher education in both the Philippines and Malaysia in relation to the requirements of the 'knowledge-'‐based' driven economy and how this sector responds and adapts <b>to</b> the challenging <b>call</b> <b>to</b> 'modernise' in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> perform and maximise its contribution to such objectives.

50|$|The Constitution {{is silent}} {{on the issue of}} the quorum needed <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> a {{parliamentary}} presidential electoral meeting. In the absence of a clear provision designating the quorum needed to elect the President, the constitution is open to differing interpretations. According to one view on the issue, a quorum constituting a majority of fifty-percent plus one (that required for any meeting of Parliament) is sufficient for a parliamentary presidential electoral meeting. Another view on the issue argues that the quorum is a two-third majority of the total members of Parliament as Article 49 of the constitution requires a two-third voting majority to elect the President in the first round and, if the quorum were half plus one, there would have been no need to require the two-third voting majority when the number of deputies present at the meeting does not exceed the quorum.|$|R
