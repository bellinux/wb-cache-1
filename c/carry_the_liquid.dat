40|$|Liquid loading is {{a problem}} in many gas wells {{especially}} older and depleted type reservoirs. If steps are not taken to minimize this effect, it will severely limit the production or even "kill" the well.

30|$|The {{streamlines}} {{inside the}} air and water phases for a superficial liquid velocity of 0.10  m/s and superficial gas velocities of 31.77  m/s 18.03  m/s downstream of the liquid inlet section are presented in Fig.  3 a, b, respectively, to show {{the characteristics of the}} flow field. It can be seen that when the amplitude of the forming wave at the liquid inlet section reaches its maximum value, it starts to move upwards. In Fig.  3 a, the liquid phase travels as thin film and it is carried out of the pipe due to the higher gas velocity (31.77  m/s) resulting in an annular flow pattern. The waves in this flow pattern tend to be flatter. All simulated cases that fall within the annular flow regime show that all the liquid film moves upward out of the pipe. As the superficial gas velocity reduces to 18.03  m/s, the drag force imparted on the liquid film becomes insufficient to <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> phase to the pipe exit section while keeping the typical annular flow pattern. As a result, the liquid film thickens, thus producing a circulatory flow region in the liquid phase causing part of the liquid film to move downward near the pipe wall. This is accompanied by the formation of flooding waves that have higher frequencies and tends to cause the continuous throwing of the liquid phase (water) in the region located above the liquid inlet section. In all the simulated cases that fall under the churn flow regime, part of the liquid film flows downwards periodically. This is considered to be the on-set of film reversal and the accompanied gas velocity is called the critical gas velocity.|$|E
40|$|The {{overreaching}} goal of {{this thesis}} research is to analyze liquid metal plug actuation in microfluidic channels and to exemplify this actuation in a tunable inductor design using liquid metal as a switching material, and to demonstrate the feasibility of liquid metal in other devices. A gallium and indium based alloy, EGaIn, which is liquid at room temperature is the liquid metal type chosen for this research. Although it owns some advantages such as high vapor pressure, non-toxicity and good conductivity, there are some crucial factors that we should pay attention to move the liquid metal in microchannels {{as a result of}} oxidation with contact to air and stickiness of oxidized skin to any surface. One of them is to determine the right coating material for coating the channel and the best surfactant to <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> metal plug without leaving residues with sufficient amount of pressure. So far, liquid metals have been used in some RF applications, but EGaIn could not be implemented properly in a microfluidic channel as a separate liquid metal plug because of the oxidation issue. Our aim is here to verify that there are ways to handle the actuation of based liquid metals in microchannels. In this thesis, we have used EGaIn in the experiments conducted, but the acquired results are also applicable to galinstan, which is another gallium based alloy. Right after the liquid metal actuation is exhibited in microfluidic channels, this actuation is exemplified in tunable loop and spiral inductors on both PCB and glass slides using lithography technique. A closed loop channel with peristaltic pumping valves has been designed with the help of LabVIEWTM and proper channel designing technique. Therefore, moving the liquid metal in a desired way with an expected speed is achieved. At the end of the study, tunability in an RF inductor using liquid metal as a switching part is provided, once a solution to the nagging oxidation problem of liquid metals is offered, and thus the feasibility of liquid metals to the electrical device applications is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas wells produce {{small amount}} of liquids along with the gas. During the initial part of the {{reservoir}} life, the gas velocity in the well tubing {{is large enough to}} drag the liquid upwards. As the well matures, the reservoir pressure starts to decline leading to a decline in the gas velocity in the tubing; here the gas momentum is not enough to <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> to the top and the liquid starts to accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} well. One of the ways to remove the liquid is the use of foam assisted lift technique where surfactant is injected downhole and turbulent mixing between the gas and the liquid generates foam which can easily be transported by the gas to the surface. However, the liquid produced in a gas well may differ from well to well. Depending on the fluid composition (gas, condensate, water) and the physical conditions of the well, a surfactant may or may not be able to remove the liquid from the bottom of the well. Hence it is imperative to evaluate the surfactant before its use. There are various methods available to evaluate a surfactant; one of the prominent methods is a small scale sparger test, where gas is injected into a surfactant solution to generate foam. We attempt to understand the foam behaviour in the small scale setup and we will use the insights to possibly standardize surfactant evaluation. The present work focuses on understanding the effect of three parameters on the foam generated in a small scale sparger setup, namely: gas velocity, surfactant concentration and pressure. We conduct three tests for each variation of the above three parameters, namely: build-up test, collapse test and carryover test. Two commercial surfactants: Foamatron and Trifoam Block 820 have been studied in the present work. In addition to these measurements, the characteristics of the dynamic surface tension of the surfactants are measured by using the maximum bubble pressure method. Increasing the pressure (in the range of our measurement) is found to have a stabilizing effect on the foam but it does not seem to directly affect the ability of the surfactant to unload liquid. The amount of foam formed in the small scale test strongly correlates with the gas velocity but is found to have a weak correlation with the surfactant concentration. Even though the hydrodynamics of the flow differ between the test scale and the flow loop scale, the small scale tests can still give important information which can help in evaluating surfactants. To be more specific, the carryover test is found to have similar trends as with data from intermediate scale tests (i. e. flow loop test) in context of ability of surfactant in unloading liquid. However the results from the flow loop scale suggest that the small scale sparger setup is not a good predictor in terms of pressure drop. We find that for an increasing velocity in the small scale setup, we operate within two flow regimes: bubble flow and slug flow. We recommend conducting the test in the slug flow regime which is closer to the actual hydrodynamics in the gas wells during liquid loading (churn flow). However, there are certain limitations to conducting the test in the slug flow: since the gas velocities are high the limit of carryover could affect the interpretation of results.

Colonic motility was measured in unanaesthetized rabbits using strain-gauge transducers and simultaneous radiography. Three types of contractions were found in the rabbit proximal colon: haustral activity, segmental activity, and mass peristalsis. Distinctly different motor patterns were observed during the formation of hard and soft faeces. When hard faeces were produced, the motor activity of the proximal colon was enhanced. It consisted of segmental and haustral activity. The segmental contractions separated the digesta into faecal pellets and forced them slowly aborad, whereas the movements of <b>the</b> haustra <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> contents back towards the caecum.
