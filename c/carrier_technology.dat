40|$|Although {{the impacts}} of {{greenhouse}} gas build-up remain uncertain, they {{have the potential to}} be very serious and possibly catastrophic. If the outcomes are serious then neither improving energy efficiency nor adaptation policies will cope with the problems of warming. Reducing climate impacts without impeding economic development will require new low or zero emissions energy <b>carriers</b> and associated <b>technologies.</b> This paper argues that current innovation policy initiatives aim at only limited dimensions of energy technology: they either promote incremental change in existing technologies, or improving performance in existing renewable alternatives. They will neither induce fundamental innovation in <b>carrier</b> <b>technologies,</b> nor change the basic technological regime of hydrocarbon production, distribution and use. For this, more radical „mission-oriented ‟ programmes are necessary.

30|$|A {{number of}} <b>carrier</b> <b>technologies</b> are {{suitable}} {{to carry the}} WBC dataset, for example, the digital audio broadcast (DAB), digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB), digital radio mondiale (DRM), digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H), multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS), satellite DMB (S-DMB), digital audio radio satellite, and so forth. Among these technologies the DVB-H is an attractive solution due to its full support for IP datacasting (IPDC). The IPDC over DVB-H [8, 9] is a new European Telecommunications Standards Institute's (ETSI) standard which enables effective distribution of digital content to mass audiences. As commercial DVB-H services have already been rolled out, the market prospect of DVB-H devices seems very bright [10].|$|R

50|$|Initially, {{stabilized}} {{satellite antennas}} were used on ships for reception of television signals. One {{of the first}} companies to manufacture stabilized VSAT antennas was SeaTel of Concord, California, which launched its first stabilized antenna in 1978. SeaTel dominates the supply of two-way VSAT stabilised antenna systems to the marine industry with almost 72% {{of the market in}} 2007 compared to Orbit’s 17.6%. Initially, maritime VSAT was using single channel per <b>carrier</b> <b>technology,</b> which suited large-volume users like oil drilling rigs and oil platforms and large fleets of ships from one shipowner sailing within one or few satellite footprints. This changed when the company iDirect launched its IP-based time-division multiple access technology that dynamically allocated bandwidth to each ship for shared bandwidth, lowering the entry-level cost for getting maritime VSAT installed, {{which turned out to be}} of key importance to small to mid-sized fleets, and thus to the market acceptance of VSAT.|$|E

5000|$|The motor of this incessant {{force of}} {{creative}} destruction is technological change. While the key <b>carrier</b> <b>technology</b> {{of the first}} Industrial Revolution (1770-1850) was based on water-powered mechanization, the second Kondratiev wave (1850-1900) was enabled by steam-powered technology, the third (1900-1940) was characterized by the electrification of social and productive organization, the fourth by motorization and the automated mobilization of society (1940-1970), {{and the most recent}} one by the digitization of social systems. Each one of those so-called long waves has been characterized by a sustained period of social modernization, most notably by sustained periods of increasing economic productivity. According to Carlota Perez: [...] "this quantum jump in productivity {{can be seen as a}} technological revolution, which is made possible by the appearance in the general cost structure of a particular input that we could call the 'key factor', fulfilling the following conditions: (1) clearly perceived low-and descending-relative cost; (2) unlimited supply for all practical purposes; (3) potential all-pervasiveness; (4) a capacity to reduce the costs of capital, labour and products as well as to change them qualitatively". Digital Information and Communication Technologies fulfill those requirements and therefore represent a general purpose technology that can transform an entire economy, leading to a modern, and more developed form of socio-economic and political organization often referred to as the post-industrial society, the fifth Kondratiev, Information society, digital age, and network society, among others.|$|E

50|$|Designed {{to improve}} {{manufacturing}} process control in a printing plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only temperature but also humidity. Carrier used {{his knowledge of}} the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, <b>Carrier's</b> <b>technology</b> was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to meet rising demand.
