40|$|In the Olympic Art Competitions (1912 – 1948) Pierre de Coubertin expresses his {{conception}} of both sport and art as instruments of moral renewal. In this paper, t{{his conception}} is criticised for failing to appreciate art and sport as necessary manifestations of modernism. The Art Competitions were informed by a traditionalist aesthetic, and thus played a highly conservative role within Olympism. A modernist art about sport, in contrast, {{would have been a}} source of critical reflection, potentially protecting the Olympic movement from corrupting exploitation by commercial and nationalistic interests. The conclusion defends the need for <b>Cultural</b> <b>Olympiads,</b> as a source of such critical reflection, that are at once modernist in conception and yet, unlike their current expression, are centrally about sport...|$|R

40|$|The Olympics are reputedly the {{greatest}} show {{on earth and}} offer not only entertainment and opportunities for embodied sporting achievement but also a significant site for serious sociological research. This book is a timely intervention in critical analyses {{of the role of}} the Olympic Games in contemporary social, cultural, economic and political life in 2012, when the Games are held in London. The London Games feature one of the most ambitious <b>Cultural</b> <b>Olympiads,</b> a phenomenon which is addressed in the book in the context of the interrelationships between art and sport, drawing upon original research in particular examples of art, sport and sponsorship. This book draws on feminist thinking and uses the concept of sex gender to explore some of the tensions that are played out in the Olympic Games and in the history of the Olympic Movement between its democratic principles and opportunities and its firmly entrenched inequalities. Sex Power and the Games argues that conceptualisations of sex gender and enfleshed selves offer ways of exploring and explaining some of the endurances of social and cultural inequalities that are generated as well as reflected in the Games along with the promise of transformation and opportunities for change which are important dimensions of how power operates in sport and in the Games in particular...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} cultural dimensions {{for both}} Summer and Winter Olymic Games. It recognises that while key Olympic rituals and {{the spectacle of}} the Opening and Closing Ceremonies are familiar from global media coverage, the other cultural components of the Games are much less well known. Indeed, even in the academic literature, the epithets ‘neglected’ or ‘forgotten’ are often used {{in relation to the}} cultural programme. After briefly discussing the nature of the classical heritage, this chapter explores why the founders of the modern Olympic movement gave prominence to the arts and how this was expressed in the Games between 1912 and 1948, with Olympic cities staging art competitions in music, literature, painting, sculpture and architecture. Thereafter, as subsequent sections show, the cultural dimension has had a chequered history. The abandonment of artistic competitions in favour of exhibitions took place after 1948, with subsequent reinterpretations of the nature and duration of the associated festivals. The Olympic Charter limits the sporting festival to 16 days, but the only stipulation about the cultural festival is that it must run while the Olympic Village is open (IOC, 2004 b, 80) – there are no specific limits about its maximum duration. This has permitted the Olympic Arts Festival to grow in scale, so that since 1992 the summer hosts have planned four-year <b>Cultural</b> <b>Olympiads,</b> with the <b>cultural</b> elements of the Olympics starting to mesh with the wider agendas that interest cities and governments. These agendas suggest a legacy for cultural tourism, identity building or culture-based urban regeneration strategies...|$|R
40|$|Originally, the Olympic Games were {{supposed}} to bring {{an opportunity for the}} enhancement of the arts in conjunction with the sports competitions. The Frenchman, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founded the Modern Olympics in 1896, inspired by the ancient Greek tradition of quadrennial celebrations of athletic and music contests held throughout Greece from 776 BC to 395 AD. Cou-bertin repeatedly expressed his vision of the Games as a marriage of sports and the arts, signifying an ideal combination of the strength of body, mind and spirit. The Olympic Charter acknowledges this aspiration in section 44, where it establishes that the host city must develop a cultural and arts program alongside the sporting events. But in spite of the persistent promotion by de Coubertin of the necessary integra-tion of the arts within all Olympic sport practices, and despite the constant re-invention and adaptation of the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Olympiads</b> (CO) structure and themes {{to the demands of the}} environment, they have remained in the shadow as a marginal aspect of the Games and are at present “one of the least known international arts festivals among both arts world professionals and the general public ” (Good 1998 : ii). This paper provides a general review of the difficulties in implementing and promote a cultural program whose mission is to be perceived as an integral part of the Olympic Games. Evidence of the many existing problems lying within the current planning and management of the CO is provided by looking at the relative success of the Barcelona 1992 case and comparing it to the 1997 - 2000 Olympic Arts Festivals (OAF) leading up to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004. This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the ongoing process of fashioning new possibilities for {{what it meant to be}} Kyrgyz during the 1920 s and 1930 s; it analyzes this dynamic development through the prism of clubs. This study examines the discourse in the language of official documents on Soviet club activities and celebrations, such as the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Olympiads,</b> in the expressed sentiments of several Kyrgyz intellectuals, such as actress Sabira Kumushaliyeva, and in the early fiction of author Chingiz Aitmatov. These artists and intellectuals, who greatly influenced Kyrgyz culture during the second half of the twentieth century, help us frame questions of gender, power and public performance. The narratives of these artists and intellectuals, who first experienced Soviet culture in Houses of Culture, underscore the story that this study draws out of the official government documents. The main method of this dissertation is the analysis of the Soviet discourse of cultural development, conveyed by Soviet institutions such as clubs and Soviet intellectuals in Kirghizia or Kyrgyzstan. It argues that Kyrgyz people who were involved in the cultural activities of the Houses of Culture, Stalinist festivals, Soviet theater, and literature helped make a new Kyrgyz community. Through public performances and artistic expressions, they negotiated Kyrgyzness within the limitations of Soviet citizenship. It suggests that club officials and national talents asserted Kyrgyz culture onto the official Soviet concept of "culturedness. " This study shows that in the 1920 s and 1930 s, club administrators, theater professionals and Olympiad organizers were encouraged to showcase the ethnic features of their nationalities in the clubs and Stalinist celebrations. These Kyrgyz elites accepted this responsibility and learned to play their ethnicity. They learned to speak the language of the cultural revolution with a Kyrgyz accent. Their national narrative portrayed Kyrgyzness wrapped in a Soviet cloak...|$|R

40|$|What main identities does Russia {{focus on}} {{in order to}} build a more {{positive}} national brand {{in the eyes of the}} international audience while getting ready to host 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi? This thesis focuses on this sporting event as a unique opportunity for Russia to boost its image internationally from a problematic to a more positive one (Ostapenko, 2010). An empirical study examines the representation of the country in press-releases and news materials published within the News section of the main website of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games from 2007 to 2014. The study builds its conclusions on the basis of 742 news items realized within seven years. The theoretical framework of the study is based on national branding theory and international events as its part. It aims to delineate some lineaments of the Russian national brand. The current study utilizes qualitative research (QR) methods, presenting regularities largely through their interpretation. Findings of the current work show that the approach to the Olympics has been deliberated in detail. The first glaring feature is that the main technique of building the Russian national brand is its culture, one of the things that is undoubtedly positively-received by people around the world, according to the National Brand Index (NBI, 2008 - 2012; Bertelsen, 2008). Conversely, it is worth noting that the part that usually causes critical or negative associations with Russia, politics, has been erased from the News section. If some high-ranking officials appeared in the limelight, most of them were linked with the national Olympic Committee. Even Vladimir Putin, the incumbent President of Russia, has appeared there 8 times in the headlines, while the previous Russian president and incumbent prime-minister Dmitri Medvedev has appeared only 9 times in the headlines. Problematic ecological and civil society-related topics, which are frequently the butt of criticism, have been covered painstakingly. The motives behind that, however, might be an intention to muffle criticism. Moreover, Russia has made an attempt in the Olympics to show people with different backgrounds (sport, cultural, show-business), with whom Russia may be associated. This goal was achieved through the ‘Olympic ambassador’-position and within the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Olympiad’s</b> events. The second hallmark of the Sochi 2014 Olympics was an inclination to demonstrate a ‘different’ Russia, varying from its stereotypical image (Dinnie, 2007). This arises even from the place hosting the Olympics, because the city of Sochi, bordering the Caucasian regions of the country, is less-known than its European part. In this respect, the news about the Olympics was mostly concentrated on the undiscovered (for foreigners) parts of the Russian Federation. Thus, some Olympic-related events, such as the torch relay, spanned the whole country, and numerous cultural events spotlighted the separate identities of the Russian indigenous groups. In addition, the Russian Olympic committee tried to highlight the positive changes taking place in Russia, ranging from the legislative amendments to the technological innovations using the Winter Olympics as a framework for these changes. The word 'innovation' was among the catchwords of the news about the Olympics preparations in Sochi. This could be explained by the fact that the positive news about Russia is usually ignored by the media in other countries (Dinnie, 2007). The link with the solid Olympic brand was supposed to evoke positive feelings in people’s minds and make the foreign audience aware of positive changes in Russia (Giffard and Rivenbuvgh, 2000, p. 15; Dinnie, 2007) ...|$|R
