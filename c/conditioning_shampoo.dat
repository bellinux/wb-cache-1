40|$|Dandruff is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} of the scalp requiring vigilant treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of scaling and itching. Frequent shampooing is key to controlling these symptoms while contributing to the cosmetic appearance of the hair. The success of the treatment depends {{not only on the}} ability of the shampoo to control the dandruff but also on patient compliance engendered by the cosmetic attributes of the shampoo. This double-blind cross-over study enrolled 40 women with mild to moderate dandruff. Following a 1 -wk washout with an unmedicated basic cleansing shampoo, all subjects used each of the two study shampoos for 1 wk. Subjects preferred the 1 % pyrithione zinc <b>conditioning</b> <b>shampoo</b> over the 2 % ketoconazole shampoo by 75 % in terms of overall performance. The dermatologist investigator confirmed the subject preference by noting that hair-combing ease, hair smoothness, and hair frizz/flyaway were statistically significantly better in subjects who used the 1 % pyrithione zinc <b>conditioning</b> <b>shampoo</b> for 1 wk. This study suggests that hair condition is an important consideration in the treatment of dandruff due to compliance...|$|E
40|$|Keratin is {{a natural}} protein {{extracted}} from the chicken feather. In the developed country, the usage of keratin in the personal care products is widely used. The personal care product produced from the keratin protein is <b>conditioning</b> <b>shampoo,</b> anti aging cream, facial cleanser and others. There are some differences between the personal care products already produced by the other developed country because the raw materials to extract the protein is sheep wool while in this research, the extraction of keratin protein is from chicken feathers. Keratin solution, polyvinyl alcohol. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone, glutaraldehyde and ammonium thioglycollate was mixed intimately. The combination of the solution was then cast and hardened through a freezing-thawing process for 1 hour and this process was repeated up to 7 times to obtain a hydrogel.

According to the FDA, all the products [...] "may be contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter gergoviae," [...] potentially dangerous bacteria. Gilchrist & Soames said that all recipients were notified of the recall of the dangerous products {{and they were able}} to recall up to 75 percent of the products distributed.|$|R
40|$|U sing {{silicones}} in personal-care {{products can}} improvethe aesthetic perfomance of formulations. For ex-ample, silicones (in particular, cyclomethicone and dimethicone) were {{essential to the}} development of dry antiperspirants, <b>conditioning</b> <b>shampoos,</b> and “oil-free ” skin-care products. The aesthetic benefits come from the unique chemical and physical properties that silicones possess and conventional, hydrocarbon-based materials do not. How-ever, these same unique chemical and physical properties can mean that special formulation techniques are needed to assure the compatibility and stability of silicones in personal-care formulations. Siloxane copolymer emulsifiers: One approach to for-mulating with silicones in personal-care products has been to use emulsifiers specifically designed for this purpose. In these cases, emulsifiers have been developed based o...|$|R
40|$|Silicones used in {{personal}} care applications are of diversified types, including cyclic, linear, or organo-functional polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), {{as well as}} silicone elastomer dispersions and resins. This wide range of molecules provides benefits that impact the performance of almost every type of beauty product, conferring attributes such as good spreading, film forming, wash-off resistance, skin feel, volatility and permeability. The first use of silicone {{in personal}} care applications {{dates back to the}} 1950 s, when a PDMS was incorporated into a commercial formulation to provide skin protection [1]. Since then, the use of silicones has kept increasing, along with the evolution of the knowledge around those materials (see Figure 1). Further to their first success, silicones made another breakthrough in the antiperspirant segment during the 1970 s. Low molecular weight cyclosiloxanes were used as volatile carriers for the antiperspirant active, enhancing consumer acceptance of products thanks to the pleasant skin feel they could confer as well as their nonstaining properties [2]. Silicones then made their entry into hair care products. Amino-functional polymers were incorporated into styling mousses and rinse-off conditioners, while fluid or emulsion forms of high molecular weight PDMS were formulated into two-in-one <b>conditioning</b> <b>shampoos.</b> More recently, silicone elastomer dispersions were introduced to the market and gave formulators access to a new sensory dimension in terms of silkiness. Today, silicones find a use in virtually all types of personal care products, in segments as diversified as hair care, hygiene, skin care, sun protection or color cosmetics...|$|R
40|$|Cationic {{polymers}} {{based upon}} poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are synthesised with {{various levels of}} charge densities, molecular architectures and hydrophobicities. Furthermore, macroinitiators incorporating PVA segments are synthesized and subsequently used for single electron transfer - living radical polymerisation (SET-LRP) for the synthesis {{of a range of}} graft copolymers. Chapter 1 is a general introduction on cationic polymers, their use within <b>conditioning</b> <b>shampoo</b> formulations and the chemical properties required for this application. The polymerisation techniques: ring-opening polymerisation and reversible deactivation radical polymerisation (RDRP); as well as the polymeric materials: PVA and polyglycerol are also discussed. Chapter 2 involves the synthesis of cationic PVA through either etherification or esterification reactions. The etherification of PVA using either glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTMAC) or 1, 2 -chlorohydroxypropyltrimethyammonium chloride (CHPTMAC) to synthesise poly[(vinyl alcohol) -ran-(vinyl, 2 -hydroxypropyl ether trimethylammonium chloride) ] (P[VA) -r-(VETMAC) ]) is investigated. The charge densities of the polymers synthesised by slowing the rate of reaction with GTMAC were determined to be greater than the charge densities claimed in the literature. The synthesis of poly(vinyl betaine) (PVB) via the synthesis of poly(vinyl chloroacetate) as an intermediate is discussed, as well as attempts to control the charge density of the resulting PVB. The charge density of the synthesised polymers were determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Chapter 3 discusses the synthesis of a novel hyperbranched graft copolymer, poly[(vinyl alcohol) -graft-(hyperbranched glycerol) ] (P[(VA) -g-(hPG) ]). The effects of the reaction conditions on the mole fraction of hyperbranched polyglycerol (x(hPG)), the degree of branching (...|$|E
50|$|Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium {{chloride}} is {{an organic}} compound {{that is a}} water-soluble quaternary ammonium derivative of guar gum. It gives <b>conditioning</b> properties to <b>shampoos</b> and after-shampoo hair care products. The effects of the cationic charge density, guar concentration in aqueous solution, and treatment time on bleached European hair have been studied. A mechanical testing method has been successfully applied to determine the efficacy of cationic guars to improve the ease of combing. The results were confirmed in a shampoo formulation on both virgin and bleached hair.|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} colour {{retaining}} efficacy of shampoo compositions, containing polymers and semi-permanent hair dyes, on hair tresses pre-coloured with permanent red oxidative dye. The conclusion {{was that the}} addition of polymeric <b>conditioning</b> actives to <b>shampoos</b> contributed to the colour retention of permanently dyed hair, whist the further addition of a cationic dye, at pH above the isoelectric point of hair, produced a weak direct-dyeing effect. Taking into account the short contact time between the semi-permanent dyes and the hair, it is proposed that this effect {{was due to the}} colourant deposition on the hair surface. Furthermore, the observed enhanced colour vibrancy and evenness, achieved with the combined polymer/dye treatments, points out to a favourable interaction between those molecules, allowing for more a consistent coverage of the hair surface...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{measures}} of {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) images have been utilized for studying the comparative effects of shampoo treatments on hair. This paper describes a method we have devised {{for the use of}} SEM and image analysis for quantitatively comparing the <b>conditioning</b> efficacies of <b>shampoos,</b> Completely natural shampoos were formulated in the lab and their conditioning efficacies were evaluated by comparing with a commercially marketed herbal shampoo and to a detergent, sodium lauryl sulphate, SLS. A measure of the extent of uplifting was quantified by using the root mean square deviation of line scans intensities expressed as a percentage of average intensity. The quantitative measure defined here and applied to the formulations showed that the damage caused to the hair due to SLS and the market shampoos were more than the natural shampoo formulated in the laboratory, thereby validating the claim that they were better than the market one. Comparison between various natural formulations are also facilitated by the quantification described and will be a valuable tool for future development of natural shampoos and other hair care products...|$|R
