25|$|The burners for {{the lights}} were changed from <b>colza</b> <b>oil</b> to {{paraffin}} oil in 1876. The original system was in use for 60 years, and in 1925, the optical apparatus was upgraded to a second order dioptric lens with an incandescent oil burner. This changed the light output to three flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. A diesel electric plant was installed in 1954, and electrical operation of the beam started in October of that year. The diesel generator was replaced in 1970. In September 1999, the light was replaced again, {{this time with a}} rotating beacon, with a 35-watt halogen bulb as the light source. The energy comes from solar panels and a battery bank.|$|E

There are 115 steps from the bottom to the lantern room. According to the Heritage Character Statement from the Government of Canada, the tower's design is very strong. The report discusses the [...] "magnificent twelve-sided polygonal lantern" [...] and the various ornate features. The gallery at the top is a round tapered and corbelled base that houses the 12-sided polygonal Fresnel lantern, which includes three rows of rectangular glass panes. The Fresnel lens was originally developed for lighthouses by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. All of the lenses for the Imperial Towers were [...] manufactured by the Louis Saulter Company of Paris. The powerful (second-order) lens was installed by specialist workmen from France. In 1859, Sperm oil was burned to illuminate the lamps but in 1860, a switch was made to <b>colza</b> <b>oil</b> since it was less expensive and more reliable in the coldest weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} {{illumination}} had generally been wood pyres or burning coal. The Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé Argand, revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of thorium dioxide suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light. The Argand lamp used whale <b>oil,</b> <b>colza,</b> olive <b>oil</b> or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, {{in partnership with}} Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.|$|R
50|$|The Argand lamp, {{invented in}} 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé Argand, {{revolutionized}} lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. The Argand lamp had a sleeve-shaped candle wick mounted so that air could pass both {{through the center}} of the wick and also around the outside of the wick before being drawn into cylindrical chimney. This steadied the flame and improved the flow of air. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of thorium dioxide suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light. The Argand lamp used whale <b>oil,</b> <b>colza,</b> olive <b>oil</b> or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner.

50|$|The lamp {{was invented}} by the French watchmaker Bernard Guillaume Carcel (1750-1818) to {{overcome}} the disadvantages of the Argand-type lamps then in use. The vegetable - mostly <b>colza</b> - <b>oils</b> then available were thick and would not travel far up a wick. The Argand lamps used a gravity feed which meant that the oil reservoir was located above the burner, casting a shadow and making the lamp top heavy. Carcel designed a lamp with the oil reservoir under the burner, {{in the body of}} the lamp. To keep the oil moving up to the burner, Carcel housed a clockwork mechanism in the lamp base that drove a small pump submerged in the oil tank. The winding key was located at the bottom of the lamp base.|$|R

60|$|He {{was found}} {{at the bottom of}} a {{detached}} shaft which had been sunk and abandoned at the commencement of the work for the new electric railway near Baker Street Station. His arm and leg and two ribs were broken. The shaft is protected by a hoarding nearly 20 feet high, and over this, incredible as it seems, Mr. Bessel, a stout, middle-aged gentleman, must have scrambled in order to fall down the shaft. He was saturated in <b>colza</b> <b>oil,</b> and the smashed tin lay beside him, but luckily the flame had been extinguished by his fall. And his madness had passed from him altogether. But he was, of course, terribly enfeebled, and at the sight of his rescuers he gave way to hysterical weeping.|$|E
60|$|But after {{a quarter}} to two he had vanished. Up to that hour {{witnesses}} were multitudinous. Dozens of people had seen him, fled from him or pursued him, and then things suddenly came to an end. At {{a quarter to}} two he had been seen running down the Euston Road towards Baker Street, flourishing a can of burning <b>colza</b> <b>oil</b> and jerking splashes of flame therefrom at {{the windows of the}} houses he passed. But none of the policemen on Euston Road beyond the Waxwork Exhibition, nor any of those in the side streets down which he must have passed had he left the Euston Road, had seen anything of him. Abruptly he disappeared. Nothing of his subsequent doings came to light in spite of the keenest inquiry.|$|E
40|$|The fat {{of mixture}} of goat and cow milk, {{extracted}} by di-ethylic ether, was gas chromatographically analysed {{in order to}} propose an analytical procedure suitable to reveal small additions of cow milk to goat milk. The obtained results show evident differences in the percentages of some fatty acids. An attempt to apply the peak area ratios, corresponding to the methyl esters of fatty acids, suggested by the literature for cow milk did not yield good results. Other ratios suitable to reveal even the presence of low percentages (up to 5 %) of cow milk in goat milk were found and proposed in this paper. Such ratios are sensitive and can be defined markers towards cow or goat milk and also towards extraneous fat like lard or <b>colza</b> seeds <b>oil...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, as to this stone box, {{which we}} call the Magic Coffer. As I have said, I am {{convinced}} that it opens only in obedience to some principle of light, or the exercise {{of some of its}} forces at present unknown to us. There is here much ground for conjecture and for experiment; for as yet the scientists have not thoroughly differentiated the kinds, and powers, and degrees of light. Without analysing various rays we may, I think, take it for granted that there are different qualities and powers of light; and this great field of scientific investigation is almost virgin soil. We know as yet so little of natural forces, that imagination need set no bounds to its flights in considering the possibilities of the future. Within but a few years we have made such discoveries as two centuries ago would have sent the discoverer's to the flames. The liquefaction of oxygen; the existence of radium, of helium, of polonium, of argon; the different powers of Roentgen and Cathode and Bequerel rays. And as we may finally prove that there are different kinds and qualities of light, so we may find that combustion may have its own powers of differentiation; that there are qualities in some flames non-existent in others. It may be that some of the essential conditions of substance are continuous, even in the destruction of their bases. Last night I was thinking of this, and reasoning that as there are certain qualities in some oils which are not in others, so there may be certain similar or corresponding qualities or powers in the combinations of each. I suppose we have all noticed some time or other that the light of <b>colza</b> <b>oil</b> is not quite {{the same as that of}} paraffin, or that the flames of coal gas and whale oil are different. They find it so in the light-houses! All at once it occurred to me that there might be some special virtue in the oil which had been found in the jars when Queen Tera's tomb was opened. These had not been used to preserve the intestines as usual, so they must have been placed there for some other purpose. I remembered that in Van Huyn's narrative he had commented on the way the jars were sealed. This was lightly, though effectually; they could be opened without force. The jars were themselves preserved in a sarcophagus which, though of immense strength and hermetically sealed, could be opened easily. Accordingly, I went at once to examine the jars. A little--a very little of the oil still remained, but it had grown thick in the two and a half centuries in which the jars had been open. Still, it was not rancid; and on examining it I found it was cedar oil, and that it still exhaled something of its original aroma. This gave me the idea that it was to be used to fill the lamps. Whoever had placed the oil in the jars, and the jars in the sarcophagus, knew that there might be shrinkage in process of time, even in vases of alabaster, and fully allowed for it; for each of the jars would have filled the lamps half a dozen times. With part of the oil remaining I made some experiments, therefore, which may give useful results. You know, Doctor, that cedar oil, which was much used in the preparation and ceremonials of the Egyptian dead, has a certain refractive power which we do not find in other oils. For instance, we use it on the lenses of our microscopes to give additional clearness of vision. Last night I put some in one of the lamps, and placed it near a translucent part of the Magic Coffer. The effect was very great; the glow of light within was fuller and more intense than I could have imagined, where an electric light similarly placed had little, if any, effect. I should have tried others of the seven lamps, but that my supply of oil ran out. This, however, is on the road to rectification. I have sent for more cedar oil, and expect to have before long an ample supply. Whatever may happen from other causes, our experiment shall not, at all events, fail from this. We shall see! We shall see!" ...|$|E

50|$|The Carcel is {{a former}} French unit for {{measuring}} the intensity of light.

50|$|Utklippan is a Swedish {{lighthouse}} and {{the name}} of two small islands, Södraskär (South skerry) and Norraskär (North skerry). It has been a light station since 1789 when a basket light was in use. The current tower (built in 1870) replaced an older tower built in 1840 on top of an old fortress. The flame ran on <b>colza</b> <b>oil.</b> In 1887 the <b>colza</b> <b>oil</b> lamp was replaced with a kerosene lamp. It has been powered electrically since 1948.|$|E
50|$|Örskär {{was one of}} {{the first}} lightstations to be built in Sweden. The first {{lighthouse}} was constructed of wood in 1684, but was burned down in 1738 when it was hit by the lightning. The present tower was constructed by the royal architect Carl Hårleman. The flame in the lantern ran on <b>colza</b> <b>oil</b> lamps, and mirrors collected the light. Kerosene lamps replaced the <b>colza</b> <b>oil</b> lamps in the 1870s. It was finally electrified in 1954.

Spinosad, based on chemical compounds found in a bacterium, is also efficient.|$|E
50|$|By 1800, an even cheaper {{alternative}} was discovered. <b>Colza</b> <b>oil,</b> derived from Brassica campestris, {{and a similar}} oil derived from rapeseed, yielded candles that produce clear, smokeless flames. The French chemists Michel Eugène Chevreul (1786-1889) and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) patented stearin in 1825. Like tallow, this was derived from animals, but had no glycerine content.|$|E
