40|$|Use of fecal Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (F. NIRS) for {{measuring}} dietary attributes such as crude protein concentration and DM (dry matter) digestibility differs from most NIRS applications in several respects. Importantly, in developing calibration equations, <b>constituent</b> <b>reference</b> values and spectra are measured on different substrates: constituent values {{are determined by}} analyzing diet samples using appropriate laboratory techniques while the NIR spectra are obtained by scanning fecal samples from animals consuming the same diets. Thus the term “diet-fecal pairs” {{is often used to}} describe these samples for developing calibration equations, which are defined as derivative calibrations in Chapter 1. Obviously an important characteristic of diet-fecal pairs is that the sample analyzed for diet reference values must be truly representative of the diet consumed and the sampled feces also must be properly matched with that same diet. A second unusual aspect of F. NIRS technology is that the dietary material of interest is modified by digestion in the gastrointestinal tract before the spectra are measured. Therefore, there is an implicit assumption that there are stable and close correlations between the spectral absorbances of feces at certain wavelengths and the dietary attributes of interest. It appears that deviations from such correlations between diet and fecal components introduce errors with some types of diets. In this paper we discuss the development of F. NIRS technology for cattle production in the extensive grazing systems of northern Australia. We focus on the techniques and methods used for obtaining diet-fecal pairs that meet the requirements of robust calibration equations...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{has previously}} been demonstrated as a technique for removal of contaminants from engine-run thermal barrier coatings (TBC). A method for monitoring the concentrations {{of some of the}} known constituents of the contaminants is developed for paralleled quantification during laser cleaning. The major constituents of these contaminants, CaO, MgO, Al 2 O 3, and SiO 2, also termed CMAS, are prepared in pressed powder samples for which Laser-induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is applied. During LIBS, unique spectra characterizing the contents of the ablated material are obtained. LIBS is applied to the individual CMAS constituent pressed powder samples to obtain reference spectra which are used to construct a set of orthonormal modes via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Although these orthogonal modes are mathematically uncorrelated, they may not necessarily be entirely representative of the correspondent <b>constituent</b> <b>references</b> that may cause inaccurate quantifications. Thus, these modes are renormalized by taking advantage of orthogonality between the modes and using that property as a constraint; by doing so, the modes can be reshaped while retaining orthogonality. The resulting orthogonal modes were calibrated using known mixtures, and then applied to engine-run blades for measurements. The missing constituents were quantified by a calculation of residual data. Photoluminescence Piezospectrocopy (PLPS), a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique that has been previously used to assess remaining lifetime of TBCs, can suffer from fluorescence interference due to dopants in the coating composition. Unlike that of CMAS obstruction, which can be cleaned via LIBS, the source of interference within the coating could not be physically removed. A different approach was taken to enable evaluation of TBC health; the collected fluorescence was time gated (or time resolved) prior to being spectrally resolved for meaningful measurements. Results showed that variations in the stress across the blade could be resolved...|$|R

Despite vigorous extraction for 20 consecutive days, some P sorbed as part of the treatments of soils 1 and 2 was not desorbed. The increased vulnerability due to effluent constituents lasted a maximum of about one cropping season and, for all other treatments, adsorption curves overestimated vulnerability to desorption. Therefore, adsorption curves provide a conservative estimate of vulnerability to desorption where effluent is used in continued crop production in these soils...|$|R

Long-term levonorgestrel treatment causes a marked cytoplasmic atrophy, as shown by decreased protein content and lactate dehydrogenase activity, whereas DNA content remains unchanged. In contrast, N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase, one of the most active lysosomal enzymes studied, shows a higher specific activity upon levonorgestrel. In both untreated and treated endometria, the organ cultures provide biochemical evidence for a higher release of N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase than of lactate dehydrogenase, indicating active secretion of the lysosomal enzyme.

40|$|PhD {{dissertation}} acknowledgments (DAs) are communicative {{acts that}} repeatedly instantiate the speech act of thanking. Their strategic building block is the acknowledgment move (AM), which typically expresses gratitude, identifies benefactors and mentions benefits [e. g. “Also, I {{would like to}} thank my fellow doctoral students [ [...] . ] for making my stay [ [...] . ] a very enjoyable experience. ”] and may include supportive moves which expand on the basic content of their main functional constituents. In this study I outline lexico-syntactic and semantic features of the 405 AMs found in 40 DAs written in English, representative of 8 disciplines, dating back to the 1990 ’s. By applying the principles and methodology of Pattern Grammar (Hunston, Francis 2000) — which aims to reveal the surface relationships between neighboring (groups of) words, and the mappings between lexical items, patterns and meaning units (i. e. such as participants, processes, circumstances) — I identify and represent both the structural patterns associated with the lexemes encoding the notion of gratitude in AMs and the associations between such patterns and the main functional units of AMs (i. e. manifestation of gratitude, identification of benefits and specification of benefits). 	The data reveals the following selective co-distribution patterns. 1) The text segments making up the AMs may be phrases, clauses or sentences, which can be combined in various ways; yet, the number of functional units encoded in AMs does not depend on the latter’s syntactic elaboration. 2) AMs not realized as clauses tend to lack gratitude expressions. 3) In AMs realized as clauses, experiences of gratitude tend to be represented as processes (through VPs), while benefactors and benefits as entities involved in or circumstances characterizing those processes (through NPs and PPs, respectively). 4) In clausal AMs with no gratitude expressions, the benefactor units and benefit units are realized through complementary resources: if the former are encoded as NPs, the latter may be encoded as VPs or PPs; if the former are encoded as PPs, the latter may be encoded as NPs, PPs or relative clauses; and if the former are encoded as incomplete clauses, the latter are typically encoded as PPs. 5) Expressions of thanks (occurring in about 60 % of the AMs) may focus on one of several aspects of gratitude: indicating benefactors’ merits (e. g. acknowledge, recognize), favorably evaluating their contributions (e. g. appreciate), indicating that the writer received more than he gave (e. g. debt, owe), manifesting pleased acceptance of the services offered (e. g. grateful, gratitude; I liked, I will always remember, I have benefited, It has been a pleasure and honor), expressing a favorable feeling towards the benefactors (e. g. thank, thanks, thank you); these notions can also be combined (e. g. gratefully acknowledge). 6) AMs containing gratitude expressions tend to be syntactically organized in the way required by the argument structure of the main lexical resources for expressing gratitude; if these are adjectives, they tend to be used after linking verbs and followed by PPs; if they are verbs, optionally modified by adverbs, they are preceded by NPs functioning as subjects and frequently followed by NPs and PPs functioning as direct and indirect objects, respectively; and if they are nouns, optionally modified by adjectives, they can occur in absolute constructions or in pre- or post-verbal position. 7) When their main lexical resources are non-linking verbs, gratitude expressions tend to be realized in the active voice, with the thankers thus represented as the main actors involved in the events being referred to. 8) Benefit units (expressed in about 85 % of the AMs) realized as VPs or (incomplete) clauses are typically encoded in the active voice and from the benefactor’s perspective, the segments identifying the benefactors (occurring in about 80 % of the AMs) tending to precede the relevant verbs. 9) In AMs containing all three main functional components, gratitude expressions tend to occur before benefactor units, which in turn precede benefit units; in those lacking a gratitude expression, benefactor units tend to precede benefit units. Thus, where applicable, the thanker is made more prominent in the discourse than the benefactor, and the latter tends to be more cognitively salient than the benefit. Finally, independently of their degree of syntactic elaborateness, AMs may be textually organized in complex ways: functional constituents may be encoded in discontinuous text segments that surround other constituents; in addition, in multi-sentence AMs, they may be instantiated more than once and even interleaved with other constituents. 	The findings show that AMs are encoded in distinctive and personalized ways {{through the use of a}} variety of lexico-syntactic resources. At the same time, their encoding patterns reveal certain shared preferences, especially with regard to the ordering options of the AMs’ functional <b>constituents.</b> <b>Reference</b> Hunston, S.

30|$|According to Smith and Nichols (2011), {{the ongoing}} mineral {{extraction}} procedures (conducted by Consolidated Rutile Ltd., now Sibelco Australia Ltd.) have generally consisted of clearing all vegetation {{ahead of the}} mine path and stripping the topsoil layers (0 – 20  cm) to enable mining of the underlying mineral sands. An artificial dredging pond was then created within the bare sand dunes to enable mining of ‘wet’ sands and extraction of mineral ore concentrates (~ 1 % of the total volume of sand). The rehabilitation process consisted of pumping the ‘cleaned’ residual sands behind the dredging pond to reconstruct the dunes according to pre-disturbance topographic patterns (up to 150  m in height) and spreading the recovered topsoil over the landform. Topsoils were typically stockpiled up to 2  years and used {{as soon as possible}} in the rehabilitation process to preserve their native seed and soil-microbial components. The reconstructed landforms were simultaneously sprayed with a biodegradable emulsion to stabilise the surface matrix and seeded with a mixture of ~ 30 native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species (~ 25, 000 seeds per hectare). Seeds were collected exclusively on the Island and selected to represent the essential species <b>constituents</b> from the <b>reference</b> communitiesb (EMRC Environmental Management Research Consultants 2006). Rehabilitated sites were fertilised at the initial emergence of seedlings and again 6 – 10  months thereafter using an NPK ratio deemed appropriate for the intended native species.

Although subtle steps were enacted to encourage faunal recolonisation (e.g., nesting boxes, log piles), no further early-establishment procedures were implemented other than the attempted suppression of fire over the first 10 – 15 years post-rehabilitation and later the selective thinning of undesirable species.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} theoretically based corresponding states procedure which predicts mixture properties accurately. This procedure separates any dimensionless residual thermodynamic property into two parts: One part is a contribution from molecular repulsion {{and the other}} is a contribution from molecular attraction. This repulsion can be represented by either a mixture of hard spheres or hard convex bodies. The two forms are compared in this work. The attraction contributions contain the symmetrical part from non-polar interactions and another asymmetrical part which comes from permanent dipole moments, quadrapole moments, or other polar effects. Each of these two attraction contributions in a mixture is determined from a pure reference fluid by way of some suitably defined pseudoparameters. The composition dependence of the pseudoparameters is derived from either the hard sphere expansion of the hard convex body expansion method. Temperature and density dependent shape factors are used to multiply the individual critical properties in the pseudocriticals to establish conformality between individual <b>constituents</b> and the <b>reference.</b> A new analytical method of defining optimal values for the hard core dimensions is developed for each pure component from its equation of state. This new conformal solution theory gives good agreement with experiment and always gives better results, especially for K-value calculations, than the results determined from the ordinary equation of state with the usual empirical mixing rules. This work has confirmed that this new theory gives a better description of composition dependence than the empirical combinational rules. The hard convex body expansion method does not give significant improvement over the hard sphere expansion results for a methane-propane mixture at the conditions investigated in this work. A reliable equation of state which describes the behavior of the pure component accurately is essential to the computation.... (Author's abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.

40|$|The HSE (Hard Sphere Expansion) theory calculates the {{thermodynamic}} properties of a mixture by separating its properties into contributions from molecular repulsion, which are calculated {{directly from a}} hard sphere mixture equation of state, and other contributions from various types of intermolecular attraction, which are obtained by corresponding states from known values of similar contributions in a pure reference fluid. Shape factors are used to establish conformality between individual <b>constituents</b> and the <b>reference</b> fluid. This theoretically based approach represents composition dependence better than the empirical mixing rules used in the traditional mixture equations of state. By applying {{the first and second}} order variational principles, a procedure is developed to determine the optimal repulsion contribution and rigid core dimensions. The procedure requires an equation of state capable of predicting accurate second derivatives for the reference fluid. A 32 constant modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin (MBWR) equation with exceptional accuracy is used for this purpose. Engineering equations of state are permissible for constituents other than the reference. The new development allows an accurate analytical approach to be applicable to the differentiation of the mixture Helmholtz free energy property with respect to component moles involved in the phase equilibrium calculations. The importance of the reference fluid selected for phase equilibrium calculations is discussed. The reference fluids used are the three hydrocarbons: methane, ethane, and propane. For mixtures containing polar fluids, such as carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide, the total attraction contribution may be evaluated entirely from the attraction in a pure nonpolar reference fluid by means of shape factors. An alternate method is to evaluate separate symmetrical and asymmetrical attraction terms, in which the multipole expansion is used to account for the polar contributions. Both approaches are discussed and compared. The HSE theory are applied to gaseous and liquid phases of binary hydrocarbon mixtures containing high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide or carbon dioxide. Calculations of densities and the vapor-liquid composition ratios (K-values) are presented. Good agreement with experimental data is achieved over a wide range of pressure and temperature.

40|$|Joint {{experimental}} work {{carried out in}} 2006 by the CORESTA Special Analytes Task Force compared yield data {{on a wide range}} of smoke <b>constituents</b> obtained from <b>reference</b> cigarettes according to the existing methods used by participants. This work identified that the methodologies that were used to determine yields of selected volatiles in mainstream smoke under the ISO smoking regime would benefit from further joint experiments. This report describes the output from the 2008 Joint Experiment on selected volatiles in smoke (1, 3 -butadiene, benzene, toluene, acrylonitrile, and isoprene). Its objectives were to investigate the main weaknesses and influencing factors in methodologies used by the participating laboratories and their effects on yield variability before deciding on one to take forward to a CORESTA recommended method. The Task Force considered this step was necessary before progressing to a full collaborative study using a recommended method. An experimental protocol was devised to investigate several factors such as the use of different calibration standards and the efficiencies of different trapping systems. The effects of other general factors identified from supplied methodology information as differing across laboratories were also analysed. A statistical assessment was made of their possible influence on smoke yields and yield reproducibility across different laboratories and is discussed in this report. Between-laboratory variability has been reduced since the last study indicating that some laboratories have improved their methodology although extremely high values for the among-laboratory variability were still found for acrylonitrile (> 100 %) and 1, 3 -butadiene (~ 80 %) when related to the mean yields. The means to reduce the variability in acrylonitrile and 1, 3 -butadiene yields are not apparent from the data and interpretations made in this study. However, when the different laboratories use the same methodology during the development of a recommended method at the next development stage then it is hoped that this high level of variability for acrylonitrile and 1, 3 -butadiene will be reduced to similar levels to those found for benzene, toluene, and isoprene. As in previous work, it was recognised that although a more intense smoking regime may be introduced into the regulatory arena in the future, it was decided that the current ISO smoking regime should be used for this joint experiment. A wider range of product styles will be investigated when the Task Force works towards a recommended method to take account of differing blends and designs and the potentially greater product variability of commercial products. This will provide robust estimates of within-laboratory repeatability and among-laboratory reproducibility and is intended to be reported in a later paper...|$|R

A unique feature is the double anticipatory reference where two referents of the following clause are specified. The factors relevant to reference monitoring are semantic rather than surface subject. Verbalized constructions have thematic functions. Discourse thematized structures have verbal affixes that agree in tense-mood with the verb of the dominating clause and optionally agree with the subject and object. The eleven verb classes are related to semantic categories. A significant problem is that of defining a grammatical sentence for narratives. The data do not support the establishment of sentences in narratives by grammatical criteria alone. The most relevant factors for describing narrative discourse are interclause relations and intonation rather than grammatical structure. ^ The semantic system is described in terms of features and the propositional framework of Grimes. Reference has both inherent and situational features. Cases have differing inherent prominence according to their mapping relations to clause constituents. Lexical predicates are analyzed in terms of their semantic features, aspect, and case frames. Rhetorical predicates organize discourse and consist of logical, equative, orientation, and response relations. Nontext semantics specifies cultural knowledge needed to understand text content. ^ Cohesive features are phonological, grammatical, and lexical. Intonation divides a text into information units and indicate cohesion between them. Grammatical cohesion includes cross reference and tense-mood agreement, cataphoric reference monitoring, anaphoric affix chains, pronominalization, repetition, and structural parallelism. Lexical cohesive features are items related in a semantic domain, collocation of objects and events or event sequences, and cycles that involve the repetition of sections of text. ^ The staging, or prominence, system indicates the salience of elements in the text. The last element of an intonation contour has prominence and marked prominence occurs when {{there is more than one}} contour per clause. Grammatically, structural complexity provides prominence. Open classes and optional elements are more prominent their counterparts. A specificity-complexity continuum varies from 0 affixation to topicalization. Thematization indicates what is being talked about in the clause (local theme) or supraclause (global theme). Unmarked local theme is signalled by the cross reference system. Marked local theme is indicated by complex structures for clause <b>constituents.</b> The cataphoric <b>reference</b> system indicates unmarked global theme whereas marked global theme is signalled by anaphora using structural elements more complex that verb affixes for reference. Oral discourse has fewer prominence features that written, narratives fewer features than nonnarratives, and culturally familiar content fewer features than culturally new content. ...|$|R
