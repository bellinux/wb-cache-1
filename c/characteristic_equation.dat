25|$|In the 18th century Euler {{studied the}} {{rotational}} motion of a rigid body and discovered {{the importance of}} the principal axes. Lagrange realized that the principal axes are the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix. In the early 19th century, Cauchy saw how their work could be used to classify the quadric surfaces, and generalized it to arbitrary dimensions.

25|$|We {{conclude}} that the function ψ {{is the value of}} the minimizing integral A {{as a function of the}} upper end point. That is, when a family of minimizing curves is constructed, the values of the optical length satisfy the <b>characteristic</b> <b>equation</b> corresponding the wave equation. Hence, solving the associated partial differential equation of first order is equivalent to finding families of solutions of the variational problem. This is the essential content of the Hamilton–Jacobi theory, which applies to more general variational problems.|$|E
25|$|Bivectors {{are also}} related to the {{rotation}} matrix in n dimensions. As in three dimensions the <b>characteristic</b> <b>equation</b> of the matrix can be solved to find the eigenvalues. In odd dimensions this has one real root, with eigenvector the fixed axis, and in even dimensions it has no real roots, so either all or {{all but one of}} the roots are complex conjugate pairs. Each pair is associated with a simple component of the bivector associated with the rotation. In particular the log of each pair is ± the magnitude, while eigenvectors generated from the roots are parallel to and so can be used to generate the bivector. In general the eigenvalues and bivectors are unique, and the set of eigenvalues gives the full decomposition into simple bivectors; if roots are repeated then the decomposition of the bivector into simple bivectors is not unique.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a method}} of analyzing complex one-dimensional multilayer waveguides in a numerically stable way. When a multilayer waveguide contains a quite thick layer or a layer whose refractive index has a very large real or imaginary part, conventional analysis methods tend to fail to find out its modes. In order to solve such a problem, the discussed analysis method is based on modified transfer matrix equations. The method consists of three steps. At the first step, two types of modified transfer matrix equations are used to derive two types of <b>characteristic</b> <b>equations.</b> At the next step, the iteration method comprised of initial root-finding and root-tracking is used to find {{the roots of the}} <b>characteristic</b> <b>equations.</b> Since the two <b>characteristic</b> <b>equations</b> have different features, the initial root-finding is carried out with one of them, and the root-tracking with the other. Finally, the field profiles of waveguide modes are calculated by using the found roots and employing a stable routine based on the modified transfer matrix equations. A few presented examples show that the discussed method works well. In addition to the method, it is shown that one of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>equations</b> can be expressed as an explicit form rather than a conventional recursive matrix relation because of the simple form of one of the transfer matrix equations. close 1...|$|R
