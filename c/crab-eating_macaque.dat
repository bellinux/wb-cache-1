5|$|Many {{carnivorous}} marine gastropods {{are known}} predators of L.canarium, including the volutes Cymbiola nobilis and Melo melo and the cone snail (Conus textile). The dog conch is also preyed upon by vertebrates. These include the <b>crab-eating</b> <b>macaque,</b> Macaca fascicularis, an opportunistic predator that scours intertidal environments. Humans {{are one of}} the dog conch's main predators, subjecting the species to intensive fishing and exploitation.|$|E
25|$|The American Society of Primatologists {{writes that}} most NHPs in {{laboratories}} in the United States are bred domestically. Between 12,000–15,000 are imported each year, specifically rhesus macaque monkeys, cynomolgus (<b>crab-eating)</b> <b>macaque</b> monkeys, squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys, and baboons. Monkeys are imported from China, Mauritius, Israel, the Philippines, and Peru.|$|E
25|$|The Nicobar long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis umbrosa, {{popularly known}} as the Nicobar monkey) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>crab-eating</b> <b>macaque</b> (M. fascicularis), endemic to the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. This primate is found on three of the Nicobar Islands—Great Nicobar, Little Nicobar and Katchal—in biome regions consisting of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>crab-eating</b> <b>macaques</b> {{and other}} nonhuman {{primates}} in experimentation is controversial with critics {{charging that the}} experiments are cruel, unnecessary and lead to dubious findings.

25|$|Other mammal species {{found within}} the {{protected}} area are classified as Least Concern by the IUCN include the <b>Crab-eating</b> <b>Macaque</b> (Macaca fascicularis); Malayan Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus malayanus); Common Palm Civit (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus); Jarvan Mongoose (Herpestes javanicus); Plantain Squirrel (Callosciurus notatus); Greater Bandicoot Rat (Bandicota indica); and the Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). There are also over 4000 Water Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) farmed by approximately 280 families in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. It is unknown what impact the numbers of buffalo have on the ecosystem, however many avian species use their grazing areas for feeding and breeding sites including heron, egrets, stilts and wader species.|$|E
25|$|In late 1989, Hazelton Research Products' Reston Quarantine Unit in Reston, Virginia, {{suffered}} {{an outbreak of}} fatal illness amongst certain lab monkeys. This lab outbreak was initially diagnosed as simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) and occurred amongst a shipment of <b>crab-eating</b> <b>macaque</b> monkeys imported from the Philippines. Hazelton's veterinary pathologist sent tissue samples from dead animals to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Maryland, where an ELISA test indicated the antibodies present in the tissue were a response to Ebola virus and not SHFV. An electron microscopist from USAMRIID discovered filoviruses similar in appearance to Ebola in the tissue samples sent from Hazelton Research Products' Reston Quarantine Unit.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{species of}} large mammal {{occur in the}} delta, but their populations are small and scattered, with the {{possible}} exceptions of the Malayan sambar deer (Cervus unicolor equinus), Indian hog deer (C. porcinus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa), which have been reported from all Reserved Forests. Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) were once widespread throughout the country with numbers as high as 10,000 animals, but in the [...] numbers have dwindled, partly due to transferring the animals to logging camps. Other species reported to be present include the leopard, Bengal tiger, <b>crab-eating</b> <b>macaque,</b> wild dog, and otters (Panthera pardus, P. tigris, Cuon alpinus, and Lutra species).|$|E

50|$|<b>Crab-eating</b> <b>macaques</b> {{extensively}} {{overlap with}} humans across their range in Southeast Asia. Consequently, they {{live together in}} many locations. Some of these areas are associated with religious sites and local customs, such as the temples of Bali in Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia, while other areas are characterized by conflict {{as a result of}} habitat loss and competition over food and space. Humans and <b>crab-eating</b> <b>macaques</b> have shared environments since prehistoric times, and both tend to frequent forest and river edge habitats. <b>Crab-eating</b> <b>macaques</b> are occasionally used as a food source for some indigenous forest-dwelling peoples. In Mauritius, they are captured and sold to the pharmaceutical industry, and in Angaur and Palau, they are sold as pets. Macaques feed on sugarcane and other crops, affecting agriculture and livelihoods, and can be aggressive towards humans. Macaques may carry potentially fatal human diseases, including herpes B virus.|$|R
