5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{takes place}} on several worlds {{centered}} around a large tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: the World of Continent at the base, the World of Ocean on the 5th floor, the World of Sky on the 10th, and the World of Ruins on the 16th. Time does not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically advanced than others. Various monsters <b>come</b> <b>forth</b> from the tower into each world; many are hostile, {{but some of them}} are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot of the human race (named mutants) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans and the World of Continent's older races.|$|E

25|$|In this world, when Israel ate the paschal lamb in Egypt, {{they did}} so in haste, as it is said: And thus shall ye eat it, etc. (Ex. XII, 11), For in haste didst thou <b>come</b> <b>forth</b> out {{of the land of}} Egypt (Deut. XVI, 3), but in the Messianic era, we are told: For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight (Isa. LII, 12).|$|E
25|$|Urbs antiqua fuit—there was {{an ancient}} city which, 'tis said, Juno loved {{above all the}} lands.

2500|$|Rabbi Judah {{taught that}} the same fire that descended from heaven settled on the earth, and did not again return to its former place in heaven, but it entered the Tabernacle. That fire <b>came</b> <b>forth</b> and devoured all the offerings that the Israelites brought in the wilderness, as [...] does not say, [...] "And there descended fire from heaven," [...] but [...] "And there <b>came</b> <b>forth</b> fire from before the Lord." [...] This was the same fire that <b>came</b> <b>forth</b> and {{consumed}} the sons of Aaron, as [...] says, [...] "And there <b>came</b> <b>forth</b> fire from before the Lord." [...] And that same fire <b>came</b> <b>forth</b> and consumed the company of Korah, as [...] says, [...] "And fire <b>came</b> <b>forth</b> from the Lord."

25|$|In {{the early}} stage, glorification of the {{religious}} beliefs and lives was the theme {{of most of the}} novels. Later on, picturization of real Bengali life became a common topic. By the end of the fifties, the novelists gradually turned to human mind and its analysis. A great change of the theme came after 1971. Novels about the Liberation War of Bangladesh began to <b>come</b> <b>forth.</b> Even till now it has not ceased to be an interesting topic.|$|E
25|$|After {{stripping}} {{themselves of}} all potential wealth, the Crusaders remained 34,000 silver marks {{short of the}} 84,000 demanded by the Venetians. Realizing that no more money would <b>come</b> <b>forth,</b> Doge Dandolo gave the Crusaders a chance to pay off their debt by doing some fighting for Venice. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the Christian port of Zara in Dalmatia. This former vassal city of Venice had rebelled and placed itself {{under the protection of}} the Kingdom of Hungary in 1186.|$|E
25|$|But the Wilson Boulevard {{extension}} {{ran into}} trouble with rights-of-way. On November 25, the county learned it had failed to obtain title to a small strip of land needed for the bridge approach. This meant that the Wilson Boulevard approach could not be submitted {{to the state of}} Virginia to obtain funding from the Civil Works Administration. Without federal funding, the project appeared dead. The federal government pledged in December 1933 that WPA money would be available in the future to hire laborers to begin the extension of the roadway. But by June 1934, no funds had <b>come</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} {{leadership of the}} British Army during the World War I was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended. Common charges were that the generals commanding the army were blind {{to the realities of}} trench warfare, ignorant of the conditions of their men and were unable to learn from their mistakes, thus causing enormous numbers of casualties ('lions led by donkeys'). However, during the 1960s historians such as John Terraine began to challenge this interpretation. In recent years as new documents have <b>come</b> <b>forth</b> and the passage of time has allowed for more objective analysis, historians such as Gary D. Sheffield and Richard Holmes observe that the {{military leadership}} of the British Army on the Western Front had to cope with many problems that they could not control such as a lack of adequate military communications, which was not known before. Furthermore, military leadership improved throughout the war culminating in the Hundred Days Offensive advance to victory in 1918. Some historians, even revisionists, still criticise the British High Command severely, but they are less inclined to portray the war in a simplistic manner with brave troops being led by foolish officers.|$|E

Heimdall raises the Gjallarhorn {{into the air and}} blows deeply into it, and Odin converses with Mím's head. The world tree Yggdrasil shudders and groans. The jötunn Hrym comes from the east, his shield before him. The Midgard serpent Jörmungandr furiously writhes, causing waves to crash. [...] "The eagle shrieks, pale-beaked he tears the corpse," [...] and the ship Naglfar breaks free thanks to the waves made by Jormungandr and sets sail from the east.

500|$|When Luan Da returned, he {{told the}} emperor of his falsified meeting with the immortals; however, he sensed that the emperor did not believe him. Before long, the emperor broke out in a rage, {{ordering}} Luan Da to tell what he had actually done. Dumbfounded, Luan Da attempted to continue his lies; however, the emperor called for the spy to <b>come</b> <b>forth</b> and expose the lies. [...] Lost for words, Luan Da was arrested on Emperor Wu's order, and executed by having his body chopped into two at the waist. [...] The emperor extended his fury to the Marquess of Lecheng for introducing Luan Da, having him beheaded and his body then defiled.|$|E

The central section is an extended choral fugue, framed by two sections with the voices embedded in {{a repeat of the}} instrumental introduction. John Eliot Gardiner remarked in connection with his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage that the instrumentation resembles Near Eastern music, the recorders representing [...] "the high pitches often associated with oriental music and the oboes da caccia (in tenor register) to evoke the shawm-like double-reed instruments (salamiya and zurna) of the Near East".|$|E

And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people <b>come</b> <b>forth</b> and make up for {{some of the things that}} have happened." [...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Erdrick {{arrived at}} Tantegel Castle {{to speak with}} King Lorik and offered his help to defeat the Dragonlord. After searching the land for clues to the Dragonlord's whereabouts, Erdrick found that the Dragonlord lived on an island that could be accessed only via a magical bridge that only a [...] "Rainbow Drop" [...] could generate. After venturing to the island, Erdrick was never heard from again. Many years later, during King LorikXVI's reign, the Dragonlord attacked the kingdom again and captured Princess Gwaelin. Many heroes tried to rescue the princess and recover the Ball of Light from the Dragonlord's castle, called Charlock, but none succeeded. The prophet Mahetta predicted that [...] "One day, a descendant of the valiant Erdrick shall <b>come</b> <b>forth</b> to defeat the Dragonlord." [...] However, when the descendant (the game's hero) arrives, {{many of the people}} of Alefgard have forgotten the story of Erdrick, and those few who do remember consider it a myth and do not believe in Mahetta's prophecy. King Lorik starts to mourn the decline of his kingdom.|$|E
500|$|On the thirtieth {{anniversary of}} the series, Henderson called the {{incident}} [...] "the low point of the series", but would later apologize to Clarke. In his 2007 book, Conacher wrote that [...] "from the broadcast booth I was shocked and disgusted when I saw Clarke viciously chop at Kharlamov's left ankle." [...] He noted [...] "that emotionally these games had clearly gone beyond sport for Team Canada and had truly become unrestricted war on ice." [...] Media opinion is divided on the effect it had {{on the outcome of}} the series. The controversy and admissions that have <b>come</b> <b>forth</b> throughout the years have led some to the belief that the incident could be considered a form of cheating. Kharlamov, who {{had been one of the}} Soviets' best forwards, missed game seven, when the Soviets could have clinched the series and while he did play in game eight, he was not at 100% and did not score. In Clarke's opinion, there were other factors for Team Canada's turnaround in Moscow: [...] "In Moscow we played much better than in Canada. We were almost equal to the Soviet team physically by then, we passed much better, we shot the puck much better, we became faster and played better on defence. Besides, when you have nothing to lose, it is easier to play. And after the fifth game we had nothing to lose." ...|$|E
