Two logboats were also recovered in 1968, one with dovetail joints. This work continues today. These Roman-period log-boats were constructed for lake fishing, and were about 8 m long, 1.5 m wide, and 80 centimetres deep, were made of oak, yew, and possibly willow. The boats were paddle propelled. Other notable <b>constructional</b> <b>features</b> are that they were complex boats: carved; dugout (extended); mortice-and-tenon; and sewn.|$|E
50|$|The first Unimog 404 concept-vehicle {{was made}} in 1953 and was {{slightly}} smaller than the series production model, it had a track width of 1,600 mm and a wheelbase of 2,670 mm. Two prototypes for the french army followed in 1954, the first 1,100 series production models were also purchased by the french army. Since the french army didn't want the spare wheel to occupy space for soldiers on the bed, the Daimler-Benz engineers decided to build the Unimog 404 with a downswept frame so the spare wheel could be mounted underneath the bed. This <b>constructional</b> <b>feature</b> also allowed more torsional flexing and, therefore, improved the offroad capabilities of the Unimog. Later, the downswept frame became a key <b>constructional</b> <b>feature</b> for the following Unimog types.|$|R

Up to 1937, 50 engines were equipped with a Bissel axle; (the axle arrangement changed as a result from 1B to 1'B). The <b>constructional</b> <b>feature</b> of this locomotive was the unusually large distance between driving and carrying axle of 4,000 mm or, on the final six units, of 4,050 mm.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of the modeling of the effective thermomechanical properties of the multifunctional carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced hybrid composites for advanced structural applications. The novel <b>constructional</b> <b>feature</b> of such multifunctional CNT-reinforced hybrid composite is that CNTs are radially grown on the circumferential surfaces of the carbon fiber reinforcements. Several micromechanical models have been developed to predict the effective thermomechanical properties of these multifunctional CNT-reinforced hybrid composites. The waviness of CNTs is intrinsic to many manufacturing processes and influences the thermomechanical behavior of CNT-reinforced composites. An endeavor has also been made to investigate the effect of wavy CNTs on the thermomechanical properties of the multifunctional CNT-reinforced hybrid composites. Radially aligned CNTs grown on the circumferential surfaces of the carbon fibers assure that the CNT-reinforced hybrid composites are truly multifunctional and may be a promising advanced next generation composite for structural applications...|$|R

Early descriptions of the building stated that it was as near as possible for modern purposes, severely Greek, not only in general design but also in its <b>constructional</b> <b>features,</b> but the introduction of domes and arches, meant that it deviated somewhat from the transom and colonnade of the old Greek models.

The 4L's five-bearing steel crankshaft was forged, as were the duralumin connecting rods which had split, steel backed, bronze bearings. The crankcase was cast from aluminium alloy.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} {{non-contact}} vibration attenuator {{made up of}} a permanent magnet mounted on a piezoelectric stack. Two such actuators are made to work simultaneously in a 'twin-actuator' configuration. It is conceived that a controlled change in the gap between the actuator and the structure is capable of attenuation of vibration of the structure. This appropriate change in gap is achieved by controlled motion of the piezoelectric stacks. It is shown that the actuator works as an active damper when the extension and contraction of the actuators are made proportional to the velocity of the beam. The resolution of extension of a piezoelectric stack is in the order of nanometers. Thus in the proposed actuator the force of actuation can be applied with great precision. This actuator is also attractive for its simple <b>constructional</b> <b>feature...</b>|$|R

50|$|Internal levees are <b>constructional</b> <b>features</b> fed by flows that {{partially}} {{spilled out}} of channelised confinement, but were largely unable {{to escape the}} confinement of the channel-belt. The flows which build internal levees may interact with the main confining surface, i.e., the external levees, and/or the channel-belt erosion surface, and are liable to erosion by the migration or avulsions of channel thalwegs, and the overbank passage of large flows not confined by the internal levees. As a consequence of lateral migration, internal levees may be better preserved on inner bends (Schwarz and Arnott, 2007). Internal levees form only when confinement has been established, {{through the construction of}} external levees and/or the degradation and entrenchment of the composite erosion surface of the channel-belt, or within canyon confinement (Deptuck et al., 2003). Internal levees may form distinct wedges of sediment where enough space is available; where space is limited, i.e., where overspill from underfit channels interacts with external levees or erosional confinement, overspill deposits may appear superficially similar to terrace deposits, which are widely identified in the subsurface (Damuth et al., 1988; Babonneau et al., 2004).|$|E

40|$|A {{radar and}} gravity {{survey of the}} ice-filled caldera at Volcán Sollipulli, Chile, {{indicates}} that the intra-caldera ice has a thickness of up to 650 m in its central part and that the caldera harbours a minimum of 6 km 3 of ice. Reconnaissance geological observations show that the volcano has erupted compositions ranging from olivine basalt to dacite and have identified five distinct volcanic units in the caldera walls. Pre- or syn-caldera collapse deposits (the Sharkfin pyroclastic unit) comprise a sequence which evolved from subglacial to subaerial facies. Post-caldera collapse products, which crop out along 17 of the 20 km length of the caldera wall, were erupted almost exclusively along the caldera margins {{in the presence of}} a large body of intra-caldera ice. The Alpehué crater, formed by an explosive eruption between 2960 and 2780 a. BP, in the southwest part of the caldera is shown to post date formation of the caldera. Sollipulli lacks voluminous silicic pyroclastic rocks associated with caldera formation and the collapse structure does not appear to be a consequence of a large-magnitude explosive eruption. Instead, lateral magma movement at depth resulting in emptying of the magma chamber may have generated the caldera. The radar and gravity data show that the central part of the caldera floor is flat but, within a few hundred metres of the caldera walls, the floor has a stepped topography with relatively low-density rock bodies beneath the ice in this region. This, coupled with the fact that most of the post-caldera eruptions have taken place along the caldera walls, implies that the caldera has been substantially modified by subglacial marginal eruptions. Sollipulli caldera has evolved from a collapse to a <b>constructional</b> <b>feature</b> with intra-caldera ice playing a major role. The post-caldera eruptions have resulted in an increase in height of the walls and concomitant deepening of the caldera with time...|$|R
40|$|The genus Cornulites, {{with the}} type species C. serpularius Schlotheim, 1820, from the Silurian of Gotland, {{comprises}} annulated, conical or tubular calcite shells, often found attached to the hard parts of other organisms. No consensus has ever been reached over the zoological affinities of the taxon, and no examples of soft-part preservation are known: detailed examination of shell structures and growth patterns provide {{the only means of}} assessing its systematic position. Using transverse and longitudinal thin sections of C. serpularius Vine, 1882, and C. cellulosus sp. nov., from the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation of England, the shell structure of Cornulites is shown to be lamellar, but with conspicuous internal chambers (camerae) at the apical end of the shell and, particularly in C. cellulosus, numerous smaller vacuities (cellulae) between the lamellae in the apertural shell region. Growth of the shell was by the secretion of low-magnesian calcite increments within one another, giving a cone-in-cone structure, with the prominent development of cellulae in C. cellulosus probably a <b>constructional</b> <b>feature</b> relating to an upright life position. By comparison of morphology and shell structure with other taxa, the zoological affinities of Cornulites are re-examined; previously suggested affinities with annelids, foraminifers, molluscs and poriferans can be ruled out. Specific shell structures, most notably pseudopuncta similar to those of bryozoans and brachiopods, have led some recent workers to interpret cornulitids as lophophorates. However, it is shown that they can be interpreted alternatively as solitary, aseptate members of the stem-Zoantharia (Cnidaria: Anthozoa). Four cornulitid species are recognized in the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation: C. cellulosus sp. nov., C. gremialis sp. nov., C. scalariformis and C. serpularius. In the absence of the type material, C. serpularius is here restricted to cornulitids closely resembling the specimens originally figured by Schlotheim. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R

40|$|Deep sea {{drilling}} off {{the east}} coast of North America provided valuable information {{on the development of the}} con-tinental rise in a region that has been influenced by the deposition of both continentally derived and pelagic sediments. Site 603 is interpreted to overlie Jurassic oceanic crustal basement. Based upon the oldest sediment recovered, Site 603 was only influenced by pelagic sedimentation during the late Berriasian to Valanginian, with terrigenous sediment not appearing until the late Valanginian to Aptian. The first evidence of clastic sedimentation is the development of a large turbidite system during a time when deltas were being built on the shelf. From the Hauterivian through the Late Creta-ceous, black shale turbidites were intermittently deposited at this site. The maximum abundance of the carbonaceous clay stone occurs interbedded with red and green claystone, and some silt and sand turbidites, in the Aptian-Albian in-terval. Sea level rose during the Albian, and as a consequence redeposition of terrigenous sediment waned, then ceased. The site then dropped below the calcite compensation depth. Less extensive terrigenous turbidite deposits are found as-sociated with multicolored noncalcareous claystone that represents pelagic sedimentation during the Late Cretaceous. A turbidite containing dark green spherules of montmorillonite, and anomalously high concentrations of Ni, Co, and As, is interpreted to represent exotic sediment that was reworked from the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary sediment, based on its sedimentological and geochemical similarities to a biostratigraphically dated K/T boundary lamina cored at DSDP Hole 390 B on the Blake Plateau. Late Paleocene to early middle Eocene pelagic claystone is disconformably overlain by middle Miocene hemipelagic claystone. Turbiditic silts and clays accumulated at this site, followed by the de-velopment of the lower continental rise hills of the Hatteras Outer Ridge.

40|$|New deep tow sidescan sonar {{data from}} the Southwest Indian Ridge reveal complex volcanic/tectonic interrelationships in the axial zone of this ultra-slow {{spreading}} ridge. While some <b>constructional</b> volcanic <b>features</b> resemble examples documented at the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, such as axial volcanic ridges, hummocky and smooth lava flows, their distribution and dimensions differ markedly. The largest axial volcanic ridges occur at segment centres, but fresh-looking volcanic constructions also occur at segment ends and in the deep basins marking the non-transform discontinuities. The orientations of the dominant fault population and main volcanic ridges are controlled by tectonic processes such as orthogonal extension in the sections of the ridge perpendicular to the spreading direction and transtensional extension in the obliquely spreading sections of the ridge. Minor faults and small volcanic ridges striking parallel to the axis in the oblique part of the ridge are not controlled by these extensional regimes. This observation suggests that the ridge axis acts as a zone of weakness and that magmatic processes, with associated fractures opening in response to magma pressure, may control local emplacements of axial volcanic ridges at obliquely spreading ridges. This non-systematic pattern of ridge characteristics suggests an along-axis variation between focused and distributed magmatic supply, a model which is supported by our interpretation of low-amplitude mantle Bouguer anomalies calculated for the area. We propose that a change of the axial segmentation pattern, from two segments to the present-day three segments, may have introduced additional instability into the crustal accretion process...|$|R

The new data extend between 55 ° 45 ′S and 57 ° 20 ′S and include Protector Shoal and the areas around Zavodovski, Visokoi and the Candlemas islands groups. Each of these areas is a discrete volcanic center. The entirely submarine Protector Shoal area, close to the northern limit of the arc, forms a 55 km long east–west-trending seamount chain that is at least partly of silicic composition. The seamounts are comparable to small subaerial stratovolcanoes in size, with volumes up to 83 km 3, indicating that they are the product of multiple eruptions over extended periods. Zavodovski, Visokoi and the Candlemas island group are the summits of three 3 – 3. 5 km high volcanic edifices.

Mass wasting takes place mainly by strong erosion at sea level, and dispersal of this material along chutes, probably as turbidity currents and other mass flows that deposit in extensive sediment wave fields. Large scale mass wasting structures include movement of unconsolidated debris in slides, slumps and debris avalanches.

To address this shortcoming, this paper presents a series of techniques designed to enhance digital elevation models (DEMs) of environments dominated by low-amplitude landforms, such as a fluvial megafan system. These techniques were validated through the study of a wide depositional tract composed of several megafans located within the Brazilian Pantanal. The Taquari megafan is the most remarkable of these features, covering an area of approximately 49, 000 km 2. To enhance the SRTMDEM, the megafan global topography was calculated and found to be accurately represented by a second order polynomial. Simple subtraction of the global topography from altitude produced a new DEM product, which greatly enhanced low amplitude landforms within the Taquari megafan. A field campaign and optical satellite images were used to ground-truth features on the enhanced DEM, which consisted of both depositional (<b>constructional)</b> and erosional <b>features.</b> The results demonstrate that depositional lobes are the dominant landforms on the megafan. A model linking baselevel change, avulsion, clastic sedimentation, and erosion is proposed to explain the microtopographic features on the Taquari megafan surface.

Biblis Patera is approximately 66 x 127 km with an oval 51 x 56 km caldera; the summit elevation is approximately 2 km above the surrounding plains. The constrcut has an estimated volume of 8 - 22 x 10 (exp 3) cu km. Ulysses Patera is located at 2. 7 deg. N, 121. 3 deg. W and stands approx. 2 - 3 km above the surrounding plain; flank slopes are approximately 7 deg. to 12 deg. The caldera floor is quite deep, lying 1. 8 to 2. 2 km below the caldera rim. The caldera has a void volume of approximately 5000 cu km, the total solid mass volume of the volcano is 7 - 16 x 10 (exp 3) cu km. Jovis Tholus is centered at 18. 3 deg N; 117. 5 deg W; it is a low relief, volcano with gentle flank slopes of between 3 and 8 deg. The construct is dominated by a series of inset calderas which make up the largest fraction of the area. The caldera complex is offset to the southwest side. Total shield dimensions are approximately 77 km (e-wt) by 62 km (n-s); the caldera complex is approximately 44 x 34 km. The shield is embayed on all sides by younger Amazonian age volcanics. Total relief, relative to the surrounding plains, is probably approximately 2 km. The total volume of Jovis Tholus is estimated to be approximately 2 - 5 x 10 (exp 3) cu km...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} <b>constructional</b> {{and technological}} <b>features</b> for manufacturing driven piles with variable strength of pile shaft. Economical efficiency of their production {{has been shown}} in the paper. The paper provides a pile cap design that ensures perception of hammer impacts with the help of lateral edges of the pile cap. Driven reinforced concrete piles which are manufactured from three shaft sections having various strength have been proposed in the paper. Material strength (concrete grade and diameter of bars) and length of shaft sections are given on a case by case basis in accordance with nature and rate of stresses in piles during their driving process. Manufacturing of polystrong piles provides an opportunity to select them for a particular construction site with due account of their preservation during driving process. A pile cap has been developed that as opposed to existing analogous designs makes it possible to transmit impact efforts from a hammer to the pile through lateral surface of its head part. The pile cap provides the possibility to increase an area for perception of hammer impact efforts by the pile and in doing so it is possible significantly to reduce a damage risk and destruction of pile concrete during its driving. Application of polystrong piles and their driving with the help of new pile cap are considered as a basis for defect-free and resource-saving technology for pile foundations in the construction. </p...|$|R
