Adobe Photoshop software was used for colour analysis to obtain analytical data {{in the form of a}} Red Green Blue (RGB) value. Calibration curves were developed for morphine, <b>codeine,</b> and diamorphine <b>hydrochloride</b> and the developed tests successfully applied to seized heroin samples to demonstrate the application of the technique in a forensic case context. Good agreement with gas chromatographic quantification results was obtained for the illicit samples analysed and a wide linear range and low detection limit for all drugs under test facilitated the application to illicit samples. The results show great potential for use as a semi-quantitative field test for illicit drug compounds...|$|R

(2004) {{observed}} that cyanoacrylate fuming process {{did not cause}} any interference in the detection of drugs of abuse (<b>codeine</b> phosphate, cocaine <b>hydrochloride,</b> amphetamine sulphate, barbital and nitrazepam) and potential adulterants (caffeine, aspirin, paracetamol, starch and talc) by Raman spectroscopy. Raman bands due to cyanoacrylate polymer were present but their presence did not cause any difficulty in establishing the identity of these drugs in even {{in the presence of}} adulterants. Sundar and Rowell (2014) identify drugs of abuse (cocaine and methadone) and therapeutic drugs (aspirin, caffeine and paracetamol) by Surface Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (SALDI-TOFMS) or Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation TOF-MS (MALDI-TOF-MS). They {{observed that}} exposure of cyanoacrylate developed prints to acetone vapor makes physical transfer of prints to lifting tape in easy and simple manner. Koenig et al. (2011) observed no significant effect of cyanoacrylate fuming method on the initial composition of latent fingermark residues.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} Raman spectroscopy to the detection of exogenous substances in cyanoacrylate-fumed fingerprints. The scenario considered was that of an individual handling a substance and subsequently depositing a contaminated fingerprint. These fingerprints were enhanced by cyanoacrylate fuming, {{a process in which}} a layer of white cyanoacrylate polymer is deposited on the fingerprint material, enabling visual detection. Five drugs of abuse (<b>codeine</b> phosphate, cocaine <b>hydrochloride,</b> amphetamine sulphate, barbital and nitrazepam) and five non-controlled substances of similar appearance, which may be used in the adulteration of drugs of abuse (caffeine, aspirin, paracetamol, starch and talc), were used. The substances studied could be clearly distinguished using their Raman spectra and were all successfully detected in cyanoacrylate-fumed fingerprints. Photobleaching was necessary to reduce the fluorescence background in the spectra of some substances. Raman spectra obtained from the substances in cyanoacrylate-fumed fingerprints were of a similar quality to spectra obtained from the substances under normal sampling conditions, however, interfering Raman bands arising from the cyanoacrylate polymer were present in the spectra. In most cases the only interfering band was the C≡N stretching mode of the polymer, and there were no cases where the interfering bands prevented identification of the substances. If necessary, the interfering bands could be successfully removed by spectral subtraction. The most difficult aspect of the detection of these substances in cyanoacrylate-fumed fingerprints was visually locatin...|$|R

40|$|A novel general {{approach}} was described to address {{many of the}} challenges of salt solubility determination of drug substances, with data processing and refinement of equilibrium constants encoded in the computer program pDISOL-XTM.  The new approach was illustrated by the determinations of the solubility products of diprenorphine hydrochloride, <b>codeine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and phosphate, lidocaine hydrochloride and phosphate at 25 oC, using a recently-optimized saturation shake-flask protocol.  The effects of different buffers (Britton-Robinson universal and Sörensen phosphate) were compared.  Lidocaine precipitates were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and polarization light microscopy. The ionic strength in the studied systems ranged from 0. 25 to 4. 3 M.  Codeine (and possibly diprenorphine) chloride were less soluble than the phosphates for pH > 2.  The reverse trend was evident with lidocaine.   Diprenorphine saturated solutions showed departure from the predictions of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in alkaline (pH > 9) solutions, consistent {{with the formation of}} a mixed-charge anionic dimer...|$|E
