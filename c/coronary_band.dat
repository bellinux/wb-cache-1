5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the <b>coronary</b> <b>band,</b> and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|Dominant white {{horses are}} born with pink skin and a white coat, which they retain {{throughout}} their lives. Although the term [...] "dominant white" [...] is typically associated with a pure white coat, such horses may be all-white, near-white, partially white, or exhibit an irregular spotting pattern {{similar to that of}} sabino horses. The amount of white hair depends on which mutation of W is involved. Non-white areas of skin and hair are most commonly seen along the dorsal midline of the horse, known as the topline, and are especially common in the mane and on the ears. They may also have interspersed specks or spots of non-white skin and hair. In addition, the hooves are most often white, but may have striping if there is pigmented skin on the <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> just above the hoof. In some cases, foals born with residual non-white hair may lose some or all of this pigment with age, without the help of the gray factor. Dominant white spotting does not affect eye color, and most dominant white horses have brown eyes. The pink skin is devoid of pigment cells (melanocytes), and appears pink from the underlying network of capillaries. White hair is rooted in unpigmented pink skin. There are many other genetic factors that produce white, near-white, and off-white coat colors in horses, some of which are visually very similar to dominant white.|$|E
2500|$|The hoof {{is made up}} by {{an outer}} part, the hoof [...] capsule (composed of various {{cornified}} specialized structures) and an inner, living part, containing soft tissues and bone. The cornified material of the hoof capsule is different in structure and properties in different parts. Dorsally, it covers, protects and supports P3 (also known as the coffin bone, pedal bone, PIII). Palmarly/plantarly, it covers and protects specialised soft tissues (tendons, ligaments, fibro-fatty and/or fibrocartilaginous tissues and cartilage). The upper, almost circular limit of the hoof capsule is the coronet (<b>coronary</b> <b>band),</b> having an angle to the ground of roughly similar magnitude in each pair of feet (i.e. fronts and backs). These angles may differ slightly from one horse to another, but not markedly. The walls originate from the coronet band. Walls are longer in the dorsal portion of the hoof (toe), intermediate in length in the lateral portion (quarter) and very short in palmar/plantar portion (heel). Heels are separated by an elastic, resilient structure named the 'frog'. [...] In the palmar/plantar part of the foot, above the heels and the frog, there are two oval bulges named the 'bulbs'.|$|E

50|$|One {{method of}} soring {{involves}} using chemical agents such as mustard oil, kerosene, and other caustic substances on the pasterns, bulbs of the heel, or <b>coronary</b> <b>bands</b> of the horses, causing burning or blistering of the horses' legs to accentuate their gaits. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is sometimes added {{to increase the}} effect. The treated area is then often wrapped in plastic while the chemicals are absorbed. The chemical agents cause extreme pain, and usually lead to scarring. A distinctive scarring pattern is a characteristic indication of soring, so practitioners may attempt to disguise the scarring with a dye, or the horse's legs may be treated with salicylic acid to reduce scarring. These chemicals are harmful, usually quite toxic, and sometimes carcinogenic, such that practitioners must use a brush and wear gloves when applying them.|$|R

40|$|Laminitis is {{a painful}} {{systemic}} disease {{of which the}} principal manifestation is a diffuse aseptic pododermatitis. An ischaemia-reperfusion and/or an activation of matrix métalloproteinases following a proinflammatory status (mainly gastro-intestinal) or hormonal disorders involving metabolic dysfunctions related {{to the development of}} insulin resistance, are at the origin of laminitis. The presence of histological lesions of keratinocytes and endothelial cells, and the infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in laminar tissues, warranted the development of the two cellular culture models corresponding for the study of this disease. Therefore, keratinocytes and endothelial cells are isolated by enzymatic digestion and mechanical separation, respectively from <b>coronary</b> <b>bands</b> and carotids, and are put in culture under controlled atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with additives. Microscopic observations of phenotype, the immunocytochemistry, growth curves, and apoptosis stainings allowed to characterize the cells.

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in feral swine are limited, and data for {{clinical}} manifestations and disease transmissibility are lacking. In this report, feral and domestic swine were experimentally infected with FMDV (A 24 -Cruzeiro), and susceptibility and virus transmission were studied. Feral swine were {{proved to be}} highly susceptible to A- 24 Cruzeiro FMD virus by intradermal inoculation and by contact with infected domestic and feral swine. Typical clinical signs in feral swine included transient fever, lameness and vesicular lesions in the <b>coronary</b> <b>bands,</b> heel bulbs, tip of the tongue and snout. Domestic swine exhibited clinical signs of the disease within 24 h after contact with feral swine, whereas feral swine did not show clinical signs of FMD until 48 h after contact with infected domestic and feral swine. Clinical scores of feral and domestic swine were comparable. However, feral swine exhibited a higher tolerance for the disease, and their thicker, darker skin made vesicular lesions difficult to detect. Virus titration of oral swabs showed that both feral and domestic swine shed similar amounts of virus, with levels peaking between 2 to 4 dpi/dpc (days post-inoculation/days post-contact). FMDV RNA was intermittently detectable in the oral swabs by real-time RT-PCR of both feral and domestic swine between 1 and 8 dpi/dpc {{and in some instances}} until 14 dpi/ 12 dpc. Both feral and domestic swine seroconverted 6 – 8 dpi/dpc as measured by 3 ABC antibody ELISA and VIAA assays. FMDV RNA levels in animal room air filters were similar in feral and domestic swine animal rooms, and were last detected at 22 dpi, while none were detectable at 28 or 35 dpi. The FMDV RNA persisted in domestic and feral swine tonsils up to 33 – 36 dpi/dpc, whereas virus isolation was negative. Results from this study will help understand the role feral swine may play in sustaining an FMD outbreak, and may be utilized in guiding surveillance, epidemiologic and economic models...|$|R

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of foot-andmouth disease (FMD) in North American bison (Bison bison) or elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). In these two experimental infection studies, we compared the susceptibilities of bison and elk to FMD virus (FMDV), respectively, with that of cattle; determined whether intra- and interspecies transmission could occur in bison and cattle, and elk and cattle; determined suitability of conventional available laboratory tests to detect FMDV infection in bison and elk; and investigated whether bison or elk are efficient long-term carriers of FMDV. In both studies, {{after a period of}} acclimation to the containment at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, animals were infected by intraepithelial tongue inoculation with 10, 000 bovine tongue infective doses of FMDV, strain O 1 Manisa. Inoculated animals were kept with contact animals; subsequently, inoculated and/or exposed contact animals were placed in rooms with unexposed animals. All bison developed oral mucosal and foot lesions similar to those of cattle. Bison developed fever, lameness, inappetence, and ptyalism. Physical examinations on bison revealed numerous small vesicles and erosions affecting tongue, gingiva, muzzle, hard and soft palates, <b>coronary</b> <b>bands,</b> and interdigital skin. Inoculated elk developed transient fever and mild focal tongue and foot lesions. Contact elk developed neither clinical signs nor gross pathologic lesions of FMD. At necropsy, lesions in bison included numerous extensive vesicles, erosions, and/or ulcers in the oral cavities, feet, and rumen pillars depending on the stage of disease. Less extensive oral, foot, and rumen lesions were present in the inoculated elk. All bison and inoculated elk developed antibodies to FMDV and were positive for FMDV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Transmission occurred between cattle and bison, and bison and bison. It did not occur between elk and cattle. Elk-to-elk transmission studies resulted in only one contact elk developing serologic evidence of a subclinical infection. Other exposed elk developed neither clinical, pathologic, virologic, nor serologic evidence of disease. FMDV was not isolated from animals past 28 days postinfection...|$|R
40|$|Purkinje fibers or Purkinje cardiomyocytes {{are part}} of the whole complex of the cardiac {{conduction}} system, which is today classified as specific heart muscle tissue responsible for the generation of the heart impulses. From {{the point of view of}} their distribution, structure and ultrastructural composition of the cardiac conduction system in the ostrich heart were studied by light and electron microscopy. These cells were distributed in cardiac conducting system including SA node, AV node, His bundle and branches as well as endocardium, pericardium, myocardium around the <b>coronary</b> arteries, moderator <b>bands,</b> white fibrous sheet in right atrium, and left septal attachment of AV valve. The great part of the Purkinje fiber is composed of clear, structure less sarcoplasm, and the myofibrils tend to be confined to a thin ring around the periphery of the cells. They have one or more large nuclei centrally located within the fiber. Ultrastructurally, they are easily distinguished. The main distinction feature is the lack of electron density and having a light appearance, due to the absence of organized myofibrils. P-cells usually have two nuclei with a mass of short, delicate microfilaments scattered randomly in the cytoplasm; they contain short sarcomeres and myofibrillar insertion plaque. They do not have T-tubules...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground/Aims: Left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy {{is associated}} with impaired coronary vascular reserve. We examined the effect of pressure-overload hypertrophy on vasorelaxant responses of guinea-pig isolated coronary small arteries and compared them mesenteric small arteries. Methods: Pressure-overload was induced by banding the ascending aorta of guinea pigs. Haemodynamics, ventricular, atrial and lung weights were measured 168 days after <b>banding.</b> Isolated <b>coronary</b> and mesenteric small arteries were contracted with a thromboxane mimetic (U 46619) and relaxation to acetylcholine, isoprenaline, forskolin and nitroprusside was examined. Arterial wall morphology was examined by light microscopy. Results: Aortic banding reduced cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance; atrial, ventricular and lung weights were increased. Coronary artery adventitial and medial thickness was increased, but mesenteric arterial wall morphology was unaffected. Coronary artery relaxation to acetylcholine, isoprenaline, forskolin and nitroprusside were reduced in banded animals. In contrast relaxation of mesenteric arteries to acetylcholine, nitroprusside and forskolin were unaffected by banding, although isoprenaline-induced relaxation was reduced. A cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, {{had no effect on}} coronary artery responses to acetylcholine in banded or sham animals, but the differences in relaxation of <b>coronary</b> arteries between <b>banded</b> and sham animals were no longer significant following pre-incubation with NO inhibitors, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and oxyhaemoglobin. Conclusion: Pressure overload-induced LVH causes impaired relaxation of small coronary arteries to endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxants. These findings are indicative of alterations in vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to vasodilators. Impairment of coronary arterial vasodilation may contribute to the reduced coronary vascular reserve seen in LVH...|$|R

50|$|Quittor is an {{infection}} of the lower leg of equines, sometimes known as graveling. A condition once common in draft horses, it is characterized by inflammation of the cartilage of the lower leg. There are two forms, subcutaneous and cartilaginous. Quittor usually results from an injury to the leg, such as an abscess on the <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> above the hoof, that allows foreign matter {{to get into the}} leg and then collect beneath the hoof, leading to {{an infection}}. In some cases, removing this matter requires cutting away parts of the hoof. Abscesses may also form inside the hoof capsule itself from improper shoeing and trimming of the hoof, from laminitis, or from injury to the sole of the hoof, but the horse will be significantly lame {{for a longer period of}} time if the infection migrates up to the <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> rather than down. Treatment of hoof and <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> abscesses today usually incorporates use of antibiotics, sometimes combined with poulticing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{hypothesis}} that abnormally increased myocardial oxygen demands {{may contribute to}} increased vulnerability to ischemia during exercise in the chronically pressureoverloaded hypertrophied left ventricle was tested. Myocardial oxygen consumption was measured during a five stage graded treadmill exercise protocol in eight normal dogs and nine adult dogs in which a 90 % increase in left ventricular mass was produced by banding the ascending aorta at 8 weeks of age. Heart rate increased progressively during exercise in both groups of dogs, but was significantly faster than normal in the group with aortic <b>banding.</b> <b>Coronary</b> blood flow increased progressively with exercise in both groups, but was significantly greater than normal in dogs with aortic banding during each exercise stage. Coronary sinus oxygen tension decreased significantly and similarly during exercise in normal and hypertrophied hearts. In dogs with hypertrophy, oxygen consumption per gram of myocardium averaged 52 % greater than normal during exercise. This excess myocardial oxygen consumption in dogs with aortic banding resulted from an abnormally large increase in oxygen consumption per beat during exercise and from the faster heart rate in this group of dogs. Measurements of myocardial blood flow with microspheres demonstrated a lower subendocardial/subepicardial blood flow ratio in dogs with hypertrophy; this ratio decreased significantly during exercise in dogs with hypertrophy, but not in normal dogs. These data {{are consistent with the}} {{hypothesis that}} increased vulnerability to ischemia in the pressure-overloaded hypertrophied left ventricle is the result of both increased myocardial oxygen demands during exercise and abnormalities of myocardial perfusion...|$|R

50|$|Sidebone is {{a common}} {{condition}} of horses, characterized by the ossification of the collateral cartilages of the coffin bone. These are found {{on either side of}} the foot protruding above the level of the <b>coronary</b> <b>band.</b> The lateral cartilages support the hoof wall and provide an important role in the support and cushioning provided to the heel. The front feet are most commonly affected.|$|E
50|$|Digital pulse {{evaluation}} is important when addressing the hoof. An increased digital pulse often {{indicates that the}} lesion is in the foot, and are usually most significantly increased in horses with laminitis. The <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> may also be palpated. Cool swelling can indicate coffin joint effusion, swelling {{with an increase in}} temperature can indicate laminitis, firm swelling can occur with ringbone, and a localized swelling with pain can indicate an abscess.|$|E
5000|$|May be conformationally induced from angular limb {{deformity}} or malalignments of {{the bones}} within the hoof. These conformational problems cause excess strain {{on one side of}} hoof making it steepen, while the side with less impact grows to a flare. The <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> often slopes asymmetrically due to pushing of hoof wall & coronet on steep side, which gets more impact than flared. May develop sheared heels, causing lameness issues, contracted heels & thrush.|$|E
5000|$|Coronary Extensor Distance (CE): the {{vertical}} {{distance from the}} level of the proximal <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> to the extensor process of P3. It is often used to compare progression of the disease over time, rather than as a stand-alone value. A rapidly increasing CE value can indicate distal displacement (sinking) of the coffin bone, while a more gradual increase in CE can occur with foot collapse. Normal values range from 0-30 mm, with most horses >12-15 mm.|$|E
5000|$|For protection, horses usually wear splint {{boots on}} the cannons of their lower front legs as well as skid {{boots on the}}ir hind fetlocks.

5000|$|The chronic phase may be {{compensated}} or uncompensated. Compensated cases will have altered hoof structure, including founder rings, wide white lines, and decreased concavity to the sole. Horses will be relatively sound. On radiographs, remodeling of the coffin bone and {{in cases of}} rotational displacement, the distal hoof wall will be thicker than that proximally.

For a truly polished look, the <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> is clipped to shorten the small straggling hairs that grow {{along the edges of}} the hoof. Leg clipping is done for most light riding horses.

The next day, August 18, radiographs showed that his fractured right leg was almost completely fused.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{controversial}} practice used on some saddle seat horses, primarily the Tennessee Walking Horse, is soring: the placing of a caustic ointment on the <b>coronary</b> <b>band</b> and pastern of the horse, to cause pain {{so that the}} horse picks up its feet {{as quickly as they}} touch the ground. Because of the pain it causes to animals, soring has been banned by federal law, enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture as part of the Horse Protection Act of 1970. [...] However, enforcement is spotty amongst show-sanctioning organizations, and funds are not sufficient for the USDA to inspect all horse shows. Therefore, even though the practice is widely condemned and illegal, with possible criminal penalties possible, it is still a problem for the industry.|$|E
5000|$|Examiners {{will also}} [...] "hoof test" [...] each foot by {{applying}} a metal instrument that squeezes the foot {{to test for}} deep pain. Diffuse sensitivity occurs with fracture or infection of the coffin bone, and laminitis. More localized sensitivity can be found with sole bruises, puncture wounds, hoof abscesses, and hot nails. Sensitivity over the middle third of the frog is consistent with navicular syndrome, but can also occur with sheared heels. To distinguish these two, the hoof testers may be applied over the heels, which will be sensitive {{in the case of}} any heel-related pain, such as sheared, contracted, or bruised heels. The hoof wall may also be percussed (struck with a hammer), which will produce a positive response in cases of hoof cracks that are causing the horse pain, laminitis, or a gravel (hoof abscess travelling up the hoof wall towards the <b>coronary</b> <b>band).</b>|$|E
