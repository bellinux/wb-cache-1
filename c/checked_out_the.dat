Commander Hobaugh and Pilot Wilmore, {{with help}} from Mission Specialist Bresnik <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Flight Control System (FCS). Immediately afterwards, at 10:58 UTC, the astronauts test fired Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters. The RCS thrusters control the shuttle’s orientation as it descends and begins its re-entry through the atmosphere. All astronauts gathered for a deorbit briefing a little after 11:00 UTC, just before their midday meal. The Thanksgiving dinner aboard Atlantis was more traditional than expected.|$|E
25|$|The Expedition 5 crew {{launched}} on June 5, 2002, aboard STS-111 and docked with the International Space Station on June 7, 2002. During her six-month stay aboard the Space Station, Whitson installed the Mobile Base System, the S1 truss segment, and the P1 truss segment using {{the space station}} remote manipulator system; performed a 4-hour and 25 minute spacewalk in a Russian Orlan space suit to install micrometeoroid shielding on the Zvezda Service Module; and activated and <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Microgravity Sciences Glovebox, a facility class payload rack.|$|E

Schweickart was due to carry out a more extensive set of activities to test the suit, and demonstrate that it was possible for astronauts to perform an EVA from the Lunar Module to the Command Module in an emergency, but as he had been suffering from space sickness the extra tests were scratched.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 11 {{the joint}} ISS/shuttle crews {{completed}} transfers {{and closed the}} hatches with the MPLM. Once the hatches were closed, the MPLM was deactivated, demated and berthed back in the payload bay of the space shuttle.

The end of the crews work days saw the two crews say goodbye in a farewell ceremony and close the hatches between the shuttle and ISS. Once the hatches were closed, the Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 was depressurized, in advance of undocking.

25|$|The crew of STS-130 began {{preparing}} {{the space shuttle}} Endeavour for landing. During the day commander George Zamka and pilot Terry Virts, with help from mission specialist and flight engineer Stephen Robinson <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Flight Control System (FCS) and did a hot fire test of the Reaction Control System (RCS). Commander Zamka also did communications checks with mission control through the tracking stations at Merit Island, White Sands Space Harbor and Edwards Air Force Base. These checks are routine for the day before landing and were all successful. While all the system checkouts were going on, {{the rest of the}} crew were stowing items no longer needed during the flight. During the early part of the day Stephen Robinson and Terry Virts also stowed and deactivated the space shuttle robotic arm. The entire crew also took time out of their day to conduct an in-flight interview with CNN, CNN Español and Univision.|$|E

25|$|Terry Wayne Fator {{was born}} June 10, 1965, in Dallas, Texas, {{the son of}} Jephtha Wesley and Edith Marie Clifton, later known as Marie Sligh. He has an older brother, Jephtha Jr., and a younger sister, Deborah. Fator's second cousin is Chris Sligh, an American Idol season six finalist. Terry Fator says in his audio {{commentary}} of Terry Fator: Live from Las Vegas (2009) {{that he went to}} college at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. The beginning of Fator's ventriloquism career dates back to when he was in fifth grade. While searching for a book for an assignment on Valentine's Day, he came across a book about ventriloquism titled, Ventriloquism for Fun and Profit, by Paul Winchell. Fator <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> book and started learning about ventriloquism. A few weeks later, Fator purchased a Willie Talk dummy from Sears and soon won a $25 prize for a performance at a church picnic.|$|E
25|$|Flight Day 2 saw {{the crew}} of Discovery begin their {{preparations}} to dock with the International Space Station (ISS). The day started with a firing of the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engine, called the NC2 burn, to help Discovery catch up to the ISS. Commander Steve Lindsey, Pilot Eric Boe and Mission Specialist Al Drew began the day performing an inspection of the Re-enforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels with the Orbital Boom Sensor System (OBSS). Lindsey and Boe started the inspection on the starboard wing and nose cap, and continued on with the port wing; the whole survey took about six hours to complete. Drew joined up with Michael Barratt and Steve Bowen to checkout and get their two Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) ready for the two spacewalks that would be conducted during the mission. Later in the day, the crew <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> rendezvous tools to ensure they were operational. At {{the end of the}} day, another OMS engine firing, known as the NC3 burn, took place.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 2, {{the crew}} of Endeavour {{completed}} several tasks {{in preparation for the}} docking on flight day 3. The first and most important of these tasks was surveying the shuttle's Thermal Protection System (TPS). The Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was used to survey the wing leading edge and nose cone. The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS, or Canadarm 1) was also used to look at the thermal tiles and blankets on and around the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods. After the survey was complete, the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3 was grappled by the SRMS. While the survey was conducted by Greg Johnson and mission specialists Roberto Vittori and Greg Chamitoff, {{the rest of the crew}} prepared the orbiter for docking. This included installing tools such as a center-line camera in the Orbiter Docking System, along with various other sensors used to gauge distance and speed. Kelly and mission specialists Mike Fincke and Drew Feustel furthermore <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> two spacesuits carried on Endeavour, in preparation for the mission's four planned spacewalks.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the summer}} of 2016, the two former rivals found {{themselves}} facing off once more, rekindling the rivalry from 2014. The two faced off in a ten-minute, one fall match at the Arena México 60th Anniversary Show that ended with Rey Cometa defeating Cavernario. Afterwards Rey Cometa challenged Bárbaro Cavernario to put the Mexican National Welterweight Championship on the line at a later date, a match Bárbaro Cavernario agreed to a few weeks later. On June 10, 2016 Rey Cometa won the Mexican National Welterweight Championship as he defeated Bárbaro Cavernario two falls to one. During the introductions to a six-man tag team match on the June 17 Super Viernes show Rey Cometa dove onto Bárbaro Cavernario while still wearing the championship belt, striking Bárbaro Cavernario in the face by accident, leading to Bárbaro Cavernario being {{taken to the hospital}} to be <b>checked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> following week the two signed a contract for a second Lucha de Apuestas match between the two for the July 1 International Gran Prix show.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, Mohamed Atta rented a silver Hyundai Accent, which he booked from SIXT Rent-A-Car for July 9 to 16, and later {{extended}} to the 19th. He drove east out of Madrid towards the Mediterranean beach area of Tarragona. On the way, Atta stopped in Reus to pick up Ramzi bin al-Shibh at the airport. They drove to Cambrils, where they spent {{a night at the}} Hotel Monica. They <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> next morning, and spent the next few days at an unknown location in Tarragona. The absence of other hotel stays, signed receipts or credit card stubs has led investigators to believe that the men may have met in a safe house provided by other al-Qaeda operatives in Spain. There, Atta and bin al-Shibh held a meeting to complete the planning of the attacks. Several clues have been found to link their stay in Spain to Syrian-born Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas (Abu Dahdah), and Amer el Azizi, a Moroccan in Spain. They may have helped arrange and host the meeting in Tarragona. Yosri Fouda, who interviewed bin al-Shibh and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) before the arrest, believes that Said Bahaji and KSM may have also been present at the meeting. Spanish investigators have said that Marwan al-Shehhi and two others later joined the meeting. Bin al-Shibh would not discuss this meeting with Fouda.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted the {{extraordinary}} development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines {{to the fact that}} Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: [...] "Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I <b>checked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> songs with her." ...|$|E
