40|$|A gravity equilibrator is a statically {{balanced}} system {{which is designed}} to counterbalance a mass such that any preferred position is eliminated and thereby the required operating effort to move the mass is greatly reduced. Current spring-to-mass gravity equilibrators are limited in their range of motion as a result of design limitations. An increment of the range of motion is desired to expand the field of applications. The goal {{of this paper is to}} develop a compact one degree of freedom mechanical gravity equilibrator that can statically balance a rotating pendulum over an unlimited range of motion. Static balance over an unlimited range of motion is achieved by a coaxial gear train that uses non <b>circular</b> <b>gears.</b> These gears convert the continuous rotation of the pendulum into a reciprocating rotation of the torsion bars. The shape of these gears are specifically designed to balance a rotating pendulum. Our gear train design and the method to calculate the parameters and the shape of the non <b>circular</b> <b>gears</b> are presented. A prototype is designed and built to validate that the presented method can balance a pendulum over an unlimited range of motion.

When can you wrap a {{conveyer}} belt (or elastic band) around them so that the belt touches every gear and is taut, as in Figure 1 b? This open problem was posed by Manual Abellanas in 2001, and recently appeared in [Abe 08]. It has been studied by several computational geometers, including the present authors, to no avail. Perhaps the most tantalizing special case is when all the gears have the same size. It appears that (a) Input it is always possible to wrap a conveyer belt around equal-size gears, but this problem also remains open.

40|$|In 2013, new {{knowledge}} on semi-pelagic trawling {{has been created}} in MultiSEPT project. The achievements in the project have been possible because of extensive cooperation between the scientific and industrial partners. This report briefly describes the activities {{carried out in the}} MultiSEPT project in 2013. Full scale tests of the semi <b>circular</b> spreading <b>gear</b> (SCSG) showed that this ground gear was easy to rig and operate, its geometry was stable during towing and it had good bottom contact. The spreading (distance between wing-ends) was approximately 7 % higher with the SCSG than with the rockhopper gear for the same gear and door spreading. The SCSG had good bottom contact and passed bottom obstacles (e. g. stones) easily. The size distribution of fish caught with the SCSG was very similar to that caught with the rockhopper. However, the number of hauls performed with the SCSG and with the rockhopper was too small to draw a clear conclusion on catch efficiency. The SCSG is a gear that is easy to rig and handle on deck, it does not require accurate adjustments, it has few control points and low weight, and the results indicate that its performance at sea is at least comparable to the rockhopper gear for given bottom conditions. Further development of the SCSG should emphasise on improving the construction materials used today in oder to reduce the wearing and increase its lifetime. Two full scale tests were carried out in spring and autum 2013 to assess the effect of sweep length on herding of fish during semi-pelagic trawling for cod and haddock. The results showed that sweep length can {{have a significant effect on}} the catches. Fixing the 450 -kg chain weights right in front of the ground gear captured in up to 50 % less cod and up to 60 % haddock (of all sizes) than when the chain weights were fixed 45 m in front of the ground gear. These results demonstrate that at least under the conditions encountered in these trials, the sweeps have a major role on the fish herding process of the gear. The state estimator model (the core of of the Roll Royce Marine's e-Trawling system) was compared with data from small scale tests in SINTEF's test tank in Hirtshals, Denmark, carried out in July 2013. The results showed that the model apparently works well. The state estimator model is currently being validated against acoustic sensor data from full scale trials with semi-pelagic trawling carried out in November 2013. A concept for remote control of existing trawl doors, which is based on manipulating the moment Balance of the trawl doors, has been designed by SINTEF. This is achieved using control lines between points on the trawl door and external lines (warps or bridles). By tensioning such lines, the orientation of the trawl door is controlled, which again is used to control the hydrodynamic forces created by the trawl door. The energy consumption of this concept is greatly reduced by changing the rigging of the trawl door to reduce its stability. A pair of 0. 6 m 2 Injector XF 9 semi-pelagic doors are currently being instrumeted with actuator and will be tested in Hirtshals' flume tank in early 2014. Semi-pelagic shrimp trawling showed approx. 6 - 8 % lower fuel consumption than bottom shrimp trawling. The 2. 5 m 2 semi-pelagic doors tested during our trials were overdimensioned for the coastal trawler "Gullholmen", and they had to be set at the lowest angle of attack to reduce spreading force and match that of the bottom trawl doors normally used by the vessel. A set of smaller doors (approx. 2 m 2) would had been a better choice to achieve the spreading force necessary for a 1500 # shrimp trawl. This would have reduced the fuel consumption even more. Shrimp catches were too low (15 – 45 kg/hour) and very variable from haul to haul to draw any conclusion on the fishing efficiency of the gear with the different sets of doors. Further experiments with coastal shrimp trawlers are planned for winter 2014...|$|R
40|$|Calibration {{of extreme}} {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) instruments utilized in space missions {{is essential in}} order to determine detector properties and optimize their design. Under the supervision of Professor Yoshikawa, this study has looked into Resistive Anode Encoders (RAE). Part of the thesis study the RAE readout mechanism and the role of RAE shape, readout technique, electrode position, sheet resistivity and intrinsic capacitance and its effect on detector positional resolution and image distortion. The goal of the study is to increase knowledge of Micro channel plate (MCP) and RAE based detectors {{so that it can be}} applied in primarily the development of the PHEBUS and EXCEED detectors and also in future EUV detectors developed at the University of Tokyo. A general conclusion that RAE of Professor C. W <b>Gear's</b> <b>circular</b> arced terminated design utilizing charge ratio as readout technique is favourable from both resolution and distortion perspectives is made. In order to determine the distortion the RAE and MCP assemblies has been irradiated by a deuterium source through a fixed grating. The Gear anode is found to have an ideally linear position response over the majority of the anode area and shows small signs of positive radial distortion, known as barrel distortion. When designed as a rectangle the effective area of the detector diminishes and the barrel distortion increases. The report also includes a study on determination of correct pulse shape amplifier time constants for optimized operational resolution. A conclusion is drawn, that RAE resistivity and intrinsic capacitance governs the charge diffusion speed through the anode resistive layer and the correct choice of shaper time constant to match the charge diffusion speed, as well as frequency of incoming particles are the key elements in a high resolution distortion free RAE based detector. The study includes a series of experiments on RAE charge diffusion and charge injection techniques. The reason for previously unknown RAE charge leakage is explained and has through experiments with probe injected charge been identified to be an error in charge injection technique rather than an error in the anode itself. Theory on correct probe injection is presented stating that injection of charge should be done with a probe with minimized probe tip area. This result shows that injection of charge through a probe tip is not suitable for resistive anode surfaces due to their mechanically brittle nature. Further research into electron gun injection of charge is suggested as an alternative. Measurements of overall detector capacitance have been made utilizing a number of electronic circuits. A Schering bridge is proved to be partially successful and a AVR based timing circuit is shown to be superior in measurement accuracy. The capacitances between the different MCP stages and towards ground is found to be in the range of 30 pF - 150 pF which fit previous calculations made by Dr. Kazuo Yoshioka.
