Long migratory periods, gestations, and time gaps between <b>calves</b> <b>results</b> in slow-growing right whale populations. A brief change in food availability can affect right whale populations for years after. Females must have access to plenty of food to successfully make it through pregnancy and produce enough milk to rear a calf. To illustrate the species’ sensitivity to food availability, in 1998 zooplankton populations dropped dramatically following a climate shift. Even though zooplankton abundance began to rise again in 1999, right whales have such a long reproduction and migratory cycle that the population was greatly affected by the minimal food availability from the year before. In 1999, only one right whale calf was born, compared to the 21 that were born in 1996, before the climate shift. In 2001, after the zooplankton populations greatly recovered, 30 calves were born.|$|R

Calves fed deficient diets for 127 - 137 days had sublethal damage characterized histologically by sarcoplasmic accumulation of lipopigment granules; ultrastructurally, these granules corresponded to cytolysosomes that had a heterogeneous ultrastructure. Alterations in necrotic cells included mitochondrial mineralization, sarcoplasmic condensation, and plasmalemmal fragmentation.

Beginning 21 d before expected parturition, cows were fed either a control diet or a diet containing glycerol (5 % of DM). After parturition, cows were assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 (dietary glycerol; 3. 3 % of DM) X 2 (glycerol drench; 500 ml/d for 5 d beginning at parturition) factorial arrangement. From d 22 through 63 of lactation, cows were fed the same diet. Feeding glycerol during the prepartum period increased prepartum DMI, but feeding glycerol during the postpartum period tended to decrease postpartum DMI and drenching glycerol for the first 5 d of lactation decreased postpartum DMI. Milk yield was not affected by feeding glycerol during either the prepartum or postpartum periods or drenching glycerol during the first 5 d of lactation. Percentages and yields of milk fat and true protein were not affected by feeding glycerol during either the prepartum or postpartum periods; however, drenching glycerol tended to decrease milk protein content and decreased milk lactose content. Glycerol fed during the prepartum period resulted in no significant effects on plasma glucose, NEFA or BHBA concentrations during the prepartum period with no carry over effects on postpartum metabolites. Prepartum incorporation of glycerol in the diet resulted in no significant effects in liver triglycerides or glycogen content in liver samples collected d 1 after calving compared with control cows with no carry over effects on postpartum liver triglycerides or glycogen content. Postpartum incorporation of glycerol in the diet resulted in no significant effects on postpartum liver composition. Short term (5 -d) oral drenching of glycerol beginning at <b>calving</b> <b>resulted</b> in no significant effects on liver composition (d 10 and 21 postpartum) or on plasma glucose and NEFA.

Overall, incorporation of glycerol in to the diets of transition cows or the short-term oral drench of glycerol at <b>calving</b> <b>resulted</b> in few positive performance responses and only modest effects on metabolic variables studied.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of rearing calves by restricted suckling (RS) compared to artificial rearing (AR) in dual purpose and dairy breed cattle in Mexico, milked once or three times a day, respectively. The following parameters were recorded during the first eight weeks after calving: social, abnormal and general behaviours and weight gain of Zebu crossbred and dairy calves; and milk yield, milk composition and udder health in the Zebu crossbred dams and udder health and milk let-down in the Holstein dams. RS reduced the abnormal behaviours of the <b>calves</b> and <b>resulted</b> in less foraging behaviours compared to AR. AR dairy calves consumed four-fold as much concentrate as RS dairy calves, whereas the amount of milk ingested was similar in the two treatments. A higher fat content in the milk ingested by RS calves compared to whole milk fed to AR <b>calves,</b> <b>resulted</b> in similar total ME intake from milk and concentrate in both treatments. Irrespective of type of animals RS resulted in similar weight gain in comparison to AR. Cow-calf separation five days after calving induced fewer indications of physiological stress in RS cows and calves. RS further increased the saleable and total (saleable and suckled) milk yield and decreased the fat content in saleable milk. RS improved udder health of the Zebu crossbred cows as judged according to elevated CMT scores and lower lactose content in AR cows. RS of Holstein dairy cows did not impair milk let-down and udder health tended to be improved according to the CMT. RS calves showed a front teat preference, which did not impair udder health according to similar CMT scores of front and rear teats.

40|$|Wild {{reindeer}} in Norway {{are found}} in 26 separate management areas. Predators are virtually absent from all areas and hunting {{is the most important}} factor determining population development through alterations of herd size and structure. Average population density (animals/km 2) after hunt was 1. 96 in Hardangervidda, 1. 18 in North Rondane and between 0. 78 and 0. 87 in Rondane South, Sn&oslash;hetta, North Ottadalen and Forelhogna. Body size and female pregnancy rates followed a reverse trend. Average net increase of the herds varied from 42. 2 &plusmn; 10. 0 % in Forelhogna to 18. 8 &plusmn; 8. 0 % in Rondane North. In areas with animals in prime physical condition a high versus a low average harvest rate of <b>calves</b> <b>resulted</b> in a similar number of animals harvested, but a lower total yield of meat and revenue from hunting licences. At a winter population density of 0. 8 - 2. 0 animals/km 2 annual harvest (per km 2) of wild reindeer amounts to 0. 23 - 0. 51 animals, 9 - 18 kg meat and 286 - 850 NKr from sale of hunting licences. There was a significant relationship between body size expressed as carcass weights or mandible length and harvest success...|$|R
