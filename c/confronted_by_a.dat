The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E

This force he divided, sending Preneuse and a corvette to patrol the Mozambique Channel.

The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort's, surrounding them. With Montfort <b>confronted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> force twice the size of his own, on unfavourable ground, the battle rapidly turned into a massacre.|$|E
