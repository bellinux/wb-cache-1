5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match {{the lay of the}} river bed. The differences however <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to the repeated use of differently-sized falsework structures {{in the construction of the}} barrel vaults (see animation below).|$|E
5|$|Stowe's house, {{which was}} {{located on the}} bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats {{shuffling}} tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains <b>could</b> <b>point</b> out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.|$|E
25|$|After the Ottoman Army had {{evacuated}} Jerusalem, {{the city}} was occupied on 9 December 1917.

25|$|Aristotle <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to {{the falling}} stone, rising flames, or pouring water to {{illustrate}} his theory. His laws of motion emphasized the common observation that friction was an omnipresent phenomenon – that any body in motion would, unless acted upon, come to rest. He also proposed that heavier objects fall faster, and that voids were impossible.|$|E
25|$|So instead Lawrence {{proposed}} {{if possible}} never meeting the enemy, thus giving their soldiers nothing to shoot at, {{unable to control}} anything except what ground their rifles <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to. Meanwhile, Lawrence and the Arabs could ride camels {{into and out of}} the desert, attacking railroad lines and isolated outposts with impunity, avoiding the heavily garrisoned positions and cities.|$|E

25|$|Sigüenza {{left his}} library and {{scientific}} instruments to the Jesuit Colegio Máximo de San Pedro y San Pablo in Mexico City. He was buried at the chapel of this Colegio, which <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to his having been reconciled with the Order. He also left {{a number of}} unpublished manuscripts, only fragments of which survived the expulsion of the Society of Jesus from the viceroyalty in 1767.|$|E
25|$|Barbara {{returned}} to Kwajalein to help Ted (then age 20) and Mikami sail the Phoenix back to Honolulu, a trip of 60 days (August 15-October 14) against the wind, while Earle was being tried and convicted for entering the off-limits zone. When Earle's conviction was overturned on appeal, the family sailed back to Hiroshima and Nick Mikami {{became the first}} Japanese yachtsman to sail around the world. The Phoenix was declared a Japanese national shrine, and city buses were re-routed past its dock so bus conductors <b>could</b> <b>point</b> it out to passengers.|$|E
25|$|Coriander {{seems to}} have been {{cultivated}} in Greece since at least the second millennium BC. One of the Linear B tablets recovered from Pylos refers to the species as being cultivated for the manufacture of perfumes, it apparently was used in two forms: as a spice for its seeds and as a herb for the flavour of its leaves. This appears to be confirmed by archaeological evidence from the same period; the large quantities of the species retrieved from an Early Bronze Age layer at Sitagroi in Macedonia <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to cultivation of the species at that time.|$|E

25|$|In 1974 George Smiley, the {{new chief}} of the secret {{intelligence}} service referred to as The Circus, continues to investigate his spy service {{in the aftermath of}} his exposure of Bill Haydon as Gerald the mole. Attempting to follow the trail of Karla, the Moscow Centre spymaster and to protect his politically-weakened spy service, Smiley launches an offensive against the Soviets. He and analysts Connie Sachs and Doc di Salis look into investigations unreasonably suppressed by the outed mole. They discover that Sam Collins's investigation of a money laundering operation in Laos <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to involvement by Karla.|$|E
25|$|Speaking of {{the other}} {{extended}} narratives, it is certainly possible that some could {{have been written by}} the condemned themselves as stated by the Accounts. They provided an account of the crimes committed as single episodes without exterior framework of life or work that might place them in a casual order and {{with a great deal of}} details about every crime. Cant language (or Cant tongue) was often employed; born in spoken speech, it was a language used by criminals for the purpose of concealment and mutual recognition. Its presence makes it likely that whoever composed the narratives wrote them in close association with the criminal. The enjoyment in exposing techniques and in explaining particular types of thieving and the way in which the repenting tone that appears everywhere else in the Accounts is minimised are other characteristics which <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to a different author than the Ordinary. Where there are exaggeration, errors and embellishments we could attribute them to the bluster or self-deception of men speaking their last words before their execution.|$|E
25|$|On {{assessing}} Greenwichs strength, the frigate kept {{close to}} the squadron, which then came up and attacked, action commencing at 9 a.m. when Diadème opened fire. For the next twelve hours Greenwich was constantly engaged with one or other of the French ships. Roddam still hoped to carry his plan of capturing one of them into execution, and assembled his men {{in an attempt to}} board the 64-gun Éveillé, but several of her consorts bore up and opened fire, damaging Greenwichs rigging and leaving her unmanageable. Roddam gathered his officers together, and told them that though they had no hope of winning against such a superior force, if any man <b>could</b> <b>point</b> out the admiral's flagship, he hoped to engage her and fight on for another hour or two. His officers, among whom was Lieutenant James Wallace, pledged to follow their captain, but pointed out that they had done all in their power to defend their ship. At 9.30 p.m., Roddam agreed to surrender his ship, as further resistance would only cause further casualties among his men.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1949, the {{movement}} {{spread to the}} new province of Newfoundland where six active squadrons, all supported by strong civilian committees, were in operation {{only a few weeks}} after Confederation. A year later, the need for an increase in the maximum establishment was recognized by the Government and the ceiling was raised to 22,500 cadets. As the League paused to observe its Tenth Anniversary in 1951, it <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to a fine record of service to Canada. Some 65,000 boys had worn the Air Cadet uniform and participated in the training program. In 1961, as the League celebrated its coming of age, more than 150,000 Air Cadets had received training in the squadrons now numbering 332. If all the cadets who had received Air Cadet training to that time could have been paraded at one time in column of route, the parade would have stretched for a distance of 35 miles. In view of a strong demand for new units at the time and to provide for gradual expansion, authority was granted in 1972 for an increase by stages to the present entitlement of 28,000 Air Cadets.|$|E
25|$|There {{remained}} the struggle in Catalonia. At no {{stage in the}} war had there been a unanimous or even majority support for Archduke Charles (Charles III) in the principality, but {{the existence of a}} rebel group inside the province, together with a superior Allied military and naval presence in Barcelona, forced many towns to decide – often reluctantly – for the Archduke's cause. Nevertheless, those who wished to continue fighting <b>could</b> <b>point</b> {{to the fact that the}} Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, as well as those in Castile, were subject to a regime that had forced them to change their laws and historic constitutions, and at no stage since his victory at Almansa and the subsequent abolition of the fueros in Aragon and Valencia in 1707, had Philip V shown any intention of respecting Catalonia's privileges. In consequence, Barcelona decided to resist, but there would be no Allied help. After the peace agreements between the major powers neither Austria nor Great Britain could return to a war footing. To compound the issue, Tory diplomatic efforts with Philip V to secure Catalan liberties were half-hearted, and Bolingbroke made no protest when, in early July 1714 – after a year of guerilla warfare in the region – Berwick returned to Catalonia to formally besiege Barcelona. Antoni de Villarroel put up a stout defence of the city, but with little hope of relief the Catalan capital surrendered on 11 September. Cardona soon followed. Majorca held out for nine months until its surrender in July 1715.|$|E
25|$|While some {{commentators}} {{have seen the}} party lose focus {{with the rise of}} SAP neoliberal study groups, the Swedish Social Democratic Party has for many years appealed to Swedes as innovative, capable, and worthy of running the state. The Social Democrats {{became one of the most}} successful political parties in the world, with some structural advantages in addition to their auspicious birth within vibrant folkrörelser. At the close of the nineteenth century, liberals and socialists had to band together to augment establishment democracy, which was at that point embarrassingly behind in Sweden; they <b>could</b> <b>point</b> to formal democratic advances elsewhere to motivate political action. In addition to being small, Sweden was a semi-peripheral country at the beginning of the twentieth century, considered unimportant to competing global political factions; so it was permitted more independence, while soon the existence of communist and capitalist superpowers allowed social democracy to flourish in the geo-political interstices. The SAP has the resource of sharing ideas and experiences, and working with its sister parties throughout the Nordic countries. Sweden could also borrow and innovate upon ideas from English-language economists, which was an advantage for the Social Democrats in the Great Depression; but more advantageous for the bourgeois parties in the 1980s and afterward. While the SAP has not been innocent of repressing communists, the party has overall benefitted, in government coalition and in avoiding severe stagnation and drift, by engaging in relatively constructive relationships with the more radical Left Party and the Green Party. The early SAP had internal resources as well, in creative politicians with brilliant tactical minds, and similarly creative labor economists at their disposal.|$|E

25|$|Partisanship, {{more than}} any other factor, appears to be the divider in the {{controversy}} surrounding Garcia Moreno’s legacy. Liberal opposition did and does continue to portray him as a tyrant by emphasizing the more authoritarian policies of his regime. Under Garcia Moreno’s presidency, his beliefs and goals alone directed government policies, an easily undermined structure for a stable government, and the legislature often was reduced to a rubber stamping body. Even when confronted with evidence of the good which was done under his presidency, most opponents then and now still would likely argue that the end does not justify the means, and further point out the morally ambiguous ways in which Garcia Moreno retained control: a secret police, the installation of political puppets, etc. In more modern times, particularly in modern republics, another complaint would be voiced as well, that being the establishment of a state religion, instead championing the individual's right to religious liberty. In Garcia Moreno’s defense, as conservative supporters point out, however, there are three factors which lessen this criticism. First, Garcia Moreno, unlike many rulers throughout history, made this move not for the sake of power, but rather in order to build a new moral identity for the nation; second, he believed, based on a career of watching warfare within Ecuador, that only a shared spiritual identity of Latin American-style Catholicism could bring peace to a land ravaged by strife between Liberals and Conservatives as well as former Spanish socioracial classes, and in many ways it worked during his regime; third, Article 10, the section of the 1869 constitution which restricted religious practice to Catholicism was, strictly speaking, a comparative continuity with the past, even though it is morally questionable, for Ecuador already was overwhelmingly Catholic {{with the exception of a}} Jewish minority and foreign Protestants living in the land. (Nevertheless, the liberal objector still <b>could</b> <b>point</b> out the ends do not justify the means and that Garcia Moreno simply could have appealed to the history of Ecuador, as separated from other former colonies in South America, for this goal.) Furthermore, the 1869 constitution also assured citizens’ right to innocence until proven guilty, prohibited arrests without warrants, and ensured the people’s rights to free speech and assembly (though one may question how well this was carried out), so long as it respected religion, morality and decency.|$|E
500|$|A royal banner {{was used}} {{as early as the}} reign of Boleslaus the Generous (r.1076-1079). The {{earliest}} mention of a banner ( [...] , pronounced [...] ) bearing the sign of an eagle is found in Wincenty Kadłubek's Chronicle which says that Duke Casimir the Just fought the Ruthenians in 1182 [...] "under the sign of the victorious eagle". A seal of Duke Premislaus II from 1290 shows the ruler holding a banner emblazoned with a crowned eagle. Five years later, Premislaus was crowned King of Poland, and he made the crowned White Eagle a national coat of arms. During the reign of King Ladislaus the Elbow-High (r.1320–1333), the red cloth with the White Eagle was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland (Polish: chorągiew Królestwa Polskiego). The orientation of the eagle on the banner varied; its head <b>could</b> <b>point</b> either upwards or towards the hoist. The actual rendering of the eagle changed with time according to new artistic styles.|$|E
500|$|On the Blond Ambition World Tour, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] {{follows the}} opening number [...] "Express Yourself".

She wore a double breasted suit with the outer jacket cut in slits so that the conical bra underneath <b>could</b> <b>point</b> through. Showing off the satin pink bodysuit and her monocle chain, Madonna performed the song on a chair. Playing a dominatrix role, Madonna got {{on top of one}} of the dancers before carrying off an exhibitionist dance routine with the chair as a prop. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
