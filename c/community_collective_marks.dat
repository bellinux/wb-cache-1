Intellectual property rights, particularly if owned collectively, accelerate cluster creation, an organizational form particularly beneficial for tourism. The positive externalities associated with clusters can be reinforced through the assignment of <b>collective</b> <b>marks.</b> A region’s intangible assets, its social cohesion, can be fostered through the introduction of <b>collective</b> <b>marks,</b> since it is an intellectual property rights that can be owned collectively by a given community.

40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>marks</b> {{guarantee}} ownership over a community’s intangible {{wealth and}} in this sense not only reinforce its branding activities, but {{set up a new}} structure in which community business can function. Systems of local innovation may thus be developed through the design of an adequate legal infrastructure, paving the way for the solution of policy concerns, such as rural exodus or unemployment. Cluster theory argues that, if small and medium sized enterprises intensify their degree of interaction to build up networks, this reduces costs, dependence on large firms, provides access to new markets and helps improve the position of the cluster in the market. All these functions can be reinforced through <b>collective</b> <b>marks,</b> which offer a legal context for the cluster’s governance structure, its standards and quality controls and system of collaboration. These features are particularly of relevance in a sector like tourism, where cooperation is a prerequisite for success. Empirical evidence suggests a certain sense of confusion on the role of trade mark protection in clusters: Individual marks are used as if they were <b>collective</b> <b>marks,</b> <b>collective</b> <b>marks</b> are used without further consideration of the economic aspects or intellectual property protection is altogether ignored. In practice the wide range of opportunities provided by collective trademarks remains unexploited. Interdisciplinary approaches to IP may help to bridge a gap, observed both within academia and in practice, and thus join the IP law perspective to the evolving management literature on cluster theory. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. There is a lacuna in the {{literature}} regarding the measurement of <b>community</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy, especially in an African context. Previously, a variety of studies have used and validated self-efficacy measures in Western social contexts (Chen, Gully & Eden, 2001; Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1993; Carroll, Rosson & Zhou, 2005). Findings from cross-cultural psychology indicate that human behaviour is not acontextual (Devonport & Lane, 2006; Karademas, 2006; van de Vijver & Leung, 1997). Thus, this study was an attempt to explore the validation of a <b>community</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy scale in an African cultural context. A sample of 1050 Setswana-speaking participants was drawn from both urban and rural areas. The participants came from a relatively more collectivistic cultural context. Measuring instruments such as the <b>Community</b> <b>Collective</b> Efficacy Scale (Carroll, Rosson & Zhou, 2005), the Generalised Self-Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1993), the New General Self-Efficacy Scale (Chen, Gully & Eden, 2001), the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC- 29) (Antonovsky, 1987, 1993) the Affectometer 2 (short version) (AFM) (Kammann & Flett, 1983), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Griffin, 1985) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 28) (Goldberg & Hillier, 1979) were used in this study. Criterion-related validity of the CCES was established. Construct validity was determined by conducting confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses on the <b>community</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy scale. Results indicated a Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of 0. 72 for the CCES and an acceptable inter-item correlations. Criterion-related validity was satisfactory. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit and exploratory factor analysis yielded only one factor on the items used. The results of the study indicated that overall, the CCES may be a valid measure of <b>community</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy in the sample selected for the study based on parameter estimates. Future studies should further validate this instrument cross-culturally in various African groups and contexts. Master...|$|R

We examined the association of <b>community</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy with depressive symptom severity in Florida public health workers (n = 2249) exposed to the 2004 hurricane season using a multilevel approach. Cross-sectional anonymous questionnaires were distributed electronically to all Florida Department of Health (FDOH) personnel that assessed depressive symptom severity and collective efficacy nine months after the 2004 hurricane season. Analyses were conducted at the individual level and community level using zip codes. The majority of participants were female (81. 9 %), and ages ranged from 20 to 78 years (median = 49 years). The majority of participants (73. 4 %) were European American, 12. 7 % were African American, and 9. 2 % were Hispanic. Using multilevel analysis, our data indicate that higher community-level and individual-level collective efficacy were associated with significantly lower depressive symptom severity (b = - 0. 09 [95 % CI: - 0. 13, - 0. 04] and b = - 0. 09 [95 % CI: - 0. 12, - 0. 06], respectively) even after adjusting for individual sociodemographic variables, community socioeconomic characteristics, individual injury/damage, and community storm damage.
