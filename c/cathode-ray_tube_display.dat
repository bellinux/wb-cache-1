500|$|While the Su-27M design had the {{avionics}} to {{give the}} aircraft the nominal designation as a multi-role fighter, flight tests with the Russian Air Force revealed difficulties in efficiently deploying the aircraft's armament. According to Aviation Week & Space Technology, air force pilots described weapons trials with the aircraft in Akhtubinsk and Lipetsk as a [...] "negative experience", with a particular emphasis on {{the layout of the}} cockpit and its adverse impact on the workload of the single pilot. Designers, test pilots and avionics software specialists therefore worked together to redesign the cockpit and its attendant systems and improve the human-machine interface. The information management system of aircraft's avionics suite had been changed so that it now has two digital computers which process information from the flight- and weapons-control systems. The information is then displayed on two [...] multi-function liquid crystal displays, which replaced the smaller multi-function <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays</b> found on the Su-27M.

As a result of airline input, the 747-400's new digital cockpit design featured a hybrid of the <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) <b>display</b> technologies first employed on the 757 and 767, along with carry-over 747 systems such as its autopilot.|$|R
40|$|Liquid cryistal {{displays}} (LCDs) {{have been}} widely used in visual display unit work. These LCDs maintain superior visibilituy nder a higher diffuse surface reflectance compared with <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays.</b> Specular (mirror-like) reflection on LCDs, however, can cause disturbed visibility and the resultant visual fatigue. The present experiment was designed to investigate whether visual fatigue consequent to the specular reflection on LCDs could be reduced by anti-reflective-glare filetering. Visual fatigue was compared between three experimental conditions, one with specular reflection and two with the use of different anti-reflective-glare filters (multicoating type and matprocessing type), under a within-subject experimental design. Each of twenty subjects performed a visuals earch task consisting of three sessions of 25 min each followed by a rest period of 25 min. Grating acuity, dark-focus accommodation, and replies to a visual fatigue questionnaire were studied {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, after each session and after the rest period. The results of the visual fatigue questionnaire showed no significant differences between the three experimental conditions. However, the use of anti-reflective-glare filtering of multicoating type induced significantly better visual search performance and visual acuity. The use of mat-processing type filtering showed less influence on dark-focus accommodation. These results suggest that the prevention of specular reflection on LCDs may lead to the possibility of reduced visual fatigue...|$|R

The offset, matrix, and tone-response correction model commonly employed for CRT color calibration is also suitable for color calibration of LCDs for most applications, though the calibration error for LCDs is higher.

40|$|Abstract. The {{accuracy}} of color appearance of displayed image on a {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD) is the fundamental to guarantee good results in the soft proofing and cross-media color reproduction. Since the color rendering mechanism of LCDs is different from <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) <b>displays,</b> the traditional color calibration method cannot turn a very good result. In this paper, a LCD color calibration model based on gamut-division algorithm is proposed using spline method through the analysis of its color rendering mechanism. The monitor 3 D gamut is firstly divided along the axis of L * in CIELAB color space according to the hue angle, and then an optimal color calibration matrix of the sub-gamut is computed with mathematical method. The experimental {{results show that the}} average color difference, the maximum color difference and hue shift are reduced compared with the traditional method...|$|R

At {{the end of each}} line the beam returns {{to the start of the}} next line; the end of the last line is a link that returns to the top of the screen. As it passes each point the intensity of the beam is varied, varying the luminance of that point.

40|$|A new {{eavesdropping}} technique {{can be used}} to read <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) <b>displays</b> at a distance. The {{intensity of}} the light emitted by a raster-scan screen as a function of time corresponds to the video signal convolved with the impulse response of the phosphors. Experiments with a typical personal computer color monitor show that enough high-frequency content remains in the emitted light to permit the reconstruction of readable text by deconvolving the signal received with a fast photosensor. These optical compromising emanations can be received even after diffuse reflection from a wall. Shot noise from background light is the critical performance factor. In a sufficiently dark environment and with a large enough sensor aperture, practically significant reception distances are possible. This information security risk should be considered in applications with high confidentiality requirements, especially in those that already require "TEMPEST"-shielded equipment designed to minimize radio-frequency emission-security concerns...|$|R

40|$|Stereoscopic {{visualization}} systems {{based on}} liquid crystal shutter (LCS) eyewear and <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) <b>displays</b> provide today the best {{overall quality of}} 3 -D images and therefore have a dominant position in commercial as well as professional markets. Due to the CRT and LCS characteristics, however, such systems suffer from perceptual crosstalk ("shadows") at object boundaries that can reduce, and at times inhibit, the ability to perceive depth. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce such crosstalk. We present a simple model for intensity leak, we assess model parameters for a time-sequential LCS/CRT system and we propose a computationally-efficient algorithm to eliminate the crosstalk. Since the full crosstalk elimination implies an unacceptable image degradation (reduction of contrast), we study the trade-off between crosstalk elimination and image contrast. We describe experiments on synthetic and natural stereoscopic images and we discuss informal subjective viewing of pr [...] ...|$|R

The CRT used was a low-cost entertainment-quality television tube, and hence had a very poor deflection band width. Settling time for the CRT system was about 10 microseconds. A technique was developed and made operational which displayed a whole dot-matrix character in a time which was less than one settling time of the display system. It is an application of the existing technique called sinusoidal scan to the display of dot-matrix characters. A data compression technique was also invented and implemented. It allows up to a 75 percent reduction {{in the size of}} the stored character tables which are normally associated with dot-matrix displays. The technique involves a digital algorithm which fills in dots between given dots in a matrix.

The attributes investigated were image color and image polarity of a CRT display. Employing a between-subjects design, five image colors and two polarities were presented during a simulated word processing task. A control group was incorporated into the design by replacing the CRT display with a similar hard copy display. The dependent variables were CRT reading rate, hard copy scanning rate, and CRT scanning rate. Subjective evaluations and paired-comparison preference scores were also collected. The results indicated that reading performance was best when subjects read white text on the CRT. Additionally, it was determined that the CRT itself may have a deleterious effect on hard copy scanning performance. Another interesting finding was that paired comparison results indicated a high preference for a positive green display; yet, reading rate was the slowest for this same display. Finally, shortcomings of the present study are discussed along with suggestions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{output of}} image coding and {{rendering}} algorithms are presented on a {{diverse array of}} display devices. To evaluate these algorithms, image quality metrics should include {{more information about the}} spatial and chromatic properties of displays. To understand how to best incorporate such display information, we need a computational and empirical framework to characterize displays. Here we describe a set of principles and an integrated suite of software tools that provide such a framework. The Display Simulation Toolbox (DST) is an integrated suite of software tools that help the user characterize the key properties of display devices and predict the radiance of displayed images. Assuming that pixel emissions are independent, the DST uses the sub-pixel point spread functions, spectral power distributions, and gamma curves to calculate display image radiance. We tested the assumption of pixel independence for two liquid crystal device (LCD) <b>displays</b> and two <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) <b>displays.</b> For the LCD displays, the independence assumption is reasonably accurate. For the CRT displays it is not. The simulations and measurements agree well for displays that meet the model assumptions and provide information {{about the nature of the}} failures for displays that do not meet these assumptions.

40|$|The {{perceived}} quality {{of an image}} displayed on a computer monitor depends {{on a number of}} different factors that can affect viewers' preferences. Two of these are the luminance of the monitor display and the resolution of the image. The effect of luminance is of interest for applications such as on-line access of images where the computer displays used for viewing these images could have different luminance settings. A relationship between <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) <b>display</b> luminance and resolution has been shown in previous studies. It was therefore interesting to investigate whether there is a relationship between image resolution and CRT display luminance on perceived image quality. Image resolution is related to the image file size, which is an important factor for applications such as on-line access of images. This work used a CRT display to study the effect of the above-mentioned factors on the {{perceived quality}} of the displayed image. Three sets of black-and-white images, each set with a different resolution, were presented to observers at three brightness settings of the computer monitor. Results are discussed regarding the effect of monitor display luminance and image resolution on perceived image quality and the interaction between them. Evaluation of results is further extended to the influence of the different backgrounds of the images. The scene content of the images was also shown to affect the viewers' judgement...|$|R
40|$|Field-emission cathodes {{containing}} {{arrays of}} carbon nanotubes coated with diamond or diamondlike carbon (DLC) are undergoing development. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes {{have been shown}} to perform well as electron field emitters. The idea underlying the present development is that by coating carbon nanotubes with wideband- gap materials like diamond or DLC, one could reduce effective work functions, thereby reducing threshold electric-field levels for field emission of electrons and, hence, improving cathode performance. To demonstrate feasibility, experimental cathodes were fabricated by (1) covering metal bases with carbon nanotubes bound to the bases by an electrically conductive binder and (2) coating the nanotubes, variously, with diamond or DLC by plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. In tests, the threshold electric-field levels for emission of electrons were reduced by as much as 40 percent, relative to those of uncoated- nanotube cathodes. Coating with diamond or DLC could also make field emission-cathodes operate more stably by helping to prevent evaporation of carbon from nanotubes in the event of overheating of the cathodes. Cathodes of this type are expected to be useful principally as electron sources for <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> and flat-panel <b>displays...</b>|$|R
