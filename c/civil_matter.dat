25|$|Many anti-slavery Virginians {{moved to}} Kentucky as well, making {{the new state}} a battleground over slavery. Churches and friends divided {{over the issue of}} the immorality of slaveholding; in Kentucky the antislavery {{position}} was marginalized both politically and geographically. Emancipationist Baptists created their own churches in Kentucky around antislavery principles. While emancipationists viewed their cause as one with republican ideals of virtue, the proslavery Baptists insisted there was a boundary between church and state; this allowed them to define slavery as a <b>civil</b> <b>matter.</b> The proslavery position, based on the importance of slave labor on many plantations, became the dominant Baptist belief in Kentucky. Emancipationist leadership declined through death and emigration, and Baptists in the Upper South healed rifts in their churches and associations.|$|E
500|$|The {{common law}} {{generally}} treated damage to another's chattels as a <b>civil</b> <b>matter</b> leading {{only to a}} right to damages in trespass or nuisance; in the 18th century, Blackstone stated: [...] "The rights of personal property in possession are liable to two species of injuries: the amotion [...] or deprivation of that possession; and the abuse or damage of the chattels, while the possession continues in the legal owner." [...] Blackstone clearly labelled these as [...] "Private Wrongs" [...] in his commentaries, emphasising that property rights were enforced inter partes, and that the State was not necessarily one of the involved parties. In fact, the criminal law only intervened {{in the case of}} arson, defining it as [...] "the malicious and wilful burning of the house or outhouses of another man". This protection extended to barns and even [...] "stacks of corn". Arson traditionally attracted the death penalty, and had done so in Roman law.|$|E

2500|$|In its {{submission}} to the Burns Inquiry, the League Against Cruel Sports presented evidence of over 1,000 cases of trespass by hunts. These included trespass on railway lines and into private gardens. Trespass can occur as the hounds cannot recognise human-created boundaries {{they are not}} allowed to cross, and may therefore follow their quarry wherever it goes unless successfully called off. [...] However, in the United Kingdom, trespass is a largely <b>civil</b> <b>matter</b> when performed accidentally.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{trial was}} a <b>civil</b> <b>matter</b> arising from an {{accusation}} made on 26 November by Victor de Carnières in his newspaper Colon français, that Abdeljelil Zaouche, a leading {{member of the}} Young Tunisians, had led the riots and paid individuals {{to take part in}} them. On 30 November Zaouche replied in his own newspaper, Le Tunisien, accusing Carnières of defamation. [...] After unsuccessful attempts to have these accusations dealt with by other administrative or judicial means, Zaouche brought a case against him. The case did not come before the court until 26 October 1912, after the criminal trials were over. Carnières' defence was that he was relying on rumours he had picked up from Tunisians. [...] The presiding judge described Zaouche as 'a man of good' and the Attorney General described his actions as worthy only of praise. Nevertheless the court simply dismissed the case on the grounds that anything damaging Carnières had said about Zaouche was only of secondary importance, and that his primary aim had been to defend French interests. The court also ruled that Zaouche should pay the costs of the action, which tended to support the view among colonists that the accusations were well-founded. Exonerated by the court, Carnières continued his attacks on Zaouche and the Young Tunisians in his newspaper. Zaouche pursued the matter at the Court of Appeal in Algiers, where Carnières' standing in the settler community in Tunis counted for less. The Algiers court found in Zaouche's favour and awarded him costs with interest against Carnières, taking into account his bad faith and his intention to defame. [...] However the court also decided, 'considering the circumstances' not to announce its decision in the Tunis newspapers, which meant that it went largely unnoticed.|$|E
6000|$|The Northern {{people also}} {{acknowledged}} {{a kind of}} ghosts, who, when they had obtained possession of a building, or the right of haunting it, did not defend themselves against mortals on the knightly principle of duel, like Assueit, nor were amenable to the prayers of the priest or the spells of the sorcerer, but became tractable when properly convened in a legal process. The Eyrbiggia Saga acquaints us, that the mansion of a respectable landholder in Iceland was, soon after the settlement of that island, exposed to a persecution of this kind. The molestation was produced by the concurrence of certain mystical and spectral phenomena, calculated to introduce such persecution. About the commencement of winter, with that slight exchange of darkness and twilight which constitutes night and day in these latitudes, a contagious disease arose {{in a family of}} consequence and in the neighbourhood, which, sweeping off several members of the family at different times, seemed to threaten them all with death. But the death of these persons was attended with the singular consequence that their spectres were seen to wander in the neighbourhood of the mansion-house, terrifying, and even assaulting, those of the living family who ventured abroad. As the number of the dead members of the devoted household seemed to increase in proportion to that of the survivors, the ghosts took it upon them to enter the house, and produce their aërial forms and wasted physiognomy, even in the stove where the fire was maintained for the general use of the inhabitants, and which, in an Iceland winter, is the only comfortable place of assembling the family. But the remaining inhabitants of the place, terrified by the intrusion of these spectres, chose rather to withdraw to the other extremity of the house, and abandon their warm seats, than to endure the neighbourhood of the phantoms. Complaints were at length made to a pontiff of the god Thor, named Snorro, who exercised considerable influence in the island. By his counsel, the young proprietor of the haunted mansion assembled a jury, or inquest, of his neighbours, constituted in the usual judicial form, as if to judge an ordinary <b>civil</b> <b>matter,</b> and proceeded, in their presence, to cite individually the various phantoms and resemblances of the deceased members of the family, to show by what warrant they disputed with him and his servants the quiet possession of his property, and what defence they could plead for thus interfering with and incommoding the living. The spectres of the dead, by name, and in order as summoned, appeared on their being called, and muttering some regrets at being obliged to abandon their dwelling, departed, or vanished, from the astonished inquest. Judgment then went against the ghosts by default; and the trial by jury, of which we here can trace the origin, obtained a triumph unknown to any of the great writers who have made it the subject of eulogy.[20] ...|$|E
