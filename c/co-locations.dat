40|$|Mining spatial <b>co-location</b> {{patterns}} plays a {{key role}} in spatial data mining. Spatial <b>co-location</b> patterns refer to subsets of features whose objects are frequently located in close geographic proximity. Due to spatial heterogeneity, spatial <b>co-location</b> patterns are usually not the same across geographic space. However, existing methods are mainly designed to discover global spatial <b>co-location</b> patterns, and not suitable for detecting regional spatial <b>co-location</b> patterns. On that account, an adaptive method for mining hierarchical spatial <b>co-location</b> patterns is proposed in this paper. Firstly, global spatial <b>co-location</b> patterns are detected and other non-prevalent <b>co-location</b> patterns are identified as candidate regional <b>co-location</b> patterns. Then, for each candidate pattern, adaptive spatial clustering method is used to delineate localities of that pattern in the study area, and participation ratio is utilized to measure the prevalence of the candidate <b>co-location</b> pattern. Finally, an overlap operation is developed to deduce localities of (k + 1) -size <b>co-location</b> patterns from localities of k -size <b>co-location</b> patterns. Experiments on both simulated and real-life datasets show that the proposed method is effective for detecting hierarchical spatial <b>co-location</b> patterns...|$|R

40|$|Summary: One {{expression}} of partnership between two organizations is {{the sharing of}} office space, often known as <b>co-location.</b> In early 2006, case managers employed by Loddon Mallee Housing Services (LMHS), a community-based organization in the regional city of Bendigo, Australia, co-located with the Bendigo office of Centrelink, the Australian government’s statutory income support agency. This article explores Centrelink and LMHS staff and management expectations of <b>co-location</b> {{as well as the}} reality of <b>co-location</b> as experienced by the staff involved. It is based on interviews conducted with staff and managers before <b>co-location</b> occurred and again six months thereafter. • Findings: <b>Co-location</b> is a powerful strategy for strengthening inter-agency relationships. The Bendigo example of service <b>co-location</b> provides confirmation of the benefits of <b>co-location</b> suggested in previous literature, including greater respect and trust between professionals from different backgrounds and with different status; informal information exchange, learning and sharing; enhanced feelings of teamwork and belonging; improved morale among staff; and enhanced communication, learning and understanding of roles. • Application: This study found that key issues requiring attention by organizations contemplating <b>co-location</b> include building on pre-existing trust and goodwill; thorough planning, taking into account the potential impact of <b>co-location</b> on third parties as well as client and organizational priorities; attending to logistical details, taking particular account of timelines for connection of telephones and internet access; consulting widely and including all relevant stakeholders in decision-making processes; promoting flexible attitudes and openness to change among affected staff; and seeking to acknowledge and contain rather than remove differences in organizational culture and practice.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of data {{gathering}} and analysis, many different domains such as public health, business, transportation, geology and so on are generating large volumes of data. Such large sets of data could contain potentially interesting patterns that can provide useful information to these domains. Many techniques {{in the area of}} data mining have been employed to discover useful patterns. Spatial co-location pattern mining has been popularly studied in spatial data mining area. ^ Spatial co-location patterns represent the subset of spatial events whose instances are frequently located together in nearby geographic space. A common framework for mining spatial co-location patterns employs a level-wised Apriori-like search method to discover <b>co-locations</b> and generates redundant information by searching all 2 l sub-sets of each length l event set. As the number of event types increases, the search space exponentially increases. This adversely increases the computational time of mining for co-location patterns. In this thesis, we propose two problems for mining compact <b>co-locations</b> which concisely represent co-location patterns. The first problem addresses mining for maximal co-located event sets. The second problem addresses top-k closed mining which finds k closed co-located event sets which have higher prevalence values than other closed <b>co-locations.</b> This thesis develops an algorithm for each problem to efficiently search for the compact patterns. The experiment results show that our algorithms are computationally efficient in finding the compact co-location patterns. ...|$|E

Nevertheless, this is a critical step to reveal <b>co-locations</b> between genes and QTL.

40|$|Abstract. In many {{application}} domains, {{occurrences of}} related spatial features may exhibit co-location pattern. For example, some disease {{may be in}} spatial proximity of certain type of pollution. This paper studies the problem of regional <b>co-locations</b> with arbitrary shapes. Regional colocations represent regions in which two spatial features exhibit stronger or weaker co-location than that in other regions. Finding regional colocations of arbitrary shapes is very challenging because: (1) statistical frameworks for mining regional co-location do not exist; and (2) testing all possible arbitrary shaped regions is computational prohibitive even for very small dataset. In this paper, we propose frequentist and Bayesian frameworks for mining regional <b>co-locations</b> and develop a probabilistic expansion heuristic to find arbitrary shaped regions. Experimental results on synthetic and real world data show that both frequentist method and Bayesian statistical approach can recover the region with arbitrary shapes. Our approaches outperform baseline algorithms in terms of F measure. Bayesian statistical approach is approximately three orders of magnitude faster than the frequentist approach. ...|$|E

Methodology: A survey among managers of 128 logistics establishments located in logistics concentration areas was used to test for differences between synergies through <b>co-location</b> on specialized versus diverse logistics parks. Findings: The findings show that logistics firms co-located on fresh logistics parks more often share knowledge, combine transport and storage capacity, and trade products last minute than other co-located logistics firms do.
