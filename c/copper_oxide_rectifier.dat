25|$|Once common until {{replaced}} by more compact and less costly silicon solid-state rectifiers in the 1970s, these units used stacks of oxide-coated metal plates and {{took advantage of}} the semiconductor properties of selenium or <b>copper</b> <b>oxide.</b> While selenium <b>rectifiers</b> were lighter in weight and used less power than comparable vacuum tube rectifiers, they had the disadvantage of finite life expectancy, increasing resistance with age, and were only suitable to use at low frequencies.

5000|$|A {{selenium}} rectifier {{is about the}} same size as <b>copper</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> but much larger than a silicon or germanium diode. Selenium rectifiers have a long but not indefinite service life of 60,000 to 100,000 hours depending on rating and cooling. The rectifier can show some unforming of the rectifier characteristic after long storage. [...] Each cell can withstand a reverse voltage around 25 volts, and has a forward voltage drop around 1 volt, which limits the efficiency at low voltages. Selenium rectifiers have an operating temperature limit of 130 °C, and are not suitable for high-frequency circuits.|$|R

Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced <b>copper</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>rectifiers</b> because they were more efficient.
