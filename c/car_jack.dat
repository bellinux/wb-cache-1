500|$|The extratropical storm complex {{incorporating}} {{the remnants of}} Gonzalo generated strong winds across the British Isles, especially over Ireland and the northern United Kingdom. Winds gusted to [...] at Oban in western Scotland, while gusts exceeding 60mph (100km/h) were common elsewhere. The system halted transportation throughout the region, forcing the cancellation of more than 100flights at London Heathrow Airport, grounding ferries, and blocking roads and railways with debris. Falling trees killed one woman near Hyde Park, London, and injured several others. In Essex, the winds collapsed a <b>car</b> <b>jack</b> supporting a van, fatally crushing a man working underneath. The storm triggered minor power outages in Scotland and Wales, with more extensive outages in northwestern Ireland after gusts as high as 70mph (115km/h).|$|E
