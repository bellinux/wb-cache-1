40|$|Abstract Background The skin is {{important}} in the positioning and playing of a musical instrument. During practicing and performing there is a permanent more or less intense contact between the instrument and the musician's skin. Apart from aggravation of predisposed skin diseases (e. g., atopic eczema or psoriasis) due to music-making, specific dermatologic conditions may develop that are directly caused by playing a musical instrument. Methods To perform a systematic review on instrument-related skin diseases in musicians we searched the PubMed database without time limits. Furthermore we studied the online bibliography "Occupational diseases of performing artist. A performing arts medicine bibliography. October, 2003 " and checked references of all selected articles for relevant papers. Results The most prevalent skin disorders of instrumental musicians, in particular string instrumentalists (e. g., violinists, cellists, guitarists), woodwind players (e. g., flautists, clarinetists), and brass instrumentalists (e. g., trumpeters), include a variety of allergic <b>contact</b> <b>sensitizations</b> (e. g., colophony, nickel, and exotic woods) and irritant (physical-chemical noxae) skin conditions whose clinical presentation and localization are usually specific for the instrument used (e. g., "fiddler's neck", "cellist's chest", "guitar nipple", "flautist's chin"). Apart from common callosities and "occupational marks" (e. g., "Garrod's pads") more or less severe skin injuries may occur in musical instrumentalists, in particular acute and chronic wounds including their complications. Skin infections such as herpes labialis seem to be a more common skin problem in woodwind and brass instrumentalists. Conclusions Skin conditions may be a significant problem not only in professional instrumentalists, but also in musicians of all ages and ability. Although not life threatening they may lead to impaired performance and occupational hazard. Unfortunately, epidemiological investigations have exclusively been performed on orchestra musicians, though the prevalence of instrument-related skin conditions in other musician groups (e. g., jazz and rock musicians) is also of interest. The practicing clinician {{should be aware of the}} special dermatologic problems unique to the musical instrumentalist. Moreover awareness among musicians needs to be raised, as proper technique and conditioning may help to prevent affection of performance and occupational impairment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Previously, {{the contact}} {{allergen}} dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) {{was identified as}} a sensitizer by inhalation in BALB/c mice; in addition, DNCB induced a lymphocytic infiltrate in the larynx of dermally sensitized Th 1 -prone Wistar rats upon a single inhalation challenge. In the present study, repeated inhalation exposures to DNCB were investigated using the same protocol as the single-challenge study: female Wistar rats were dermally sensitized with DNCB and subsequently challenged by inhalation exposure to 7 or 15 mg/m(3) DNCB twice a week for 4 weeks. Allergy-related apnoeic breathing was not observed. DNCB-specific IgG antibodies were found in the serum and [...] predominantly lymphocytic [...] inflammations were found in the nasal tissues and larynx. Similar effects were observed in animals repeatedly exposed by inhalation without previous dermal <b>contact,</b> indicating <b>sensitization</b> by inhalation. The inflammation may be the upper respiratory tract analogue of hypersensitivity pneumonitis/allergic alveolitis. Possible progression of the airway inflammation upon long-term exposure should be investigated to support or dismiss discrimination between contact and respiratory allergens in relation to respiratory allergy.

40|$|Exposure {{to animal}} allergens {{constitutes}} a relevant {{risk factor for}} the development of allergic sensitization. Moreover, an increasing number of people become owners of less common animals. In this article we summarize aspects related to sensitization to cat/dog which may be applied also to uncommon pets or other furry animals. The data discussed here suggest that several different factors may induce allergic sensitization to furry animals with or without previous <b>contact.</b> Allergic <b>sensitization</b> without animal exposure is a relevant risk for patients because they are not aware about the possibility that even severe respiratory symptoms may develop after an occasional animal contact. This aspect should be taken into account by susceptible individuals before acquiring pets or beginning a contact for working/leisure activity with a common as well as uncommon animal. As a consequence, skin prick test and/or evaluation of specific IgE antibodies (by classic ImmunoCAP or micro-array technique ImmunoCAP ISAC) also to less common ("new") mammalian allergens could be recommended in individuals already sensitized to common pets to identify the occurrence of allergic sensitization and consequently to avoid future exposures to uncommon animal allergens...|$|R
40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} {{is one of}} the most frequent dermatological problems affecting 7 % of the general population. Impaired skin barrier function facilitates the penetration of contact allergens and irritants into the epidermal layer and is regarded as an important cofactor promoting the process of allergic <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization.</b> Filaggrin is crucial for the maintenance of the skin barrier function. Loss-of-function mutations within the filaggrin (FLG) gene are associated with skin barrier diseases such as ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic eczema (AE). To assess the impact of FLG on allergic <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> and plausible intermediate traits, the two prevalent FLG mutations R 501 X and 2282 del 4 were typed in 1, 502 individuals of the KORA C population-based cohort with extensive dermatologic phenotyping. Associations of FLG mutations with AE could be replicated. Strong associations were seen with dry skin, palmar hyperlinearity, and keratosis pilaris. In addition, an association with <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> to nickel and <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> to nickel combined with intolerance to fashion jewelry, but not with other contact allergens, was observed. From these data, we conclude that a genetically determined FLG deficiency manifests as dry skin and features of ichthyosis vulgaris. In addition, FLG deficiency may also represent a risk factor for <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> to allergens...|$|E

40|$|Methyl {{methacrylate}} (MMA) is a respiratory irritant and dermal sensitizer {{that has}} been associated with occupational asthma in a small number of case reports. Those reports have raised concern that it might be a respiratory sensitizer. To better understand that possibility, we reviewed the in silico, in chemico, in vitro, and in vivo toxicology literature, and also epidemiologic and occupational medicine reports related to the respiratory effects of MMA. Numerous in silico and in chemico studies indicate that MMA is unlikely to be a respiratory sensitizer. The few in vitro studies suggest that MMA has generally weak effects. In vivo studies have documented <b>contact</b> skin <b>sensitization,</b> nonspecific cytotoxicity, and weakly positive responses on local lymph node assay; guinea pig and mouse inhalation sensitization tests have not been performed. Cohort and cross-sectional worker studies reported irritation of eyes, nose, and upper respiratory tract associated with short-term peaks exposures, but little evidence for respiratory sensitization or asthma. Nineteen case reports described asthma, laryngitis, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis in MMA-exposed workers; however, exposures were either not well described or involved mixtures containing more reactive respiratory sensitizers and irritants. The weight of evidence, both experimental and observational, argues that MMA is not a respiratory sensitizer...|$|R

The sterilized device and its extracts were subjected to the raft of ISO 10993 biocompatibility tests that demonstrated safety with respect to cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, blood <b>contact,</b> irritation, <b>sensitization,</b> systemic toxicity and tissue reaction. Intra-arterial administration was performed in a swine model of hepatic arterial embolization in which 0. 22 – 1  mL of sedimented bead volume was administered to the targeted lobe(s) of the liver. The beads could be visualized during the embolization procedure with fluoroscopy, DSA and single X-ray snapshot imaging modalities. CT imaging was performed before and 1  h after embolization and then again at 7, 14, 30 and 90 days. LC Bead LUMI™ could be clearly visualized in the hepatic arteries with or without administration of IV contrast and appeared more dense than soluble contrast agent. The CT density of the beads did not deteriorate during the 90 day evaluation period. The beads embolized predictably and effectively, resulting in areas devoid of contrast enhancement on CT imaging suggesting ischaemia-induced necrosis nearby the sites of occlusion. Instances of off target embolization were easily detected on imaging and confirmed pathologically.

40|$|Probiotics are {{ingested}} live microbes {{that can}} modify intestinal microbial populations {{in a way}} that benefits the host. The interest in probiotic preventative/therapeutic potential in allergic diseases stemmed from the fact that probiotics have been shown to improve intestinal dysbiosis and permeability and to reduce inflammatory cytokines in human and murine experimental models. Enhanced presence of probiotic bacteria in the intestinal microbiota is found to correlate with protection against allergy. Therefore, many studies have been recently designed to examine the efficacy of probiotics, but the literature on the allergic skin disorders is still very scarce. Here, our objective is to summarize and evaluate the available knowledge from randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials of probiotic use in allergic skin conditions. Clinical improvement especially in IgE-sensitized eczema and experimental models such as atopic dermatitis-like lesions (trinitrochlorobenzene and picryl chloride <b>sensitizations)</b> and allergic <b>contact</b> dermatitis (dinitrofluorobenzene <b>sensitization)</b> has been reported. Although there is a very promising evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics into foods, probiotics do not have a proven role in the prevention or the therapy of allergic skin disorders.

40|$|Background. Contact {{allergy and}} {{sensitization}} are frequent {{in the general}} adult population, but there are few studies on this prevalence among children. To evaluate the frequency of allergic <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> to standard chemical allergens in children and to compare data in children with atopic dermatitis and healthy controls, we performed patch tests with standard chemical allergens. This study {{was the first in}} Lithuania to investigate the prevalence of <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> in children. Materials and Methods. A total of 194 children ranging from 3 to 17 years in age were enrolled in the study. Results. At least 1 positive reaction was observed in 15 % in the control group and 55 % in the atopic dermatitis group. The most prevalent allergens in atopic dermatitis and healthy groups were: nickel sulfate (18. 2 % and 10 %, respectively), cobalt chloride (13. 8 % and 4 %), chromium (12. 8 % and 9 %), fragrance mix (11. 8 % and 3 %), wool alcohols (11. 8 % and 6 %), thimerosal 10. 8 % and 6 %).

40|$|Epicutaneous {{exposure}} of mice to the contact sensitizing chemicals 4 -ethoxymethylene- 2 -phenyl-oxazol- 5 -one (oxazolone) and 2, 4, 6 -trinitrochlorobenzene (picryl chloride) causes an inhibition of proliferative responses induced following subsequent topical challenge. The effects on lymphocyte proliferation comprise both transient antigen non-specific and more persistent hapten-specific mechanisms. Pretreatment of mice with one chemical 5 {{days prior to}} sensitization with a second, at which time antigen non-specific influences on proliferative responses are manifest, results in depression of <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> as measured by changes in ear thickness following challenge. If, however, the period between pretreatment and sensitization is extended the inhibition of <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> disappears in parallel with {{a decline in the}} antigen non-specific depression of lymph node cell proliferation. These data reveal that there exist two homeostatic mechanisms which control proliferation in response to challenge with at least some antigens, and that the extent of lymphocyte proliferation directly influences the degree of <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> achieved. Moreover these results demonstrate that, in some instances at least, competition between antigens may be a function of immunoregulatory influences on lymphocyte proliferation...|$|E
40|$|Emigration of Langerhans cells (LC) {{from the}} {{epidermis}} upon exposure to contact sensitizers {{is regarded as}} an essential event {{in the development of}} <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization.</b> Since migration of several types of cells depends on the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in the present study we tested whether MMP inhibitors (BB 94, BB 2116 and CT 1166) can prevent the emigration of LC in cultured skin explants, which were exposed to a contact sensitizer (NiSO 4). Epicutaneous application of NiSO 4 significantly reduced the number of LC within the epidermis and the remaining LC were localized along the epidermal-dermal junction indicating the emigration of LC. In the presence of each of the MMP inhibitors tested, NiSO 4 -induced migration of LC was strongly decreased. Since after the epicutaneous application of contact sensitizer, its presentation by skin LC is essential for the development of <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> instead of the development of antigen-specific tolerance, our results suggest that the use of MMP inhibitors may be beneficial for the prevention of <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> of the hos...|$|E
40|$|Superantigens are potent {{modulators}} of {{the immune}} system, especially T cells. Therefore, we determined the influence of superantigens on the T-cell-mediated immune response, contact sensitivity. We chose the combination of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) as superantigen and 2, 4 -dinitrofluorbenzene (DNFB) as the contact sensitizer, because in BALB/c mice SEB reacts almost exclusively with Vβ 8 + T cells, and these cells are capable of transferring contact sensitivity to DNFB from sensitized donors to naive syngeneic recipients. Pretreatment with a single intradermal injection of 50 ng SEB 24 h before DNFB exposure at the same site on the lower abdomen enhanced the induction of contact sensitivity: its intradermal injection permitted sensitization with non-sensitizing concentrations of DNFB as assessed by ear swelling responses after challenge with DNFR. In contrast, pretreatment with repeated intradermal injections of 50 ng SEB every other day over at least 1 week inhibited the induction of <b>contact</b> sensitivity following <b>sensitization.</b> The enhancing effect of SEB {{may be explained by}} the creation of a proinflammatory milieu in the skin after a single intradermal injection of the bacterial toxin, whereas the inhibitory effect may be due to tolerization of Vβ 8 + T cells. The data indicate that products of skin-colonizing bacteria that can serve as superantigens are able to augment or inhibit the development of contact sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Sensitization to thimerosal is commonplacein {{the general}} population. A {{large-scale}} North American study of allergic contact der-matitis found that thimerosal {{ranked among the}} 12 most common contact allergens. The study, which involved 3, 120 patients, showed contact reactions to thimerosal occurred in 10. 7 % of patients. 1 European studies have reported com-parable findings. What is the mode of sensitization? Thimerosal is an organic, mercurial compound widely used as an antibacterial preservative in contact lens solutions, eye drops, and vaccines. Exposure to thimerosal by any of these routes {{has been associated with}} sensitization. Both immediate and, more commonly, delayed hyper-sensitivity reactions have been reported. While thimerosal-induced keratoconjunc-tivitis is commonly seen in <b>contact</b> lens users, <b>sensitization</b> to thimerosal from vaccination probably surpasses that from contact lenses. In a study done by Aberer, et al., thimerosal reactivity by patch testing was seen most frequently in children who had recently been immunized. 2 The concomitant presence of atopic dermati-tis may be a risk factor for thimerosal sensitiza-tion, although this is not a universal observation. What are the effects of thimerosal-containing vaccines in sensitized individuals? Most reports of adverse immunologic reactions to thimerosal in vaccines involve small numbers of patients. Consequently, the spectrum of adverse clinical reactions may be deduced, but true risk of reaction in sensitized individuals is difficult to estimate.

40|$|The Unsaturated Test Method {{has been}} applied to study glass {{reaction}} under conditions that may be present at the potential Yucca Mountain site, currently under evaluation for storage of reprocessed high-level nuclear waste. The results from five separate sets of parametric experiments are presented wherein test parameters ranging from water <b>contact</b> volume to <b>sensitization</b> of metal in contact with the glass were examined. The most significant effect was observed when the volume of water, as controlled by the water inject volume and interval period, was such to allow exfoliation of reacted glass to occur. The extent of reaction was also influenced to a lesser extent by the degree of sensitization of the 304 L stainless steel. For each experiment, the release of cations from the glass and alteration of the glass were examined. The major alteration product is a smectite clay that forms both from precipitation from solution and from in-situ alteration of the glass itself. It is this clay that undergoes exfoliation as water drips from the glass. A comparison is made between the results of the parametric experiments with those of static leach tests. In the static tests the rates of release become progressively reduced through 39 weeks while, in contrast, they remain relatively constant in the parametric experiments for at least 300 weeks. This differing behavior may be attributable to the dripping water environment where fresh water is periodically added and where evaporation can occur...|$|R

The relationship of the response {{as a function of}} induction/elicitation concentrations was investigated. Groups of guinea pigs received 9 induction doses of the biocide, 3 times a week, at concentrations ranging from 25 – 2000 ppm a. i. These guinea pigs were challenged with the biocide at concentrations ranging from 20 – 2000 ppm a. i., and the application sites were scored for erythema 24 and 48 h after the challenge. The incidence of delayed contact dermatitis in induced guinea pigs was dependent on both the induction and challenge concentrations. The EC 50 (concentration at which delayed contact dermatitis was seen in 50 % of the population) for induction at a challenge concentration of 2000 ppm a. i., a nonirritating concentration, was estimated to be 88 ppm a. i. with a slope of 3. 47 probits/unit log concentration. The EC 50 for elicitation at an induction concentration of 1000 ppm a. i. was estimated to be 429 ppm a. i. with a slope of 2. 74 probits/unit log concentration. These data demonstrate that for Kathon biocide, there is an induction/elicitation concentration dependency for delayed contact dermatitis response, and there is a “no response concentration” zone where the biocide can be used without concern for clinically significant delayed contact dermatitis. In comparison with a previous study, these data also suggest that the number of induction doses may be an important factor in demonstrating the sensitization {{potential of}} a chemical...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to immediate type I allergy symptoms, natural rubber latex allergy may manifest as protein contact dermatitis on {{the hands of}} health-care workers and other natural rubber latex glove users. We examined whether repeated application of natural rubber latex on mouse skin causes sensitization to natural rubber latex and dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization with natural rubber latex produced a significant influx of mononuclear cells, CD 4 + CD 3 + cells, and eosinophils to the sensitized skin sites. The number of degranulated mast cells in natural rubber latex-sensitized skin sites was significantly higher compared with control sites treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The expression of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 4 mRNA was markedly increased in natural rubber latex-sensitized skin sites. Moreover, significant increases in the mRNA expression of chemokines CCL 2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1), CCL 11 (eotaxin- 1), CCL 3 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α), and CCL 4 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β) were found. In {{addition to}} the cutaneous inflammatory response, epicutaneous sensitization with natural rubber latex induced a striking increase in the total and specific immunoglobulin E levels {{but not in the}} immunoglobulin G 2 a levels. Intraperitoneal immunization with natural rubber latex induced a strong natural rubber latex-specific immunoglobulin G 2 a response, but only a weak immunoglobulin E response. We also studied the role of two major natural rubber latex allergens, the highly hydrophilic prohevein and the hydrophobic rubber elongation factor. Cutaneous application of natural rubber latex elicited a strong immunoglobulin E response against prohevein, but not against rubber elongation factor. On the contrary, intraperitoneal immunization with natural rubber latex elicited strong immunoglobulin G 2 a production to rubber elongation factor but not to prohevein. These results demonstrate that epicutaneous sensitization with natural rubber latex induces T helper 2 -dominated dermal inflammation and strong immunoglobulin E response in this murine model of natural rubber latex induced protein <b>contact</b> dermatitis. Epicutaneous <b>sensitization</b> to natural rubber latex proteins eluting from latex gloves may therefore {{contribute to the development of}} hand dermatitis and also natural rubber latex-specific immunoglobulin E antibodies...|$|R

Objectives. To describe the prevalence of <b>contact</b> <b>sensitization</b> to allergens tested in consecutive patients in the years 2007 and 2008, and to discuss possible differences. METHODS: Data from the 39 departments in 11 European countries comprising the European Surveillance System on Contact Allergy network (www. essca-dc. org) in this period have been pooled and analysed according to common standards. RESULTS: Patch test results with the European baseline series, and country-specific or department-specific additions to it, obtained in 25 181 patients, showed marked international variation. Metals and fragrances are still the most frequent allergens across Europe. Some allergens tested nationally may be useful future additions to the European baseline series, for example methylisothiazolinone, whereas a few long-term components of the European baseline series, namely primin and clioquinol, no longer warrant routine testing.
