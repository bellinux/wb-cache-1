40|$|<b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Publishing</b> {{can be seen}} as {{a problem}} of {{placement}} of rectangles on a bounded surface where text, pictures, or advertisements, must be placed on a set of pages. There exists formally predefined rules to design pages. Nevertheless, more subjective rules involving the personality of the designer lead to some complex problems. In fact, the designer is generally not able to specify, in a formal way, the rules he applies unconsciously. We propose to use a new machine learning technique, that is induction of logic programs and constraint logic programs to automatically extract a model of the rules used by the designers of pages of journals. Keywords Inductive Logic Programming, Constraint Logic Programming, <b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Publishing.</b> 1 Introduction The placement of rectangles on a bounded surface is a general problem [16] which has many applications such as space planning [2], chipset layout [5], cutting-stock problems [4] or <b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Publishing.</b> Given a set of recta [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the architectural issues in building storage systems for object-oriented database management systems (OO DBMSs) and persistent languages. We survey techniques for placing {{small and large}} objects on disk and disk space management, and we present client-server architectures for OO DBMSs. We describe alternatives in making a programming language persistent and in particular, we discuss pointers and three pointer dereference mechanisms: import/export, software dereference, and hardware dereference. 1 Introduction Relational database systems cannot {{meet the requirements of}} advanced database applications such as electronic CAD, mechanical CAD, geographic information systems and <b>computer-aided</b> <b>publishing</b> [28]. These applications are characterized by extremely complex data structures, and complex patterns of computation and navigation. They are implemented in 3 GLs such as FORTRAN, C, and C++, and because these applications are both computationally intensive and interacti [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) {{combines}} both Machine Learning and Logic Programming techniques. ILP uses first-order {{predicate logic}} restricted to Horn clauses as an underlying language. Thus, programs induced by an ILP system inherit the classical limitations of PROLOG programs. Constraint Logic Programming avoids some {{of the limitations of}} Logic Programming and so ILP aims to induce programs that employ this paradigm. Current ILP systems which induce constrained logic programs extend systems based on the normal semantics of ILP. In this paper we introduce ICLog, a new system which induces constrained logic programs and relies on an extension of a non-monotonic semantics-based system. We then present an application of IC-Log in the field of <b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Publishing.</b> Keywords Machine Learning, Inductive Logic Programming, Inductive Constraint Logic Programming. 1 Introduction Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) combines both Machine Learning and Logic Programming techniq [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Viral DNA {{integration}} into the infected cell genome is an essential step in the HIV- 1 life cycle. Hence, the viral integrase enzyme has become an important target for antiviral therapy. The integrase's activity action relies on the binding to its cellular partners, therefore {{the knowledge of the}} structural determinants is very important from a therapeutic perspective. Here we first review <b>published</b> <b>computer-aided</b> structural predictions of HIV- 1 integrase in complex with its interactors. These include DNA and the human HAT protein. Next, we present a prediction of the complex between HIV- 1 integrase with the human prolyl-isomerase- 1 (hPin 1) enzyme. Interaction with hPin 1 is crucial for efficient HIV- 1 infection and it increases integrase stability (Manganaro et. al 2010, Nat. Med. 16, 329). The modeling presented here, which is validated against experimental data, provides a rationale for a variety of viral protein's mutations which impair protein function and HIV- 1 virus replication in vivo without significantly affecting enzymatic activity...|$|R
40|$|In Chinese {{calligraphy}} cao shu {{is regarded}} as a kind of free form art which differs from other styles greatly in its less constrained strokes and brush textures. In this paper we present a framework for synthesizing cao shu realistically. In our system, we adopt different brush texture patches (BTP) collected from hand-written artworks to represent the solid and hollow strokes appearing in cao shu. BTP can be extended to fit the required length by use of texture synthesis, smooth transitions between adjacent BTP over the stroke are achieved by a Markov Random Field (MRF) -based interpolation technique. With a few parameters we can reproduce typical stroke forms of cao shu, variations of brush texture, the ink amount as well as wetness of the stroke. Our model is also able to synthesize characters of cao shu with different levels of detail that are applicable to scalable font design, very high-quality <b>publishing,</b> <b>computer-aided</b> education and electronic practice of calligraphy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Purpose of {{this paper}} is {{development}} of Generic Visualization methods (GVM) to enhance a Periodic Table of Generic Visualization Methods (PT-GVM) by examining a particular case of ER diagrams. Work is based on the concept of the three-layer architecture for an information visualization system, including: (1) Periodic Table of GVM (PTGVM); (2) middleware, translating conceptual visualizations into classes, comprising processing logic in the spirit of Generic Programming, and translating methods of classes into instructions of a Graphic Programming Language of <b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Publishing</b> System; and (3) graphic package, realizing visualization physically. Middleware can be developed exploiting such methods as (a) inheritance; (b) polymorphism; (c) parametrized templates (Boost C++ Graph Library). This paper relates to the case (a). Hierarchy of classes, representing nodes, was designed and implemented, programs to draw ER diagrams were developed, exemplary ER diagrams were generated. Quantitative signature for this particular representative visualization was defined to position it precisely inside a PTGVM. Fragments of implementation code are given...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this Acadia Conference was {{to a large extent}} {{addressed}} by Mitchell in his article “'What was <b>Computer-aided</b> design?”', <b>published</b> about two years ago. While one has to agree with most of his points, I find his predictions gloomy enough to wish I could disagree. Luckily, Mitchell has chosen to address what the majority of the profession (and many architectural schools) currently consider to be CAD. It turns out that this CAD is not what CAD is supposed to be. I have, therefore, purposely chosen a title which appears to echo an opposite view. My intention is not to express disagreement but rather to project the other face of CAD, in my own mind, the only CAD which deserves the name. Whether the current CAD should or will be called CAD in the future is of non-essential significance. As teachers of architectural design we need to be concerned that architectural CAD remains, to date, a very immature field. It is CAD only by name, since a true CAD system has yet to be'discoveredi. This presentation consists of three major sections. The first reviews why the currently available CAD systems do not have the ingredients which may justify them as design oriented machines. This discussion leads to the identification of architectural modelling and knowledge systems as the two main areas which need to be researched so that they may offer the basis for the development of truly design oriented machines. Each is discussed under a separate section, but the point is also made that the two should work hand-in-hand and should be integrated into a completely unified system...|$|R

Abstract: The {{purpose of the}} study was to assess the efficacy of epidural steroid injections for low-back pain. Data was obtained using <b>computer-aided</b> search of <b>published</b> randomized clinical trials and assessment of the methods of the studies. Twelve randomized clinical trials evaluating epidural steroid injections were identified. Data was extracted based on scores for quality of the methods, using 4 categories (study population, interventions, effect measurement, and data presentation and analysis) and the conclusion of the author(s) with regard to the efficacy of epidural steroid injections. Method scores of the trials ranged from 17 to 72 points (maximum 100 points). Eight trials showed method scores of 50 points or more. Of the 4 best studies (> 60 points), 2 reported positive outcomes and 2 reported negative results. Overall, 6 studies indicated that the epidural steroid injection was more effective than the reference treatment and 6 reported it to be no better or worse than the reference treatment. There appeared to be no relationship between the methodological quality of the trials and the reported outcomes. In conclusion, there are flaws in the design of most studies.

40|$|Research {{articles}} on the prognosis of stroke patients were analysed to identify studies that met sound methodological principles of prognostic research {{as well as to}} identify variables capable of predicting functional outcome (ADL) after stroke. Data sources comprised a <b>computer-aided</b> search of <b>published</b> prognostic studies and references to literature used in prognostic studies. Seventy-eight studies were tested for adherence to the following key methodological criteria: reliability and validity of measurement instruments used to assess dependent and independent variables; inclusion of an inception cohort; adequate and uniform end-point of observation; control for drop-outs during period of observation; statistical testing of presumed relationship between dependent and independent variables; sufficient sample size in relation to number of determinants; control for multicollinearity; specification of patient characteristics (i. e. age, type, recurrent stroke and localization of stroke); description of interfering treatment effects during the period of observation; and cross-validation of the prediction model in a second independent group of patients. Only three studies satisfied nine out of 11 criteria and ten studies eight criteria for the determination of valid prognostic research. The results of these studies indicate that the following variables are valid predictors for functional recovery after stroke: age; previous stroke; urinary continence; consciousness at onset; disorientation in time and place; severity of paralysis; sitting balance; admission ADL score; level of social support and metabolic rate of glucose outside the infarct area in hypertensive patients. This study supports the general opinion that not only are differences in objectives and heterogeneity in stroke patients responsible for the lack of accuracy in predicting functional outcome, but also the methodological flaws in published prognostic research...|$|R
