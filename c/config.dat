We do not allow any other application to run with configuration permission, forcing all requests {{for a change in}} system configuration to be processed by <b>configd.</b> We discuss the basic functionality required for <b>configd</b> to protect system configuration, and some preliminary improvements to a basic prototype design.

40|$|Conventional DC ion {{thruster}} design considers the maximum closed contour to determine favorable mag field <b>configs.</b> Detailed computational analysis shows that {{important aspects of}} DC {{ion thruster}} performance are determine the magnetic field line, as well as, field strength contours. Primary electrons are highly magnetized and follow field lines. Lower field strengths allow greater ion density since it delays the onset of discharge instability, {{which leads to a}} greater performance range. Submitted Abstract – DC-ION is a detailed computational model for predicting the plasma characteristics of rain-cusp ion thrusters. The advanced magnetic field meshing algorithm used by DC-ION allows precise treatment of the secondary electron flow. This capability allows self-consistent estimates of plasma potential that improves the overall consistency {{of the results of the}} discharge model described in Reference [refJPC 05 mod 1]. Plasma potential estimates allow the model to predict the onset of plasma instabilities, and important shortcoming of the previous model for optimizing the design of discharge chambers. A magnetic field mesh simplifies the plasma flow calculations, for both the ions and the secondary electrons, and significantly reduces numerical diffusion that can occur with meshes not aligned with the magnetic field. Comparing the results of this model to experimental data shows that the behavior of the primary electrons, and the precise manner of their confinement, dictates the fundamental efficiency of ring-cusp. This correlation is evident in simulations of the conventionally sized NSTAR thruster (30 cm diameter) and the miniature MiXI thruster (3 cm diameter) ...|$|R
