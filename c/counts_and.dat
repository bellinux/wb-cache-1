40|$|There exists {{many studies}} on the robust {{estimation}} of the regression effects in a linear model set up for continuous such as Gaussian data possibly containing one or more outliers. The robust estimation of the regression effects in a generalized linear model (GLM) {{set up for the}} <b>count</b> <b>and</b> binary data in the presence of outliers is, however, relatively difficult. In this thesis, we deal with this difficult estimation issue and develop the robust estimation procedures under three scenarios. First, a fully standardized Mallows-type quasi-likelihood (FSMQL) estimation technique is developed to obtain consistent regression estimates in the GLM set up for both independent <b>count</b> <b>and</b> binary data. Secondly, we develop a robust generalized quasi-likelihood (RGQL) estimation procedure to deal with the outliers in the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) set up for both <b>count</b> <b>and</b> binary data.

5|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is high {{altitude}} subtropical or tropical dry forests composed primarily of African juniper. However, the juniper forests preferred by the francolin are dying, {{so it may}} be found in other habitats, such as box-tree forests. This bird is only known from two locations in Djibouti, one of which is largely unsurveyed. It can be found in small groups and is extremely shy. It is known to feed on berries, seeds, and termites, and it breeds between December and February. It is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90% population decline in twenty years. The degrading of its juniper habitat through man-made disturbances, such as overgrazing, is a major threat to the francolin's survival. Ongoing conservation work includes the restoration of some juniper forest, and surveys to obtain accurate population <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> to raise awareness.|$|E

He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia.

5|$|Metanephrops challengeri is {{currently}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, {{due in part}} to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government. The species does appear to be declining, however, based both on burrow <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population. Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, which is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|The Port Authority then {{proposed}} an inter-terminal rail connector at JFK in 1987. The connector, proposed {{as part of}} a $3 billion renovation of the three airports, would originate from a new five-story, $500 million transportation center, connecting all the terminals to that transportation hub. The two-track system would be able to accommodate 2,000 riders an hour and would also connect to another new structure, a $450 million terminal proposed by Pan American World Airways. The connector and transport hub were proposed to alleviate traffic at the airport, since during the previous year, all three airports had experienced an unusually large increase in passenger <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> were now accommodating 1.5 to 2 times their design capacity. This construction was proposed in conjunction with the JFK Expressway, which was already under construction. Architect Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners created a design for the terminal and the proposed people mover system. However, the Port Authority withdrew its plans for the large transport hub in 1990 after opposition from the airlines there, which could not pay for the costly renovation.|$|E

5|$|B.cuneata is {{very unusual}} in {{apparently}} suffering no seed loss due to granivory. In nearly all other species, burrowing insect larvae eat {{a large proportion}} of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B.cuneata. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed <b>counts,</b> <b>and</b> the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a Banksia species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.|$|E

He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list.
