5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent <b>crazing</b> and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E

25|$|Although fully mineralized and {{containing}} no water—and {{therefore not}} subject to dehydration and subsequent <b>crazing</b> as seen in opal—ammolite is often damaged due to environmental exposure. The thin, delicate sheets in which ammolite occurs are also problematic; for these reasons, most material is impregnated with a clear epoxy or other synthetic resin to stabilize the flake-prone ammolite prior to cutting. Although the tessellated cracking cannot be repaired, the epoxy prevents further flaking and helps protect the relatively soft surface from scratching. The impregnation process was developed {{over a number of}} years by Korite in partnership with the Alberta Research Council. Impregnated and epoxy-coated ammolite first entered the market in 1989 and the treatment significantly increased the availability and durability of the gem.|$|E
40|$|The way {{in which}} the <b>craze</b> growth {{behavior}} is affected by the <b>craze</b> density surrounding the <b>craze</b> is investigated. The <b>craze</b> density is defined as the total number of <b>crazes</b> per unit surface area. It is noted that heretofore the growth rate of a <b>craze</b> has been considered either constant or inversely proportional to time. By allowing for the effect of the surrounding population of <b>crazes,</b> it is found that the <b>craze</b> growth rate is influenced by the local effective stress acting {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>craze.</b> It is found that measured data of <b>craze</b> length as a function of time are greatly affected by local interactions. With regard to the <b>craze</b> number, it is found that at high stresses a large number of small <b>crazes</b> becomes visible after a relatively short time, whereas under small stresses a large number of large <b>crazes</b> becomes visible after a long loading time...|$|R

25|$|The use of lead glaze {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali glazes {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to <b>crazing.</b> A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.|$|E

40|$|The {{finite element}} method is applied to {{contours}} (measured by interferometry) of <b>craze</b> zones in front of stationary crack tips in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in order to compute the stress distribution. The stress along the <b>craze</b> zone has its maximum at the crack tip, being about twice that predicted by the Dugdale model; and it decreases at first sharply and then more gradually, being almost constant as the <b>craze</b> tip is approached. Stress distributions, in a growing <b>craze</b> at the still stationary crack tip, at various times can be combined in a normalized curve. <b>Craze</b> stresses relax with time as the <b>craze</b> continues to propagate in a stable manner. When the specimen is unloaded, the <b>craze</b> stress is compressive near the crack tip, but is tensile at the <b>craze</b> tip {{and for most of}} the <b>craze</b> length. Analysis of measurements made during a loading cycle establishes miniimum stress intensity levels at which no fibrils are in compression.

2500|$|Laser cutting {{may be used}} to form {{intricate}} designs from PMMA sheets. PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a {{very clean}} cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses along the cut edge, which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable [...] "stress-crazing" [...] at the cut edge and several millimetres deep. Even ammonium-based glass-cleaner and almost everything short of soap-and-water produces similar undesirable <b>crazing,</b> sometimes over the entire surface of the cut parts, at great distances from the stressed edge. Annealing the PMMA sheet/parts is therefore an obligatory post-processing step when intending to chemically bond lasercut parts together.|$|E
