50|$|The {{telescope}} has two software-selectable filter {{banks of}} a modified NRAO design, each containing 256 channels. At 115 GHz, the 0.5 MHz per <b>channel</b> <b>filter</b> bank provides a velocity resolution of 1.3 km/s, and velocity coverage of 333 km/s, and the resolution and {{coverage of the}} 0.25 MHz per <b>channel</b> <b>filter</b> bank are 0.65 and 166 km/s, respectively. The spectrometers divide the 150 MHz final IF signal from the receiver into 16 bands of 4 or 8 MHz width, each centered on 8 MHz. The 16 bands are passed to {{an equal number of}} filter boards, each with 16 contiguous two-pole Butterworth filters of 0.25 or 0.5 MHz width. The outputs of the filters are passed to square law detectors. After amplification, the detected signals are accumulated in integrators. The sampling time is 48 ms, followed by a 5 ms hold for sequential read-out by an analog-to-digital converter, after which the integrators are cleared for the next cycle. The 256 values produced by the converter are stored in a buffer during the following cycle, allowing the computer a full 48 ms to read the data.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a propagation channel simulator for polarized bidirectional wideband propagation channels. The generic channel model {{implemented in the}} simulator {{is a set of}} rays described by geometrical and propagation features such as the delay, 3 D direction at the base station and mobile station and the polarization matrix. Thus, most of the wideband channel models including tapped delay line models, tap directional models, scatterer or geometrical models, ray-tracing or ray-launching results can be simulated. The simulator is composed of two major parts: firstly the channel complex impulse responses (CIR) generation and secondly the <b>channel</b> <b>filtering.</b> CIRs (or CIR matrices for MIMO configurations) are processed by specifying a propagation model, an antenna array configuration, a mobile direction, and a spatial sampling factor. For each sensor, independent arbitrary 3 D vectorial antenna patterns can be defined. The <b>channel</b> <b>filtering</b> is based on the overlap-and-add method. The time-efficiency and parameterization of this method are discussed with realistic simulation setups. The global processing time for the CIR generation and the <b>channel</b> <b>filtering</b> is also evaluated for realistic configuration. A simulation example based on a bidirectional wideband channel model in urban environments illustrates the usefulness of the simulator.|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} paper, we study the {{transmission}} of the two-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) superellipse ring resonator. The fast growing applications of optomechanical systems lead to strong demands in new sensing mechanism in order to design the sensing elements to nanometer scale. The photonic crystal based resonator has been investigated as promising solutions because the band gap structure and resonator characteristics are extremely sensitive to the deformation and position shift of rod / cavity in PC resonators. This structure opens a single <b>channel</b> <b>filter.</b> The study is extended for tuning of channel filter’s wavelength with a temperature of this structure. The transmission of the <b>channel</b> <b>filter</b> shows a red shift with temperature linearly. This wavelength shift of the <b>channel</b> <b>filter</b> {{is used for the}} sensor application. The sensitivity for the proposed structure is found to be 65.3 pm/°C. The outstanding sensing capability renders PC resonators as a promising optomechanical sensing element to be integrated into various transducers for temperature sensing applications.|$|E

In this paper, we conduct {{theoretical}} research and numerical simulation on the spread spectrum communication technique based on binary offset subcarrier frequency sweep and related methods.

40|$|Abstract—The most {{computationally}} intensive {{part of a}} wideband receiver is the channelizer, which extracts individual radio channels {{from the}} output of the ADC. The computational complexity of Linear Phase Finite Impulse Response (LPFIR) filters employed in the channelizer is dominated by the number of adders (subtractors) used in the implementation of the multipliers. Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) has been proposed as an efficient method to minimize the number of adders in LPFIR filters. In this paper, two methods are proposed to efficiently implement the <b>channel</b> <b>filters</b> in a wideband receiver by optimizing CSE. We exploit the fact that significant amount of redundant multiplications exist in the filter bank channelizer as it extracts multiple narrowband channels from the wideband signal. By forming three and four nonzero-bit super-subexpression utilizing redundant identical shifts that exist between a two-nonzero-bit Common Subexpression (CS) and a third nonzero bit, or between two nonzero-bit CS, we show that the number of adders to implement the <b>channel</b> <b>filters</b> can be reduced considerably. Furthermore, the complexity of adders is analyzed and design examples of the <b>channel</b> <b>filters</b> employed in the Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (D-AMPS) and the Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) channelizers show that the proposed methods offer considerable reduction in full adders when compared to conventional CSE methods...|$|R

30|$|While {{the complex}} random {{variable}} {{description of a}} wireless channel as Rayleigh, Rician, etc., forms one aspect of characterization, another one involves taking the time-variations of the <b>channel</b> <b>filter</b> taps into consideration.
