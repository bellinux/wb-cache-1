5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.|$|E
5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of <b>collateral</b> <b>damage.</b> Regardless, planners added more cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E

5|$|The Lincolns {{generally}} conducted {{area bombing}} missions, {{as well as}} strikes against pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers. Not having to contend with anti-aircraft fire, the Lincolns flew mainly by day. After completing a bomb run, they would make another pass over the target to strafe with machine guns and 20mm cannon. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, {{as well as their}} firepower and heavy bomb load. No.1 Squadron also flew night missions—the only Commonwealth air force unit authorised to do so—of up to six hours duration, dropping one bomb every half hour or so. To reduce the risk of <b>collateral</b> <b>damage,</b> all air strikes had to be approved by the Joint Operation Centre, located at Kuala Lumpur in central Malaya and staffed by military, police and civilian personnel. Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops.|$|E

25|$|Distinct {{restrictions}} were still applied however. Critics of the US effort charged {{that it was}} deliberately targeting civilians, but while several instances of <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> did occur, US policy and practice was concentrated on strategic military targets not the elimination of civilians. The Nixon regime forbid the bombing of dams for example, along with POW camps, hospitals and religious shrines. Precision munitions aided this mandate. For example, US F-4 aircraft destroyed power generators at the Lang Chi Hydroelectric Plant during Linebacker I, but left its dam 50 feet away untouched to minimize civilian <b>collateral</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
25|$|This initiates in the {{surrounding}} tissue an inflammatory response which attracts leukocytes and nearby phagocytes which eliminate the dead cells by phagocytosis. However, microbial damaging substances released by leukocytes would create <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> to surrounding tissues. This excess <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> inhibits the healing process. Thus, untreated necrosis results in a build-up of decomposing dead tissue and cell debris {{at or near the}} site of the cell death. A classic example is gangrene. For this reason, it is often necessary to remove necrotic tissue surgically, a procedure known as debridement.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of bubbles, both oscillating and stationary near biomaterials {{is of interest}} {{for the development of}} various medical treatment involving ultrasound and shock waves. This is because cavitation bubbles often nucleate in the bodily fluid under pressure waves, and their dynamics directly influence the success of the treatment and the <b>collateral</b> <b>damages</b> sustained. For example, in the treatment of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL), cavitation bubbles are created when the shock wave is administered. These bubbles oscillate and collapse near the kidney stones and the body tissues. They are responsible both for the breaking up of the stones as well as the <b>collateral</b> <b>damages</b> to the nearby tissues. We study the {{interaction of}} an oscillating bubble near various biomaterials. The bio-materials are modeled as elastic fluids with similar physical properties such as elastic modulus, Poisson ratio, and density. The bubble dynamics are summarized based on biomaterial physical properties. We also study the interaction of a stationary bubble with the nearby bio-materials when hit by a lithotripter shock wave. High speed jets and splitting of bubbles are observed due to the influence of the nearby biomaterials...|$|R

40|$|DDoS {{attack is}} a {{distributed}} source but coordinated Internet security threat that attackers either degrade or disrupt a shared service to legitimate users. It uses various methods to inflict damages on limited resources. It can be broadly classified as: flood and semantic (logic) attacks. DDoS attacking mechanisms vary {{from time to}} time and simple but powerful attacking tools are freely available on the Internet. There have been many trials on defending victims from DDoS attacks. However, many of the previous attack prevention systems lack effective handling of various attacking mechanisms and protecting legitimate users from <b>collateral</b> <b>damages</b> during detection and protection. In this paper, we proposed a distributed but synchronized DDoS defense architecture by using multiple agents, which are autonomous systems that perform their assigned mission in other networks on behalf of the victim. The major assignments of defense agents are IP spoofing verification, high traffic rate limitation, anomaly packet detection, and attack source detection. These tasks are distributed through four agents that are deployed on different domain networks. The proposed solution was tested through simulation with sample attack scenarios on the model Internet topology. The experiments showed encouraging results. A more comprehensive attack protection and legitimate users prevention from <b>collateral</b> <b>damages</b> makes this system more effective than other previous works...|$|R
