50|$|A {{dielectric}} mirror, {{also known}} as a Bragg mirror, is a type of mirror composed of multiple thin layers of dielectric material, typically deposited on a substrate of glass or some other optical material. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, one can design an optical coating with specified reflectivity at different wavelengths of light. Dielectric mirrors are also used to produce ultra-high reflectivity mirrors: values of 99.999% or better over a narrow range of wavelengths can be produced using special techniques. Alternatively, they can be made to reflect a broad spectrum of light, such as the entire visible range or the spectrum of the Ti-sapphire laser. Mirrors of this type are very common in optics experiments, due to improved techniques that allow inexpensive manufacture of high-quality mirrors. Examples of their applications include laser cavity end <b>mirrors,</b> hot and <b>cold</b> <b>mirrors,</b> thin-film beamsplitters, and the coatings on modern mirrorshades.|$|R

50|$|Some early {{digital cameras}} {{designed}} for visible light capture, {{such as the}} Associated Press NC2000 and Nikon Coolpix 950, were unusually sensitive to infrared radiation, and tended to produce colours that were contaminated with infrared.

40|$|The {{performance}} of unimodal biometric systems (based {{on a single}} modality such as face or fingerprint) has to contend with various problems, such as illumination variation, skin condition and environmental conditions, and device variations. Therefore, multimodal biometric systems {{have been used to}} overcome the limitations of unimodal biometrics and provide high accuracy recognition. In this paper, we propose a new multimodal biometric system based on score level fusion of face and both irises' recognition. Our study has the following novel features. First, the device proposed acquires images of the face and both irises simultaneously. The proposed device consists of a face camera, two iris cameras, near-infrared illuminators and <b>cold</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Second, fast and accurate iris detection is based on two circular edge detections, which are accomplished in the iris image {{on the basis of the}} size of the iris detected in the face image. Third, the combined accuracy is enhanced by combining each score for the face and both irises using a support vector machine. The experimental results show that the equal error rate for the proposed method is 0. 131 %, which is lower than that of face or iris recognition and other fusion methods...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design and the first light results for the new dual band {{receiver}} (4 mm and 3 mm bands) for Onsala Observatory 20 m antenna. For single dish operation, the receiver uses innovative on-source/off-source optical switch. Within the same optical layout, the switch, in combination with additional optical components, provides 2 calibration loads and sideband measurements possibilities. The optics layout of the receiver uses offset elliptical <b>cold</b> <b>mirrors</b> for both channels whereas the on-off switch employs flat mirrors only. The 3 mm channel employs 2 SB dual polarization receiver with OMT, 4 - 8 GHz IF, x 2 pol x (USB+LSB). The cryostat has 4 optical widows made of HDPE with anti-reflection corrugations, two for the signal and two for each frequency band cold load. The cryostat employs a two stage cryocooler RDK 408 D 2 and uses anti-vibration suspension of the cold-head to minimize impact of the vibrations on the receiver stability. The LO system is based on Gunn oscillator with PLL and two mechanical tuners for broadband operation, providing independently tunable LO power for each polarization.

40|$|The {{infrared}} intensities {{which would}} {{be observed by the}} Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), and which are produced by surface chemistry following atmospheric impact on SIRTF and the shuttle are estimated. Three possible sources of reactants are analyzed: (1) direct atmospheric and scattered contaminant fluxes onto the shuttle's surface; (2) direct atmospheric and scattered contaminant fluxes onto the SIRTF sunshade; and (3) scattered fluxes onto the <b>cold</b> SIRTF <b>mirror.</b> The chemical reactions are primarily initiated by the dominent flux of reactive atomic oxygen on the surfaces. Using observations of the optical glow to constrain theoretical parameters, it is estimated for source (1) that the infrared glow on the SIRTF mirror will be comparable to the zodiacal background between 1 and 10 micron wavelengths. It is speculated that oxygen reacts with the atoms and the radicals bound in the organic molecules that reside on the shuttle and the Explorer surfaces. It is concluded that for source (2) that with suitable construction, a warm sunshade will produce insignificant infrared glow. It is noted that the atomic oxygen flux on the <b>cold</b> SIRTF <b>mirror</b> (3) is insufficient to produce significant infrared glow. Infrared absorption by the ice buildup on the mirror is also small...|$|R

After their defeat by the Flash, they formed a lasting group, and usually a Rogue will never commit a crime by himself. The Silver Age Flash enemies who became Rogues were Captain <b>Cold,</b> <b>Mirror</b> Master, Heat Wave, Weather Wizard, the Trickster, Pied Piper, the Top, Captain Boomerang and later, Rainbow Raider.

5000|$|The VL5 was {{the first}} moving light to use [...] "cold mirror" [...] {{technology}} to provide a cool, high-intensity light beam, which could be placed close to objects and people, without burning them.

The prototype VL5 <b>cold</b> <b>mirror</b> reflector allegedly cost US$100,000 to produce.

50|$|Since {{the release}} of the Source Four, other {{lighting}} manufacturers have since revised their products to compete in the market share alongside the ETC. The Selecon Pacific, an L shaped ERS, has an irregular shape due to an integrated dichroic <b>cold</b> <b>mirror,</b> which effectively splits the visible wavelengths of the light beam from the infrared, allowing the heat to be drawn off by a heat sink and away from the instrument. This keeps the beam of the fixture cool allowing for the use of plastic gobos. The beam also improves shutter, gobo and color gel life, and can improve the temperature on stage.

The ultimate objective of this project is to extend a ripeness study on the citrus fruit image data and the segmentation methods by multispectral analysis for fruit picking robot. To acquire {{the combination of the}} image data, an economic portable <b>cold</b> <b>mirror</b> acquisition system has been prototyped to align two CCD cameras with a classical <b>cold</b> <b>mirror</b> on a custom built fixture. The use of the <b>cold</b> <b>mirror</b> system is an attempt to capture different waveband images without algorithmic registration on images from the same channel by triggering and synchronizing two cameras closely. With interchangeability, some physical optical filters can be interchanged on the cameras as well to capture the attenuated image data. In the study, some segmentation methods have been selected conceptually covering the color indices, Fisher linear discriminate analysis, and the hyperplane construction using single perceptron with the multilayer perceptron, and the competitive self-organizing map. Therefore both the original image data and the attenuated data by physical optical filter from one camera are compared to discuss the data improvement and performance of the methods on segmentation. From the results, the polarizer filtered data is closely better than neutral density filtered data and much better than the original image data. Performance of the segmentation methods and some issues regarding the data are discussed in this paper...|$|E
