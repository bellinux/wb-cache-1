5|$|Anderson {{was shown}} footage of James Cameron's Avatar which sold {{him on the}} idea to shoot Resident Evil: Afterlife in digital 3D. He shot in high-definition with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using Cameron's Fusion <b>Camera</b> <b>System,</b> or more {{specifically}} a Sony F35 camera. The crew spent two weeks in pre-production learning the 3D <b>camera</b> <b>system.</b> With a budget of about $60 million, principal photography took place for 55 days from September 29, 2009 to December. Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget. Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009. The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days. During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 camera.|$|E
5|$|There {{are mainly}} {{three types of}} <b>camera</b> <b>systems.</b> In fixed <b>camera</b> <b>systems,</b> the <b>camera</b> does not move at all and the system {{displays}} the player's character in a succession of still shots. Tracking cameras, on the other hand, follow the character's movements. Finally, interactive <b>camera</b> <b>systems</b> are partially automated and allow the player to directly change the view. To implement <b>camera</b> <b>systems,</b> video game developers use techniques such as constraint solvers, artificial intelligence scripts, or autonomous agents.|$|R

5|$|The {{game has}} made a lasting {{impression}} {{on the field of}} 3D game design, featuring a dynamic <b>camera</b> <b>system</b> and 360-degree analog control. The title is acclaimed by many critics and fans {{as one of the greatest}} and most revolutionary video games of all time.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual <b>camera</b> <b>system</b> creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible to plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E
40|$|Having seen {{increased}} interest {{from the research}} com-munity, smart <b>camera</b> <b>systems</b> have gone {{through a number of}} evolutionary steps like from single cameras to distributed smart <b>camera</b> <b>systems</b> with collaboration features. This work aims at defining a taxonomy to classify these systems based on their platform capabilities, the degree of distributed pro-cessing as well as system autonomy aspects covering self-configuration and mobility. Existing <b>camera</b> <b>systems</b> are clas-sified according to the proposed taxonomy. Besides captur-ing the design space for smart cameras, the main contribution of this paper is an overview of the research challenges for the envisioned class of pervasive smart <b>camera</b> <b>systems.</b> As defined in this work, future pervasive smart <b>camera</b> <b>systems</b> will be visual sensor networks targeted at end-user applica-tions where special emphasis is put on unobtrusiveness of the cameras as well as simple deployment supported by self con-figuration capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Multiple <b>camera</b> <b>systems</b> may {{be divided}} into {{multiple}} overlapping and non-overlapping <b>camera</b> <b>systems.</b> Both are widely used for image and video analysis tasks, object analysis, computer graphics and surveillance. Visual matching and tracking of humans in multiple <b>camera</b> <b>systems</b> {{is an important component}} of many such systems. For both overlapping and non-overlapping <b>camera</b> <b>systems,</b> recognising the same person in different cameras is the main challenge. Different methods have been developed to match and track humans in video. This thesis proposes novel methods for human matching and tracking in multiple <b>camera</b> <b>systems,</b> both overlapping and non-overlapping. It presents a frame-based human matching method for multiple cameras that combines feature point descriptions and geometric constraints between feature points to achieve better human matching results. It also presents a sequence-based human appearance matching method, based on model-adaptive Mean-Shift tracking and key patch selection to improve the human matching accuracy. Through key patch re-initialization, humans can also be tracked in multiple <b>camera</b> <b>systems.</b> The proposed methods have been tested on videos obtained from the Smart Room in School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales. Experimental analysis presented in this thesis shows that the proposed methods can match and track humans stably...|$|R

5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended <b>camera</b> <b>system</b> created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the <b>camera</b> <b>system</b> malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Unleashed was mixed, with Metacritic aggregate {{scores of}} 60 and 54 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions respectively, and 66 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions. The added element of motion controls for the Werehog sections, {{as well as}} text-based hub worlds and better Werehog level design and <b>camera</b> <b>system,</b> were reasons cited for the higher review scores for the Wii version of the game, though a few review websites, such as 1UP, gave the Wii version a lower score than its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts. Nevertheless, the game was a commercial success and sold 2.45 million units combined making it Sega's third best selling game during their last fiscal year period of 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} praise in pre-release showings, Sonic the Hedgehog {{was released}} to notably negative reception.

5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of the}} camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under the same set of views. An early example of {{this kind of}} <b>camera</b> <b>system</b> can be seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} met with mixed {{reception}} from video game critics.
