5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> often highly distressed. The <b>child</b> <b>is</b> generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E

Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.|$|E
5|$|Adopted <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>children</b> that <b>were</b> {{given up}} at birth, {{abandoned}} or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 <b>children</b> <b>were</b> adopted in 2001. The average age of these <b>children</b> <b>was</b> 7, which shows that fewer older <b>children</b> <b>were</b> adopted.|$|R

5|$|The dog {{leaves the}} house and swims back across the river, {{down the street and}} into its master and mistress's home. In a study, the child's father is sitting; Rover enters and pleads with him to follow. They leave, with the man {{following}} the dog across the river in a boat to the slums. They enter the room where the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> hidden, and the father quickly takes the child from the beggar woman and leaves with the dog. Upon their return home, the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> placed in the arms of the mother, while Rover prances happily around them.|$|E
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the <b>child</b> <b>is</b> attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
