2500|$|The vapor-compression {{cycle is}} used in most {{household}} refrigerators {{as well as in}} many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [...] The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically, {{less than half of the}} liquid. [...] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the <b>compressor</b> <b>inlet</b> at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Charging {{pressure}} regulation utilises a two coiled three way {{solenoid valve}} pneumatically connected with hoses to the turbo charger’s waste gate, the turbo chargers outlet and the <b>compressor’s</b> <b>inlet.</b> The solenoid valve is electrically supplied from +54 via fuse 13 and {{is controlled by}} the ECU via its pin 26 and pin 2. The control voltage is pulse width modulated (PWM) at 90 Hz below 2500 RPM and 70 Hz above 2500 RPM. The rationale for this change is to avoid resonance phenomena in the pneumatic hoses. By grounding pin2 longer than pin 26 the charging pressure is decreased and vice verse, when pin 26 is grounded longer than pin 2 the charging pressure is increased. To be able to regulate the charging pressure the ECU must at first calculate a requested pressure, a pressure value that the system must strive for. This is done by taking a pre programmed value (matrix of values established in respect of RPM and throttle opening). At WOT the pressure values for each RPM are selected {{to make sure that the}} engine gets the requested torque.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{propulsion}} system concepts {{to be considered}} for the High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) is an underwing, dual-propulsion, pod-per-wing installation. Adverse transient phenomena such as engine <b>compressor</b> stall and <b>inlet</b> unstart could severely degrade the performance of one of these propulsion pods. The subsequent loss of thrust and increased drag could cause aircraft stability and control problems {{that could lead to a}} catastrophic accident if countermeasures are not in place to anticipate and control these detrimental transient events. Aircraft system engineers must understand what happens during an engine <b>compressor</b> stall and <b>inlet</b> unstart so that they can design effective control systems to avoid and/or alleviate the effects of a propulsion pod engine <b>compressor</b> stall and <b>inlet</b> unstart. The objective of the Inlet Unstart Propulsion Airframe Integration test program was to assess the underwing flow field of a High-Speed Civil Transport {{propulsion system}} during an engine compressor stall and subsequent inlet unstart. Experimental research testing was conducted in the 10 - by 10 -Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. The representative propulsion pod consisted of a two-dimensional, bifurcated inlet mated to a live turbojet engine. The propulsion pod was mounted below a large flat plate that acted as a wing simulator. Because of the plate s long length (nominally 10 -ft wide by 18 -ft long), realistic boundary layers could form at the inlet cowl plane. Transient instrumentation was used to document the aerodynamic flow-field conditions during an unstart sequence. Acquiring these data was a significant technical challenge because a typical unstart sequence disrupts the local flow field for about only 50 msec. Flow surface information was acquired via static pressure taps installed in the wing simulator, and intrusive pressure probes were used to acquire flow-field information. These data were extensively analyzed to determine the impact of the unstart transient on the surrounding flow field. This wind tunnel test program was a success, and for the first time, researchers acquired flow-field aerodynamic data during a supersonic propulsion system engine <b>compressor</b> stall and <b>inlet</b> unstart sequence. In addition to obtaining flow-field pressure data, Glenn researchers determined other properties such as the transient flow angle and Mach number.

The propulsion system consisted of a mixed-compression, two-dimensional bifurcated inlet coupled to a General Electric J 85 - 13 turbojet engine.

40|$|A multi-cylinder {{turbocharged}} Diesel {{engine is}} analysed {{from a second}} law analysis point of view via a single-zone thermodynamic model. For this purpose, a comprehensive digital computer program is developed that incorporates subroutines to simulate, among other things, combustion, heat transfer, indirect fuel injection, mass flow through valves, turbocharger and aftercooler behaviour, and real multi-cylinder engine action. This is tested favourably against relevant data from an experimental investigation conducted at the authors' laboratory. A second law analysis is performed {{in all parts of}} the engine (cylinder, <b>compressor,</b> turbine, aftercooler, <b>inlet</b> and exhaust manifolds). The analysis describes explicitly all the availability terms existing, i. e. work, heat and mass transfer, availability accumulation in every control volume and fuel flow, thus providing the proper evaluation of every component's irreversibilities, which for the present study are <b>compressor,</b> turbine, <b>inlet,</b> exhaust and combustion. The model is applied to a six-cylinder, turbocharged and aftercooled, indirect injection, four-stroke, medium-high speed diesel engine, installed at the authors' laboratory. Availability rate and cumulative availability terms, with respect to crank angle, for all the processes encountered are presented in diagrams, which show the trends of the availability accumulation and destruction in every component during an engine cycle. Separate diagrams are presented for the main chamber and the prechamber and also for the closed and open parts of the cycle. Tabulation of all second law analysis terms is given for the full load-maximum speed operation and the differences against first law assessments are discussed. Special attention is paid to the correct determination and explanation of the irreversibility quantification and second law efficiencies for every component and for the whole plant.
