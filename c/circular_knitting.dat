40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} wearing trend and {{purchase}} facts for adult females in their 20 s and 30 s {{along with their}} fitting satisfaction for woven jackets and <b>circular</b> <b>knitted</b> jackets. A questionnaire survey on consumers investigated satisfaction with jackets according to clothing materials and repair trend after wearing. Subsequently, a preference for cir-cular knitted jackets was shown higher than woven jackets. Females in their 20 s preferred woven jackets than those in their 30 s; however, the latter preferred <b>circular</b> <b>knitted</b> jackets than the former. For woven jackets, they showed the high-est satisfaction with size; however, for <b>circular</b> <b>knitted</b> jackets, they showed the highest satisfaction with fitting. In the question on their satisfaction by jacket part, satisfaction with <b>circular</b> <b>knitted</b> jackets was higher in all items except for bust measurement, bottom edge measurement, elbow circumference, shoulder width, and clothes length. <b>Circular</b> <b>knitted</b> jackets had lower repair rates than woven jackets and woven jackets had significant differences by age in satisfaction with back width. The research results indicate that females in their 20 s and 30 s who value fit preference and practicality will increasingly wear knit clothes. Therefore, we can address the fitting satisfaction requirement of females in their 20 s and 30 s by taking the clothing material properties of <b>circular</b> <b>knitted</b> clothes into consideration. In addition, further research is required on jacket patterns in consideration of clothing materials.

Twenty-seven fine-gauge <b>circular</b> <b>knitted</b> samples from nine different knitted fabrics intended for golf shirt fabrics were assessment using both the subjective and objective methods. In the experiment, five mechanical properties which are considered significant in knitted fabric softness were evaluated, including Compression Resilience (RC), Surface Friction (MIU), Geometrical Roughness (SMD), Thickness (T) and Weight (W). The result implies that softness property is a feeling of springy (i. e., High in RC) with a smooth hand (i. e., Low in MIU and SMD). Also, knitted fabrics which are thin and light in weight are preferred in softness property. Fabric construction was also identified as a significant factor affecting softness with plain knitted ranked better than tuck knitted fabrics.

The quality of the stitching operation has a particular influence on the finite product quality and is determined on side by the quality of knitted pieces, and on the other by insuring the correlation between the technological parameters of the stitching operation and the physico-mechanical characteristics of the knittings that are to be assembled through stitching. Although the product execution processes comprise of manufacturing the elements and distinct subassemblies and their ulterior assembly, they present various difference dictated by the constructive particularities of the machine, as well as fabric characteristics. Because of the multiple interactions between the material, yarn and working parts of the sawing machine, inadequacies in the technological discipline can result in negative effects on both the knitted and stitching thread as well as the machine. A part of these can be fixed by extra time consuming tasks (yarn breaks, stitching ruffling etc.), while other defects appear during the usage of the product cheapening it (stitch tearing by perforating the knitted on the stitching line, pilling effect, dimensional instability etc.).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop and refine new yarn and knit textile combinations using Nuyarn technology for a selected niche market. New Zealand’s Nuyarn is an industryconnected project with Massey University and Levana Textiles. Levana Textiles is a woolen mill based in Levin with over 50 years industry experience. Through the exploration of trend forecasting, iterative design process, market research as well as finding a gap in the market, this result in unique New Zealand products that can demand a premium price. Nuyarn technology is a new and innovative way of spinning yarn. The technology enhances the yarn performance by taking the twist out, and instead it lays the fibres along the same orientation {{as the rest of the}} yarn. Levana Textiles have purchased Nuyarn spinning technology. Through the use of this technology, Levana is producing and introducing innovative and newly improved products into the textile market. This technology is paramount in setting them apart from other textile mills as well as bringing a point of difference in the market. There is a need to achieve smarter performance in blended yarns for circular knitwear apparel. The wool industry endured hard times in previous years due to the rise in demand for synthetic fibres in the 1960 s. Wool is now re-emerging with companies focusing on new developments and innovation with the fibre. As a result of intensive research and development, cutting-edge design process and contemporary insight into the industry have enabled Levana to lead the way in the development of new yarn combinations and improved yarn performance through the use of new spinning technology. Resulting in specialty blended yarn and <b>circular</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics that provide opportunity to target niche markets, high profitability, and increased brand awareness for Levana Textiles...|$|R
