[...] As to the frescos, little remained of work once so perfect. [...] Summer and winter weather of some three cycles had wasted; [...] Plaster had fallen, and left unsightly blotches of ruin; [...] Wanton and stupid neglect had done its worst to the pictures: [...] Yet to the sympathetic and reverent eye was apparent-- [...] Where the careless glance but found, in expanses of plaster, [...] Touches of incoherent color and lines interrupted-- [...] Somewhat still {{of the life of}} surpassing splendor and glory [...] Filling the frescos once; and here and there was a figure, [...] Standing apart, and out from the common decay and confusion, [...] Flushed with immortal youth and ineffaceable beauty, [...] Such as that figure of Eve in pathetic expulsion from Eden, [...] Taking--the tourist remembers--the wrath of Heaven al fresco, [...] As is her <b>well-known</b> <b>custom</b> <b>in</b> thousands of acres of canvas.|$|R
