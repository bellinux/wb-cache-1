5|$|While the Apostolic Faith Mission {{was founded}} in 1908 and Pentecostalism brought to South Africa by American missionaries, several factors helped create a {{favorable}} <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> the Pentecostal movement to spread in the country. First, revivals in the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (DRC) in 1860, 1874 and 1884 were characterized by deep conviction of sin followed by conversion, fervent prayer and some ecstatic phenomenon. Thus in 1908, some older DRC members were familiar and open to Pentecostalism. Second, the Dutch Reformed minister Andrew Murray was a prominent holiness teacher and helped create a <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> revival. A third factor was the Zionist churches, led by John Alexander Dowie from Zion City, Illinois, United States.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth's {{climate is}} a {{transitional}} humid continental/cold humid subtropical/marine type, {{which is the}} predominant <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> Massachusetts. Due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean, humidity levels can be very high year-round. Plymouth's coastal location causes it to experience warmer temperatures than many inland locations in New England. Summers are typically hot and humid, while winters are cold, windy and often snowy.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Romneys {{sold their}} primary {{residence}} in Belmont and their ski chalet in Utah, leaving them an estate along Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and an oceanfront {{home in the}} La Jolla district of San Diego, California, which they had purchased the year before. The La Jolla home proved beneficial in location and <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> Ann Romney's multiple sclerosis therapies and for recovering from her late 2008 diagnosis of mammary ductal carcinoma in situ and subsequent lumpectomy. Both it and the New Hampshire location were near some of their grandchildren. Romney maintained his voting registration in Massachusetts, however, and bought a smaller condominium in Belmont during 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the revolt, the Brazilian populace saw frequent {{changes in the}} country's political, economic, and social <b>climate.</b> <b>For</b> example, in May 1888, slavery in Brazil was abolished with the enactment into law of the Lei Áurea, a law vehemently opposed by the Brazilian upper class and plantation owners. This discontent among the upper parts of society directly led to a peaceful coup d'état spearheaded by the army and led by Benjamin Constant and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca. Pedro II {{and his family were}} quickly and quietly sent into exile in Europe; they were replaced with a titular republic with Fonseca as president.|$|E

5|$|The {{tendency}} to portray animals as having human traits was not new; Aesop's moralistic animal tales were still popular with {{readers of the}} day, and inspired such works as Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894). However, one of the features separating the turn-of-the-century animal writers from those before them was the desire to have their animals set an example through their noble, sympathetic characteristics. Anna Sewell's Black Beauty, for example, {{told the story of}} a gentle horse seemingly from the animal's own point of view; after being published in the United States by the American Humane Education Society in 1890, Sewell's book helped further the cause against animal cruelty. The budding animal welfare movement helped establish a <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> wider public support of wildlife conservation, and soon nature writers similarly sought to gain sympathy for wild animals—specifically those who seemingly displayed honorable human traits—by depicting them in a positive light. One popular nature writer of the day, Mabel Osgood Wright, told of wolves nobly taking their own lives after losing their mates.|$|E
