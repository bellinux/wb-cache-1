50|$|A further {{landmark}} {{building is}} the Empress State Building, located in Lillie Road, which {{was completed in}} 1962, and is a unique triangular office building with <b>concave</b> <b>bow</b> façades. It was occupied by the Ministry of Defence for 30 years. It underwent extensive refurbishment and updating prior to its occupation by the Metropolitan Police around 2003.|$|E
5000|$|His studies {{produced}} {{a revolution in}} the design of hulls for merchant and navy vessels. Most ships of the time had rounded bows to optimise the cargo-carrying capacity, but starting from the 1840s the [...] "extreme clipper ships" [...] started to show <b>concave</b> <b>bows</b> as increasingly did steam ships culminating with the Great Eastern. After his views were propounded by Commander Fishbourne, the American naval architect John W. Griffiths acknowledged the force of Russell's work in his Treatise on marine and naval architecture of 1850 though he was grudging in acknowledging a debt to Russell.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Wacanda boats had evolved {{distinctive}} styling and performance features including on the v-hulls a flared and <b>concave</b> (hollow) <b>bow</b> profile and ‘squared off’ bow. These features {{resulted in a}} roomier interior, {{as well as a}} very dry boat.|$|R

Albacore sailed south late in May and, after {{operating in the}} British West Indies for two weeks, proceeded to Key West {{to serve as a}} target for the Surface Antisubmarine Development Detachment. After returning north, she spent much of the remainder of 1959 and most of 1960 undergoing widely varied tests for the David Taylor Model Basin. One of the more unusual consisted of evaluating a <b>concave</b> <b>bow</b> sonar dome.|$|E

5000|$|In 1843, the A. A. Low & Bros. {{representative}} in Canton, William Low, and {{his pregnant wife}} Ann had been passengers on a very slow and frustrating trip home from Canton with Captain Nathaniel Palmer on Paul Jones. [...] "To vent his frustration Nat began carving a block of wood {{into the shape of}} what he thought the ideal hull of a Canton trader should look like, one that [...].

5000|$|Adjusting the {{truss rod}} affects the {{intonation}} of a guitar {{as well as}} the height of the strings from the fingerboard, called the action. Some truss rod systems, called double action truss systems, tighten both ways, pushing the neck both forward and backward (standard truss rods can only release to a point beyond which the neck is no longer compressed and pulled backward). The artist and luthier Irving Sloane pointed out, in his book Steel-String Guitar Construction, that truss rods are intended primarily to remedy <b>concave</b> <b>bowing</b> of the neck, but cannot correct a neck with [...] "back bow" [...] or one that has become twisted. Classical guitars do not require truss rods, as their nylon strings exert a lower tensile force with lesser potential to cause structural problems. However, their necks are often reinforced with a strip of harder wood, such as an ebony strip that runs down the back of a cedar neck. There is no tension adjustment on this form of reinforcement.|$|R
40|$|Appendicular {{skeletons of}} isotemnid notoungulates are {{described}} from Cañadón Vaca (Vacan ‘‘subage’’, Casamayoran South American Land Mammal ‘‘Age’’,?middle to late Eocene). Simpson documented three of these, Thomashuxleya externa, Anisotemnus distentus, and Pleurostylodon similis, some 70 years ago, in fashioning a composite isotemnid skeleton, {{but he did}} not emphasize their differences from one another. We note variation, especially in the forelimb, that appears to be functionally significant as well as phylogenetically informative. For example, the downwardly curved olecranon, ventrally <b>concave</b> <b>bowing</b> of the ulnar shaft, and orthogonally directed articulation of the elbow joint suggest an erect forelimb stance in Thomashuxleya externa, whereas the forelimbs of Anisotemnus distentus and Pleurostylodon similis show indications of a crouching posture, including ventrally convex bowing of the ulnar shaft with a slight upward curvature of the olecranon, and an elbow joint in which the antebrachium rotated obliquely relative to the humerus. Articular facets on the proximal carpals suggest that the manus of Anisotemnus was habitually extended, indicating a plantigrade stance of the forelimb. Although none of these three taxa have associated hindfoot material, all known Vacan notoungulate astragali have shallow trochlea, well...|$|R
40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 52 : 12 in length. The Concertino, by Giuseppe Torelli, {{is written in}} a very typical Baroque style. It will be performed on piccolo trumpet and will display the ornamentation and character of that period. The natural or Baroque trumpet was a valveless instrument which required tremendous flexibility of the lip and strength of its performer. The harmonics on the natural trumpet are very close together, which makes even simple passages rather difficult. Slower tempi was a characteristic of this period, {{partly due to the}} unevolved trumpet and the <b>concave</b> violin <b>bow.</b> Torelli was born in Verona, Italy on April 22, 1658, and died in Bologna on February 8, 1709. He was an Italian violinist and composer, and was probably the originator of the solo concerto for violin. His trumpet works demand almost violinistic agility of its soloist. August De Boeck was a Belgian composer, born on May 9, 1865, and died October 9, 1937. The Allegro (Allegro de Concours) will be performed on B-flat trumpet, and was composed as a contest piece. Boeck studied organ at the Brussels Conservatory, and he was also a church organist. Later he taught harmony both at the Royal Flemish Conservatory at Antwerp, and the Brussels Conservatory. He wrote operas and incidental music for stage plays, and much of his orchestra music is infused with elements on impressionism. Caprice Op. 47, was written in 1943, by Eugene Bozza. It will be performed on C-trumpet, and is very impressionistic in style. This is a very typical Paris Conservatory final examination piece. Successful works, such as this one, will display ???fanfare-like??? technical passages and lyrical melodic lines. Bozza was born on April 4, 1905 and was a French composer and conductor. He studied at the Paris Conservatory, and won first prize as a violinist in 1924. He also won first prize as a conductor in 1930 in Paris, and at the Grand Prj. x de Rome in 1934. In 1939 he became a conductor at the Opera-Comique, he then moved to Valenciennes, where he was appointed director of the local conservatory. (See more in text. ...|$|R
