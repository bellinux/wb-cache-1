5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of <b>colostrum)</b> and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via <b>colostrum</b> {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in <b>colostrum</b> during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E
5|$|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital <b>colostrum</b> milk. Lambs {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented {{from doing so}} by the ewe require aid in order to live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied {{to force them to}} accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is not eating, a stomach tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life. In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, a shepherd may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another ewe. Lambs are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital <b>colostrum</b> milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} bovine <b>colostrums</b> on inhibition of DNA oxidative damage and low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in vitro. Results showed that whey and skimmed milk exhibited not only higher inhibitory activities of oxidative damage of deoxyribose but also an inhibitory effect on the breakdown of supercoiled DNA into open circular DNA and linear DNA. The quantities of 8 -OH- 2 ′-dG formed under whey, caseins and skimmed milk treatment were 0. 24, 0. 24 and 1. 24 μg/mL, respectively. The quantity of malondialdehyde formed through LDL oxidation induced by copprous ion was significantly decreased as <b>colostrums</b> protein solutions were added, in which whey and caseins led to a more significant decrease than skimmed milk. The formation of conjugated dienes could be inhibited by treatment with <b>colostrums</b> protein solutions. Whey exhibited the longest lag time of conjugated dienes formation among the <b>colostrums</b> proteins. The lag time of the whey was 2. 33 {{times that of the}} control.

40|$|Bovine <b>colostrums</b> are the “early ” milk {{produced}} by cows {{during the first}} several days post-parturition. This “early ” milk has a nutrient profile and immunological composition that differs substantially from “mature ” milk. Included in the nutrient profile are higher amounts of immunoglobulins, growth factors, cytokines, and nucleosides than are found in milk. Bovine <b>colostrums</b> are also rich in oligosaccharides, antimicrobials, and immune-regulating factors. Available evidence suggests a beneficial effect of supplementation of bovine <b>colostrums</b> in improving body composition, aspects of athletic performance, diarrhea in persons with immune-deficiency syndromes, NSAID-induced gastrointestinal disturbances, and aspects of the acute phase response that occurs secondary to surgery.

25|$|Livestock breeders {{commonly}} bank <b>colostrum</b> {{from their}} animals. <b>Colostrum</b> {{can be stored}} frozen but it does lose some of its inherent quality. <b>Colostrum</b> produced on a breeder's own premises {{is considered to be}} superior to <b>colostrum</b> from other sources, because it is produced by animals already exposed to (and, thus, making antibodies to) pathogens occurring on the premises. A German study reported that multiparous mares produced on average a liter (quart) of <b>colostrum</b> containing 70grams of IgG.|$|E
25|$|Bovine <b>colostrum</b> from pasture-fed cows {{contains}} immunoglobulins {{specific to}} many human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus species, and rotavirus (which causes diarrhea in infants).

In fact, when Albert Sabin made his first oral vaccine against polio, the immunoglobulin he used came from bovine <b>colostrum.</b> When antibiotics began to appear, interest in <b>colostrum</b> waned, but, now that antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens have developed, interest is once again returning to natural alternatives to antibiotics, namely, <b>colostrum.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Colostrum</b> {{varies in}} quality and quantity. In the dairy industry, {{the quality of}} <b>colostrum</b> is {{measured}} {{as the amount of}} IgG (Immunoglobulin G) per liter.

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) and alkylphenols (APs) are {{well-known}} endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) {{which may}} threat the next generations' health. We performed biomonitoring of these phenols in <b>colostrums</b> to assess {{risk of the}} phenols in breast-fed neonates. Study subjects were the lactating mothers who delivered babies within 2 weeks (N= 325; 30. 67 ± 3. 45 years) and their neonates (N= 326; embryonic period, 39. 1 ± 1. 5 weeks). BPA, nonylphenol (NP), and octylphenol (OP) in <b>colostrums</b> were quantified with LC/MS/MS. Information for environmental exposure sources of the phenols was obtained by questionnaires. As results, median level of BPA in <b>colostrums</b> was 7. 8 [*]ng/mL, while most NP or OP was not detected. Regarding health risks of phenols, levels of total NP in <b>colostrums</b> were elevated among sick mothers with toxemia, thyroid disorders, gastritis, and so forth than health mothers (3. 51 ± 4. 98 versus 2. 04 ± 3. 71 [*]ng/mL, P= 0. 02). Dairy products intake and detergents use were positively correlated with total BPA levels (Ps< 0. 05). In conclusion, we estimate most neonates who are exposed to BPA rather than NP or OP via <b>colostrums</b> and recommend continuous biomonitoring of the phenols to clarify their suspected health risk on neonates and pregnant or gestation mothers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the S 100 B concentration in <b>colostrums</b> of 51 Burkinabe and 30 Sicilian women, still living in their countries, and in case of a difference to search for its explanations, considering also ethnic differences. The concentration of S 100 B, in <b>colostrums</b> of the first three days from the delivery, was assessed with commercial immunoluminometric assay. The production of <b>colostrums</b> was significantly higher in Burkinabe women, where the <b>colostrums</b> S 100 B levels in the first day of lactation showed to be at 24 h higher than those of Sicilian mothers (672. 21 ± 256. 67 ng/ml vs 309. 36 ± 65. 28 ng/ml) and progressively decreased reaching the values of Sicilian mothers in the second and third day (204. 31 ± 63. 25 ng/ml and 199. 42 ± 45. 28 ng/ml, respectively). Correlation was found between the level of S 100 B and the length of stage II (duration of expulsive phase of delivery), but the correlation with pain was found only in Burkinabe women. The S 100 B level in <b>colostrums</b> of Burkinabe mothers differs from that of Sicilians only in the first day of lactation, and in consideration that Burkinabe women produce more <b>colostrums,</b> their newborns receive, during the first days of life, an higher amount of S 100 B. The elevated quantity of S 100 B ingested by Burkinabe newborn in the first days of life could promote the physiological postnatal brain adaptation and maturation in the precarious delivery condition of African infants. </p...|$|R

25|$|In {{almost all}} mammals, milk is fed to infants through breastfeeding, either {{directly}} or by expressing the milk to be stored and consumed later. The early milk from mammals is called <b>colostrum.</b> <b>Colostrum</b> contains antibodies that provide protection to the newborn baby as well as nutrients and growth factors. The makeup of the <b>colostrum</b> and the period of secretion varies from species to species.|$|E
25|$|Assertions that <b>colostrum</b> {{consumption}} is of adult human benefit are questionable because most components undergo digestion in the mature stomach, including antibodies {{and all other}} proteins.

40|$|The {{intensity}} {{and duration of}} passive immunity against swine leptospirosis were investigated by the microscopic agglutination test and in vitro leptospira growth inhibition. Twenty-one females at first parturition were divided into three groups: Group A (n = 08) : received two doses with 30 days interval of the commercial anti-leptospira bacterin A. Group B (n = 06) received two doses with 30 days interval of the commercial anti-leptospira bacterin B and Group C (n = 07) was the control. In all groups the <b>colostrums</b> were collected. Blood collection of piglets was performed in four different ages. Agglutinin antibodies were equally detected in sera and <b>colostrums</b> for serovars Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Copenhageni, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pomona (Group A) and Canicola, Copenhageni, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona and Hardjo (Group 13).

25|$|For {{a period}} of 20 days post {{parturition}} the cow is called a fresh cow.

This first milk, called <b>colostrum,</b> is rich in fats, protein, and also maternal immune cells. This <b>colostrum</b> is not usually commercially sold, but is extremely important for early calf nutrition. Perhaps most importantly, it conveys passive immunity to the calf before its immune system is fully developed.|$|E
40|$|Fatty acid composition, triglycerides, {{cholesterol}} and tocopherols were determined in <b>colostrums,</b> transitional and mature milk. With progress of lactation, triglycerides and percentage medium chain fatty acids increased whereas tocopherols, {{cholesterol and}} percentage long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased. These changes reflect augmented {{de novo synthesis}} of fatty acids (12 : 0, 14 : 0, 16 : 0 and 18 : 0) in the mammary gland and a tendency of increasing fat globule size as milk matures. Transitional and mature milks but particularly <b>colostrums,</b> contained higher concentrations of components considered {{to be derived from}} the fat-globule membrane (cholesterol, tocopherols, percentage long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids). On the same time, serum concentration of cholesterol, triglycerides, total lipids, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol were estimated and revealed a higher level in older camel.

40|$|Calves become {{infected}} with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) early in life, which frequently results in long-term shedding of the zoonotic pathogen. Little {{is known about}} the animals' immunological status at the time of infection. We assessed the quantity and dynamics of maternal and acquired antibodies to Shiga toxins (Stx 1 and Stx 2), the principal STEC virulence factors, in a cohort of 27 calves. Fecal and serum samples were taken repeatedly from birth until the 24 th week of age. Sera, milk, and <b>colostrums</b> of dams were also assessed. STEC shedding was confirmed by detection of stx in fecal cultures. Stx 1 - and Stx 2 -specific antibodies were quantified by Vero cell neutralization assay and further analyzed by immunoblotting. By the eighth week of age, 13 and 15 calves had at least one stx 1 -type and at least one stx 2 -type positive culture, respectively. Eleven calves had first positive cultures only past that age. Sera and <b>colostrums</b> of all dams and postcolostral sera of all newborn calves contained Stx 1 -specific antibodies. Calf serum titers decreased rapidly within the first 6 weeks of age. Only five calves showed Stx 1 -specific seroconversion. Maternal and acquired Stx 1 -specific antibodies were mainly directed against the StxA 1 subunit. Sparse Stx 2 -specific titers were detectable in sera and <b>colostrums</b> of three dams and in postcolostral sera of their calves. None of the calves developed Stx 2 -specific seroconversion. The results indicate that under natural conditions of exposure, first STEC infections frequently coincide with an absence of maternal and acquired Stx-specific antibodies in the animals' sera...|$|R

This study proposed a CAE control strategy without sacrificing contaminated mothers. Thirty-nine female kids, born to CAE seropositive mothers were isolated from their mothers at birth and fed heat-treated <b>colostrums</b> and pasteurized milk from seronegative goats up to two months of age. All kids were submitted to three-monthly serological tests from birth to 12 months; seropositives were segregated from the herd. The control group consisted of 12 kids born to seropositive mothers that remained with their mothers. Diagnosis was the same, but seropositve animals were not segregated. At the end of 12 months, 34 (87 %) animals from the experimental group remained seronegative with 76 % to 98 % confidence limits; in control group animals, the accumulated negativity rate was 17 %, with 0 % and 38 % confidence limits.

Objective: This paper reveals the growth and nutritional status of 0 - 59 month old children in India and also tries to delineate the responsible socio-economic factors behind nutrition. Methodology: The sample size of this study is 30, 105 which have been collected by the third National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 3). Data on socio-economic backgrounds are gender differences of {{the children}}, place, religion, education and age-group of mothers, wealth index and impact of <b>colostrums</b> on children’s growth and nutrition. Under nutrition has been assessed through the cutoff point of – 2 of the z-score value corresponding to weight for age and height for age. Results: The data show that in India, 35. 7 per cent children are undernourished. By age-group distribution, the maximum occurrence is noticed in the age between 24 - 35 months. More than 50 % occurrences of underweight and stunted children are found in the states of east to central belt of India. It is also found that the distributions of weight and height around the means remain remarkably stable over age. This would appear to indicate that using of <b>colostrums</b> and weaning practices are possibly more important factors than solid food intake. Data reveals that mother’s education and family welfare are the prime factors to regulate the nutritional status of children. The study also reveals that mother’s education, economy, age-groups, and religion have great impact on use of <b>colostrums.</b> Conclusion: Analysis of possible regional and socio-economic factors thought to influence child nutrition outcomes does not reveal any substantive causal relations except for the mother’s educational status and household welfare...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Due to {{inadequate}} data on {{the dynamics}} of {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) infection in buffalo, the present work was aimed at investigating some virological and immunological aspects of FMD virus (FMDV) SAT 2 infection in naturally exposed and vaccinated buffalo cows and their calves. Materials and Methods: The study employed clinical observation and examination, virus isolation in mice brain and cell culture, in addition to virus detection using complement fixation test; indirect sandwitch enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and demonstration of RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for confirmation the results. Results: FMD type SAT 2 antibodies was detected in a protective level by the 1 st week post infection and 3 rd week post vaccination and peak titers were recorded by the 3 rd week, 12 th week in infected and vaccinated buffaloes, respectively. These titers began to decline to reach their lowest protective levels by the 36 th week, 12 nd week in infected and vaccinated buffaloes respectively. The SAT 2 antibodies in calves born to vaccinated and infected buffalo cows were detected on the 1 st day post parturation through the suckling of their Dam’s <b>colostrums.</b> The highest maternal antibody titers were recorded in sera by the 2 nd day post parturation. These antibodies declined gradually to reach their lowest protective levels on 14 th week, 16 th week post parturition in calves rom vaccinated and infected buffaloes, respectively. High antibody titers in the <b>colostrums</b> and milk of vaccinated and naturally infected buffalo cows were recorded at parturition, and they began to decrease gradually recording their lowest protective titers by 10 th and 12 nd week post parturition respectively. Conclusion: FMDV serotype SAT 2 was confirmed as a causative agent of the suspected FMD signs in pregnant buffalo at El-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt, during 2012. Vaccinated and naturally infected buffalo cows were able to provide their calves with high levels of maternal derived antibodies through their <b>colostrums,</b> which could protect new born calves for not less than 14 week post parturation...|$|R

Objective: To find out breastfeeding practices among mothers in Koeri community in Inaruwa of Sunsari district. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Koeri community of Inaruwa Municipality. Total of 205 households were visited in two wards of Inaruwa Municipality to enroll 36 eligible mothers of the community in the study. Verbal consent was obtained. Data was collected by interview technique using semi structured questionnaire and observation of breast feeding. Proportion and percentage were calculated. Results: Meheta, Mahato, Khuswaha, Singh and Kamat castes constituted the Koeri community. They were occupationally involved in farming specially producing vegetables. Ninety-four percent newborns were <b>colostrums</b> fed. Breastfeeding was initiated within half an hour by around 30 % of the mothers.

40|$|Aim: This {{cross-sectional}} study describes {{the practice of}} different myths regarding newborns and maternal physical activity among Saudi women during puerperium. Material and Methods: The study was conducted at Mother and Child Hospital, Buraidah from January to December 2011. Results: The multinomial logistic regression (MRA) on age, education, occupation, parity and mode of delivery was statistically significant (χ 2 (60) = 487. 656, p <. 001). Individuals who were between 25 and 30, had education level primary or below, para 2 - 4 {{were more likely to}} limit household activities. Women in the age group of 25 - 30 were 41 {{times more likely to have}} no exercise. Women with parity 2 - 4 were 24 times more likely to abstain from sex during puerperium as compared to Para 5 and above. Individuals who had a normal vaginal birth were approximately 9 times less likely to be in the kofalaya’sgroup. Individuals below college level education were more likely to believe that breast feeding in front of others may steal mother’s milk. Women below 25 years of age and women with vaginal delivery were more likely to avoid <b>colostrums</b> feeding. Conclusion: Health Education programs are needed to encourage women to increase physical activity during puerperium and encourage breast feeding. Focus groups for improving physical activity should include age group 25 - 30 and women with primary and below level education. Women with cesarean delivery should be counseled against kofalayas and women with vaginal delivery should be encouraged for <b>colostrums</b> feeding...|$|R
40|$|The general {{aim of the}} PhD thesis, {{realised}} at the Department of Animal Science and Food Control (University of Napoli, Federico II, Italy), was {{to study}} animal performance and the nutritional characteristics of meat from Buffalo bred in Italy (Italian Mediterranean Buffalo) fed different diets. The importance {{of this research is}} to give a contribute to better characterize the buffalo infra vitam performance (i. e. weight gain, feed conversion index, etc.) and meat quality (mainly in terms of fatty acids profile). Moreover, the originality of the investigation into the field was the diet composition. In particular, in the first experimental study the use of a leguminosae (faba bean, Vicia faba minor L.), as protein source in the diet of buffalo, was compared to the soya bean meal. The second investigation refers the results obtained using a nutraceutical additive (Aloe arborescens) in the dairy cow buffalo diets to study the influence on the <b>colostrums</b> quality and buffalo veal performance in the early period of life. In the first trial it has been demonstrated that feeding growing buffalo with diet without soybean does not affect either in vivo performances (body weight, daily weight gain and biological efficiency of growth, feed conversion index) or nutritional characteristics of meat. This is very interesting, due to the public concerns about genetically modified feed, as large part of soybean nowadays is. The second trial confirmed the influence of good quality <b>colostrums</b> on the calves growth. Indeed, the addition of Aloe arborescens to the mother’s diet during the last period of pregnancy, significantly increased the immunoglobulin content of <b>colostrums.</b> This result, in addition to determine and adequate passive transfer of immunity, very probably also determined the higher growing performances of calves due to the link of IgG to a number of growth and maturation factors able to increase absorption of nutrients from intestine. Particularly interesting are the results on the fatty acids profile and cholesterol content of buffalo meat. The cholesterol content results lower than those found for the Italian bovine bred specialised for meat production; the contents of myristic, palmitic and stearic acids result significantly lower than those recorded by other authors for young bulls of Chianina bred. To the light of the both high atherogenic and thrombogenic activity of the first two fatty acids and of that only thrombogenic of the stearic acid, we can attribute a favourable judgment to buffalo meat from the dietetic-nutritional point of view. In fact, although the contents of oleic acid and of PUFA of the ω- 6 and ω- 3 series are not particularly high, both the atherogenicity (AI) and the thrombogenicity (TI) index were very low...|$|R
