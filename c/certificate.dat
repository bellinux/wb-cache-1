50|$|Client <b>certificates</b> {{are less}} common than server <b>certificates,</b> {{and are used}} to {{authenticate}} the client connecting to a TLS service, for instance to provide access control. Because most services provide access to individuals, rather than devices, most client <b>certificates</b> contain an email address or personal name rather than a hostname. Also, because authentication is usually managed by the service provider, client <b>certificates</b> are not usually issued by a public CA that provides server <b>certificates.</b> Instead, the operator of a service that requires client <b>certificates</b> will generally operate their own internal CA to issue them. Client <b>certificates</b> are supported by many web browsers, but most services use passwords and cookies to authenticate users, instead of client <b>certificates.</b>|$|R

30|$|The BestLog [5] project {{warned that}} the {{research}} in the field of certification programmes is far more complex than they initially expected. Hence the detection of additional <b>certificates</b> with a logistics focus is very difficult. Although <b>certificates</b> are created by organisations such as the International Organization for Standardisation (ISO), the <b>certificates</b> themselves are mostly granted by licensed companies or associations, which make the collection of logistics <b>certificates</b> very difficult. These companies often also alter official <b>certificates</b> to customise them to special sectors or fields. Furthermore, many national <b>certificates</b> have been adapted to European <b>certificates,</b> making differentiation complicated. Additionally, many <b>certificates</b> affect logistics indirectly, making clear classification even more complicated. All in all, the project found a high diversity of certifications in the market, with an ambiguous degree of focus.|$|R
