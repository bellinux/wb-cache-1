40|$|Abstract. Throughput of {{inventoried}} tags is one {{the most}} important performance parameters for RFID systems. This paper presents an en-hancement for the anti collision protocol for frame slotted ALOHA in RFID systems. It is especially designed for application with known size of the tag population such as in assembly lines <b>or</b> <b>conveyer</b> <b>belts.</b> It ex-ploits the fact of low probability regions of the event space {{and is based on}} restarting a frame after the observation of a part of the whole frame. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated on different tag popula-tions. ...|$|R

25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired setting qualities in the {{finished}} product, a quantity (2–8%, but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) {{is added to the}} clinker, and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement mill. The grinding process is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range, in which typically 15% by mass consists of particles below 5 μm diameter, and 5% of particles above 45 μm. The measure of fineness usually used is the 'specific surface area', which is the total particle surface area of a unit mass of cement. The rate of initial reaction (up to 24 hours) of the cement on addition of water is directly proportional to the specific surface area. Typical values are 320–380m2·kg−1 for general purpose cements, and 450–650m2·kg−1 for 'rapid hardening' cements. The cement is <b>conveyed</b> by <b>belt</b> <b>or</b> powder pump to a silo for storage. Cement plants normally have sufficient silo space for one to 20 weeks of production, depending upon local demand cycles. The cement is delivered to end users either in bags, or as bulk powder blown from a pressure vehicle into the customer's silo. In industrial countries, 80% or more of cement is delivered in bulk.|$|R
