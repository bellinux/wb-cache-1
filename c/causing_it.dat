5|$|June 30, 2010– Hurricane Alex made {{landfall}} at Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas in Mexico {{as a large}} Category2 hurricane, bringing heavy rains, wind, and tornadoes to South Texas.

5|$|Marine {{molluscs}} such as sea hares, cuttlefish, squid and octopuses {{give themselves}} a {{last chance to}} escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to attack the cloud.|$|E

The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the centre}} {{and the eastern}} {{parts of the country}} are mostly flat, the west is mountainous. Both the Andes and Sierras Pampeanas affect the climate of Argentina, leading to {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, and spatial distribution of precipitation depending on the topography and altitude. Here, the Andes exert an important influence on the climate. Owing to the higher altitudes of the Andes north of 40oS, they completely block the normal westerly flow, preventing low pressure systems containing moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in. Thus, much of Argentina north of 40oS is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. South of 40oS, the Andes are lower in altitude, allowing much of Patagonia to be dominated by westerly winds and air masses from the Pacific Ocean. However, the north–south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses originating from the Pacific Ocean. This is because they force these air masses upwards, cooling adiabactically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, causing abundant precipitation and cloudiness while on the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to become drier as it descends. Thus, an extensive rain–shadow is present in much of Patagonia, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to receive very little precipitation. The Sierras Pampeanas influences the climate on a much smaller scale than the Andes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a boarding gate open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt {{to board the}} ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, Ark 4 begins filling with water and is set adrift after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to skim the hull of Ark 6 before drifting off. With Jackson and Noah's help, {{the crew of the}} Ark manages to regain control of the Ark narrowly before it fatally smashes into Mount Everest.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as {{incubators}} for the creatures' offspring. When the marines kill a chestburster, the other aliens are roused and ambush the troops, killing Frost, Crowe, Wierzboswki, and Drake while capturing Apone and Dietrich alive to be cocooned as hosts. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, taking control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Hicks, Private Hudson and Private Vasquez, the only three survivors. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots Spunkmeyer and Ferro, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to crash into the station. The remaining group barricade themselves inside the colony command center.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, astronomers {{believed}} Sakurai's Object to be a slow nova. Later spectroscopic analysis suggested that the star was not a nova, but had instead undergone a very late thermal pulse similar to that of V605 Aquilae, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to vastly expand. V605 Aquilae, which was discovered in 1919, is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and models predict that Sakurai's Object, over the next few decades, will follow a similar life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{the shots}} from the {{northern}} side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> to flood.|$|E
