This paper puts {{forward a}} distributed automation scheme with grounding protection for 10 kV aerial wire, {{which is based}} on the outgoing line and feeder circuit breaker in substation, the intelligent column circuit breaker and the intelligent load switch. Though the outgoing line and feeder circuit breaker in substation, the intelligent column circuit breaker and the load switch cooperating with each other, Which could isolate and exclude the aerial wire transient fault automatically, and isolate the permanent fault immediately. Practical application results show that the application of the scheme have reduced the hours of power failure, reduced maintenance time and improved the stability of the system. At present， 10 kV aerial line is widely used in our country, after coming out through the substation circuit breaker (the <b>column</b> <b>switch</b> are various, but the most widely used is circuit breaker or load switch).

30|$|The {{proposed}} <b>column</b> <b>switch</b> {{method is}} presented in Algorithm 4. The basic idea {{is to use the}} tree search to determine the more difficult half part and use the parallel detections to find the easier half part. The reason behind this idea is that the parallel decoding is more efficient to decode the reliable symbols separately. The more accurate the linear estimation, the faster is the convergence speed for each individual detection branch. On the other hand, the tree search phase is a joint serial detection in nature which is more suitable to decode those unreliable symbols.|$|E
30|$|The 3 D MIMO code {{has been}} shown to be {{efficient}} and robust in distributed MIMO scenarios. Yet, it suffers from high ML decoding complexity. In this paper, we first proposed a new form of the the 3 D MIMO codeword and investigated some important properties of the new codeword. With these properties, the 3 D MIMO code is proven to be fast decodable. Consequently, we proposed a reduced-complexity ML decoder for the 3 D MIMO code which offers the same performance as that of the ML decoder. The simulation results demonstrate that the novel low-complexity decoder yields much less processing time latency than the classical Guo-Nilsson sphere decoder with Schnorr-Euchner enumeration. Moreover, the proposed 2 -by- 2 <b>column</b> <b>switch</b> technique can significantly reduce the average decoding complexity, especially with the 16 -QAM modulation.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a strategy for}} the development of coupled-column liquid chromatographic methods for groups of polar pesticides in environmental water samples. This method is needed in flexible pesticide monitoring programs. The strategy is based on the use of retention data introduced into a computer program; the program calculates conditions for <b>column</b> <b>switching</b> and step-gradient elution. As an example for the validation of this approach, we developed a multiresidue method that is capable of assaying nine polar pesticides: bentazone, DNOC, dinoseb, dinoterb, metamitron, monuron, metribuzin, diuron, and linuron. Using computer simulation, we found proper conditions for the on-line cleanup of extracts by means of <b>column</b> <b>switching</b> and subsequent step-gradient elution for efficient separation of the analytes. The pesticides can be assayed in ground water samples down to a concentration of 0. 1 ppb.

30|$|Using (25), the {{decoding}} sequence can {{be determined}} in two levels. We first compare the aggregate errors {{of the first half}} and second half parts of the symbols (line 2 in Algorithm 4). The half with worse accuracy is assigned to the tree search (put {{in the latter part of}} the decoding sequence). Consequently, within this half part, the errors of the first two symbols and the second two are compared. The two symbols with worse accuracy are put closer to the root of the tree. If this two-symbol-by-two-symbol exchange takes place in the second half of the symbols which are to be decoded using the tree search, the same two-symbol-by-two-symbol exchange should be done accordingly in the other half in order to maintain the structure of the R matrix. If only the symbol exchange between the two halves of the symbols is carried out, it is referred to as ‘ 4 -by- 4 column switch’. Otherwise, if the exchange within each half is also performed, it is called ‘ 2 -by- 2 column switch’. The advantage of the <b>column</b> <b>switch</b> will be shown in the next section.|$|E

Due to little or no repair of DNA-phosphate adducts, these adducts may offer {{increased}} possibilities of both identifying and quantifying DNA adducts. The formation of DNA-phosphate adducts leads to a complete esterification of the phosphate group giving rise to a phosphotriester configuration. This work consists of the characterization of ethyl phosphotriesters (Ethyl PTE) using miniaturized LC-ESI-MS/MS and column switching in enzymatic hydrolysate of DNA treated in vitro with the model compound N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). In vitro ENU-treated DNA was enzymatically degraded using nuclease P 1, phosphodiesterase, and alkaline phosphatase. The use of <b>column</b> <b>switch</b> allowed for large-volume injections, where unmodified nucleosides were discarded in the loading step. The analytes were forward flushed to the analytical column in the eluting step and separated using a linear gradient. Ten different ethyl PTEs (dGpEtdG, dApEtdA, dCpEtdC, TpEtT, dGpEtdA, dGpEtdC, dGpEtT, dApEtdC, dApEtT, and dCpEtT) were characterized by their masses and CAD product ion spectra. Measurements of accurate masses were carried out yielding experimental masses within 5 ppm of the calculated masses for 9 of the 10 ethyl PTEs. For comparison, the enzymatic hydrolysate of ENU-treated DNA was subjected to transalkylation of the DNA-phosphate adducts by cob(I) alamin.

The mobile phase comprised 0. 1 % acetic acid- 0. 2 mmol ammonium acetate in water (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The flow rate is 0. 2 mL/min. The analytes were detected by a LC-MS 2010 single quadrupole mass spectrometer instrument equipped with an electrospray ionization interface using selective ion monitoring positive mode. A "post cut" <b>column</b> <b>switch</b> technique was incorporated into the method to remove interferences of earlier and later eluting matrix components than entecavir and internal standard, including salting-out reagent used in sample pre-processing. The method was validated over the concentration range of 0. 05 - 20 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precision of the assay, {{as measured by the}} coefficient of variation (%CV), was within 3. 59 %, and the intra-day assay accuracy was found to be within 4. 88 %.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the creative, technological, and philosophical means and methodology, by which technology artists and researchers can materially and sculpturally transform physical computing technology from hard, remotely-designed, plastic shells, into intimately created, sensual computing objects and artifacts. It {{asserts that the}} rigid, square, and prefabricated physical materials of computing technology are a fundamental technological and artistic limitation to anyone who wishes to sensually transform physical computing technology, or develop a rich artistic vocabulary for it. Smart and active sculptural computing materials are presented {{as a solution to}} this problem. Practically, smart computing materials reduce the number of separate, rigid, and square prefabricated parts required to create physical computing objects. Artistically, active sculptural computing materials give artists and designers the ability to directly manipulate, shape, experiment with, and therefore aesthetically understand the real, physical materials of computing technology. Such active design materials will also enable creative people to develop a meaningful artistic relationship between physical form and computation. The total contributions of this thesis include a proposal for a future three-dimensional design/technology practice, a portfolio of sensually transformed expressive computational objects (including new physical interfaces, electronic fashions, and embroidered musical instruments), and the smart and active sculptural computing materials and processes (in this case smart textiles), which make that transformation possible. Projects from the design portfolio include: The Triangles, and its applications; Electronic Fashions, including the Firefly Dress and Necklace, New Year's Eve Ball Gown, and Serial Suit; The Musical Jacket; Electronic Tablecloths; and a series of Embroidered Musical Instruments with embroidered pressure sensors.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents the}} study and integration of <b>column</b> <b>switching</b> {{in the analysis of}} biological and environmental compounds. Areas of study in this work include: the determination of MHPG in human urine, the determination of atrazine and its degradation products in water, studies of binding site heterogeneity in split-peak chromatography and chromatographic immunoassays, and optimization of a chemiluminescent reaction for use in HPLC post-column detection. ^ The studies with MHPG (3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylethylene glycol) resulted in a method for determination of total and free MHPG in urine using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) with electrochemical detection. The chromatographic separation was made faster by the using of <b>column</b> <b>switching</b> to remove any late eluting peaks that would increase analysis time significantly. ^ The determination of atrazine and its degradation products used of <b>column</b> <b>switching</b> to couple, high performance immunoaffinity chromatography (HPIAC) and RPLC. The results of the HPIAC/RPLC method agreed well with the results of a reference GC/MS method. In addition, the HPIAC/RPLC was shown to be able to quantitate these compounds at the parts-per-trillion range in water. ^ The theoretical studies of heterogeneity showed that binding site variations can affect split-peak adsorption behavior. Simulations suggested a linear equation describing such behavior. Simulations and experiments showed that the presence of a slow binding site decreases the amount of solute adsorbed to the column under all conditions. ^ For a sequential addition immunoassay (SAIA), computer simulations predicted that heterogeneity results in a larger dynamic range for sample quantitation. However, heterogeneity generally resulted in small changes in the assay results versus those obtained in homogeneous assays. Thus heterogeneity in the stationary phase, should not be a great hindrance in the use and performance of these assays. ^ The last topic, the optimization of the chemiluminescence reaction of acridinium esters for post-column determinations was performed for the detection of labeled compounds can be determined at sub-attomole levels. The optimal levels determined for phenyl acridinium esters were 1 M sodium hydroxide, 0. 02 % (w/v) hydrogen peroxide and 1 % (w/v) Triton X- 100.

The loading mobile phase (MP) containing acetonitrile (AcN) – H 2 O – formic acid (FA) (2 : 97. 95 : 0. 05, v/v/v) was delivered isocratically at a flow rate of 0. 200 mL/min. Manual injections of 200 μL were made with an external loop, and the samples were loaded on a HotSep Tracy column (Kromasil C 18; 5 x 1 mm (inner diameter (ID)), 5 μm). After a loading time of 3. 5 min the analytes were back flushed from the pre-column and transferred to the separation column, a HotSep Kromasil C 18 column (50 x 0. 3 mm (ID), 3. 5 μm), using an eluent consisting of AcN – H 2 O (gradient) with 20 mM NH 4 +HCOO- and 0. 05 % FA added, delivered at a flow rate of 0. 005 mL/min. In-line UV detection was performed at 210 nm. The limits of detection (LOD) were ~ 10 ng/mL for bradykinin and below 1 ng/mL for angiotensin II. The robustness {{of the system is}} discussed. An isocratic and a gradient eluting nano LC-UV system and a <b>column</b> <b>switching</b> gradient nano LC-UV method, all with a Kromasil C 18 nanocolumn (150 x 0. 1 mm (ID), 3. 5 μm), were developed for bradykinin determination. The signal responses for bradykinin dissolved in H 2 O and 20 % AcN with FA added in different amounts were compared using direct infusion electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (direct infusion-ESI-TOF-MS) at different capillary voltages. The ratio of theoretical dilution of two different capillary columns was calculated and compared to the experimental dilution ratio obtained with those columns using capillary RPLC coupled to an electrospray time-of flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF-MS) ...|$|R
