A further referendum {{will be needed to}} approve 300 million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission. The Swiss have also been under EU and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and to raise tax rates to parity with the EU. Preparatory discussions are being opened in four new areas: opening up the electricity market, participation in the European GNSS project Galileo, cooperating with the European centre for disease prevention and recognising <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for food products.|$|E

With government-issued <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> Japanese rice produced outside the prefectures Chiba, Fukushima prefecture, Gunma, Ibaraki, Niigata, Nagano, Miyagi, Saitama, Tokyo, Tochigi and Saitama {{was allowed to}} be exported. In the first shipment 140.000 tons of Hokkaido rice of the 2011 harvest was sold to China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Some nations, such as Switzerland, and West Germany, {{which were}} not UN members, {{conducted}} business legally with Rhodesia – the latter remained the Smith government's largest trading partner in Western Europe until 1973, when Bonn joined the UN. Japan continued to accept more Rhodesian exports than any other nation, and Iran provided oil. The Portuguese government marketed Rhodesian products as its own, via false <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and disguised trade channels. South Africa openly refused to observe the UN sanctions. A 1971 amendment passed in the United States permitted American firms to go on importing Rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal.|$|E

25|$|Israel {{also took}} {{a series of steps}} to evade the embargo and clandestinely trade with the Arab world. Front {{companies}} in third countries were set up, which imported goods, then re-exported them to Arab countries with false labels and <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> In other cases, foreign companies would purchase Israeli technology and materials, use them to assemble completed products, and export them to Arab countries while concealing this fact from their customers. Arrangements with American companies were worked out where the American companies would buy goods from Israeli affiliates and export them as American-made goods. Israeli ships were re-flagged as ships of other nations and provided with faked bills of landing so they could directly export goods to the Arab and Muslim world. Greece and Cyprus were particularly popular hubs for smuggling Israeli goods into the Arab world due to their location, multilateral economic connections, large merchant fleets, and Cyprus' corporate and bank secrecy laws.|$|E
6000|$|Let me ask the House {{to examine}} this {{proposal}} for a moment. Has any serious, civilised Government--I ask for information--ever been to the pains and trouble of erecting round their coasts a tariff, with all its complications, with the need of exacting <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> on every class of goods, with the need of demanding strict assessment of all commodities brought to their shores--has any nation ever erected the vast and complicated network which {{would be involved in}} such a duty, simply for the paltry purpose of imposing a duty of 1 per cent.? I say there is no argument and no reason for such a course, and the only argument which could justify it is the argument used by Dr. Smartt at the Colonial Conference when he said (page 514 of the Blue Book), [...] "The foreigner pays, and we do not." [...] Mr. Deakin felt the force of the objection which would be entertained in this country to introducing such a tariff as the right hon. gentleman has proposed, simply for fiscal purposes, and he proceeded to say that Great Britain, if she was a party to such a bargain, should be permitted to raise the money in her own way, and to contribute her proportion to the common fund. That was a great concession to the self-government of the Mother Country.|$|E
50|$|Non-{{preferential}} <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are {{the most}} common type of certificate.

30|$|All the {{responses}} can be summarised as follows: It {{would be a}} positive approach that the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> issued by country B would state the originating country of the main ingredient and provide an authenticated photocopy <b>of</b> the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the main ingredient released by country A. If the main ingredient origin is stated on the label, this information should be shown on commercial documents. However, an authenticated photocopy <b>of</b> the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the main ingredient issued by country A cannot guarantee that the origin statement on the label would be truthful, and importing country C might need another method to verify the origin if it would damage consumers’ interests.
