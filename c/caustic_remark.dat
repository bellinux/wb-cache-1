In particular, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (1967) and [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen web site (...) [...] Perhaps the most <b>caustic</b> <b>remark</b> about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham.

2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your <b>caustic</b> <b>remark.</b> I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E

60|$|It {{might be}} the dread of Arthur's being annoyed, as she watched him looking very pale and spiritless from fatigue, which made her {{perceive}} that all dinner-time Matilda was overwhelming him with a torrent of affected nonsense--or at least what Violet would have thought so in any one but her highly-respected eldest sister; and she feared, too, {{that he could not}} admire the girlish airs and graces which did not become that sharpened figure and features. She had not known how much more Matilda talked than any one else; even her father only put in a <b>caustic</b> <b>remark</b> here and there, when Matilda WOULD know all Lord St. Erme's and Lady Lucy's views and habits. Mrs. Moss was silenced whenever her low voice tried to utter a sentence. Annette, quiet and gentle as ever, looked drooping and subdued, and scarcely spoke, while the two fine blooming girls, who seemed like new acquaintance, were still as mice in awe and shyness. Caroline, the second sister, was married and settled in Canada; and the three blanks that weddings had made only now impressed themselves on her mind as a novelty.|$|E

60|$|The sun of {{that same}} day going down, dusk was saluted as usual at the hotel by an {{instantaneous}} sparkle of electric lights. The hours between dinner and bedtime were always difficult enough to kill, and the night after the dance they were further tarnished by the peevishness of dissipation. Certainly, {{in the opinion of}} Hirst and Hewet, who lay back in long arm-chairs {{in the middle of the}} hall, with their coffee-cups beside them, and their cigarettes in their hands, the evening was unusually dull, the women unusually badly dressed, the men unusually fatuous. Moreover, when the mail had been distributed half an hour ago there were no letters for either of the two young men. As every other person, practically, had received two or three plump letters from England, which they were now engaged in reading, this seemed hard, and prompted Hirst to make the <b>caustic</b> <b>remark</b> that the animals had been fed. Their silence, he said, reminded him of the silence in the lion-house when each beast holds a lump of raw meat in its paws. He went on, stimulated by this comparison, to liken some to hippopotamuses, some to canary birds, some to swine, some to parrots, and some to loathsome reptiles curled round the half-decayed bodies of sheep. The intermittent sounds--now a cough, now a horrible wheezing or throat-clearing, now a little patter of conversation--were just, he declared, what you hear if you stand in the lion-house when the bones are being mauled. But these comparisons did not rouse Hewet, who, after a careless glance round the room, fixed his eyes upon a thicket of native spears which were so ingeniously arranged as to run their points at you whichever way you approached them. He was clearly oblivious of his surroundings; whereupon Hirst, perceiving that Hewet's mind was a complete blank, fixed his attention more closely upon his fellow-creatures. He was too far from them, however, to hear what they were saying, but it pleased him to construct little theories about them from their gestures and appearance.|$|E

50|$|Since his debut, Panousis has {{introduced}} a controversial style of rock music with humorous and sarcastic lyrics.

5000|$|For all his tribulations {{with the}} Press, O'Rahilly confessed himself well {{satisfied}} with the enterprise: scholarly works had been published, young writers encouraged and the academic status of the College had been enhanced. The books displayed in the public showcases on campus constituted [...] "a fine record of publications". A generation later, commentators were less starry-eyed. While the <b>caustic</b> <b>remark</b> of one academic ("what the Press has published has largely depended on what the post has brought in") seems excessively harsh, the more measured comment of a College officer pointed to [...] "several successes and also to a number which we prefer to forget".|$|E

5000|$|The novel {{tells the}} story of two sisters who work in a Parisian {{book-binding}} factory. Huysmans had inherited such a factory from his mother on her death in 1876, allowing him to observe the lives of his employees at close quarters. The plot concentrates on the unhappy love affairs of the sisters of the title, Céline and Désirée. Céline lives with an artist called Cyprien Tibaille - whose <b>caustic</b> <b>remarks</b> reflect Huysmans' own opinions - before leaving him for a man who beats her. Her more timid sister's relationship with the ineffectual Auguste also comes to nothing.

Though Biswajeet was a hero for a long time, he was never portrayed as a very masculine hero. So when he put on a female disguise and sang [...] "Kajra Mohabbat Wala", the audience received it with wolf whistles, knowing very well that he was a man! I remember that one of the film magazines made a very <b>caustic</b> <b>remark</b> that if Biswajeet were to stick to these kind of roles, he would be much more successful.
