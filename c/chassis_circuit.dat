40|$|Electronic {{equipment}} {{has been}} applied to virtually every area associated with commercial, in-dustrial, and military applications. Specifically, electronics have been incorporated into avionics com-ponents installed in aircraft. This equipment is exposed to dynamic loads such as vibration, shock, and acceleration. Especially, avionics components installed in a helicopter are subjected to simulta-neous sine and random base excitations. These are denoted as sine on random vibrations according to MIL-STD- 810 F, Method 514. 5. In the past, isolators have been applied to avionics components to reduce vibration and shock. However, an isolator applied to an avionics component installed in a helicopter can amplify the vibration magnitude, and damage the <b>chassis,</b> <b>circuit</b> card assembly, and the isolator itself via resonance at low-frequency sinusoidal vibrations. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the dynamic characteristics of an avionics component installed in a helicopter and the structural dynamic modification of its tray plate without an isolator using both a finite element anal-ysis and experiments. The structure is optimized by dynamic loads that are selected by comparing the vibration, shock, and acceleration loads using vibration and shock response spectra. A finite ele-ment model(FEM) was constructed using a simplified geometry and valid element types that reflec...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A compact {{dual-band}} MIMO {{coupling element}} based antenna with high port isolation is {{proposed for the}} first time. The proposed antenna comprises four nonresonant coupling elements, the matching <b>circuit,</b> <b>chassis</b> of the mobile terminal, and de-coupling structures. The proposed antenna can cover two working bands of E-GSM 900 and PCS 1900. The measured {{results show that the}} isolation between the coupling elements operating at the same frequency is higher than 20 dB. The proposed structure {{can be applied to the}} MIMO system. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>chassis.</b> CMOS <b>circuits</b> {{were used}} {{wherever}} possible to reduce power consumption, and therefore, the dissipated heat. We have developed anew power supply controller which would combine 20 -bit precision, simple interfacing, and versatile software control. It performs many tasks internal {{to the power}} supply and also communicates with an external host computer. Parameters can be entered and/or read over a serial link {{using one of the}} 82 command words [l]. In addition, an optional remote control panel can be located up to thousands of feet away. This new controller will reduce the software dcvclopment time normally spent by the user, while increasing the reliability of the system. The cost is less than buying the equivalent separate CAMAC system. Nonvolatile memory remembers all configuration data; one generic controller can thus be programmed to use anywhere from the smallest power supply to the largest. We are presently building 22 power supplies using these controllers. They will be used at the Clinton P. Anderso...|$|R
50|$|The circuit {{hosted the}} final round of the World Superbike Championship on 2 November 2008. On 9 June, the track was {{confirmed}} to host a round of the 2008-09 A1 Grand Prix season. The race was set for the weekend of 12 April 2009. On 10 October 2008, the Le Mans Series announced a 1000 km night race to be held at Algarve on 2 August 2009. On 5 November 2008, the FIA GT Championship announced and 7th round of the 2009 season will be held at Algarve on 13 September 2009. A Formula One test session, with the McLaren and Honda teams participating, was scheduled for 15-17 December 2008. Ferrari also ran at Algarve. Toyota also tested at the circuit on 20 January 2009 in the first outing of their new TF109 <b>chassis.</b> The <b>circuit</b> will also host {{the final round}} of the 2009 GP2 Series season in September 2009. From 2010 it will host a round of the FIA World Touring Car Championship.|$|R
50|$|Luyendyk's win {{marked the}} lone victory for Lola at the Indy 500 in the 1980s and 1990s. Lola {{returned}} to Indy in 1983 with Mario Andretti, and {{quickly became a}} competitive <b>chassis</b> on the <b>circuit.</b> Despite the manufacturer's high level of success in the sport during that period, which saw them quickly displace March as the prominent customer chassis, Lola failed to ever win at Indy again. The only previous victories to their credit at Indy were with Graham Hill in 1966 and with Al Unser, Sr. in a modified Lola Chaparral in 1978. They would be upstaged numerous times by March, Penske and Reynard, until ceasing participation at Indy after 1996.|$|R
5|$|Three {{days after}} the accident, series {{organizers}} announced that the race would {{be the subject of}} a full investigation. The other members of the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States (ACCUS), the national governing body of automobile racing in the United States, {{and a member of the}} FIA made their resources available for the investigation, which IndyCar officials expected to take several weeks. As all ACCUS/FIA members participated in the investigation, IndyCar would have full use of the NASCAR R Center in Concord, North Carolina. In the meantime, all testing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was cancelled indefinitely; Franchitti and Chip Ganassi Racing had been planning to test the 2012-spec Dallara <b>chassis</b> at the <b>circuit</b> in the week following the race.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} silverface Twin Reverbs, {{along with}} all other silverface models, had an aluminum frame (trim) surrounding the sparkling blue grillcloth from late 1967 to 1969. Early silverface amplifiers made between 1967 and 1968 had black lines on the brushed aluminum faceplate, still retaining the '60s [...] "tailed" [...] design on the amp logo, installed on the upper {{left side of the}} grillcloth. This feature was offered on models produced prior to the [...] "tailless" [...] period in 1973. Some later models came with an unusual silver grillcloth with sparkling orange threads ("orange sparkle"); a black grillcloth was even fitted on some production runs. During the silverface period, the Twin Reverb's <b>chassis</b> and AA769 <b>circuit</b> was shared by the Dual Showman Reverb, effectively producing the Twin Reverb in a head form, although the matching speaker cabinet for the Dual Showman Reverb sported a pair of 15-inch JBL speakers rather than 12-inch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{team was}} forced to {{withdraw}} from the second pre-season test in Barcelona when Romain Grosjean complained about a [...] "strange" [...] feeling in the chassis while driving on the opening morning of the test. The team gave no official diagnosis of the problem at the time, but speculation within the media suggested the problem was related to the front suspension and that the problem presented itself at the Circuit de Catalunya because of the higher lateral loads placed on the <b>chassis</b> at the <b>circuit</b> than those experienced at Jerez. James Allison, the team's technical director, later confirmed that the team had identified the problem as being the mounting of the upper front wishbone on the rear suspension arm. Grosjean had been testing the chassis designated E20-02 at the time; the chassis E20-01 was returned to the team's Enstone facility following completion of testing at Jerez. Upon discovering the problem, Lotus initially prepared chassis E20-01 to be transported to Barcelona to complete the test, but simulations revealed that the problem was also present on E20-01, and so the team decided {{to withdraw from the}} remainder of the test with immediate effect. The problem was then corrected in time for the team to start the season.|$|R
5000|$|... "The chassis of the Wheldon's#77 {{impacted}} a post {{along the}} right-side {{of the tub}} and created a deep defect in the tub that extended from the pedal bulkhead, along the upper border of the tub, and through the cockpit. As the race car passed by, the pole intruded into the cockpit and made contact with the drivers' helmet and head. Dan's injury was limited to his head injury. Dan appeared to suffer two distinct head forces. The first head force created a level of Head Injury Criterion, {{also known as a}} HIC number, that normally does not produce any injury. During the initial crash sequence, the accident data recorder measured 12 or 13 impacts. During that timeframe one of those impacts measured a measurable HIC number for Dan - that's the number that does not normally cause injury. The number was low enough. The second force was a physical impact, and it was the second force that caused a non-survivable blunt force injury trauma to Dan's head." [...] Brian Barnhart, detailing the sequence of events surrounding the accident in the official report on Wheldon's death. Three days after the accident, series organizers announced that the race would be the subject of a full investigation. The other members of the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States (ACCUS), the national governing body of automobile racing in the United States, {{and a member of the}} FIA made their resources available for the investigation, which IndyCar officials expected to take several weeks.

5000|$|Nigel Mansell went {{even faster}} on Saturday with a 1:19.495 {{and took his}} sixth pole {{position}} of the season. Mansell later described his time as a [...] "totally clear lap". Riccardo Patrese improved to qualify second fastest, however he was held up by Bertrand Gachot {{on one of his}} qualifying laps, and reacted by heading over to the Larrousse pit and trying to punch the Frenchman. Ayrton Senna finished qualifying third on the grid despite spinning the rear of his car into the tyre barrier at the Mirabeau corner, damaging both his rear suspension and wing which eventually broke off in the tunnel as Senna returned his damaged car to the pits. Stefano Modena suffered a drive shaft failure early in the session and ran back to his pit to use the spare Jordan. In the spare car he failed to improve on his Friday time and dropped to 21st on the grid. Modena was the only driver who did not set a faster time in Saturday Qualifying. Following his crash in the morning Pierluigi Martini still took part in the afternoon session in the spare Dallara and qualified 18th fastest. Having finished 20th fastest on Thursday Roberto Moreno only managed to improve slightly on his Thursday time with a 1:24.945 due to [...] "a string of mechanical problems" [...] with the S921 <b>chassis.</b> With the <b>circuit</b> proving faster on Saturday Moreno fell to 26th place {{by the end of the}} session. Eric van de Poele set his fastest time in the final minutes of qualifying but just failed to make 26th place as he was +0.036 seconds slower than Moreno's Andrea Moda. Formula 1 journalist Joe Saward reported there was [...] "rejoicing" [...] in the Andrea Moda pit upon Moreno's qualification for the race.|$|R
