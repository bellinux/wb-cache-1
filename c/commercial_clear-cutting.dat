Due to intensive commercial logging in the Kologrivsky {{area in the}} 20th century, this type of forest has been giving way to successional species of birch, aspen and alder. (Before 1960, 80% of the area was covered with dark conifers.) Today, most of the reserve is forested, but the actual islands of old-growth southern taiga are relatively small and scattered. The largest virgin stand of southern taiga in the Kologrivsky Reserve is only 918 ha. A key purpose of the reserve, therefore, is to regenerate the surrounding forest from <b>commercial</b> <b>clear-cutting,</b> through the secondary forest types and ultimately preserve a mature forest. [...] The large northern sector (the Kologrivsky site) is predominantly a spruce forest, where virgin stands are inter-mingled with second-growth forests on the sites of windfalls and wildfires. The largest spruces are 45 m in height; the lower stories include Norway maple (Acer platanoides) and Mountain elm. Some logging was done on a selective basis 75-100 years ago, but the under story was left intact; these plots have the highest biodiversity today. The Kologrivsky sector is scientifically useful for studying the dynamics of forest regeneration under various conditions. [...] Scientists on the reserve have recorded 495 species of vascular plants. [...] The animal life of the reserve {{is a mixture of}} boreal forest and mixed deciduous forest. Although the fauna is mostly representative of the Kostroma region, there are recently introduced species. The terrain, with many small slopes and soft soil favors burrowing animals such as shrews, moles, and badgers; and the extensive network of small streams and ponds supports large populations of beaver, mink and otter. The sharp continental climate with cold winters reduces the number of wintering birds and large mammals. The small number of swamps in the reserve limits waterfowl. Extensive fields of ref bilberry do support some birds and bears.|$|E
