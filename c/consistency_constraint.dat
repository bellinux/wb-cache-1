40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{strategy}} for efficient geometrical verification in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image matching. First, considering the complex transformation model between correspondence set in the image-space, feature points of initial candidate matches are projected onto an elevation plane in the object-space, with assistant of UAV flight control data and camera mounting angles. Spatial relationships are simplified as a 2 D-translation in which a motion establishes the relation of two correspondence points. Second, a hierarchical motion <b>consistency</b> <b>constraint,</b> termed HMCC, is designed to eliminate outliers from initial candidate matches, which includes three major steps, namely the global direction <b>consistency</b> <b>constraint,</b> the local direction-change <b>consistency</b> <b>constraint</b> and the global length <b>consistency</b> <b>constraint.</b> To cope with scenarios with high outlier ratios, the HMCC is achieved by using a voting scheme. Finally, an efficient geometrical verification strategy is proposed by using the HMCC as a pre-processing step to increase inlier ratios before the consequent application of the basic RANSAC algorithm. The performance of the proposed strategy is verified through comprehensive comparison and analysis by using real UAV datasets captured with different photogrammetric systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated motions have noticeable separation ability, and the HMCC-RANSAC algorithm can efficiently eliminate outliers based on the motion <b>consistency</b> <b>constraint,</b> with a speedup ratio reaching to 6 for oblique UAV images. Even though the completeness sacrifice of approximately 7 percent of points is observed from image orientation tests, competitive orientation accuracy is achieved from all used datasets. For geometrical verification of both nadir and oblique UAV images, the proposed method can be a more efficient solution. Comment: 31 pages; 11104 word...|$|E
