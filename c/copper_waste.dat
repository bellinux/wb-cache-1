Electronic waste, especially waste print circuit boards contain large amounts of copper, which not only bring greater ecological threat, but also cause a serious <b>waste</b> of <b>copper</b> resources. Therefore, the study on clean, effective copper leaching technology has a very important practical significance to reduce environmental hazards of waste print circuit board and resources recycling. Hydrometallurgical is a better technology for recycling <b>copper</b> from <b>waste</b> print circuit boards. In this article, hydrometallurgical copper recovery system is divided into four categories: acid leaching, ammonia - ammonium leaching, chloride leaching, as well as other ways of leaching. The advantages and disadvantages of leaching of copper system are analyzed in the process of copper resource utilization. Studies abound on recycling <b>copper</b> from copper-containing <b>waste</b> with citric acid and other complexing agents as the leaching reagent, but studies on recycling <b>copper</b> from <b>waste</b> print circuit boards are rarely reported, which can be used for reference.

This work proposes an optimization metho dology for their management, applied {{to the case of}} copper in France. Four criteria are identified to assess management strategies: cost, environmental impacts, energy consumption and resource losses. The first step of this methodology is the analysis of the current situation, by modelling the French copper cycle from 2000 to 2009. This analysis showed that France imp orts almost all of its needs as refined copper, and has an underdevelop ed recycling industry. Following these initial results, the problematic of <b>copper</b> <b>wastes,</b> including recycling, has been investigated. A recycled flow modelling strategy has been developed, based on the construction of flowsheets. The general mathematical formulation of the problem is then defined. It is a non-linear, mixed and a priori multiobjective problem, with a strong equality constraint (mass conservation). A review of optimization methods has led to choose a genetic algorithm (GA). An alternative was also proposed to solve the multiobjective problem with linear programming, by linearizing it under constraint. This work has highlighted the necessity of developing an effective recycling field of wastes from electric and electronic equipment in France. It also showed that the <b>copper</b> contained in <b>wastes</b> does not meet the demand, so that France needs to import copper, preferably as scraps...|$|R

The vineyard Mollisol copper uptake (55 mg Cu kg(- 1) of dry mass) in the shoots was significantly improved upon inoculation of oatmeal plants with isolate A 2 (128 mg of Cu kg(- 1) of shoot dry mass). Overall oatmeal plant biomass displayed higher potential of copper phytoextraction with inoculation of rhizosphere bacteria in vineyard soil to the extent that 404 and 327 g ha(- 1) of copper removal were respectively observed in vineyard Mollisol bioaugmented with isolate A 2 (S. maltophilia) and isolate A 6 (A. calcoaceticus).

40|$|World-wide, {{acid rock}} {{drainage}} (ARD) {{is one of the}} biggest environmental challenges facing environments with current or previously active mining activities. Formed from the exposure of sulphide mineral to both water and air, and catalyzed by naturally occurring iron- and sulphur-oxidizing micro-organisms, ARD pollution is predominantly associated with the mining of sulphidic ores and coal. Of particular concern are the large volumes of mining wastes from which the generation of ARD and the associated pollution effects often persist over tens to hundreds of years after mining operations have ceased. Current ARD management strategies focus on the prevention of ARD through mineral waste deposition or remediation options once ARD has formed. These strategies, however, do not remove the risk of ARD generation in the future. The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of the potential for ARD generation from a low-grade <b>copper</b> <b>waste</b> rock through the accelerated removal of the sulphur components via reaction.

40|$|Circuit boards, {{which can}} be found in {{practically}} every electric appliance and which, consequently, are produced in large quantities, are made in a very sophisticated, complex procedure comprising many steps, especially for multilayer boards. As the production of circuit boards means wet chemical processes, the volumes of waste products and liquid effluents arising can be quite considerable. Analyses of mass conversions and mass flows in each individual process step are required if environmental pollution is to be estimated and evaluated. This study therefore has been conducted to elucidate and assess quantitatively the inventories and the further history of important materials in specific steps of printed circuit production. Special emphasis was put on the mass flows of copper. The most important <b>copper</b> <b>waste</b> volumes arose from copper-bearing etching solutions, which took some 45 % (some 2200 t) of the total copper inventory from the manufacturing process. In 1993, roughly 99 % of the copper-bearing etching solutions were reprocessed externally by third companies, partly abroad. The recycling procedures currently available in-house for reprocessing metal waste do not permit such waste to be returned into the circuit board manufacturing process. The reason is that the quality of recycled copper obtained in internal electrolytic processing is not sufficient for material to be reused in manufacturing printed circuit boards. The liquid effluent of resist processing, which is highly polluted with organics, has been brought down to the legal COD limit of 600 mg O_ 2 /l by dilution with other liquid effluents after liquid effluent treatment.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 A {{proposed}} copper mine in Arizona has {{the potential}} to be the largest copper producing mine in North America. It is expected to produce over a billion pounds of copper per year, and individually produce more than half of the United State's demand for copper. The operation claims to be more sustainable than previous operations by being more efficient with their use of water, energy and material resources. An embodied energy, or EMERGY analysis, was used to evaluate the sustainability of the proposed copper mining operation. The post-mining externalized annual energy cost of <b>copper</b> <b>waste</b> management for previous operations had an EMERGY value of 1. 50 E+ 22 solar emjoules per year (sej/yr); the proposed mine plans to internalize the cost of waste management during operation by containing and reusing waste, resulting in an estimated annual EMERGY cost of 6. 00 E+ 18 sej/yr. These results indicate that the proposed method of waste management will potentially be more sustainable than past mining operations in terms of embodied energy cost savings. A 1992 copper mine required 7. 35 E+ 23 sej/yr for annual energy resource investment; the proposed mine is estimated to require 5. 85 E+ 20 sej/yr. These results indicated that the proposed mine will use energy resources more efficiently than old copper mining operations. However, these results do not account for the impacts of subsidence on water and land resources, nor do they account for other potential impacts of deep mining extraction that may occur as a result of the proposed mining operation.
