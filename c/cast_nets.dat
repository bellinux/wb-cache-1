25|$|The {{family is}} highly {{important}} to fisheries throughout the Indo-Pacific, with {{species such as}} the northern whiting, Japanese whiting, and King George whiting forming the basis of major fisheries throughout their range. Many species are also of major importance to small subsistence fisheries, while others {{are little more than}} occasional bycatch. Smelt-whitings are caught by a number of methods, including trawling, seine nets, and <b>cast</b> <b>nets.</b> In Australia and Japan in particular, members of the family are often highly sought by recreational fishermen who also seek the fish for their prized flesh.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} whiting, Sillago sihama (also {{known as}} the silver whiting and sand smelt), is a marine fish, the most widespread and abundant member of the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. The northern whiting was the first species of sillaginid scientifically described and is therefore the type species of both the family Sillaginidae and the genus Sillago. The species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific region from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Indonesia in the east, also becoming an invasive species to the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. The northern whiting inhabits coastal areas to 60 m, but is most often found in shallow water around bays and estuaries, often entering freshwater. It is a carnivore, taking a variety of polychaetes and crustaceans. The species is of major economic importance throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is most frequently taken by seine nets and <b>cast</b> <b>nets</b> and marketed fresh.|$|E
2500|$|Sillaginids {{are taken}} {{by a variety of}} fishing methods, with inshore catches {{predominantly}} taken using beach seine nets and <b>cast</b> <b>nets.</b> Due to the alert nature of sillaginids, skill is required on creeping up quietly {{enough to be able to}} net fish with a cast net, with experienced fishers often paddling into the sun toward a school and drifting slowly upon it before casting the net. In deeper waters, commercial trawlers and longliners take the most fish, with a number of sillaginids taken in prawn trawls as bycatch. The fish are normally marketed fresh locally under various names, with [...] "Ashuos" [...] commonly used in many countries for various sillaginids. At least one export fishery exists in Australia whereby S. flindersi is exported to Thailand where the fish are repackaged and sent to Japan frozen.|$|E

2500|$|In Burma, in {{the upper}} reaches of the Ayeyarwady River, Irrawaddy {{dolphins}} drive fish towards fishers using <b>cast</b> <b>nets</b> in response to acoustic signals from them. The fishermen attempt to grasp the attention of the dolphins through various efforts such as using a cone-shaped wood stick to drum the side of their canoe, striking their paddles to the surface of the water, jingling their nets, or making calls that sound turkey-like. A herd of dolphins, who agree to work alongside the fisherman, will entrap a school of fish in a semi-circle, guiding them towards the boat. In return, the dolphins are rewarded with some of the fishers' bycatch. Historically, Irrawaddy River fishers claimed particular dolphins were associated with individual fishing villages and chased fish into their nets. An 1879 report indicated legal claims were frequently brought into native courts by fishers to recover a share of the fish from the nets of a rival fisher which the plaintiff's dolphin was claimed to have helped fill.|$|E
6000|$|We climbed {{towards the}} little church, at a cheery pace, among the loose stones, the deep mud, the wet coarse grass, the {{outlying}} water, and other obstructions from which frost and snow had lately thawed. It {{was a mistake}} (my friend was glad to tell me, on the way) to suppose that the peasantry had shown any superstitious avoidance of the drowned; on the whole, they had done very well, and had assisted readily. Ten shillings had been paid for the bringing of each body up to the church, but the way was steep, and a horse and cart (in which it was wrapped in a sheet) were necessary, and three or four men, and, all things considered, {{it was not a}} great price.

40|$|We {{compared}} logistical {{issues and}} the catch composition, density, and size structure of nekton samples collected with a drop sampler, benthic sled, and a fine mesh <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> in shallow non-vegetated habitats of Galveston Bay, Texas. Approximately 16 <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> replicates were collected and sorted for every one drop or benthic sled sample. The drop sampler collected {{the greatest number of}} species and provided the highest density estimates for the majority of crustaceans and small demersal fishes; the sled provided comparable density estimates for penaeids and small demersal nekton, while under-representing more mobile fishes. Densities of small benthic nekton were underestimated by the <b>cast</b> <b>net,</b> but it provided the highest density estimates for larger and mobile fishes. Within the selectivity constraints of each gear, the sled and <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> provide viable alternatives to the drop sampler for sampling particular nekton from shallow open water habitats...|$|R

To determine a standard weight equation, several data sets or weight-length relationships representing a species across its range are used.|$|E
50|$|Artisanal fishing (or traditional/subsistence fishing) {{are various}} small-scale, low-technology, low-capital, fishing {{practices}} undertaken by individual fishing households (as opposed to commercial companies).

40|$|Red drum is one ofthe {{most popular}} species sought by anglers in Florida Bay, yet juveniles are rarely encountered. We {{evaluated}} Florida Bay as a nursery area for red drum by sampling for recently-settled late larvae in basin areas within the bay with an epi-benthic sled at six stations in November 2000, and at seven stations during December 2000 through February 2001. In November 2000 we surveyed potential sampling sites in quiet backwaters adjacent to mangroves for juvenile red drum. A total of 202 sites were sampled mainly in northern Florida Bay and adjacent waters with a <b>cast</b> <b>net.</b> We collected only one recently-settled red drum larvae and no juveniles. Obviously the sites that we sampled in Florida Bay and adjacent waters are not nursery habitat for this valuable species. Sled collections {{were dominated by}} bay anchovy, Anchoa mitchilli, but densities were biased by one collection. Five small resident species were among the dominant species: rainwater killifish, Lucania parva; dusky pipefish, Syngnathus floridae; dwarf seahorse, Hippocampus zosterae; and clown goby, Microgobius gulosus. Three species that spawn outside Florida Bay in the GulfofMexico were common: pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides; pigfish, Orthopristis chrysoptera; and silver perch, Bairdiella chrysoura. Twenty-seven species were collected with the <b>cast</b> <b>net.</b> Hardhead silversides (Atherinomorus stipes), bay anchovy, tidewater mojarra (Eucinostomus harengulus), silver jenny (Eucinostomus gula), and goldspotted killifish (Floridichthys carpio) were the most common in <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> collections. Although only one red drum was collected, we were able to: (1) identify mesohaline waters from our <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> sites to test our preliminary assessment that mesohaline habitat might be limited in Florida Bay, (2) document the distribution and abundance of fishes collected by <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> that should enhance our understanding of ichthyofauna in the Northern Subdivision ofFlorida Bay and adjacent waters, and (3) from epibenthic sled collections, describe the habitats, abundance and distribution of recently settled larvae/small juveniles/small resident fishes during late fall and winter. This information should be useful to managers and future research. (PDF contains 34 pages...|$|R
50|$|In Burma, {{there are}} several types of fisheries, {{including}} coastal or inshore fisheries, and offshore or deep-sea fisheries. A majority of these fish are harvested by commercial means, which includes the use of trawling nets, purse seins, driftnet and gillnet. A minority still use traditional techniques, such as hook-and-line, <b>cast</b> <b>net,</b> bag net, trammel gill net, lift net, and traps. In 2003, trawling accounted for 40% of fish caught.|$|R
50|$|Commercial fishing today uses {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for fishing. Fishing rods with baited hooks and fishing lines used in various ways are used for fishing for some particular types of fish. Fishing using nets like <b>cast</b> <b>nets,</b> hand nets, drift nets, gillnets, seine nets, trawl nets, surrounding nets etc. of various sizes and construction as well as longline fishing with hundreds of hooks on a line fishing both for bottom and pelagic fish (near surface fish) are the most common devices used to catch high yields of fish. The crab fisheries uses crab pots baited with dead fish to catch crabs.In some parts of the Pacific Northwest, fishing with baited traps is also common. Common commercial methods for catching shrimp and prawns include bottom trawling, <b>cast</b> <b>nets,</b> seines, shrimp baiting and dip netting. Bottom trawling often tears up the ocean bottom and can be very destructive to all bottom dwelling fish. Trawling involves the use of a system of nets deployed on or near the sea floor. Benthic trawling is towing or dragging a net at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Midwater trawling (pelagic trawling) is trawling, or net fishing nearer the surface of the ocean.|$|E
