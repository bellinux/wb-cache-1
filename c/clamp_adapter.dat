40|$|Technical {{textiles}} play {{a highly}} {{important role in}} today's material engineering. In fibrous composites, which are being applied {{in a number of}} industrial branches ranging from aviation to civil engineering, technical textiles are used as the reinforcing or toughening constituent. With growing number of production facilities for fibrous materials, the need for standardized and reproducible quality control procedures becomes urgent. The present thesis addresses the issue of tensile strength of high-modulus multifilament yarns both from the theoretical and experimental point of view. In both these aspects, novel approaches are introduced. Regarding the theoretical strength of fibrous yarns, a model for the length dependent tensile strength is formulated, which distinguishes three asymptotes of the mean strength size effect curve. The transition between the model of independent parallel fibers applicable for smaller gauge lengths and the chain-of-bundles model applicable for longer gauge lengths is emphasized in particular. It is found that the transition depends on the stress transfer or anchorage length of filaments and can be identified experimentally by means of standard tensile tests at different gauge lengths. In the experimental part of the thesis, the issue of stress concentration in the clamping has been addressed. High-modulus yarns with brittle filaments are very sensitive to stress concentrations when loaded in tension making the use of traditional tensile test methods difficult. A novel <b>clamp</b> <b>adapter</b> for the Statimat 4 U yarn tensile test machine (producer: Textechno GmbH) has been developed and a prototype has been built. A test series comparing yarns strengths tested with the <b>clamp</b> <b>adapter</b> and with commonly used test methods has been performed and the results are discussed. Furthermore, they are compared with theoretical values using the Daniels' statistical fiber-bundle model...|$|E
50|$|Accessories or Backshells are {{mechanical}} devices (e.g., strain reliefs, cable <b>clamps,</b> <b>adapters,</b> potting boots) {{that are}} threaded onto the rear connector accessory threads of plug or receptacle connectors {{to make up}} the total connector assembly.|$|R
50|$|The firearm is {{equipped}} with iron sights that consist of a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight, mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation, has an open notch used to fire up to 100 m and three apertures used for: 200, 300 and 400 m. The receiver housing has recesses that work with HK <b>clamp</b> <b>adapters</b> used to mount day or night optics.|$|R
50|$|The LLM01 (Laser Light Module 01) is an {{adaptive}} target acquisition module made by Rheinmetall Soldier Electronics GmbH in Stockach, Germany. It {{is designed to}} be mounted with a metal integral quick release <b>clamping</b> <b>adapter</b> {{on the left side of}} the carry handle adapter of Heckler & Koch G36 assault rifles. It can also be attached to other firearms, such as the Heckler & Koch MP7 submachine gun and L85A2 assault rifle.|$|R
5000|$|... braze-on : An {{alternative}} to the clamp is the braze-on derailleur hanger, where the derailleur is mounted by bolting a tab on the derailleur to a corresponding tab on the frame's seat tube. This avoids any clamp size issues, but requires either a frame with the appropriate braze-on, or an <b>adapter</b> <b>clamp</b> that simulates a braze-on derailleur tab.|$|R
50|$|The G41 has {{mechanically}} adjustable iron sights with a rear rotating diopter {{drum and}} hooded front post. The rear sight drum has three apertures of different diameter calibrated for firing at distances of 200, 300 and 400 m and a triangular notch setting preset for firing at 100 m. The receiver housing has recesses {{in the top}} cover that {{permit the use of}} H&K's proprietary <b>clamp</b> mounts and <b>adapters</b> for NATO-standard optics (such as the Hensoldt 4Ã—24 telescopic sight).|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the idea}} of the {{fabrication}} platform in the automobile industry to save cost and time of fabrication, the fabrication of other micro fluidic actuators will be reorganised to a full wafer fabrication technology line too. The equipment therefore will be the same for different fluidic devices like micro pumps, active micro valves and micro mixers. To fabricate different fluidic devices just particular design is to be done by appropriate masks and etching protocols. All different fluidic devices will be fabricated with the same front end and back end process on the same equipment, no special steps or equipment are necessary. The front end device fabrication for the different fluidic products is based on a 4 " wafer process integrated in a 100 class cleanroom and yet organised in a platform conception. The main process modules are oxide, nitride, doubled sided lithography, dry etching, wafer bond technologies, KOH deep etching and sputtering. Also the back end fabrication will be modular: changing the fabrication from one device to another, downtime of the different equipment is reduced to few minutes because only device specific <b>adapters,</b> <b>clamps</b> or conversion kits must be changed to fabricate different fluidic devices with the same equipment. Intermediate tests will be done on wafer level, thus time for single product endtest will be reduced. Reliability tests like temperature and vibration tests will be developed. This back end fabrication will be integrated in a laboratory (10 000 class cleanroom). High yield and reproducibility, low cost, good performance and repeatability will be the result of realizing the full wafer fabrication platform of microfluidic devices...|$|R
