5|$|The Constitution Act of 1867 was {{designed}} to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule, while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The compromises made by the Fathers of Confederation set Canadians on a path to bilingualism, and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Diocese of Bristol {{was founded}} in 1542, when the former Abbey of St. Augustine (founded by Robert Fitzharding four hundred years earlier) became Bristol Cathedral.

5|$|After the war, Ajax was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea in 1919–1920.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} <b>the</b> {{causes of}} <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Congo since independence and investigates how the Congo case fits {{the model of}} <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> proposed by Collier and Hoeffler. Five conclusions arise from this case study. First, the level and growth rate of national income increased the risk of war by reducing the cost of organizing rebellions and the government’s ability to counteract the rebellions. Second, while regional ethnic dominance served {{as a basis for}} mobilization of rebellions, ethnic antagonism was also an obstacle to the expansion of <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> beyond the province of origin. Third, while natural resource dependence was a significant determinant of <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DRC, it is the geographic concentration of natural resources and their unequal distribution that made the Congo particularly prone to <b>civil</b> <b>war.</b> Fourth, the government’s ability to counteract rebellions depended more on external support than on the government’s military and economic capacity. Fifth, discriminatory nationality laws, disruptions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ethnic balance of the eastern region caused by the influx of Rwandan Hutu refugees in 1994, and shared ethnicity between rebels and neighboring regimes—variables which are not included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Collier-Hoeffler model—were significant determinants of <b>the</b> outbreak of <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s. ...|$|R
5|$|After the war, Marlborough was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea in 1919–20. She was also involved in the Greco-Turkish War. In 1930, the London Naval Treaty mandated that the four Iron Duke-class battleships be discarded; Marlborough was used for a variety of weapons tests in 1931–32, the results of which were incorporated into the reconstruction programme for the s.|$|E
5|$|Although {{threatening}} letters sent to BélaIV by the khans of the Golden Horde {{proved that}} the danger of a new Mongol invasion still existed, he adopted an expansionist foreign policy. FrederickII of Austria died fighting against Hungarian troops in 1246, and BélaIV's son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich, annexed large territories along the kingdom's southern frontiers. Conflicts between the elderly monarch and his heir, Stephen, caused a <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1260s.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{operated}} {{together in}} the Mediterranean Fleet after entering service, and they remained in the fleet throughout World War I. They participated in the blockade of the Adriatic to keep the Austro-Hungarian Navy contained early in the war. During this period, Edgar Quinet {{took part in the}} Battle of Antivari in August 1914, and Waldeck-Rousseau was unsuccessfully attacked twice by Austro-Hungarian U-boats. Waldeck-Rousseau participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea in 1919–22, while Edgar Quinet remained in the Mediterranean during the contemporaneous Greco-Turkish War.|$|E

5|$|Carmarthenshire {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times. The town of Carmarthen {{was founded by}} the Romans, and the region {{was part of the}} Principality of Deheubarth during the High Middle Ages. It saw turbulent times during the invasion by the Normans in the 12th and 13h centuries before it was subjugated, along with other parts of Wales, by Edward I of England. There was further unrest in the early 15th century when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glyndŵr, and more strife during the English <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{outbreak}} of the First Muslim Civil War and the priorities on other fronts, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century. The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the Transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in 661/662, they launched a raid into Albania but were defeated by the local prince; in 683 or 685 (also a time of <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Muslim world), a large-scale raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners.|$|E
5|$|During the ship's peacetime career, she {{frequently}} {{took part}} in fleet reviews. In 1934, she went on a tour with the royal yacht to eastern Africa, and she made another foreign cruise two years later to Germany during the 1936 Summer Olympics being held there. She {{was involved in the}} Spanish <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s; she evacuated Italian nationals in August 1936, and while returning to Italy, suffered an explosion in an aviation gas tank that necessitated major repairs. The ship supported the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939.|$|E

50|$|Switzerland and Portugal {{were also}} {{unaffected}} in 1848, though both {{had gone through}} <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preceding years (<b>the</b> Sonderbund <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland and <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Wars</b> <b>in</b> Portugal). <b>The</b> introduction of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848 was a revolution of sorts, laying the foundation of Swiss society as it is today.|$|R
5|$|Henry VIII {{gave the}} ruins to the Carey family, who {{retained}} {{it until it}} passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families. The castle {{was not involved in}} the events of the English <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, and escaped the slighting that affected many similar properties, probably because the collapse of the outer walls had already made it indefensible and of little military value. In 1737, after the death of Edward Coke, the castle and the surrounding manor were bought by Thomas Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, for £22,500.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the ship}} had an {{aircraft}} catapult installed, along with a crane to handle floatplanes. The following year, the single 8.8cm guns were replaced with a new triaxially stabilized twin-mount; two other twin mounts were added on the rear superstructure. Fire control directors for the anti-aircraft guns were also installed. After emerging from this refit, Königsberg was employed as a gunnery training ship. During the Spanish <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s, the ship participated in non-intervention patrols, during which she forced Republicans to surrender a German freighter they had seized.|$|E
5|$|Königsberg {{served as}} a {{training}} ship for naval cadets throughout the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she laid defensive minefields in the North Sea and then participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway in April 1940. While attacking Bergen, she was badly damaged by Norwegian coastal artillery, and sunk by British bombers the following day in the harbor. The wreck was eventually raised in 1942 and broken up for scrap the following year.|$|E
