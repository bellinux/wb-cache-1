The re-sults indicate (I) very slight average difference in legibility (less than 1 %) due to scan direction: (2) a more substantial difference (about 973 between upper and lower case; and (3) legibility directly proportional to pitch and sampling distances, and to character lieiglzt. For individual clraracters in starrdurd typescript or similar material, 97. 5 z Iegibility apparently requires resolution on the order of 110 X 110 elements to the inch (scanning aperture nine mils square). Two secondary comparisons established the fact that individual <b>character</b> <b>legibility</b> (a) remained virtually unchanged when continuous scaiuiiiig (one-mil resolution) was substituted for the best uve-mil) sampling distance, and (b) varied less rhaii 2 % wheil extra test documents were generated to check the repeatability of the experiment. In facsimile transmission, increasing resolution requires either longer transmission time or greater communication bandwidth. Either alternative adds to the system costs. But if the images to be transmitted are compressed by digital coding...|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} fonts {{have sprung up}} in recent years in digital {{publishing}} industry and reading devices. In this paper, we focus on methods of evaluating digital Chinese fonts and their typeface characteristics to seek a good way to enhance the character recognition rate. To accomplish this, we combined psychological analysis methods with statistical analysis. It involved an extensive survey of distinctive features of eighteen popular digital typefaces. Survey results were tabulated and analyzed statistically. Then another objective experiment was conducted using the best six fonts derived from the survey results. These experimental results reveal an effective way of choosing legible digital fonts most suitable for comfortable reading of books, magazines, newspapers, and for display of texts on cell-phones, e-books, and digital libraries, and finding out the features for improving <b>character</b> <b>legibility</b> of different Chinese typefaces. The relationships among legibility, eyestrain, and myopia, will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{modeling}} {{suggests that}} levels of retinal defocus routinely caused by presbyopia should produce phase reversals (spurious resolution-SR) for spatial frequencies in the 2 cycles/letter range {{known to be}} critical for reading. Simulations show that such reversals can have a decisive impact on <b>character</b> <b>legibility,</b> and that correcting only this feature of defocused images (by re-reversing contrast sign errors created by defocus) can make unrecognizably blurred letters completely legible. This deblurring impact of SR correction is remarkably unaffected by the magnitude of defocus, as determined by blur-circle size. Both the deblurrring itself and its robustness can be understood from the effect that SR correction has on the defocused pointspread function, which changes from a broad flat cake to a sharply pointed cone. This SR-corrected pointspread acts like a delta function, preserving image shape during convolution regardless of blur-disk size. Curiously, such pointspread functions always contain a narrow annulus of negative light-intensity values whose radius equals {{the diameter of the}} blur circle. We show that these properties of SR-correction all stem from the mathematical nature of the Fourier transform of the sign of the optical transfer function, which also accounts for the inevitable low contrast of images pre-corrected for SR. © 2007 SPIE-IS & T...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{mobile phones}} are {{very popular in}} the world. The use of text email with short message service (SMS) is spreading. In this study, we {{evaluated}} the <b>legibility</b> of <b>characters</b> on the liquid crystal displays of mobile phones. When characters are small, younger people assure readability by shortening the viewing distance. However, elderly people find it far more difficult to see small <b>characters.</b> Moreover, <b>legibility</b> deteriorates as the contrast of display becomes lower...|$|R

5000|$|Written {{texts in}} German are easily {{recognisable}} as such by distinguishing {{features such as}} umlauts and certain orthographical features - German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns, a relic of a widespread practice in Northern Europe in the early modern era (including English for a while, in the 1700s) - and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. The longest German word that has been published is [...] made of 79 <b>characters.</b> Because <b>legibility</b> and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (In contrast, although English can also string nouns together, it usually separates the nouns with spaces. For example, [...] "toilet bowl cleaner".) ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{more and}} more fonts have been {{implemented}} in the digital publishing industry and in reading devices. In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} methods of evaluating digital Chinese fonts and their typeface characteristics. Our goal is to seek a good way to enhance the legibility and readability of Chinese characters displayed on digital devices such as cell phones, tablets and e-book devices. To accomplish this goal, we have combined methods in data mining, and pattern recognition with psychological and statistical analyses. Our research involved an extensive survey of the distinctive features of eighteen popular Chinese digital typefaces. Survey results were tabulated and analyzed statistically. Then, two objective experiments were conducted, using the best six fonts derived from the survey results. These experimental results have revealed an effective way of choosing legible and readable Chinese digital fonts that are most suitable for the comfortable reading of books, magazines, newspapers, and for the display of texts on cell-phones, e-books, and digital libraries. Results also helped us find out the features for improving <b>character</b> <b>legibility</b> and readability of different Chinese typefaces. The relationships among legibility, readability, eye-strain, and myopia, will be discussed. Moreover, digital market requirements and analyses will be provided...|$|E
40|$|Teletext is {{difficult}} to read, {{partly because of the}} letter fonts employed. Present fonts are contained in a matrix of 6 (horizontal) × 10 (vertical) elements. Research on matrix <b>characters</b> of optimum <b>legibility</b> started in 1969 at the Institute for Perception Research. Criteria resulting from this research have now been used to design alphanumeric characters in a matrix of 12 × 10 elements for use in Teletext. Several versions of each character were designed and their legibility tested in recognition experiments. The legibility of the best new version for each letter was compared with and shown generally to be greater than that of the presently used version...|$|R

Participants {{were asked to identify}} individual characters after a brief exposure and performance was recorded. Classification tree analysis was used to examine the influence of specific <b>character</b> features on <b>legibility.</b> Features included attributes such as height, width, weight, stroke variation, contrast, and complexity. Results reveal the most influential features for six commonly confused characters (zero, one, "e", "l"., and $). The use of classification tree analysis appears to be promising for typographers in determining the limits of typeface features and for practitioners who must choose an optimal typeface for a particular use...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model of}} character recognition and the experiments used to develop and test it. The model applies to foveal viewing of blurred or unblurred characters and to tactile sensing of raised characters using the fingerpad. The primary goal of the model is to account for variations in <b>legibility</b> across <b>character</b> sets; a secondary goal is to account for variations in the cell entries of the confusion matrix for a given character set. The model consists of two distinct processing stages. The first involves transformation of each stimulus into an internal representa-tion; this transformation consists of linear low-pass spatial filtering followed by nonlinear compression of stimulus intensity. The second stage involves both template matching of the transformed test stimulus {{with each of the}} stored internal representations of the characters within the set and response selection, which is assumed to conform to the unbiased choice model of Luce (1963). Though purely stimulus driven, the model accounts quite well for differences in the <b>legibility</b> of <b>character</b> sets differing in character type, size of character, and number of characters within the set; it is somewhat less successful in accounting for the details of each confusion matrix. Over the years much effort has been devoted to the study of <b>character</b> recognition and <b>legibility</b> in perceptual psychol-ogy. Many of the experimental studies in vision have been motivated by applied concerns, such as determining optimal character types for print and computer displays (e. g., Berger...|$|R
