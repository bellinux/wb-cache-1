40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{whether there is a}} difference in the quality of life between elderly patients managed in a day hospital and those receiving conventional care. DESIGN: Randomized <b>controlled</b> trial; assessment <b>upon</b> <b>entry</b> to study and at 3, 6 and 12 months afterward. SETTING: Geriatrician referral-based secondary care. PATIENTS: A total of 113 consecutively referred elderly patients with deteriorating functional status believed to have rehabilitation potential; 55 were assessed and treated by an interdisciplinary team in a day hospital (treatment group), and 58 were assessed in an inpatient unit or an outpatient clinic or were discharged early with appropriate community services (control group). OUTCOME MEASURES: Barthel Index, Rand Questionnaire, Global Health Question and Geriatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (GQLQ). MAIN RESULTS: Eight study subjects and four control subjects died; the difference was insignificant. Functional status deteriorated over time in the two groups; although the difference was not significant there was less deterioration in the control group. The GQLQ scores indicated {{no significant difference between the}} two groups in the ability to perform daily living activities and in the alleviation of symptoms over time but did show a trend favouring the control group. The GQLQ scores did indicate a significant difference in favour of the control group in the effect of treatment on emotions (p = 0. 009). CONCLUSION: The care received at the day hospital did not improve functional status or quality of life of elderly patients as compared with the otherwise excellent geriatric outpatient care...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} in the U. S. Bureau of Mines Safety Research Coal Mine at the Pittsburgh Research Center evaluated the effects of crosscuts on the travel time of carbon monoxide (CO) along an entry to improve the accuracy of a mine-fire locator program. Three entries, ten single crosscuts, and three double crosscuts were instrumented with CO sensors. One-percent CO in nitrogen was released and monitored as it traveled the entries. In addition to dispersion of CO {{at the front of}} the CO wave, CO was entrained from the entry into the crosscuts. It was determined for an entry and single-crosscut configuration that the measured travel time for a concentration change of 5 ppm was 27 % greater than the predicted time based <b>upon</b> <b>entry</b> volume only, but 13 % less than the predicted time based <b>upon</b> <b>entry</b> and crosscut volumes. For an entry and double-crosscut configuration, the measured travel time for the same concentration change was 25 % greater than the predicted time based <b>upon</b> <b>entry</b> volume only, but 10 % less than the predicted time based <b>upon</b> <b>entry</b> and crosscut volumes. An effective dispersion coefficient for CO dispersion along one of the entries was estimated to be 1. 5 m 2 / s...|$|R
