60|$|Miss Pilbeam, only {{daughter}} of Sergeant Pilbeam, <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> sharply.|$|E
60|$|She cast {{down her}} eyes once more, and a sob <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|Rosamund <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and {{clutched}} Sakr-el-Bahr's arm, the arm {{that held the}} lantern.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dixon {{tried to}} speak, but 'er temper {{was too much}} for 'er. She looked from her 'usband to Charlie and Bob and then back at 'im agin and <b>caught</b> <b>'er</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|She <b>caught</b> at <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> for a moment, half {{closed her}} eyes as thought to shut out {{something}} disagreeable.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>caught</b> at <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> She did {{not care}} to ask why. But {{compared}} with Bechamel!--"We take each other on trust," [...] she said. [...] "Do you want to know--how things are with me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Green <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and sitting}} down again took {{his arm in}} her {{trembling}} fingers.|$|E
60|$|She <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and set a}} hand {{upon her}} bosom as if to repress its sudden tumult.|$|E
60|$|Miss Hernshaw <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> as if {{she were}} going to speak, but she did not say anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "One o' the lightermen let go o' {{the skipper}} and went arter 'er, and, just as I was giving {{the other three}} a helping 'and, 'e came back with <b>'er.</b> Mrs. Pratt <b>caught</b> <b>'er</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and as for the}} skipper, 'e didn't know where to look, as the saying is. I just saw the lady give 'im one quick look, and then afore I could dream of wot was coming, she rushes up to me and flings 'er long, bony arms round my neck.|$|R
60|$|Away like a flash {{went the}} new-found {{peace in the}} girl's face. She <b>caught</b> at <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>her</b> fingers gripped {{the table in front}} of her. Once more she was as he had known her first--pale, with great terrified eyes shining out of a haggard face.|$|R
6000|$|The {{suspense}} was mercifully ended. Lucille Haldane half {{opened her}} eyes, {{and looked up}} at me without recognition, closed them, and <b>caught</b> at <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> audibly, while I held her hands fast in a restraining grasp. Then, as she looked up again, the blood came back, mantling the clear skin, and she said, brokenly: [...] "I fell out of the wagon, did I not? How long have I been here?--and my head is wet. I--I must get up." ...|$|R
60|$|Sudden {{and utter}} silence {{followed}} that exhortation. Asad listened in relieved amazement; Rosamund <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> in sheer dismay.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped and}} <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{with a little}} gasp, while her voice grew {{strained}} and broken as she went on.|$|E
60|$|A humblebee {{from the}} Square Garden boomed in and buzzed idly round the room. She <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{in a little}} sob....|$|E
60|$|There was one argument, or panacea, {{which had}} {{generally}} {{worked like a}} charm, although some time had elapsed since last he had resorted to it. He tried to seize and kiss her, but she eluded him. At last he <b>caught</b> <b>her,</b> out of <b>breath,</b> {{in the corner of}} the room.|$|R
60|$|Pushing open a {{communicating}} door, I saw Mariposilla {{upon her}} bed. Her head {{was buried in}} the pillow, while long, choking sobs <b>caught</b> and held <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> She had been so happy but a short time before, flattered and pleased because Mrs. Wilbur had invited her to practice duets, that I was surprised at her condition.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} his face resolutely. [...] "I hate it," [...] she said, and <b>caught</b> at <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "You do not understand, you do not think. There {{was a time when}} you said things and I {{believed}} them. I am growing wiser. You are a man, you can fight, force your way. You do not mind bruises. You can be coarse and ugly, and still a man. Yes--it makes you. It makes you. You are right. Only a woman is not like that. We are different. We have let ourselves get civilised too soon. This underworld is not for us." ...|$|R
60|$|Frona <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> for a moment. Then she {{straightened}} {{out her arms}} to hold the man in challenge to the arms of Lucile.|$|E
60|$|Helen was {{not only}} amazed, but enraged. She <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> preparatory to giving this incorrigible sister {{a piece of her}} mind. Bo went calmly on.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} hers were empty of any recognition. Then they lit up. She <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> quickly, and a faint flush {{came into her}} face.|$|E
6000|$|How could Fanner Brown's boy do such {{a dreadful}} thing? Somehow, his {{freckled}} face didn't look cruel. He was even beginning to grin. That must be because he had <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> napping and knew that this time she couldn't possibly {{get away from him}} as she had so many times before. [...] "Oh!" [...] sobbed Old Granny Fox under <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{fled from}} the creepy {{house for a}} walk. It was thirty below zero; too cold to exhilarate her. In the spaces between houses the wind <b>caught</b> <b>her.</b> It stung, it gnawed at nose and ears and aching cheeks, and she hastened from shelter to shelter, {{catching}} <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{in the lee of}} a barn, grateful for the protection of a billboard covered with ragged posters showing layer under layer of paste-smeared green and streaky red.|$|R
60|$|She {{had both}} hands on his shoulders--her face was close to his--she was simply irresistible. Arnold <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> round the waist and kissed her. Needless {{to tell him to}} get through the hoop. He had surely got through it already! Blanche was speechless. Arnold's last effort in the art of {{courtship}} had taken away <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> Before she could recover herself a sound of approaching footsteps became plainly audible. Arnold gave her a last squeeze, and ran out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] she whispered, {{and leaned}} against him. A fresh breeze bore the boom of the river. She <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> quickly: [...] "I love you!--I love you!--Good-bye!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, only..." [...] Saxon <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{and avoided}} the {{threatened}} outburst. [...] "Only I'm not hungry. It's been so hot all day. It was terrible in the laundry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] and Polly <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> as if {{a dash of}} {{cold water}} had fallen on her, for the more in earnest Tom grew, the blunter he became.|$|E
60|$|Eva was {{shouting}} {{with the rest}} as the green horses came hopping by, when Puck <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> up before him, and away they raced so swiftly that her hair whistled {{in the wind and}} <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> was nearly gone. A tremendous leap took them high over the little hill and landed Eva in a tall dandelion, where she lay laughing and panting as if on a little yellow sofa, while Trip and her mates fanned her and smoothed her pretty hair.|$|R
60|$|The {{conversation}} was here {{interrupted by a}} busy hum in the audience; and the auctioneer, a short, bustling, important fellow, elbowed {{his way into the}} crowd. The old woman drew in <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and <b>caught</b> instinctively at <b>her</b> son.|$|R
6000|$|... "Years ago, when I was {{out with}} the missis one evening, I saved a gal's life for her. She slipped as she was getting off a bus, and I <b>caught</b> <b>'er</b> just in time. Fine {{strapping}} gal she was, and afore I could get my balance we 'ad danced round and round 'arfway acrost the road with our arms round each other's necks, and my missis watching us from the pavement. When we were safe, she said the gal 'adn't slipped at all; and, {{as soon as the}} gal 'ad got <b>'er</b> <b>breath,</b> I'm blest if she didn't say so too.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Jelks <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> impatiently. [...] "Because itâ€™s {{got nothing}} to do with you what I do now," [...] she said, sharply. [...] "I can go out with who I like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To edit it?" [...] His wife <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and {{she took}} {{a little time to}} realize the fact, while she stared hard at her husband {{to make sure he was}} not joking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Jimmy; [...] "please don't think that!" [...] And impulsively he {{took her}} hand beneath the table. At the contact the girl <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> with a little quick-drawn sigh.|$|E
60|$|She leaned {{forwards}} and upwards {{to pierce}} the darkness; he, also straining to look, felt <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> on his cheek, and turning, saw the pallor {{of her face}} close to his, and felt the dark glow of <b>her</b> eyes. He <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> in his arms, and held her mouth in a kiss. Then, when he released her, he turned away, saying something incoherent about going to fetch the lantern to look. She remained with her back towards me, and pretended to be feeling among the mistletoe for the berries. Soon I saw the swing of the hurricane lamp below.|$|R
50|$|Mae goes kayaking at night, {{and nearly}} drowns due to fog and {{darkness}} preventing her from seeing a ship; she is rescued by the coastguard. The following day Mae is in Eamon and Tom's office. Eamon explains that SeeChange cameras <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> {{breaking into the}} kayak premises and also <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> in the water. It {{was because of the}} cameras that she was saved. He then asks her if there is anything she wants to confess, and Mae admits to being in their office previously. Eamon then asks her how it feels to tell the truth, and she says it is liberating. Eamon and Tom then allude to a plan that involves her. At the next meeting, Eamon introduces Mae on stage, and they talk about her experience of being rescued. She expresses the good of transparency, and announces she is the first circler to go 'completely transparent'. This involves wearing a small camera on her person while awake and therefore exposing her life to everyone in the world. Annie is seen in the audience, appearing exhausted. She looks resentfully at Mae and calls her a natural under <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} catch <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>Her</b> voice was still tremulous.|$|R
