40|$|The present {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} a method for treating and recycling the effluent from a supercritical water oxidation reactor and more specifically to a method for treating and recycling the effluent by expanding the effluent without extensive cooling. Supercritical water oxidation is the oxidation of fuel, generally waste material, in {{a body of water}} under conditions above the thermodynamic critical point of water. The current state of the art in supercritical water oxidation plant effluent treatment is to cool the reactor effluent through heat exchangers or direct quench, separate the <b>cooled</b> <b>liquid</b> into a gas/vapor stream and a liquid/solid stream, expand the separated effluent, and perform additional purification on gaseous, <b>liquid,</b> <b>brine</b> and solid effluent. If acid gases are present, corrosion is likely to occur in the coolers. During expansion, part of the condensed water will revaporize. Vaporization can damage the valves due to cavitation and erosion. The present invention expands the effluent stream without condensing the stream. Radionuclides and suspended solids are more efficiently separated in the vapor phase. By preventing condensation, the acids are kept in the much less corrosive gaseous phase thereby limiting the damage to treatment equipment. The present invention also reduces the external energy consumption, by utilizing the expansion step to also cool the effluent...|$|R

Martian slope streaks are currently occurring geological phenomenon on Mars, which requires any formation theory {{to be in}} agreement with Mar 2 ̆ 7 s current temperature and pressure conditions. Planar morphology of martian slope streaks suggest a potential fluvial formation, but current conditions on Mars are not conducive to water remaining liquid long enough to erode the surface. Debris flows, fluid stains and dry dust avalanches have all been previously cited as a potential formation mechanism for martian slope streaks.

40|$|High {{precision}} manufacturing, e. g. milling and grinding, {{which have}} manufacturing tolerances {{in the range}} of < 10 μm require microscopic measurement techniques for the inspection of the manufactured components. These measurement techniques are very sensitive to <b>cooling</b> <b>liquids</b> and lubricants which are essential for many manufacturing processes. Therefore, the measurement of the components is usually conducted in separate and clean laboratories and not directly in the manufacturing machine. This approach has some major drawbacks, e. g. high time consumption and no possibility for online process monitoring. In this article, a novel concept for the integration of high precision optical topography measurement systems into the manufacturing machine is introduced and compared to other concepts.
