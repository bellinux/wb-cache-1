40|$|Written <b>constitutions,</b> though {{designed}} <b>to</b> endure, {{are remarkably}} fragile, {{with a mean}} lifespan of only 17 years across all countries since 1789. This paper draws on the literature on endogenous <b>constitutions</b> <b>to</b> explore the determinants of constitutional durability among nation states. It first examines the relationship between constitutional change and regime change, analyzing the causes of constitutional demise. It then considers the role of state-level structural characteristics as well as features of constitutional design in allowing <b>constitutions</b> <b>to</b> withstand exogenous shocks. The findings suggest that certain features of constitutional design do make a difference, and can help constitutions endure: in particular, the inclusiveness of the adoption process, {{the flexibility of the}} amendment process, and the specificity of the document are crucial features promoting endurance...|$|R
5|$|The warring parties mostly {{moved to}} entrenched positions, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new {{conflict}} was anticipated. Croatia {{became a member}} of the UN on May 22, 1992, which was conditional upon Croatia amending its <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> protect the human rights of minority groups and dissidents.|$|E
5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS <b>Constitution.</b> <b>To</b> pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking farmers who protested {{what they saw as}} a threat to their republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E
5|$|African {{slaves were}} {{originally}} excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slaves, former slaves, {{and their descendants}} were not eligible under the <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> be citizens. Additionally, American Indians were not originally recognized as citizens, since Indian tribes {{were considered to be}} outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|Baxter had {{now been}} {{governor}} {{for a year}} and was following an independent course. He began dismantling the systems put in place by the Minstrels. He appointed honest Democrats and Republicans to the Election Commission, reorganized the militia by placing it {{under the control of the}} State, rather than the governor, and pushed for an amendment to the state <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> re-enfranchise ex-Confederates.|$|E
5|$|Constitutionalism {{was only}} {{established}} {{during the reign}} Abdul Hamid II, who thus became the empire's last absolute ruler and its reluctant first constitutional monarch. Although Abdul Hamid II abolished the parliament and the <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> return to personal rule in 1878, he was again forced in 1908 to reinstall constitutionalism and was deposed. Since 2017, {{the head of the}} House of Osman and pretender to the defunct Ottoman throne has been Dündar Ali Osman, a great-grandson of Abdulhamid II.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Marshall focused {{primarily}} on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of a}} child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E

5|$|During the Portuguese Liberal Revolution of 1820, he {{supported}} the constitutionalists, who advocated a national <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> limit {{the powers of the}} Portuguese monarchy, against the absolutists, who preferred an absolute monarchy. It is unknown whether he actively took part in the uprising, however, and if so, to what degree. Honório Hermeto {{was a member of a}} secret society called A Gruta (The Den), founded by Brazilian students at Coimbra with the primary goal of changing Brazil from a monarchy into a republic. His republicanism would fade with time and eventually be replaced by staunch support for monarchism.|$|E
5|$|Déby {{attempted}} {{to reconcile the}} rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. Déby unilaterally modified the <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> be ratified, however, {{nine of the}} {{thirteen}} states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E

50|$|Draco {{introduced}} the lot-chosen Council of Four Hundred, {{distinct from the}} Areopagus, which evolved in later <b>constitutions</b> <b>to</b> play {{a large role in}} Athenian democracy. Aristotle notes that Draco, while having the laws written, merely legislated for an existing unwritten Athenian constitution such as setting exact qualifications for eligibility for office.|$|R
5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory. The rebellion {{was one of the}} major factors in the decision to draft a stronger national <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> replace the Articles of Confederation. On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the United States Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln won a {{landslide}} re-election in early November 1864 {{on a platform}} advocating passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> abolish slavery altogether, and Booth devoted increasing energy and money to his kidnap plot. He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including David Herold, George Atzerodt, Lewis Powell (also known as Lewis Payne or Paine), and John Surratt, a rebel agent. They began to meet routinely at the boarding house of Surratt's mother Mrs. Mary Surratt.|$|E

Public officials (including the President) {{are required by}} the <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> declare their wealth to the Ombudsman and to the public; {{those who do not}} comply are suspended from office.|$|E
5|$|Section 2 {{protects the}} right to vote only of adult males, not adult females, making it the only {{provision}} of the <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> explicitly discriminate on the basis of sex. Section 2 was condemned by women's suffragists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights. The separation of black civil rights from women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} piecemeal amendments {{have been}} added in response to federal developments. Amendments ratified by the voters reduced the voting age to eighteen to conform with the Twenty-sixth Amendment, removed residency requirements for voting, and conformed voter registration to the Motor Voter Act. A legislative session now may be called after a Governor's veto. Virginia joined thirty-two other states in 1996 by amending its <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> provide for rights of victims of crime.
