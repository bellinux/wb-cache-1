5|$|The Jagiellonian dynasty was not {{entitled}} to automatic hereditary succession, rather each new king had {{to be approved by}} nobility consensus.

In 1430, the nobility agreed to the succession of the future Władysław III only after the king <b>consented</b> <b>to</b> a series of concessions. In 1434, the old monarch died and his minor son Władysław was crowned; the Royal Council led by Bishop Oleśnicki undertook the regency duties.|$|E

5|$|Before her marriage, Louise {{served as}} an {{unofficial}} secretary to her mother, the Queen (1866–1871). The question of Louise's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s. Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested, but Victoria wanted new blood {{in the family and}} therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the aristocracy. Despite opposition from members of the royal family, Louise fell in love with John, Marquess of Lorne, the heir to the Duke of Argyll. Victoria <b>consented</b> <b>to</b> the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. Despite a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen's constraints on their activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sexual activity in heterosexual relationships {{has made a}} recent appearance in the empirical literature. However, {{studies have found that}} it is a relatively common occurrence. The present study reviews a definition of the concept and the reasons given for <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sexual activity. Three specific theories are outlined that could potentially explain the behavior: attachment theory, evolutionary theory, and the Traditional Sexual Script (TSS). Additionally, the role of sexual communication is explored. A proposed model is presented that focuses on adherence to the TSS and ability to communicate sexual preferences. This model takes into account both individual and dyadic factors, and therefore, provides a strong framework for understanding <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sexual activity. This model was tested in a sample of 77 heterosexual couples of college-age. The results suggest that men and women <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sexual activity for different reasons. In the present sample, men were more likely than women <b>to</b> <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sex in order to avoid negative consequences, such as conflict within the relationship. The individual and dyadic implications of this are explored. The results also suggest that the woman 2 ̆ 7 s level of adherence to the TSS predicts her own, as well as her partner 2 ̆ 7 s, <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sex. The ability to communicate sexual preferences moderated the association between adherence to the TSS and <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sex, suggesting that communication is extremely important in predicting the behavior. When an individual was able to communicate his or her sexual desires, adherence to the TSS no longer predicted <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sex. These data suggest that couples should work to foster strong communication skills {{in order to reduce the}} likelihood that <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> unwanted sex will occur...|$|R
