40|$|Introduction: the {{incidence}} of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) varies widely according to geographical area and {{has been reported to}} have increased in the last few years. No data are available on the current incidence of this disease in Madrid (Spain). Aim: to determine {{the incidence}} of inflammatory bowel disease in the area of influence of University Hospital Fundación Alcorcón (Madrid), and to compare our results with those from other Spanish and European series. Patients and methods: a prospective, population-based study was performed to determine {{the incidence of}} IBD in the area of University Hospital Fundación Alcorcón in Madrid between 2003 and 2005. Total population: 213, 587 inhabitants (177, 490 older than 14 years). Crude rates and age- and sex-specific rates adjusted to the European standard population were calculated. A retrospective study (1998 - 2003) was also performed. Results: a total of 69 cases were diagnosed -Crohn's disease (CD) : 35, ulcerative colitis (UC) : 33, indeterminate colitis: 1 - in the prospective period. Crude rates of CD and UC were 7. 92 and 7. 47 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants/year, respectively (the population aged 0 - 14 years). Specific rates were 8. 0 (95 % CI, 7. 03 - 8. 97) and 7. 47 (95 % CI, 6. 5 - 8. 4), respectively. Mean age at diagnosis was <b>31.</b> <b>02</b> ± <b>10.</b> 76 and 39. 91 ± 16. 19 years for CD and UC, respectively. Incidence in the retrospective study was 7. 13 and 6. 22 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants/year, respectively for CD and UC. Conclusions: the incidence of CD and UC in Madrid has increased in the last decades, with rates close to those in northern European countries for CD, higher than those recently published in Spanish prospective studies and similar to those previously described in Spain and southern countries for UC. Rates were higher in the prospective period than in the retrospective one...|$|R
