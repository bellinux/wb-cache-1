40|$|Background: Caudal {{block with}} {{levobupivacaine}} or ropivacaine {{is the most}} commonly used regional anaesthesia in children. Methods: The aim of study was to compare the cardiocirculatory profile induced in two matched groups of young patients, submitted to <b>caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> with levobupivacaine or ropivacaine for an elective subumbilical surgery. Sixty children were enrolled: thirty received levopubivacaine 0. 25 % and thirty ropivacaine 0. 2 %. Intraoperative heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were monitored at following times: Ta 0 (after anaesthesia induction), Ta 1 (after <b>caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia),</b> Ta 2 (five minutes later), Ta 3 (ten minutes later), Ts 1 (at surgical incision), Ts 2, Ts 3, Ts 4, Ts 5 (every 10 minutes during surgery), Taw (at the awakening). Results: In both groups the cardiocirculatory trend remained within normal ranges at all times considered, demonstrating the safety of the method with both drugs. Both groups showed a similar trend at the different monitoring times: low decrease in HR, SBP and DBP after caudal block, slight increase in parameters after skin incision, slight decrease during surgery, increase at awakening. Regarding SBP and DBP, the levobupivacaine group children generally showed higher levels compared to the ropivacaine group, especially for DBP. Conclusions: Paediatric <b>caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is an effective method with an very infrequent complication rate. Possible hypotheses for differing haemodynamic behaviour could include a stronger vasoconstriction reflex of innervated areas during <b>caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> with levobupivacaine and a lower levobupivacaine induced block of the sympathetic fibers, related to different pharmacokinetic profile of low concentrations of the local anaesthetics used in paediatric epidural space...|$|E
40|$|Background: The sacrum {{is a large}} {{triangular}} bone {{formed by}} the fusion of the five sacral vertebrae and forms the caudal region of the vertebral column. Aims: This was aimed at studying the morphometry of the sacral hiatus noting its anatomical variations that is useful in <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anaesthesia.</b> Materials and Methods: Eighty three intact adult sacra of unknown sex were measured with vernier callipers and the various shapes of the sacral hiatus were also noted. Results: The findings revealed that inverted U (48. 2 %) was the most predominant shape; followed by inverted V (34. 9 %), dumbbell (4. 8 %), bifid (4. 8 %) and irregular (4. 8 %).

40|$|The human sacrum is a {{triangular}} bone {{formed by the}} fusion of five separate vertebras along with the intervertebral discs. Gross morphology of sacrum shows a concave ventral surface, a convex dorsal surface and {{a triangular}} sacral canal.

40|$|Background. <b>Caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is {{a common}} {{procedure}} for infants and children undergoing subumbilical surgery, mostly performed in conjunction with general anaesthesia. Even if compli-cations are rare, the risk of postoperative apnoea is significant, especially in infants born preterm or operated upon before 46 weeks of post-conceptual age. Caudal block in sedated, spontaneously breathing patients might be a safe alternative. Methods. We investigated 512 infants and children. Premedication consisted of midazolam, sedation was induced with i. v. nalbuphine 0. 1 mg kg 21 and propofol 1 mg kg 21, and maintained with propofol 5 mg kg 21 h 21 in children, if necessary. Caudal block was performed with ropi-vacaine 1 ml kg 21 (0. 2 % or 0. 35 %). Results. Data were obtained from 228 infants and 284 children. Median (IQR) age was 1. 3 (0. 2, 3. 4) yr; median body weight was 10. 0 (4. 8, 15. 3) kg. Two hundred and thirty-three (45. 51 %) were born preterm and 47 (9. 18 %) were operated upon before 46 weeks of post-conceptual age. Caudal block was successful in 98. 05 % and adverse events occurred in 7. 03 % patients. The incidence of adverse events was not higher in born preterm or operated upon before 46 weeks of post-conceptual age than in term born infants (P 0. 35 and 0. 35, respectively), or in infants vs children (P 0. 61). There was no correlation between the incidence of adverse events and con-tinuous sedation (P 0. 07), coexisting diseases (P 0. 11), or ASA classification (P 0. 33).

40|$|Objective: Chronic {{hyperglycaemia}} {{is associated}} with subfertility and infertility in male diabetic subjects, possible {{as a result of}} perturbed testicular antioxidant defence system. Recent evidence however shows that some testicular cells produce insulin and this raises the possibility of a role for this hormone in spermatogenesis. Moreover, isoforms of the nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) have been detected in testicular tissue, suggesting a role for insulin sensitisation in testicular function. In this study, we report the ameliorative effects of the PPAR γ agonist pioglitazone on testicular morphologic aberrations and impaired semen profile induced by diabetes in rats treated with intraperitoneal alloxan (150  mg/kg). Setting: This is an in vivo experimental study. Methods: Diabetic rats were randomized to receive oral pioglitazone at 10 or 30  mg/kg once daily for 6  weeks, after which rats were euthanised under <b>anaesthesia.</b> <b>Caudal</b> epididymal sperm was analysed for count, motility and morphology, and testosterone levels were measured in testicular homogenates by the enzyme immunoassay technique. Portions of the testes were fixed and processed by the H&E and Gordon and Sweet techniques. Blood glucose was estimated weekly during oral pioglitazone treatment using the glucometer. Results: Weekly blood glucose measurement showed weak effect of pioglitazone on hyperglycaemia in our model. Nonetheless, findings from caudal epididymal sperm analysis showed significantly high sperm density in the pioglitazone-treated rats at the two doses tested (P    0. 05). Conclusion: These findings show that increased sensitivity of testicular cells to insulin mediated by the PPAR γ agonist pioglitazone restores testicular histomorphometry and improves semen quality in diabetic rats, despite the weak effect of this glitazone on blood glucose. This suggests a role for insulin sensitizers and improved insulin signalling in the amelioration of testicular lesions and regulation of spermatogenesis in the diabetic state, and lends support for insulin at promoting testicular functions...|$|R
40|$|Surgery and {{anaesthesia}} {{are known}} to cause stress response. Attenuation of stress response can decrease morbidity, postoperative hospital length of stay and, thus, cost. Intrathecal and epidural techniques produce reliable analgesia in patients undergoing surgery along with stress response attenuation. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of caudal sufentanil and bupivacaine combination on perioperative stress response in paediatric patients undergoing open heart surgery. Thirty patients (ASA grade II-III) undergoing elective corrective cardiac surgery for acyanotic congenital heart disease, were randomly allocated to two groups. In group GA (n = 15), patients received balanced general anaesthesia. In group GC (n = 15), in addition to general <b>anaesthesia,</b> <b>caudal</b> block with bupivacaine and sufentanil combination was given after endotracheal intubation. Monitoring included electrocardiography, invasive arterial pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases including serum electrolytes, blood glucose, serum cortisol, urine output, central venous pressure and temperature. Haemodynamic responses in both groups were statistically similar. Serum cortisol levels were significantly lower in GC group than GA group (P 0. 05) after sternotomy (9. 8 &#x 00 B 1; 7. 5 vs. 34. 74 &#x 00 B 1; 27. 35), on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (12. 17 &#x 00 B 1; 6. 2 vs. 35. 36 &#x 00 B 1; 24. 15), after sternal closure (14. 03 &#x 00 B 1; 5. 1 vs. 37. 62 &#x 00 B 1; 20. 69), 4 hours (26. 64 &#x 00 B 1; 14. 61 vs. 37. 62 &#x 00 B 1; 9. 13) and 24 hours (14. 30 &#x 00 B 1; 8. 11 vs. 28. 12 &#x 00 B 1; 16. 31) after intubation. Blood glucose levels were significantly higher in GA group as compared to GC group at sternal closure (277. 46 &#x 00 B 1; 77. 25 vs. 197. 73 &#x 00 B 1; 42. 17) and 4 hours (255. 26 &#x 00 B 1; 73. 73 vs. 185. 26 &#x 00 B 1; 57. 41) after intubation (P 0. 05).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Anal fissures, characterised by painful {{defecation}} and rectal bleeding, {{are common}} in both children and infants. A significant proportion are resistant to simple laxative therapy, and no simple surgical treatment has been described which does not risk compromising sphincteric function. This study reports the initial experience of fissurectomy as a treatment of this condition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 36 month period, 37 children with an anal fissure were treated by fissurectomy. There were 14 boys and 23 girls, with an age range of 17 weeks to 12 years. Fissurectomy was performed under general anaesthetic, with additional <b>caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Stay sutures were used to avoid {{the need for an}} anal retractor, thereby preventing stretching of the internal anal sphincter. Of the 37 operations, 36 (97 %) were performed as day cases and all children were discharged on laxative therapy. RESULTS: At review, 6 weeks postoperatively, 30 (81 %) were asymptomatic. Six (16 %) patients were symptomatic; however, 4 of these had failed to comply with the postoperative laxative regimen. One patient failed follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Fissurectomy is a successful treatment for anal fissures, when combined with postoperative laxative therapy.

40|$|Plain {{solutions}} of 1. 73 {{per cent}} carbonated lignocaine and the equivalent concentration of lignocaine hydrochloride were compared for <b>caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in 64 patients, 46 {{of whom were}} ambulatory out-patients. The carbonated solution produced rapid intense blockage 4. 5 {{times faster than the}} hydrochloride solution, and the segmental spread of analgesia was 46 per cent more extensive. This was achieved with no increase in toxicity. The advantages of caudal block for perineal surgery in out-patients were shown to include the absence of adverse cardiac and laryngeal vagal reflexes and persistence of sacral analgesia postoperatively together with rapid mobilization. The rapid and extensive analgesia of carbonated lignocaine was shown to further enhance this technique. The carbon dioxide salts of lignocaine have been shown to have marked advantages over the hydro-chloride salts in both epidural analgesia (Bromage, 1965; Bromage et al., 1967) and brachial plexus block (Bromage and Gertel, 1970; Schulte-Stein-berg, Hartmuth and Schutt, 1970). The marked improvement in onset time and intensity of anal-gesia in these two situations suggested that car-bonated lignocaine might have desirable properties for use in caudal analgesia. This paper reports on a comparison of 2 per cent lignocaine hydrochloride and the equivalent concentration of carbonated lignocaine in caudal epidural analgesia for out-patients. Plain solutions without adrenaline were chosen in order to ensure a short period of blockade with rapid recovery of function since it has previously been shown, in lumbar epidural analgesia, that the plain carbon dioxide and hydrochloride solutions are both very short acting and the intensity of motor blockade is greatly reduced when 1 / 200, 000 adrenaline i...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is {{recommended}} for most surgical procedures of {{the lower part of}} the body, mainly below the umbilicus. It has been well established that a dorsal penile nerve block immediately after surgery decreases postoperative pain in children undergoing hypospadias repair. This study aimed to compare caudal or penile nerve block using bupivacaine in postoperative pain control in hypospadias repair in children. Patients and Methods: After local ethical committee approval and obtaining informed parental consent, 85 American society of Anesthesiologists status I and II patients, aged 6 months to 6 years old, undergoing hypospadias repair, were prospectively enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into the following two groups: Caudal block was performed in 44 and penile block was performed in 41 patients. Cardiorespiratory systems data, analgesic requirement and complications were compared between the groups. Results: There were statistically significant haemodynamic (blood pressureand heart rate) alteration during operation in each group (P< 0. 01). The haemodynamic parameters were stable during operation in successful blocks in both groups. Caudal block success rate is 97. 7 %, whereas in penile block is 92. 6 %. Nineteen of 43 patients (44 %) in caudal group and 29 of 41 patients (70 %) in penile group received analgesia in the postoperative period and this difference was significant between the two groups (P = 0. 025).

Antenatal factors For jurisdictions where data on number of antenatal visits were available, 98. 3 % of women who gave birth had at least one antenatal visit, with 92. 0 % having five or more visits. Women who had no antenatal care accounted for only 0. 3 %. The proportion of women who smoked while pregnant was 16. 2 %. The average age of mothers who smoked was 27. 0 years compared with 30. 2 years for non-smokers.   Indigenous mothers Of women who gave birth during 2008, 3. 8 % identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The average age of Indigenous mothers was 25. 1 years, compared with 30. 1 years for non-Indigenous mothers. Over half of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (50. 9 %), compared with 14. 4 % of non-Indigenous women who gave birth. Labour and delivery  Of women who laboured, 74. 6 % had analgesia administered. The most common type of analgesia for labour was nitrous oxide (50. 3 %). The most common method of administration of anaesthesia for instrumental deliveries was epidural or <b>caudal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (50. 7 %), and for caesarean sections, spinal anaesthesia (61. 3 %). This is the second year that the rate of caesarean section has not significantly increased with a 0. 2 % rise from 30. 9 % in 2007 to 31. 1 % in 2008. The caesarean section rate for first-time mothers was 32. 0 % in 2008. Around 83. 2 % of those who had previously had a caesarean section had a further caesarean section in 2008.   Baby outcomes  Of babies born in 2008, 6. 1 % of live births were of low birthweight (less than 2, 500 grams). This rate of low birthweight was the lowest in the decade 1999 – 2008. The perinatal death rate was 10. 2 per 1, 000 births in 2008, which comprised fetal and neonatal death rates of 7. 4 per 1, 000 births and 2. 8 per 1, 000 live births respectively. The leading category of perinatal death was congenital abnormality (24. 9 %). For term singleton births the leading categories of perinatal death were unexplained antepartum death (26. 8 %), congenital abnormality (16. 4 %) and hypoxic peripartum death (13. 2 %).
