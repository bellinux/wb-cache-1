Ltd, began construction in 2001 and its first section opened on 28 March 2004. Between 2004 and 2007, many new stations on the line opened successively. On 1 May 2011, the line was further extended westwards by 3 stations, bringing it to its current length of 52.8km. The Tram line in the system, the TEDA Modern Guided Rail Tram, was built to serve the Tianjin Economic Development Area and was opened on 10 May 2007. Line 2, after a lengthy construction delay and a structural accident, finally opened, as two separate sections, to the public on 1 July 2012, with the sections being reconnected on 28 August 2013. Line 3, another main north-south line, opened in October 2012.|$|E

60|$|He {{walked down}} to the <b>construction</b> <b>line</b> and went among the idle men and the strings of cars, the piles of rails and the piles of ties. He seemed to absorb in them again. Then he walked down the loose, unspiked ties to where they ended, and so on along the graded {{road-bed}} to the point where his quick eyes recognized the trouble. They swiftly took in what had been done and what had been attempted. How much needless work begun and completed in the building of the railroad! He clambered around in the sand, up and down the ravine, over the rocks, along the stream for half a mile, and it was laborious work. But how good to pant and sweat once more! He retraced his steps. Then he climbed the long slope of the hill. The wind up there blew him a welcome, and the sting and taste of dust were sweet. His steps was swift. And then again he loitered, with keen, roving glance studying the lay of the ground. Neale's was the deductive method of arriving at conclusions. Today he was inspired. And at length there blazed suddenly his solution to the problem.|$|E

60|$|Findlayson, C. E., {{sat in his}} trolley on a <b>construction</b> <b>line</b> {{that ran}} along {{one of the main}} revetments--the huge stone-faced banks that flared away north and south for three miles {{on either side of the}} river and {{permitted}} himself to think of the end. With its approaches, his work was one mile and three-quarters in length; a lattice-girder bridge, trussed with the Findlayson truss standing on seven-and-twenty brick piers. Each one of those piers was twenty-four feet in diameter, capped with red Agra stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the Ganges' bed. Above them was a railway-line fifteen feet broad; above that, again, a cart-road of eighteen feet, flanked with footpaths. At either end rose towers, of red brick, loopholed for musketry and pierced for big guns, and the ramp of the road was being pushed forward to their haunches. The raw earth-ends were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny asses climbing out of the yawning borrow-pit below with sackfuls of stuff; and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of hooves, the rattle of the drivers' sticks, and the swish and roll-down of the dirt. The river was very low, and on the dazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat cribs of railway-sleepers, filled within and daubed without with mud, to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up. In the little deep water left by the drought, an overhead crane travelled to and fro along its spile-pier, jerking sections of iron into place, snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant grunts in the timberyard. Riveters by the hundred swarmed about the lattice side-work and the iron roof of the railway line hung from invisible staging under the bellies of the girders, clustered round the throats of the piers, and rode on the overhang of the footpath-stanchions; their fire-pots and the spurts of flame that answered each hammer-stroke showing no more than pale yellow in the sun's glare. East and west and north and south the construction-trains rattled and shrieked up and down the embankments, the piled trucks of brown and white stone banging behind them till the side-boards were unpinned, and with a roar and a grumble a few thousand tons' more material were flung out to hold the river in place.|$|E

Findlayson, C. E., turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the country that he had changed for seven miles around. Looked back on the humming village of five thousand work-men; up stream and down, along the vista of spurs and sand; across the river to the far piers, lessening in the haze; overhead to the guard-towers -and only he knew how strong those were - and with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was good. There stood his bridge before him in the sunlight, lacking only a few weeks' work on the girders of the three middle piers - his bridge, raw and ugly as original sin, but pukka - permanent - to endure when all memory of the builder, yea, even of the splendid Findlayson truss, has perished. Practically, the thing was done.|$|E

40|$|Shapes - {{taken as}} {{well-defined}} collections of lines - are fundamental building blocks in architectural drawings. From doodles to shop drawings, shapes {{are used to}} denote ideas and represent elements of design, many of which ultimately translate into actual objects. But because designs evolve, the shapes representing a design are seldom static - instead, they are perpetually open to transformations. And since transformations involve relationships, conventional methods of describing shapes as sets of discrete endpoints may not provide an appropriate foundation for schematic design. This paper begins with {{a review of the}} perception of shapes and its significance in design. In particular, it argues that juxtapositions and inter-relationships of shapes are important seedbeds for creative development of designs. It is clear that conventional representation of shapes as sets of discrete lines does not cope with these -emergenti subshapes, the most basic of which arise out of intersecting and colinear lines. Attempts to redress this by using “reduction rules” based on traditional point-and-line data structures are encumbered by computational problems of precision and shape specification. Basically, this means that some “close” cases of sub-shapes may escape detection and their specifications are difficult to use in substitution operations. The paper presents the findings of a computer project - Emergence II - which explored a'relational'description of shapes based on the concept of <b>construction</b> <b>lines.</b> It builds on the notion that architectural shapes are constructed in a graphic context and that, at a basic compositional level, the context can be set by <b>construction</b> <b>lines.</b> Accordingly, the interface enables the delineation of line segments with reference to pre-established <b>construction</b> <b>lines.</b> This results in a simple data structure where the knowledge of shapes is centralized in a lookup table of all its <b>construction</b> <b>lines</b> rather than dispersed in the specifications of line segments. Taking this approach, the prototype software shows the ease and efficiency of applying “reduction rules” for intersection and colinear conditions, and for finding emergent sub-shapes by simply tracking the <b>construction</b> <b>lines</b> delimiting the ends of line segments...|$|R
