40|$|We {{proposed}} a new architecture with multiple {{pick and place}} heads to suck inspected chips and to be moved synchronously for acquiring the images of different surfaces on different chips at their corresponding acquisition stations. The computation loading of defect inspection for each chip also can be distributed because of sequential image acquisition. Considering the different computing loading of 6 surfaces of a chip, image acquisition for {{the front and back}} sides of chips is allocated at the first and second stations, and then 4 edge sides of chips. The modification and calibration of position and orientation for each opto-mechanical device will be simpler and easier when the characteristics of inspected chips changed. Thus system can accomplish the inspection for 6 surfaces of each chip and determine its quality in real-time before that chip is put onto target wafer. Developed inspection system has advantages and contributions of real-time inspection with high throughput during chip sorting process, and easily adjustment and calibration for all opto-mechanical devices to inspectdifferent types of chips. The first phase of development was accomplished for an AOI system to inspect defects on 5 surfaces of chips. System has been integrated in customer’s <b>chip</b> <b>sorter</b> for testing. The inspecting accuracy for chip backside is better than 95 %...|$|E

40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 23 rd January 2003 The integration of complete analyses systems “on chip ” {{is one of the}} great potentials of microfabricated devices. In this study we present a new pressure-driven microfabricated fluorescent-activated cell <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> with advanced functional integration. Using this sorter, fluorescent latex beads are sorted from chicken red blood cells, achieving substantial enrichments at a sample throughput of 12000 cells s 21. As a part of the <b>sorter</b> <b>chip,</b> we have developed a monolithically integrated single step coaxial flow compound for hydrodynamic focusing of samples in flow cytometry and cell sorting. The structure is simple, and can easily be microfabricated and integrated with other microfluidic components. We have designed an integrated chamber on the chip for holding and culturing of the sorted cells. By integrating this chamber, the risk of losing cells during cell handling processes is eliminated. Furthermore, we have also developed integrated optics for cell detection. Our new design contributes to the ongoing efforts for building a fully integrated micro cell sorting and analysing system...|$|R
40|$|Sorting cells {{by their}} type is an {{important}} capability in biological research and medical diagnostics. However, most cell sorting techniques rely on labels or tags, which may have limited availability and specificity. Sorting different cell types by their different physical properties is an attractive alternative to labels because all cells intrinsically have these physical properties. But some physical properties, like cell size, vary significantly from cell to cell within a cell type; this {{makes it difficult to}} identify and sort cells based on their sizes alone. In this work we continuously sort different cells types by their density, a physical property with much lower cell-to-cell variation within a cell type (and therefore greater potential to discriminate different cell types) than other physical properties. We accomplish this using a 3 D-printed microfluidic chip containing a horizontal flowing micron-scale density gradient. As cells flow through the chip, Earth's gravity makes each cell move vertically {{to the point where the}} cell's density matches the surrounding fluid's density. When the horizontal channel then splits, cells with different densities are routed to different outlets. As a proof of concept, we use our density <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> to sort polymer microbeads by their material (polyethylene and polystyrene) and blood cells by their type (white blood cells and red blood cells). The chip enriches the fraction of white blood cells in a blood sample from 0. 1 % (in whole blood) to nearly 98 % (in the output of the chip), a 1000 x enrichment. Any researcher with access to a 3 D printer can easily replicate our density <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> and use it in their own research using the design files provided as online Supporting Information. Additionally, researchers can simulate the performance of a density <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> in their own applications using the Python-based simulation software that accompanies this work. The simplicity, resolution, and throughput of this technique make it suitable for isolating even rare cell types in complex biological samples, in a wide variety of different research and clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Safe, high-rate and {{cost-effective}} cell sorting {{is important for}} clinical cell isolation. However, commercial fluorescence-activated cell sorters (FACS) are expensive and prone to aerosol-induced sample contamination. Here we report a microfluidic cell sorter allowing high rate and fully enclosed cell sorting. The <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> consists of an array of micro heating hotspots. Pulsed resistive heating in the hotspots produces numerous micro vapor bubbles with short duration, which {{gives rise to a}} rapid jet flow for cell sorting. With this method, we demonstrated high sorting rate comparable to commercial FACS and the significant enrichment of rare cancer cells. This vapor bubble based cell sorting method can be a powerful tool for contamination-free and affordable clinical cell sorting such as circulating tumor cell isolation and cancer cell therapy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The CMOS {{realization}} {{of a new}} scalable, modular sorting architecture is presented. The high-performance architecture is based on rank ordering, and on efficient implementation of multi-input majority (voting) functions. The overall complexity of the proposed bit-serial architecture increases linearly {{with the number of}} input vectors to be sorted (window size = m) and with the bit-length of the input vectors (word size = n), and the sorter architecture can be easily expanded to accommodate large vector sets. It is shown that the proposed sorting engine is capable of producing a fully sorted output vector set in (m+n- 1) clock cycles, i. e., in linear time. To demonstrate the concept, a full-custom sorting engine is realized to process 63 input vectors of 16 -bits (m = 63, n = 16), using conventional 0. 35 µm CMOS technology. The resulting <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> occupies a silicon area of 13 sqmm, operates at a clock frequency of 200 MHz, and it is capable of completing the sorting operation of 63 16 -bit vectors within 78 clock cycles. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} {{the development of}} various physical sorting algorithms, each ofwhich is represented by a corresponding sorter topology for a microfluidic-based cell <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> using electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) as transport mechanism. One of the main tasks of this novel cell sorter {{is devoted to the}} study of specific cell mechansims using cell selection in the research on tumor genesis with respect to e. g. the development of leukemias or lymphomas. The development of the multi-layer chip has been carried out in the framework of the EU founded (EFRE) joint research project "MINAPSO" (Mikrochip Navigierte Parallel Sortier-Anlage) 1 and encompasses a control chip in standard CMOS technology together with the corresponding mictrofluidic packaging. The hereby realized sorter topology consists of an optimized so-called, 2 - 3 -Sequential-Divider-Sorter" with a numerically estimated performance (i. e. cell throughput) between 0, 6 bis 1, 85 cells/clock (future chip architectures such as the so-called, "Smart-Diffusion-Sorter" achieve even higher cell throughputs up to 5 cells/clock). For the modeling and optimization of the sorter architectures (aka sorter algorithms) a simulation platform has been developed and implemented in MATLAB. Here the EWOD-based droplet manipulations and subsequent operators have been represented and handled within a sort of data paradigm in order to closely conform to the essentials of digital microfluidics. To estimate the characteristic time delays and the impact of the EWOD-based operators on the overall cell throughput together with the quest for hidden optimization potentials the previous numerical logistic analysis is paralleled by extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics as well as by corresponding droplet actuation experiments. It's worth noting that the presented cell sorter stands - {{to the best of our}} knowledge - for the currently most complex EWOD microfluidic chip...|$|R
40|$|An {{intelligent}} {{image processing}} algorithm {{is designed to}} automatically classify microscopic images of yeast cells in a microfluidic channel environment. The development process used stationary cell images as training data. The images are enhanced to reduce background noise, and a robust segmentation algorithm is developed to extract geometrical features including compactness, axis ratio, and bud size. The features are then used for classification, and the accuracies of various machine-learning classification algorithms are compared. The linear support vector machine, distance-based classification, and k-nearest-neighbour algorithm were the classifiers used. The performance variations of the system under various illumination and focusing conditions are also tested. The results suggest {{it is possible to}} automatically classify yeast cells based on their morphological characteristics with noisy and low-contrast images. A micro fabricated cell <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> is then designed for the purpose of cell sorting using the above mentioned algorithm. A review of existing cytometry techniques is conducted to justify the choices of detection and flow control technologies. Then the chip structure is designed. Experiments are conducted with different channel dimensions and chip layouts to optimize the fabrication process and sample focusing performances, a sorting simulation is conducted using fluorescent beads to optimize the detection system parameters and verify the sorting accuracy. A cell counting experiment is also performed, the system was able to detect and classify cells with very high accuracy, with a throughput of 1. 5 cells per second. Due to equipment and time limitation, cell sorting was not verified. This thesis project shows the goal of implementing mLSI at Waterloo Microfluidic Laboratory was successfully achieved, and imaging detection and mLSI can be used to produce a cell sorter capable of detecting and classifying yeast cells in different cell cycle phases. Recommendations are made at the end for improvements in the mLSI system, and the application of the cell sorter in detecting protein factors in budding yeast cells...|$|R

We also demonstrated a technique for controlling microfluidic chips that requires no off-chip hardware. We accomplish this by using inert compounds to adjust the densities of fluids in the chip. When fluids of different densities flow together under laminar flow, the interface between the fluids quickly reorients to be orthogonal to Earth's gravitational force. If the channel containing the fluids then splits into two channels, the amount of each fluid flowing into each channel is precisely determined by the angle of the channels relative to gravity. This approach allows for sophisticated control of on-chip fluids with no off-chip control hardware, significantly reducing the cost of microfluidic instruments in point-of-care or resource-limited settings...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} for the analysis and processing of biological materials require the enrichment of cell subpopulations. Conventional cell sorting systems are large and expensive with complex equipment that necessitates specialized personnel for operation. Employing microfluidics technology for lab-on-a-chip adaptation of these devices provides several benefits: improved transport control, reduced sample volumes, simplicity of operation, portability, greater accessibility, and reduced cost. The designs of microfluidic cell sorting chips vary widely in literature; evaluation and optimization efforts are rarely reported. This study intends to investigate the primary components of the design to understand the effect of various parameters and to improve {{the performance of the}} microfluidic chip. Optimized individual elements are incorporated into a proposed cell <b>sorter</b> <b>chip</b> with the ability to dynamically sort target cells from a non-homogeneous solution using electrical driving forces. Numerical and experimental results are used to evaluate the sample focusing element for controlled cell dispensing, the sorting configuration for target cell collection, and the flow elements for reduced pressure effects and prevention of flow blockages. Compact models are adapted to solve the potential field and flow field in the chip and to predict the focused sample stream width. A commercial CFD package is used to perform 2 -D simulations of the potential, velocity, and concentration fields. A fluorescence microscopy visualization system is implemented to conduct experiments on several generations of chip designs. The data from sample focusing experiments, performed with fluorescent dye samples, is analyzed using a Gaussian distribution model proposed in this work. A technique for real-time monitoring of fluorescent microspheres in the microfluidic chip enables the use of dynamic cell sorting to emulate fully autonomous operation. The performance values obtained from these experiments are used to characterize the various design configurations. Sample focusing is shown to depend largely on the relative size of the sheath fluid channel and the sample channel, but is virtually independent of the junction shape. Savings in the applied potential can be achieved by utilizing the size dependency. The focusing performance also provides information for optimizing the widths of the channels relative to the cell size. Successful sorting of desired cells is demonstrated for several designs. Key parameters that affect the sorting performance are discussed; a design employing the use of supplemental fluid streams to direct the particle during collection is chosen due to a high sorting evaluation and a low sensitivity to flow anomalies. The necessary reduction of pressure influences to achieve reliable flow conditions is accomplished by introducing channel constrictions to increase the hydrodynamic resistance. Also, prolonged operation is realized by including particle filters in the proposed design to prevent blockages caused by the accumulation of larger particles. A greater understanding of the behaviour of various components is demonstrated and a design is presented that incorporates the elements with the best performance. The capability of the microfluidic chip is summarized based on experimental results of the tested designs and theoretical cell sorting relationships. Adaptation of this chip to a stand-alone, autonomous device can be accomplished by integrating an optical detection system and further miniaturization of the critical components...|$|R
