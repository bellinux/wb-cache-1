40|$|Although {{the flow}} of {{granular}} material in silos and the pressure acting on the silo walls have been studied for over a century, many challenges still remain in silo design. In particular, during the discharge process some dynamic phenomena in silos can often be observed to display large, self-induced and dynamic pulsations which may endanger {{the stability of the}} silo structure. The aim of this thesis is to study the flow and pressure in silos using numerical modelling and analytical methods, and to further understand the mechanical behaviour of granular material and mechanism of dynamic phenomena during silo discharge. The Finite Element (FE) method can be used to analyse the behaviour of the granular material in silos by considering the material as a continuum. In this thesis, FEM modelling of silo flow was developed using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation in the Abaqus/Explicit program and the key parameters that affect the predictions of the flow and pressure during discharge were identified. Using the ALE technique, almost the entire silo discharge process can be simulated without mesh distortion problems. The mass flow rate and temporally averaged discharge pressure predicted by the FE model were first investigated in a <b>conical</b> <b>hopper</b> and were found to be in good agreement with those from the most commonly quoted theoretical solutions. The transient dynamic pressure fluctuations during incipient silo discharge were predicted and the causes for these dynamic events have been investigated which led {{to the conclusion that the}} stress wave propagation and the moving shear zone phenomena within the bulk solid were responsible for the dominant higher and lower frequencies effects respectively. A one-dimensional dynamic model of granular columns subject to Coulomb wall friction was developed to investigate the propagation of stress waves, focusing on the effect of geometry by examining converging and diverging tapered columns. The analytical solutions of this model are compared to the FE model based on the ALE formulation. This FE model was first validated using the known behaviour for cylindrical columns. In all cases, the stress impulse set off by incipient discharge at the silo outlet grew with the distance travelled up the column, however the rate was shown to depend on the halfangle of the taper. Over a range of small angles, the proposed analytical model was found to accurately predict this behaviour. After the successful application of the ALE technique for a <b>conical</b> <b>hopper,</b> the FE model was extended to simulate the granular flow in a flat-bottomed model silo. The FE predictions were compared with the silo pressure measurements in a model silo (Rotter et al, 2004). Pressure cells mounted along a vertical line on the silo walls were used to measure the pressure distribution in the silo tests using dry sand. The FE model was further extended to simulate the granular flow in a model silo consisting of a cylindrical section with a <b>conical</b> <b>hopper.</b> The prediction was compared with the experimental observations from a model silo (Munch-Andersen et al, 1992), together with the well-known theoretical solutions. Two numerical issues were addressed in some detail: one is the numerical treatment of the abrupt transition between the cylinder section and the <b>conical</b> <b>hopper,</b> the other is the interaction between the granular solid and the silo walls that was modelled using a dynamic friction model. In addition, the dynamic pressure events during discharge were examined and plausible explanations were given. Finally, this thesis deployed a non-coaxial elastoplastic constitutive model to explore the effect of non-coaxiality on silo phenomena. The non-coaxial FE modelling was performed on three problems: a simple shear test under various initial conditions, a steep hopper and a flat-bottomed silo. The results show that non-coaxiality did not influence the prediction of wall pressure during filling and storing, on the other hand, the discharge pressure was predicted to be larger when non-coaxiality is considered.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to broaden current knowledge of the strength and buckling/collapse of shells, with special reference to steel silo structures on discrete supports, and thus to provide design guidance of practical value for future silo design and construction and to develop new research aspects for further investigation. A linear elastic solution of the cylindrical shell bending equations is presented for local loadings, with special attention to local longitudinal distributed loadings. Algebraic expressions for the displacements and stresses induced by a rectangular patch of longitudinal load on a simply supported cylindrical shell are derived using double Fourier series. The solution of this problem is general, and therefore {{can be applied to}} cylindrical shells under local I loadings in any direction and with different boundary conditions. Linear elastic analyses of discretely supported perfect cylinders under axial compression are presented using the finite element method. The pre-buckling meridional membrane stress distribution above the support centreline is examined in detail, and is followed by investigations of the linear bifurcation behaviour of the cylinders. The effects on the stress distribution and the buckling strength of different loading patterns and different geometric configurations are extensively examined. Geometrically nonlinear elastic buckling analyses are also performed using large deflection theory. Both perfect and imperfect cylinders are studied with various geometric configurations and under different loading conditions. The nonlinear elastic buckling behaviour, the buckling strength and the buckling configuration are thoroughly investigated for discretely supported cylinders Further studies extend the work into the plastic range. Discretely supported cylinders obeying the von Mises yield criterion are analysed. Limit analyses of perfect cylinders are first conducted using small deflection theory. Geometrically nonlinear elastic-plastic collapse analyses of both perfect and imperfect cylinders are performed next. Studies of different loading conditions and parametric studies of varying geometries and material strengths are presented in both types of analysis.

Jenike’s radial solution, {{widely used}} {{in the design of}} materials-handling equipment, is a {{similarity}} solution of steady-state continuum equations for the flow under gravity of granular material through an infinite, right-circular cone.

Unlike for the Jenike solution, all three components of the correction velocity are nonzero: i. e., there is secondary circulation in the perturbed flow. We show that, depending on hopper and material parameters, the perturbed velocity depends sensitively, to an astonishing degree, on hopper geometry.

Guided by numerical models based upon continuum descriptions, we find experimental evidence for secondary, azimuthal circulation in response to perturbation of the symmetry with respect to gravity by tilting. For small perturbations we can discriminate between constitutive relations, based upon the agreement between the numerical predictions they produce and our experimental results. We find that the secondary circulation can be suppressed as wall friction is varied, also in agreement with numerical predictions. For large tilt angles we observe the abrupt onset of circulation for parameters where circulation was previously suppressed.

40|$|In this thesis, a high-fidelity multibody {{dynamics}} {{model of}} a backhoe for simulating the digging operation is developed using the DIS (Dynamic Interactions Simulator) multibody dynamics software. Sand {{is used as a}} sample digging material to illustrate the model. The backhoe components (such as frame, manipulators links, track segments, wheels and sprockets) are modeled as rigid bodies. The geometry of the major moving components of the backhoe is created using the Pro/E solid modeling software. The components of the backhoe are imported to DIS and connected using joints (revolute, cylindrical and prismatic joints). Rotary and linear actuators along with PD (Proportional-Derivative) controllers are used to move and steer the backhoe and to move the backhoes manipulator in the desired trajectory. Sand is modeled using cubic shaped particles that can come into contact with each other, the backhoes bucket and ground. A cubical sand particle contact surface is modeled using eight spheres that are rigidly glued to each other to form a cubical shaped particle, The backhoe and ground surfaces are modeled as polygonal surfaces. A penalty technique is used to impose both joint and normal contact constraints (including track-wheels, track-terrain, bucket-particles and particles-particles contact). An asperity-based friction model is used to model joint and contact friction. A Cartesian Eulerian grid contact search algorithm is used to allow fast contact detection between particles. A recursive bounding box contact search algorithm is used to allow fast contact detection for polygonal contact surfaces and is used to detect contact between: track and ground; track and wheels; bucket and particles; and ground and particles. The governing equations of motion are solved along with joint/constraint equations using a time-accurate explicit solution procedure. ^ The sand model is validated using a <b>conical</b> <b>hopper</b> sand flow experiment in which the sand flow rate during discharge and the angle of repose of the resulting sand pile are experimentally measured.

The addition of magnesium stearate flow increases the rate through the granulate sorbitol. Mass flow rate through the orifice the <b>conical</b> <b>hopper</b> of the test depending on the particle size and hole diameter were monitored. With increasing particle size the rate of pouring decreases, while the diameter of the hole had the opposite effect. Dependence of the flow rate to the average of the opening of the hopper was modeled by a power equation Jones-Pilpel. When using the current parameters with accuracy reverse estimate of the flow rate ranged between approximately 2 - 4 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{problems}} related to the flow of cohesionless granular materials in hoppers are investigated. An approximate solution to the flow of granular materials in a <b>conical</b> <b>hopper</b> is presented. The material is modeled as a rigid-perfectly plastic continuum which satisfies the Mohr-Coulomb yield condition. Unknown geometries of {{the upper and lower}} free surfaces are determined from the stress-free conditions. The results are compared to those based on different constitutive postulates as well as to experimental observations. The computed mass flow rate and wall stress compare well with the experimental measurements made with small and full size hoppers. The flow field in a hopper with a vertical bin is observed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the details of the flow field. The observations seem to correspond to the recent results obtained by other investigators using X-ray radiography. The funnel flow regime in hoppers is studied in detail. The different types of flow which exist are identified and classified. The possibility of having a transition from one type of flow into another one is recorded as a function of the material properties and hopper geometry. Finally, the boundary between the moving and stagnant material is studied as a function of the hopper geometry. Other parameters such as the effect of the hopper thickness and wall roughness on the flow field are also studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDiscrete and {{continuum}} modelling of granular flow in a <b>conical</b> <b>hopper</b> discharge is presented. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is {{used for}} discrete modelling and Finite Element Method based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for continuum modelling. The ALE model has shown its capability to model granular flow and macroscopic behaviour in silos in the authors’ previous work (Wang et al., 2013). The use of ALE overcomes mesh distortion problem due to material large deformation which is often encountered in standard finite element modelling of silo discharge. However, there is still limitation when a continuum method is used to model silo discharge, in particular, to pursue particle-scale features in such granular flow. In this study, wall pressure, flow pattern and flow rate during silo discharge are investigated using both ALE and DEM simulation. Classical theories are used as a comparison, to verify the two numerical models. By comparison, it is indicated that both FE model using ALE formulation and DEM model {{have the capacity to}} model the granular behaviour and wall pressure for granular process in silos. The conclusion that ALE has advantages over DEM in wall pressure prediction giving stable pressure profile with smooth trend; while DEM has the ability to evaluate the role of particle-scale parameters on macro-scale response in such granular flow after carefully smoothing out the results has been drawn in the present study...|$|E
40|$|Accurate batch {{dispensing}} {{of pharmaceutical}} powders, {{on the scale}} of hundreds of microns, in small doses is a challenging task. A novel dispensing technique has been developed by Yang et al. using high-frequency vibration to control powder flowout of a narrow hopper. Thismethod removes the need for mechanical valves because the powder, very quickly, forms a bridge-like structure across the passive outlet preventing outflow. Activation of the vibration has been found to destabilise the bridging structure enabling the powder to flow, when vibration stops the bridge structure quickly rebuilds and dispensing stops. In this work the Discrete Element Method (DEM) was used to simulate this novel dispensing control method in order to identify the internal mechanism that allows the flow to be controlled so precisely. A simulated <b>conical</b> <b>hopper</b> was filledwith particles then oscillated vertically at high frequency (~ 10 kHz), amplitude and frequency were scaled from the experimental system. Two orifice sizes, a variety of DEM parameters and two vibration modes were simulated. The parametric study of DEM parameters was based around a case that provided flow rates within a factor of 2 of the experimental flow rates. Dispensing after vibration was found to stop very quickly as in experiments. Visualisation of internal structures during fill, vibration and immediately after vibration revealed a central mass of slow moving particles floating above the nozzle outlet. When the vibration stops the central mass of particles drops into contact with the walls and quickly plugs the flow...|$|E
