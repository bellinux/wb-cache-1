5|$|Due to {{a change}} in {{election}} law approved by Jersey City voters at the end of 2016, mayoral elections will now take place in November, with the next election scheduled for November 2017. Although the mayorship has historically been a four-year term in Jersey City, and although <b>current</b> <b>law</b> prescribes the mayorship as being a four-year term in the future, due to the calendar change in elections, the current mayorship is a four-and-a-half-year term, beginning July 2013 and ending at the end of 2017. The winner of the November 2017 mayoral election will take office January 1, 2018.|$|E
5|$|In short, an Indian cannot today gain a {{right of}} {{occupancy}} simply by occupying public land, as the Indians did in Cramer. Under <b>current</b> <b>law,</b> that occupancy could {{not be viewed as}} undertaken with the implied consent of the government, as was the occupancy in Cramer. We therefore conclude that any individual occupancy rights acquired by the Danns must have had their inception prior to November 26, 1934, the date that the lands in question were withdrawn from entry by Executive Order No. 6910.|$|E

The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|The <b>current</b> <b>law</b> {{regulating}} {{the design and}} use of the Belarusian emblem was passed on July 5, 2004. Article 9 of Chapter 3 of Law No. 301-3 begins by describing the official drawing of the Belarusian arms and regulates on its proper design. Officially, the arms can be drawn in full colour, monochrome or using two colors. Article 10 states that the national emblem must be displayed at specified locations on a continual basis, such as the residences of the Belarusian leader, the chamber of the National Assembly and at governmental offices of national and regional levels. The emblem can also be used on documents issued by the government, including money, passports and official letterheads.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With the increased use of the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage <b>current</b> <b>law</b> was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E

5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under <b>current</b> <b>law,</b> the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E
