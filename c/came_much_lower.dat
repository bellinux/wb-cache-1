It was filmed by a tourist at the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming with an 8-millimeter color movie camera. The object was in the range of size from a car to a house and could have ended its life in a Hiroshima-sized blast, but there was never any explosion. Analysis of the trajectory indicated that it never <b>came</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than [...] off the ground, and the conclusion was that it had grazed Earth's atmosphere for about 100 seconds, then skipped back out of the atmosphere to return to its orbit around the Sun.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Besides critiquing the Congressional Budget Office {{for failing}} to cite and discuss {{evidence}} from independent sources that suggest that the net corporate costs of pharmaceutical research and development costs are <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than industry advocates claim, Light’s review showed how these high estimates are constructed realities that one can reconstruct by using different assumptions, data, or calculations and <b>come</b> up with <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> estimates. In their reply here, DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski unwittingly reinforce that point. Besides critiquing the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{for failing to}} cite and discuss evidence from independent sources that suggest that the net corporate costs of pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) costs are <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than industry advocates claim, I aimed in my review to show how these high estimates are constructed realities that one can reconstruct by using different assumptions, data, or calculations and <b>come</b> up with <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> estimates. In their reply here, DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski unwittingly reinforce that point. While I cite data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicating {{that the number of}} sub-jects involved in the trials used to approve a new drug are one-third or less as many as those used by Dimasi, Hansen, and Grabowski in their high estimated cost of drug development, they would argue that all the subjects in all the trials by a company should be counted. Companies do many other trials, mainly to bolster their marketing materials; so should they be counted as marketing expenses or R&D expenses? Readers can decide. DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski do not comment on data I cit...|$|R
2500|$|Morgan's poor form {{continued}} into the World Cup, where he only scored 90 runs in five innings. His tournament started badly as he was dismissed for a duck in England's opening game against Australia. He made 17 in the next match against New Zealand as England slumped to a humiliating eight wicket defeat. He made 46 against Scotland as England won their first match of the tournament, and made 27 in England's nine wicket defeat against Sri Lanka. He was out for yet another duck in England's must win game against Bangladesh, meaning they exited the tournament. They won their final match against Afghanistan, with Morgan {{not be required to}} bat.

Although Marian and Ted are fully aware of this, Leo is too naïve to understand why the lovers can never marry.

Together, these factors make Marian's secret relationship with Ted highly dangerous for all parties concerned.|$|R
30|$|Because we fix {{the wage}} {{at the level}} of the pre-shock {{competitive}} equilibrium, these results should be considered an upper estimate. To the extent that wages adjust somewhat, our quantitative results will reflect that adjustment, though our qualitative results hold. In addition, we do not model a world price of pome and prunus, which may drastically decrease the ability of these industries to pass-though the spoilage rate costs onto the consumer as higher prices, and thus harm would <b>come</b> at <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> spoilage rates. In that case, increased imports would maintain the quantity consumed and prevent prices from increasing; thus, the loss to consumer welfare would be limited. Instead, losses would fall most directly on domestic producers. Harm would come to domestic producers much more quickly than the spoilage rates we report. Finally, our analysis is limited to the industry level because of data unavailability. Despite this limitation, the lessons here can be applied to differentiated sub-industry products such as particular varieties or organically produced products, for example.|$|R
50|$|Extensive {{additional}} renovations in the amphitheater {{were made}} in the mid-1990s. Congress appropriated $4.82 million in fiscal 1992 to repair rainwater damage and fix leaks, and an additional $4.5 million in fiscal 1993 to restore damaged marble. Although the project was planned for completion in July 1995, a six-month delay occurred because of protests regarding the way the contracts were awarded. Bids for the project <b>came</b> in <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than anticipated, creating $2.7 million in savings. The Army used $34,405 to make whole the bidder who had protested the improper contract award. About $1.4 million of these savings were used to build new wheelchair access ramps and improve access to the amphitheater for handicapped or disabled individuals. The remaining $1.3 million were used to build a columbarium at the cemetery. The repairs included installation of new waterproof membranes; removing water and rust stains; patching and repainting cement, marble, and stone; replacement of all deteriorated marble sculptures, balusters, and benches; replacement of worn and rusted iron railings and drinking fountains; replacement of worn and broken flagstone walkways; and installation of new and upgraded signage and trash containers. These repairs and improvements were almost complete by the end of March 1996.|$|R

40|$|Portugal, {{like the}} rest of the world, is going through a huge {{economic}} crisis, in this sense; other types of product emerge to meet consumer needs and the country's economy.

In Portugal, these drugs have become a success story, recognized by the European Medicines Association (Gonçalves, 2009), which is related with the governmental measures adopted by governments, since the introduction of this type of medication in Portuguese market, as the creation of reference prices. However, this growth could have been even greater if it had not been observed a low rate of prescription in an initial phase. In this study, in order to understand how to enhance the consumption of these drugs and understand why in many cases Brand medicines are still elected as the first choice, the researcher proposed to observe the consumer due to its activ...|$|R
25|$|Following {{the study}} committee's report, {{the school board}} agreed to use a {{one-time}} refund on insurance premiums to pay for $575,000 in repairs at Memorial Stadium. These included east bleacher drainage improvements, east bleacher foundation and stairway improvements, and adding handicapped-accessible areas to both {{the east and west}} grandstands. The cost of these upgrades increased to $600,000 in May 2000. Costs had actually decreased because an engineer's assessment came in lower than expected and an accounting error was discovered that removed double-counting of expenses. With the additional expenditure of just $25,000, however, the work could now be expanded to include entirely replacing the east bleachers, replacing the running track, and doubling the size of the team meeting/concessions buildings. In May 2000, the work was expected to be complete by the fall. The school board had yet to decide whether the track should be expanded to 10 lanes, but did agree to solicit bids to determine the cost of improving the west grandstand. The track was expanded to eight lanes two weeks later. The track work contract came in 16 percent low, which enabled the school district to add improvements to the long-jump paths and pits as well. The contract for replacing the east bleachers, however, came in $95,000 high after contractors discovered that the existing drainage system was far more damaged than previously suspected. In June 2000, the school board agreed to tap its general maintenance fund to pay for the work on the west bleachers after these cost estimates <b>came</b> in <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than expected.|$|R
40|$|A formal {{comparison}} between fundamental RX amplifier configurations for Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUT) is proposed in this paper. The impact on both RX and the pulse-echo frequency response {{and on the}} output SNR are thoroughly analysed and discussed. It is shown that the resistive-feedback amplifier yields a band-pass RX frequency response, while both open-loop voltage and capacitivefeedback amplifiers exhibit a low-pass frequency response. For a given power dissipation, it is formally proved that a capacitivefeedback amplifier provides a remarkable SNR improvement against the commonly adopted resistive feedback stage, achieved {{at the expense of}} a reduced pulse-echo center frequency, making its use convenient in low and mid-frequency ultrasound imaging applications. The advantage mostly <b>comes</b> from a <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> noise contributed by the active devices, especially with low-Q, broadband transducers. The results of the analysis are applied to the design of a CMUT front-end in BCD-SOI technology operating at 10 MHz center frequency. It comprises a low-power RX amplifier, a high voltage T/R switch and a 100 V TX driver. Extensive electrical characterization, pulse-echo measurements and imaging results are shown. Compared to previously reported CMUT front-ends, this transceiver demonstrates the highest dynamic range and state-of-the-art noise performance with RX amplifier power dissipation of 1 mW...|$|R

50|$|Although most of {{the focus}} for {{improving}} energy efficiency in buildings has been on their operational emissions, {{it is estimated that}} about 30% of all energy consumed throughout the lifetime of a building can be in its embodied energy (this percentage varies based on factors such as age of building, climate, and materials). In the past, this percentage was <b>much</b> <b>lower,</b> but as <b>much</b> focus has been placed on reducing operational emissions (such as efficiency improvements in heating and cooling systems), the embodied energy contribution has <b>come</b> <b>much</b> more into play. Examples of embodied energy include: the energy used to extract raw resources, process materials, assemble product components, transport between each step, construction, maintenance and repair, deconstruction and disposal. As such, it is important to employ a whole-life carbon accounting framework in analyzing the carbon emissions in buildings.|$|R
50|$|The study {{claims that}} the {{major part of the}} Balto-Slavic genetic {{variation}} can be primarily attributed to the assimilation of the pre-existing regional genetic components, which differed for present West, East and South Slavic-speaking people. For Slavic peoples correlations with linguistics <b>came</b> out <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than high correlations with geography. The South Slavic group, despite sharing a common language, is separated and has largely different genetic past from their northern linguistic relatives genetically. Therefore, for the Bulgarians and most other South Slavs the most plausible explanation would be that their most sizable genetic components were inherited from indigenous Balkan pre-Slavic and pre-Bulgar population. Another pan-Slavic Y-DNA study concludes that most of the Southern Slavic group is distinct from their Northern Slavic relatives, whose homogeneity on the other hand stretches form the Alps to Volga end even as far as the Pacific Ocean in Russia. This means that there is a paternal genetic rather than a geographical factor separating these Slavic peoples. The South Slavs are characterized by featuring NRY hgs I2a and E plus 10% higher Mediterranean k2 autosomal component, while the Eastern and Western Slavs are characterized by the k3 component and hg R1a. The current differentiation of high I-P37 and lower R-Z282 among South Slavs and vice versa among North Slavs suggests it was present prior to the Slavic settling in the Balkans as no relevant migrations occur later to change the frequencies. The contribution of the Y chromosomes of peoples who had settled in the Balkans before the Slavic expansion is the most likely explanation of the phenomenon according to the other study on Y-haplotypes, concluded by its two separate analyses because of the complicity of the methods tracing the alleles. The presence of two distinct genetic substrata in the genes of East-West and South Slavs would conclude that assimilation of indigenous populations by bearers of Slavic languages was a major mechanism of the spread of Slavic languages to the Balkan Peninsula.|$|R
