5|$|In addition, medieval cases {{referred}} to the clauses in Magna <b>Carta</b> which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation. Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna <b>Carta</b> rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because Magna <b>Carta</b> had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna <b>Carta</b> were no longer actively used.|$|E

5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of habeas corpus was backed by Magna <b>Carta.</b> Coke supported the Petition of Right in 1628, which cited Magna <b>Carta</b> in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna <b>Carta.</b> Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna <b>Carta</b> {{in any way that}} would reduce his independence as King.|$|E

5|$|In 1687, William Penn {{published}} The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property: {{being the}} birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England, which contained the first copy of Magna <b>Carta</b> printed on American soil.

5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, Magna <b>Carta</b> became {{increasingly}} {{important as a}} political document in arguments over {{the authority of the}} English monarchy. James I and Charles I both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the divine right of kings, and Magna <b>Carta</b> was cited extensively by their opponents to challenge the monarchy.|$|E

Edward also invoked Magna <b>Carta</b> in advancing his cause, arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and were themselves acting against Magna <b>Carta.</b> In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the Statute of Marlborough, which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna <b>Carta.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1258, a {{group of}} barons seized power from Henry in a coup d'état, citing the need to {{strictly}} enforce Magna <b>Carta</b> and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the Provisions of Oxford. The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to Louis IX of France in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued their case based on Magna <b>Carta,</b> suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Whig {{interpretation}} of Magna <b>Carta</b> {{and its role}} in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian William Stubbs's Constitutional History of England, published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark of this view. Stubbs argued that Magna <b>Carta</b> had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation, and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.|$|E
5|$|It also greatly {{extended}} {{the powers of}} Parliament. Under this new constitution, monarchical absolutism was replaced by parliamentary supremacy. It was quickly realised that Magna <b>Carta</b> stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This supremacy would be challenged {{by the likes of}} Granville Sharp. Sharp regarded Magna <b>Carta</b> as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained that it would be treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited slavery.|$|E

5|$|John's French defeats {{weakened}} {{his position}} in England. The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in the Magna <b>Carta,</b> which limited royal power and established common law. This would {{form the basis of}} every constitutional battle of the 13th and 14th centuries. The barons and the crown failed to abide by the Magna <b>Carta,</b> leading to the First Barons' War when rebel barons provoked an invasion by Prince Louis. Many historians use John's death and William Marshall's appointment as protector of nine-year-old Henry III to mark the end of the Angevin period {{and the beginning of the}} Plantagenet dynasty. Marshall won the war with victories at Lincoln and Dover in 1217, leading to the Treaty of Lambeth in which Louis renounced his claims. In victory, the Marshal Protectorate reissued the Magna <b>Carta</b> as the basis of future government.|$|E

5|$|Radicals such as Sir Francis Burdett {{believed}} that Magna <b>Carta</b> {{could not be}} repealed, but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be repealed. The repeal of clause 36 in 1829, by the Offences against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4 c. 31 s. 1), {{was the first time}} a clause of Magna <b>Carta</b> was repealed. Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of Magna <b>Carta</b> (1297) as statute was repealed, leaving just clauses 1, 9, and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were repealed in England and Wales by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863, and in modern Northern Ireland and also in the modern Republic of Ireland by the Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872.|$|E

5|$|The charter {{became part}} of English {{political}} life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it {{lost some of its}} practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna <b>Carta.</b> Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going {{back to the days of}} the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna <b>Carta</b> had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as habeas corpus. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna <b>Carta</b> extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna <b>Carta,</b> until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.|$|E
