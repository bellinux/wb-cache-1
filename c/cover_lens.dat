Ve spolupráci s Hella Autotechnik s. r. o., se budu snažit potvrdit/vyvrátit předpokládanou závislost rozměrových odchylek na geometrii krycích skel. Výsledkem by mělo být zformulování závěru, zda mezi výsledky Moldflow a 3 D měřením existuje závislost a zda může mít odlišná konstrukce podobných skel vliv na budoucí rozměry. The {{subject of}} this thesis is to compare the 3 D analysis, to process data {{as well as to}} find {{deviations}} between MOLDFLOW and 3 D measurement. Moreover, the author will investigate the cause in the structure of glass. In collaboration with the company Hella Autotechnik Ltd., the author will try to confirm / disprove the expected dependence of dimensional variations on the geometry of the <b>cover</b> <b>lens.</b> In line with this, the aim of this thesis is to formulate a conclusion, in particular, whether the results of Moldflow and the 3 D measuring dependency exists as well as whether different design of glass may have a similar effect on the future size 639 - Katedra managementu kvalitydobř...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} applications for high brightness LEDs is in automotive headlights. Optical designs for a low or high beam headlights are plagued by the low flux and luminance of LEDs compared to HID or incandescent sources, by mechanical chip placement tolerances and by color and flux variations between different LEDs. Furthermore the creation of a sharp cutoff is very difficult without baffles or other lossy devices. We present a novel LED headlight design that addresses all of the above problems by mixing the light of several LEDs first in a tailored light guide called LED combiner, thereby reducing color and flux variations between different LEDs and illuminance and color variations across the LED surfaces. The LED combiner forms a virtual source tailored to the application. The illuminance distribution of this virtual source facilitates the generation of the desired intensity pattern by projecting it into the far field. The projection is accomplished by one refractive and one reflective freeform surface calculated by the 3 D SMS method. A high quality intensity pattern shape and a very sharp cutoff are created tolerant to LED to optics misalignment and illuminance variations across the LED surface. A low and high beam design with more than 75 % total optical efficiency (without <b>cover</b> <b>lens)</b> and performance as latest HID headlights have been achieved. Furthermore it is shown that the architecture has similar tolerance requirements as conventional mass produced headlights...|$|E

50|$|A superzoom or hyperzoom lens {{is a type}} of {{photographic}} zoom lenses with unconventionally large focal length factors, typically ranging from wide angle to extreme long lens focal lengths in one lens. There is no clear definition of a superzoom lens but the name generally <b>covers</b> <b>lenses</b> that have a range well above the 3x or 4x of a standard zoom lens, with lenses being 10x, 12x, 18x, or above considered superzoom.|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, number of {{surveillance}} cameras deployed has increased significantly.

These cameras are often unattended or security guard might have lost his focus and if discovery of such an attempt is not immediate, even though there is no failure in the system and the images are still being recorded, these recordings are not useful.

The powerful quartz iodine swiveling headlamps designed for the 1968 model DS represented so many performance improvements at once that they were far beyond what the regulations could allow. Even the aerodynamic headlight covers were illegal - as seen on the 1968 Jaguar E-Type. It took the lobbying muscle of Ford {{to point out that}} the government was requiring two contradictory things - safety, by ensuring that all headlights were best-of-breed circa 1940, and fuel economy through the CAFE standard - by definition, cars with poor aerodynamics are sacrificing fuel economy. Composite bulb lamps and aerodynamic covered headlights were not permitted until 1983.|$|R
