After validation by comparison against published triaxial test results, this model was applied to a numerical simulation developed for computing the axial bearing capacity of a pile foundation subjected to a cyclic loading. The axial bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>degradation</b> of a single pile under different cyclic load levels and different cyclic load numbers was studied.

In order to improve the computational efficiency, a simplified analysis method based on a simple nonlinear soil model is presented for the cyclic axial <b>capacity</b> <b>degradation</b> of single piles.

Consider {{that there are two}} players in the network: the first player wishes to split its traffic so as to minimize its average delay, which the second player, i. e., the malicious player, tries to maximize. The first player has a demand constraint on the total traffic it routes. The second player controls the link capacities: it can decrease by some amount the capacity of each link under a constraint on the sum of <b>capacity</b> <b>degradation.</b> We first show that the average delay function is convex both in traffic and in <b>capacity</b> <b>degradation</b> over the parallel links and thus does not have a saddle point. We identify best responses strategies of each player and compute both the max-min and the min-max values of the game. We are especially interested in the min max strategy as it guarantees the best performance under worst possible link <b>capacity</b> <b>degradation.</b> It thus allows to obtain routing strategies that are resilient and robust.

This travel time budget varies with individuals and with trip purposes and is related to the requirement on punctual arrivals. Moreover, all travelers want to minimize their travel time budgets. We formulate this route choice behavior in a mix-equilibrium formulation with multiple classes of travelers, each class with a different requirement on punctual arrivals.

EVAP 5 M was developed under this project to provide a tool for simulating a finned-tube air-to refrigerant evaporator operating with single-component refrigerants and refrigerant mixtures. The tube-by-tube modeling approach allowed for one-dimensional non-uniformity in the air velocity profile and arbitrary maldistribution on the refrigerant side. The model uses the Carnahan-Starling-DeSantis equation of state for calculating refrigerant thermodynamic properties. Simulations were performed for three evaporator slabs with different refrigerant circuitry designs. For the maldistributions studied, maldistributed air caused much more significant <b>capacity</b> <b>degradation</b> than maldistributed refrigerant.
