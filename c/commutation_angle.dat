As low-resolution position sensors, a high placement accuracy of Hall-effect sensors is hard to achieve. Accordingly, a <b>commutation</b> <b>angle</b> error is generated. so this <b>commutation</b> <b>angle</b> is causes the increase in losses of the low inductance motor and even cause serious consequence, which is the abnormal conduction of a freewheeling diode in the unexcited phase especially at high speed. In this paper, the influence of the <b>commutation</b> <b>angle</b> error for the high-speed low inductance brushless dc motor and non ideal back electromotive force in a magnetically suspended control moment gyro (MSCMG) is analyzed. In order to achieve low steady-state loss of an MSCMG for space application the self compensation method for the <b>commutation</b> <b>angle</b> error is introduced in terms of dc link current to reduce the error. The simulation results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Index Terms—BLDC motor, <b>commutation</b> <b>angle</b> error, self-compensation, Hall sensors, Lo...|$|E

40|$|An AC system’s voltage {{unbalance}} by {{a fundamental}} frequency negative sequence system {{is usually the}} main cause for the emission of non-characteristic harmonics by current source converters as used in conventional HVDC systems. This emission takes place {{on both sides of}} each 12 -pulse converter. On the DC side mainly a 2 nd harmonic voltage appears driving a 2 nd harmonic current. The magnitude of this harmonic current can exceed the magnitudes of the characteristic harmonics even if no low order resonance exists. Further non-characteristic harmonics generated by the converter under such unbalanced supply voltage conditions have frequencies with a frequency distance to the characteristic harmonics of 2 times the fundamental frequency. The main technical drawbacks are the unintended coupling between both AC systems and the risk of thyristor over-stresses by DC current discontinuities at low power transfer levels. On both AC sides the largest 2 non-characteristic current harmonics generated by a 12 -pulse HVDC converter under unbalanced supply voltage conditions are a negative sequence system of the fundamental harmonic and a positive sequence system of the 3 rd harmonic. Also on the AC sides further harmonics are emitted by the converter with a order number distance of 2 to the orders of the characteristic harmonics. However, in practical AC system operation special attention has to be paid to the 3 rd harmonic distortion level, in particular when low order resonance appears between the system impedance and the impedance of the converter station AC filters. In order to avoid the above mentioned problems, large smoothing reactors and sometimes large blocking filters are installed on the DC side and the voltage distortion on the AC sides is reduced by AC filters. However, these filters require an expensive high component rating if they are tuned to the 2 nd or 3 rd harmonic respectively. The work shows that a modification of the valve firing can reduce the levels of the 2 nd and 3 rd harmonic without investment into additional primary equipment. Furthermore, this offers the chance to reduce the minimum power transfer level since also the risk of an intermittent DC current can be reduced. A corresponding algorithm and a control strategy are proposed. However, the calculation of an appropriate firing pattern requires a detailed modelling of the processes within the converters, especially the formation of the harmonics and the harmonic transfer between AC and DC sides. The work proposes a component vector model for the calculation of the harmonics. This model assumes that each harmonic consists of a first component representing the ideal conversion process, a 2 nd component representing the impact of different <b>commutation</b> <b>angles</b> {{and in the case of}} the modified firing a 3 rd component considering the impact of the intended non-equidistant firing. The work shows, that the harmonic component vectors resulting from voltage unbalance and from firing modulation can be treated separately and superimposed linearly. The calculation of the harmonic component vectors is performed applying the method of switching functions. For the consideration of the <b>commutation</b> and firing <b>angle</b> differences the modelling of switching functions based on differential impulses is proposed. However, especially an accurate representation of the above mentioned 2 nd component vector requires a correct calculation of the <b>commutation</b> <b>angles</b> and their valve-specific differences. The investigations of this work have revealed that the conventional method of calculating the <b>commutation</b> <b>angles</b> – assuming an ideal smoothed DC current - may not produce results of sufficient accuracy. This is especially true in the case of a high ripple of the DC current, e. g. smoothed with a small smoothing reactor. A small smoothing reactor is typical for HVDC back-to-back applications. Therefore a new analytical method for the calculation of the <b>commutation</b> <b>angles</b> has been developed which in particular considers the typical pulse form of the DC current and additionally the impacts of the voltage unbalance and of the proposed modification of the firing on the ripple shape of the DC current. Moreover, as this analytical method requires the instantaneous values of the DC current at the instants of valve firing, a further analytical method for the calculation of these discrete current values has been developed. The equations are valid under the same conditions as the new ones for calculation of the <b>commutation</b> <b>angles,</b> i. e. resistive-inductive AC system fundamental frequency impedances, any degree of DC current smoothing between ideal smoothing and a ripple at the limit for current discontinuities. Symmetrical conditions, supply voltage unbalances and non-equidistant firing as proposed are applied. It is shown that, using this method, also the discrete values of the DC current at the end of the commutation intervals can be determined. In practice one of these discrete current values indicates the minimum value during one period of the fundamental frequency. This offers the chance for a more exact analytical determination of the limit for the appearance of DC current discontinuities. For typical parameters of a back-to-back installation the new methods and the new analytical equations have been compared with simulation results showing excellent correlation for typical voltage unbalances of not more than 1 [...] . 2 % and firing angle differences of not more than 2. 5 °. This verification is performed for the harmonics, the <b>commutation</b> <b>angles</b> and the discrete values of the DC current at the firing instants as well...|$|R

40|$|As the induced-voltage commutation-type commutatorless motor (DC-CLM) {{depends on}} only its {{armature}} induced-voltage commutation of thyristors, in the starting, it sometimes fails in commutation.

The goal is to reduce noise generated by radial vibrations of the stator. Motor phase commutation angles are dithered by 1 or 2 mechanical degrees to investigate the effect of randomization on acoustic noise. VRM commutation points are varied using a uniform probability density function and a 4 state Markov chain among other methods. The theory of VRM and inverter operation and a derivation of {{the major source of}} acoustic noise are developed. The experimental results show the effects of randomization. Uniform dithering and Markov chain dithering both tend to spread the noise spectrum, reducing peak noise components. No clear evidence is found to determine which is the optimum randomization scheme.

40|$|M. Sc. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering) The {{behaviour}} of {{alternating current}} machines being fed from an electronic commutator is investigated. The performance of compound power switches {{for use in}} electric vehicle drives are examined. A detailed study on switching losses and base current characteristics based upon experimental measurements was carried out. With further reference to power switches the merit, development and functioning of an electronic commutator is discussed. Because of the close association between this study and electric vehicle drives, a comparative study {{of the performance of}} different rotor types within the same machine was executed. Attention is paid to torque and efficiency characteristics in particular. The influence of voltage and current harmonics was established by comparative testing of the machine with sinusoidal and electronic commutator excitation. The study shows that the highest specific power was attained with the alternating current machine with a wound rotor (synchronous machine) while there seems to be merit in the use of permanent magnet rotors for electric drives as well. On the average the use of electronic commutator excitation resulted in an efficiency decrease of approximately 15 % for the a. c. machine with different rotor types. Efficiency and torque for an induction machine with solid rotor were disappointing so that there seems to be little application for solid steel rotors. A simple model for the synchronous machine with wound rotor was developed to explain the dependence of torque and efficiency upon speed of rotation and <b>commutation</b> <b>angle.</b> To conclude, guidelines are given for future studies on electric vehicle drives and machine types as primary drive...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Switched {{reluctance}} motor (SRM) drive has remarkable characteristics {{that make it}} attractive for high-speed applications. As the motor’s speed increases {{the shape of the}} current waveform changes in such way that limits the production of motoring torque. At high speeds, it is possible for the phase current never reaches the desired value due to the self e. m. f. of the motor, therefore, the torque falls off. In order to remedy this problem, the phase turn on angle is advanced in such way that the phase commutation begins sooner. Advancing the <b>commutation</b> <b>angle</b> offers the advantages of getting the current into the phase winding while the inductance of the phase is low, and also of having a little more time to get the current out of the phase winding before the rotor reaches the negative torque region. Since the SRM drive is a variable speed motor then, the amount of advancing for the turn on angle should be accomplished automatically according to the speed of the motor, meaning, as the motor speed increases so should the turn on angle and vice versa. In this respect, this paper introduces an electronic governor using a P. L. L. module in conjunction with a micro controller to achieve this task for a desired speed/advancement angle profile, which is considered to be linear in this study. The governor causes 0 - 14 degrees automatic adjustment in the turn on angle from stand still to a pre-set speed for a SR motor. A linear analysis of the curren...|$|E
40|$|As the induced-voltage {{commutation}} type commutatorless motor (Thy-CLM) {{does not}} need external commutation elements such as capacitors and reactors, its construction is simple compared with the compulsive commutation type CLM. But, as the commutation of the thyristors depends on the armature induced-voltage, the setting angle has to be equal to or larger than the <b>commutation</b> margin <b>angle.</b> Therefore, for the Thy-CLM, if the setting angle is smaller than the commutation‐margin angle, its normal operation {{as well as its}} starting are imposible. This paper describes the effects of the cumulative-and differential-compound field windings over the load characteristics of the transistor-CLM(TR-CLM), based on the experiments, and the following results are obtained. (1) For the TR-CLM the setting angle can be chosen in a range wider than that for the Thy-CLM, and therefore the former is superior in starting and steady operation characteristics. (2) The differential-compond field winding results in a good constant speed characteristic, but in a heavy load condition, the powerfactor and efficiency decline. (3) The cumulative-compound field winding suppresses the decrease of the load leading-angle, and the load limit is widened. Therefore, this scheme is particularly useful when applied to the Thy-CLM...|$|R

Aposteriori uncertainty is treated by power system state estimators. A survey of existing techniques and their limitations is described. A method is presented that improves the speed of weighted least squares state estimation by modifying the structure of injection measurements to give a very sparse information matrix, the matrix to be inverted. Used with fast decoupling, this approach yields a very fast on-line state estimator, capable of handling all types of measurements. Bad data detection and identification techniques are reviewed and an improvement based on "mathematical" bad data removal is presented. The inclusion of h. v. d. c. links into a. c. state estimation is considered. Decoupling and geographic partitioning of the multi a. c. -h. v. d. c. state estimator are shown to cause little degradation in the estimates, and a method of accurately representing <b>commutation</b> overlap <b>angle</b> is outlined. Availability analysis in state estimator operation and design is considered, and applied to optimal meter placement design. The feasibility of hierarchical central-electrical, local-dynamic hydroturbine and canal state estimation, based on a linearized Kalman filter, is investigated. Apriori uncertainty in long-term future planning studies involving expected nodal generation and loads can be included in stochastic loadflows.
