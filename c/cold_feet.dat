5|$|Over {{four years}} after <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> ended, ITV {{executives}} were {{still looking for a}} series that could comfortably replace it. On his appointment as chairman of ITV plc in 2007, Michael Grade announced that he wanted the ITV network to be broadcasting long-running series like <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> to attract the younger, upmarket viewing demographic.|$|E
5000|$|When {{many of the}} Miami {{favored the}} British and {{abandoned}} Kekionga for Pickawillany, <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot</b> remained loyal to his French allies and remained at Kekionga. The French rebuilt the nearby fort on higher ground in 1750, and <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot</b> moved to the old fort, which became known as <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot</b> Village. [...] During the Winter of 1751/1752, however, the village was hit with smallpox, {{and many of the}} inhabitants died, including <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot</b> and his son. [...] Future chief Pacanne may have been his nephew.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>Foot</b> was a Miami {{chief in}} the 18th century; his brother or {{brother-in-law}} was The Turtle (Aquenackqua), father of <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot's</b> nephew, P'koum-kwa and of P'koum-kwa's sister, Tacumwah, {{who became the}} wife of a French fur trader (Joseph Drouet de Richerville) and the mother of Chief Peshewa. Their family owned and controlled the Long Portage, an 8-mile strip of land between the Maumee and Wabash Rivers used by traders travelling between Canada and Louisiana. An inhabitant of Kekionga, <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot</b> lived during a time when the Miami were torn between their traditional trading partners of New France and new, more lucrative traders from the British colonies. There is a record of <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot</b> receiving a large reward for putting down some hostilities during this time.|$|R

5|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> is a British {{television}} pilot {{directed by}} Declan Lowney. It stars James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale as Adam and Rachel, {{a couple who}} meet and fall in love, only for the relationship to break down when he gets <b>cold</b> <b>feet.</b> John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst appear in supporting roles. The programme was written by Mike Bullen, a BBC radio producer with little screenwriting experience, who was tasked with creating a one-off television production that would appeal to middle-class television audiences, who the executive producer Andy Harries believed were underepresented on British television.|$|E

5000|$|Pacanne (P'Koum-Kwa) was {{probably}} the nephew of <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot,</b> the Miami Chief of Kekionga until a smallpox epidemic took his life in 1752. [...] One of the earliest references to Pacanne comes from Captain Thomas Morris, who had been sent by the British to secure Kekionga, Ouiatenon, Vincennes, and Kaskaskia following Pontiac's Rebellion. In 1764, at Fort Miamis, near Kekionga, two Miami warriors dragged him to the village and tied him to a pole {{with the intent of}} executing him. According to his report, Pacanne, still a minor, rode up and released him. [...] This may have been a staged event, signalling Pacanne's assumption of leadership.|$|R
5|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> ran {{for five}} years from 1998 to 2003, and Nesbitt won the British Comedy Award for Best TV Comedy Actor in 2000, the Television and Radio Industries Club Award for Drama TV Performer of the Year in 2002, the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Performance in 2003, and the TV Quick Award for Best Actor in 2003. Nesbitt credits the role with raising his profile with the public. Further {{television}} roles during these five years included women's football team coach John Dolan {{in the first two}} series of Kay Mellor's Playing the Field (appearing alongside his <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> co-star John Thomson), investigative journalists Ryan and David Laney in Resurrection Man (Marc Evans, 1998) and Touching Evil II respectively, and womaniser Stanley in Women Talking Dirty (Coky Giedroyc, 1999).|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Hooper {{directed}} two {{episodes of}} Granada Television's comedy-drama television series <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet,</b> which marked his move to bigger-budget productions. There was initially concern at Granada that Hooper {{might be an}} unsuitable director for the series given his background in drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{pilot was}} {{directed}} by Father Teds Declan Lowney over 12 days in 1996 on location around Greater Manchester. The programme {{was one of four}} one-off Comedy Premieres made by Granada for ITV. <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> was eventually broadcast on 30 March 1997. It received only 3.5 million viewers and little critical attention. As ITV's comedy portfolio was so thin, <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> was submitted as the network's comedy entry at the Montreux Television Festival in May 1997. There it won the Silver Rose for Humour and the Rose d'Or, the highest accolade of the festival. ITV scheduled a repeat broadcast a few days afterwards but did not commission a series. Not until David Liddiment's appointment as director of programming at ITV in August 1997 was a six episode series ordered.|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetic subjects. Methods Between autumn 2002 and spring 2003, 2559 newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetic subjects (about 15 % of the cases/year in Italy) were enrolled in 265 diabetology centres. Family history of diabetes, smoking, height, weight, waistline, fasting glycaemia, glycosylated haemoglobin, total and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride values were collected. Claudication, cyanosis, <b>cold</b> <b>foot,</b> foot hair anomalies, skin thinning and femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were assessed. The ABI was measured with a portable Doppler continuous-wave instrument. Results An ABI < 0. 9 was found in 539 (21. 1 %) patients. Claudication was present in: 187 (7. 3 %). Femoral pulse was absent in 218 (8. 5 %), popliteal in 316 (12. 3 %), tibial in 563 (22. 0 %) and dorsalis pedis in 578 (22. 6 %). Foot cyanosis was observed in 88 (3. 4 %), <b>cold</b> <b>foot</b> in 359 (13. 9 %), skin thinning in 468 (18. 3 %) and hair anomalies in 857 (33. 5 %). Multivariate analysis of the variables associated with ABI < 0. 9 in the univariate analysis confirmed the independent role of age [relative risk (RR) 1. 02, P < 0. 001, confidence interval (CI) 1. 01, 1. 04], claudication (RR 4. 53, P < 0. 001, CI 2. 97, 6. 93), absence of tibial pulse (RR 3. 45, P <= 0001. CI 2. 54, 4. 68) and pedis pulse (RR 1. 96, P <= 0. 001, CI 1. 4, 2. 68). Conclusions PAD, as represented by ABI < 0. 9, is common in newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetic patients...|$|R

5|$|In 1996, Ripley {{was cast}} in her {{breakthrough}} role of Jenny Gifford in the ITV series <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet.</b> Initially a supporting role in the pilot episode, Ripley's character was expanded when a series was commissioned in 1998. She stayed with the show for three full series before leaving to take more varied roles and {{to spend more time}} with her family. She returned for a guest appearance in the fifth series. After leaving <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet,</b> Ripley played a succession of leading roles in comedies and dramas including Green-Eyed Monster (2001), I Saw You (2002), The Stretford Wives (2002), and Dead Gorgeous (2002). Each role won her critical acclaim. In 2006, she filmed a leading role in the ITV drama Bon Voyage, before taking time away from acting after the birth of her second child. Ripley returned to television in 2009, starring as human resources manager Christine Frances in the ITV comedy drama Monday Monday, and Nicola Perrin alongside Martin Clunes in BBC One's Reggie Perrin.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> {{was adapted}} {{into a series}} of the same name for American network NBC. He wrote the {{screenplay}} for one of the pilot episodes. At the same time, NBC and Granada Entertainment USA commissioned a pilot script from Bullen entitled Small Beer, which centred on {{a group of people who}} take over a microbrewery in the north-western United States.|$|E
5|$|Into the 1990s, Bathurst gained wider {{recognition}} from television audiences, first as writer Mark Taylor in Joking Apart from 1993 to 1995, then as David Marsden in <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> from 1998 to 2003.

50|$|British merchants, {{seeking to}} expand their {{economic}} base, convinced some Miami to travel East for trade, {{in violation of the}} 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. In 1749, the pro-British La Demoiselle left Kekionga to establish the English trading village of Pickawillany, which grew rapidly. Fighting between pro-French and pro-British villages broke out among the Miami in 1751, as tensions rose in the region. French officials tried to persuade the Miami to return to Kekionga, which was nearer their stronghold of Detroit and harder for the British to reach. Lieutenant Louis Coulon de Villiers was sent to the dilapidated Fort Miamis and given authority to commandeer French voyageurs to construct a new fort, which was finished in 1752. In the same year, the pro-French chief <b>Cold</b> <b>Foot</b> died at Kekionga in another smallpox epidemic. When the French-allied Three Fires Confederacy destroyed Pickawillany, most of the surviving Miami returned to Kekionga, which stopped assisting the French.|$|R
5|$|Production on {{the first}} series of <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet</b> began in January 1998. Bullen {{continued}} his method of developing storylines based on his own life; {{he and his wife}} had their first child in the latter half of 1997, so he integrated their experiences into the storyline of characters Pete and Jenny, who have their first child in Cold Feets first episode. Throughout 1998, he retained his job at the BBC, working on three radio shows per week at the same time as writing <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet.</b> During the second series he cut back to one show per week. By the time of the third series in 2000, he felt confident enough that he would have a future in television that he was able to give up radio presenting completely. He moved from his home in London to Cambridge, where he was able to write for two full days a week and at evenings and weekends.|$|E
5|$|Series 4, Episode 8 is {{the final}} episode of the fourth series of the British comedy-drama {{television}} series <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet.</b> It was written by Mike Bullen, directed by Ciaran Donnelly, and was first broadcast on the ITV network on 10 December 2001. The plot follows on directly from the previous episode, as Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) travel to Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) impromptu wedding. Adam is sceptical that Pete is truly in love with Jo, and Jo's rich father Rod (Gary Sweet) suspects that Pete is only marrying her {{to get access to}} his money. Under pressure from Rod, Pete gets <b>cold</b> <b>feet</b> and he and Jo call off the wedding. The couple soon reconcile and marry with Rod's blessing. Meanwhile, David discovers that Karen has been having an affair with her colleague Mark (Sean Pertwee) and ends their marriage, and Rachel gives birth prematurely in a Sydney hospital.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first episodes was negative, with many reviewers not liking the characters and finding the comedy drama format unusual. As the series progressed, critics' opinions became more positive; the production values rated highly and the fantasy scenes, which became a hallmark of <b>Cold</b> <b>Feet,</b> were well received. An average of eight million viewers watched the series each week. The following year it won awards from the Royal Television Society, the Broadcasting Press Guild and the British Comedy Awards. It was also nominated for the Rose d'Or and a Banff Rockie Award. All six episodes have been released on VHS, DVD and internet media formats.|$|E
40|$|Using {{methods of}} non-equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} that extend and generalize the MHD energy principle of Bernstein et al. (1958, Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 244, 17) we develop a formalism {{in order to}} analyze the stability properties of prominence models considered as dissipative states i. e. states far form thermodynamic equilibrium. As an example, the criterion {{is applied to the}} Kippenhahn-Schlüter model (hereafter K-S) considering the addition of dissipative terms in the coupled system of equations: the balance of energy equation and the equation of motion. We show from this application, that periods corresponding to typical oscillations of the chromosphere and photosphere (3 and 5 min respectively), that were reported as observations of the prominence structure, can be explained as internal modes of the prominence itself. This is an alternative explanation to the one that supposes that the source of these perturbations are the <b>cold</b> <b>foot</b> chromospheric and photospheric basis. Fil:González, R.

5|$|Instead of {{returning}} immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex {{to accompany him}} to his younger sister's wedding. He learns that the reason the couple had him take photos of a cutout picture of them in various places was because they cannot afford a honeymoon. When the groom gets <b>cold</b> <b>feet,</b> Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade the groom {{to go through with}} the wedding. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy, he successfully argues that the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding goes off without any further hitches.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that after their kiss, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) confirmed to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) her {{intention to marry}} Roy Anderson (David Denman).

The lie he had told, based, as it were, on some deep, temperamental instinct that after death James would not know the truth, had taken away all power of feeling for the moment. His arm brushed against something. It was his father's naked foot. In the struggle to breathe he had pushed it {{out from under the}} clothes. Soames took it in his hand, a <b>cold</b> <b>foot,</b> light and thin, white, very cold. What use to put it back, to wrap up that which must be colder soon! He warmed it mechanically with his hand, listening to his father's laboured breathing; while the power of feeling rose again within him. A little sob, quickly smothered, came from Winifred, but his mother sat unmoving with her eyes fixed on James. Soames signed to the nurse.|$|R
