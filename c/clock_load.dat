These variations cause performance uncertainty for which timing margins must {{be added to}} guarantee correct operation.

Error detection and correction (EDAC) systems monitor critical paths with spe-cialized registers. These registers detect late-arriving input transitions and trig-ger a state rollback. Reliably accomplishing this while minimizing overhead is a key challenge: both state and timing are required, adding to datapath and <b>clock</b> <b>loading.</b> Prior work uses either double sampling or a transition detector to detect state changes and a clock-derived mask to control the timing aspect of detection [1 - 5].

40|$|The {{impressive}} {{evolution of}} modern high-performance microprocessors {{have resulted in}} chips with over one billion transistors as well as multi-GHz clock frequencies. As the silicon integrated circuit industry moves further into the nanometer regime, three of the main challenges to overcome in order for continuing CMOS technology scaling are; growing standby power dissipation, increasing variations in process parameters, and increasing power dissipation due to growing <b>clock</b> <b>load</b> and circuit complexity. This thesis addresses {{all three of these}} future scaling challenges with the overall focus on reducing the total clock-power for low-power, multi-GHz VLSI circuits. Power-dissipation related to the clock generation and distribution is identified as the dominating contributor of the total active power dissipation. This makes novel power reduction techniques crucial in future VLSI design. This thesis describes a new energy-recovering clocking technique aimed at reducing the total chip clock-power. The proposed technique consumes 2. 3 x lower clock-power compared to conventional clocking at a clock frequency of 1. 56 GHz. Apart from increasing power dissipation due to leakage also the robustness constraints for circuits are impacted by the increasing leakage. To improve the leakage robustness for sub- 90 nm low <b>clock</b> <b>load</b> dynamic flip-flops a novel keeper technique is proposed. The proposed keeper utilizes a scalable and simple leakage compensation technique. During any low frequency operation, the flip-flop is configured as a static flip-flop with increased functional robustness. In order to compensate the impact of the increasingly large process variations on latches and flip-flops, a reconfigurable keeper technique is presented in this thesis. In contrast to the traditional design for worst-case process corners, a variable keeper circuit is utilized. The proposed reconfigurable keeper preserves the robustness of storage nodes across the process corners without degrading the overall chip performance. Report code: LiU-TEK-LIC- 2006 : 21...|$|E

The design provides simple-to-layout and scalable multipoint skew compensation useful for large designs.

40|$|Clock {{distribution}} in VLSI designs is of crucial importance {{and it is}} also a major source of power dissipation of a system. For today’s high performance microprocessors, clock signals are usually distributed by a global clock grid covering the whole chip, followed by post-grid routing that connects <b>clock</b> <b>loads</b> to the <b>clock</b> grid. Early study [7] shows that about 18. 1 % of the total clock capacitance dissipation was due to this post-grid clock routing (i. e., lower mesh wires plus clock twig wires). This post-grid clock routing problem is thus an important one but not many previous works have addressed it. In this paper, we try to solve this problem of connecting clock ports to the clock grid through reserved tracks on multiple metal layers, with delay and slew constraints. Note that a set of routing tracks are reserved for this grid-to-ports clock wires in practice because of the conventional modular design style of high-performance microprocessors. We propose a new expansion algorithm based on the heap data structure to solve the problem effectively. Experimental results on industrial test cases show that our algorithm can improve over the latest work on this problem [10] significantly by reducing the capacitance by 24. 6 % and the wire length by 23. 6 %.

One {{of the most important}} performance measurements is clock jitter. Jitter is defined as "the short-term variation of a signal with respect to its ideal position in time. " In a clock generator chip, there are many factors which contribute to output clock jitter, such as the device noise, supply variation, jitter in the reference <b>clock,</b> <b>loading</b> condition, and interference coupled from nearby circuitry. Jitter can be measured in different ways, including period jitter J PER, cycle-to-cycle jitter J CC, and accumulated jitter J ACC. In general, jitter consists of the deterministic jitter and random jitter. Since the deterministic jitter in most digital systems is introduced frommany different bit patterns from the digital data, clock signal jitter can usually be considered to be just random jitter. In this application note, we will go over the definitions and introduce test setups for making measurements. Jitter definitions Period jitter: J PER Jitter J PER is the most popular jitter measure. It is the time difference between a measured cycle period and the ideal cycle period. Due to its random nature, this jitter can be measured as Peak-to-Peak or by Root Mean Square (RMS). Let's define the clock rising edge crossing point at the threshold V TH as T PER(n), where n is the time domain index, as shown in Figure 1.
