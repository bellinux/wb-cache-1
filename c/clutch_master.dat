25|$|Lotus used {{a variety}} of parts from other cars to reduce {{development}} costs. Esprits built before 1993 used many British Leyland parts and those built in the mid- to late-1980s incorporated more Toyota parts while those built after 1993 had many GM (Vauxhall, Opel) parts. Door handles from the Morris Marina/Austin Allegro were used until the S4 model in 1994 when GM Calibra door handles were used. Early cars used a Momo steering wheel, while later ones had the same wheel as the Pontiac Trans Am. Headlight lift motors came from the Pontiac Fiero. The aerial mount and whip on the S4 and V8 was the same as the GM Calibra and Tigra. The side mirrors were from the Citroën CX. Non-SE fog lamps from about 1989 were GM Astra MK1. The fan motors came from the Ford Fiesta Mk2. The alternator on the V8 models was a standard GM unit also found in the V6 Opel Omega B and the earlier Lotus Carlton/Omega, which also provided interior plastic fittings such as door handles and steering column covering. The <b>clutch</b> <b>master</b> and slave cylinders on 1998 and newer models were Girling parts shared with the series 2A Land Rover. The S1 and S2 shared some front suspension components with the Opel Ascona. The GT3's Brembo front brake pads were the same as on a Fiat Coupé Turbo or a Peugeot 406 3.0 V6. The SE's fuel pump was from the Renault Fuego.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the light car range, the Rapier's front {{suspension}} was re-engineered to replace the half king pin on each side of the car with a sealed for life ball joint. All other suspension joints became either sealed for life or were rubber bushed thereby eliminating every grease point on the car. Gearing was adjusted overall to compensate for the smaller wheels and the front brake discs were reduced in size so that they would fit inside the wheels. A brake servo became standard and the spring and damper settings were adjusted to give a softer ride. A new diaphragm clutch and new <b>clutch</b> <b>master</b> cylinder brought lighter and more progressive clutch operation.|$|E
5000|$|The next upgrade was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper 'S'), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, to a permanently affixed, folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. Separate brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>master</b> cylinders were fitted, as car manufacturers' thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of smog pumps and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time reversing lamps were made a standard fitment and the cars' electrical system was switched to negative earth and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{carriage}} waiting. A {{man and a}} woman approached the master. The woman's arms went out and <b>clutched</b> the <b>master</b> around the neck--a hostile act! The next moment Weedon Scott had torn loose from the embrace and closed with White Fang, who had become a snarling, raging demon.|$|R
5000|$|Masters made a {{claim that}} {{his version of the}} full nelson hold, which he dubbed the Master Lock, was unbreakable. Masters began a series of {{contests}} he would call [...] "Master Lock Challenges" [...] where Masters would put an opponent in the Master Lock and the opponent would try to break free before Masters made him submit or pass out. Masters would go on to log more full nelson submission victories than any wrestler in WWE history, breaking the record previously held by Kurt Angle. Originally he would call out plants from the crowd, placing a $1,000 prize of his own money to be paid to anyone who could break free from the Master Lock. At Backlash, he defeated Melissa Coates in a Master Lock Challenge. He engaged in feuds with lower-card wrestlers, Val Venis and Sgt. Slaughter, who both failed to break the Master Lock. Using villainous tactics, he often attacked the wrestlers beforehand and frequently cheated (for example using a low-blow to escape Sgt. Slaughter's cobra <b>clutch).</b> <b>Masters</b> increased the offered reward each week up to $20,000 and sometimes threw in a bonus. After defeating the 400-pound Rosey on July 18, Masters defiantly stated [...] "it doesn't matter how big they are!", prompting The Big Show to accept a Master Lock Challenge. In accordance with his villainous persona, Masters fled, refusing a match with the Big Show.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} were oriented on {{two high}} flow, high modulus fiber-glass reinforced nylon 6 (HMG series) grades for automotive and other industrial applications requiring high stiffness and high strength. These materials combined the following improved technological (injection molding, vibration welding, etc.) and mechanical performance properties such as greater dimensional stability, higher short-term (strength and stiffness) and long-term (fatigue and creep). The current and possible applications of these plastics includes auto mirror housing brackets, clutch pedals, <b>clutch</b> <b>master</b> cylinders, ski bindings, steering wheels, levers, auto seat frames, door handles and door lock mechanisms. In Part I of this paper, we are presenting results of reinforcement analysis with {{the influence of}} level of loading and geometrical parameters of used fiber-glass. KEY WORDS: nylon, reinforcement, fiber-glass, performance...|$|E

In one episode, Billy and Jimmy find her, but cannot save her from the Shadow <b>Master's</b> <b>clutches.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} {{had driven}} away, and other strange gods had appeared from out the house. Some of these stood respectfully at a distance; {{but two of}} them, women, perpetrated the hostile act of <b>clutching</b> the <b>master</b> around the neck. White Fang, however, was beginning to tolerate this act. No harm seemed to come of it, while the noises the gods made were certainly not threatening. These gods also made overtures to White Fang, but he warned them off with a snarl, and the master did likewise with word of mouth. At such times White Fang leaned in close against the master's legs and received reassuring pats on the head.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Wear {{particles}} in lubricating grease used in ball grooves {{of a heavy}} load tracked vehicle’s <b>master</b> <b>clutch’s</b> release mechanism were observed and its digital photos were taken by a ferroscope. Those images were analyzed quantitatively via computer image technology by analyzing the configuration, size, color, and area percentage of wear particles. Wear ratio of abrasion, adhesion, contact fatigue and corrosion wear are quantificationally analyzed...|$|R
50|$|The third type {{developed}} {{most recently}} and fitted to 7000series and 3000 Xtra machines has a wet <b>master</b> <b>clutch,</b> a six speed powershift section and a four speed range box. As reverse {{is at the}} front of the powershift section the reverse gears are spread throughout the speed range. This arrangement gives 24 forward gears (2x3x4) and 12 reverse gears (1x3x4). Note that the top three reverse gears are not available for use.|$|R

50|$|Earlier 2003-2004 Supersport models had a high-specification chassis {{featuring}} fully adjustable Showa {{front forks}} and a fully adjustable Sachs shock absorber. From 2004 onwards Ducati reduced {{the level of}} chassis specification {{to that of the}} Sport (which was subsequently dropped from the range some time later). The alloy swinging arm was replaced with a steel item; the five-spoke Marchesini wheels were replaced by three-spoke wheels by Brembo; the front forks were replaced by non-adjustable Marzocchi items; the Brembo Goldline <b>clutch</b> and brake <b>master</b> cylinder were replaced with lower specification items as found on many lower capacity Ducati Monsters.|$|R
5000|$|Beast Man {{also appears}} in the live action Masters of the Universe movie in 1987. Although {{credited}} as 'Beastman' (all one word), he is presented as [...] "the Beastman" [...] within the movie. Played by Tony Carroll, he is portrayed somewhat differently from other incarnations, appearing as a savage minion of Skeletor's, who merely growls instead of speaking. Although his lack of speech might indicate {{a lower level of}} intelligence than his usual depiction, the character is shown as capable of using high-tech weapons, working in a team and following orders. (He is also seen to carry a rather battered, simple sword at his waist, although is not seen actually using it in the movie.) When Skeletor incinerates Saurod for the broader team's failure, Beast Man <b>clutches</b> at his <b>master's</b> leg and makes a great show of begging for his life.|$|R
