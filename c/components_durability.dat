Abstract: In this paper, a robust adaptive control scheme with an intelligent supervisor for vehicle powertrain systems is investigated. The control objectives are to provide smooth shift transients for passenger comfort {{and to improve}} <b>components</b> <b>durability.</b> The reaction carrier speed and the turbine speed during the inertia phase are controlled to track their desired speeds. The boundedness of all signals in the closed loop system and the convergence of the reaction carrier speed error near to zero are guaranteed by applying the Lyapunov stability analysis. The adaptive compensation controller with an intelligent supervisor is implemented to keep the turbine speed error near to zero and the deviation of the shift duration within an allowable range. The proposed control algorithm is implemented and evaluated on an experimental test setup. Copyright © 2002 IFAC...|$|E
40|$|In {{the third}} {{decade of the}} last century the {{investigations}} related to the structural durability were initiated by Thum, Gaßner and Klöppel based on knowledge that the structural durability is influenced as well by the material properties as by the shape (GESTALTFESTIGKEIT) and the variable operational loading (BETRIEBSFESTIGKEIT). These research had the scope to define the main influences and parameters being of decisive influence to the structural durability. The milestones of the research work being carried in Technical University Darmstadt mainly by Institutes for Material-Science and Material-Testing (IfW/MPA), and for Steel Constructions and Mechanics of Material (IFSW/IWMB), and at Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System Reliability (LBF/SzM) are summarized in this report. These milestones cover the topics: - Influence of design parameters on structural durability - Fatigue behaviour under operational loading - Determination and description of operational loading related to structural durability - Influence of material and manufacturing on structural durability - <b>Components</b> <b>durability</b> validation - Structural durability related to steel constructions in civil engineering.

40|$|Abstract: The {{specific}} outputs of some {{diesel engine}} applications have produced thermal loadings {{in excess of}} the strength of typical aluminium piston alloys. Functionally graded coatings are used to increase performances of high temperature components in diesel engines. Thermal barrier coating are being evaluated to return the <b>components</b> <b>durability</b> to acceptable levels as well as providing a means of lowering heat rejection. This paper discusses the use of a finite element model to analyze these thermal barrier coating systems, including the impact of material properties, coating thickness, residual stress and boundary conditions. These coatings consist of a transition from the metallic bond layer to cermet and from cermet to the ceramic layer. Thermal analyses were employed to deposit metallic, cermet and ceramic powders such as NiCrAl, NiCrAl+MgZrO 3 and MgZrO 3 on the substrate. The numerical results of AlSi and steel pistons are compared with each other. It was shown that the maximum surface temperature of the functional graded coating AlSi alloy and steel pistons was increased by 28 % and 17 %, respectively. In this study, thermal behavior of functional graded coatings on AlSi and steel piston materials was investigated by means of using a commercial code, namely ANSY...|$|E

The activity carried out by the research unit of Milan was, in general, about the definition of a methodology for planning the durability, as the capability for building components to keep, during time, the required performance levels.

Besides the potential benefits of reuse activities, governmental legislation, environmentally conscious and customer expectations forced the enterprises to undertake the responsibility of their products from cradle to grave. In this study an integration of analytical process and linear programming approach is proposed to quantify the potential cost-savings can be achieved in a production system where returns are collected, remanufactured and finally remarketed as perfect substitutes of new products. When the system component and limitations are carefully defined, this approach proved to be a strong tool applicable for any industry.

40|$|Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) are {{advanced}} material {{systems that are}} {{being used in the}} hot sections of gas turbines such as combustor, turbine blades, and vanes. The top ceramic coating in TBCs provides insulation against the hot gases and the intermediate metallic bond coat provides oxidation and corrosion resistance to the underlying turbine <b>components.</b> <b>Durability</b> of thermal barrier coatings is very important for the overall performance of the gas turbine. TBCs can fail in several different ways and there is a combination of more than one failure mechanism in most situations. One of the most widely used TBC is atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Both the deposition technique and the TBC material have certain limitations. The main aim of this research is to study new TBC materials and/or new deposition techniques and compare with the conventional YSZ and understand their failure mechanisms during cyclic oxidation and hot corrosion. Thermal cyclic oxidation of a newly developed high purity nano YSZ thermal barrier coating has been studied. Cross sectional analysis of exposed as well as completely failed samples showed a mixed-type failure caused by crack propagation parallel to the bond coat/top coat interface. The majority of the damage occurred {{towards the end of the}} coating life. A finite element model has been developed to study the probability of crack growth along different paths that leads to the final failure. Hot corrosion mechanism in suspension plasma sprayed two-layer gadolinium zirconate/YSZ, three-layer dense gadolinium zirconate/gadolinium zirconate/YSZ, and a single-layer YSZ has been studied in the presence of sodium sulfate and vanadium pentoxide. The test results showed that gadolinium zirconate coatings were more susceptible to corrosion compared to YSZ coatings despite gadolinium zirconate coatings having lower reactivity with the corrosive salts. Thermal cycling behavior of a high chromium bond coat has been studied. Cross-sectional analysis showed formation of sandwich type microstructure with chromium rich oxide and alumina as the top and the bottom layers. Inter-diffusion of minor elements between different MCrAlY coatings – substrate systems has been studied using, diffusion simulation software, DICTRA. The simulation results showed that the diffusion of minor elements in the coatings is dependent on the rate of β phase depletion in the beginning. After the depletion of β phase there was no clear dependence of the coating composition on the diffusion of minor elements...|$|E

40|$|Researchers from NASA and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are {{evaluating}} {{a series}} of electron beam curable composites for application in reusable launch vehicle airframe and propulsion systems. Objectives are to develop electron beam curable composites that are useful at cryogenic to elevated temperatures (- 217 C to 200 C), validate key mechanical properties of these composites, and demonstrate cost-saving fabrication methods at the subcomponent level. Electron beam curing of polymer matrix composites is an enabling capability for production of aerospace structures in a non-autoclave process. Payoffs of this technology will be fabrication of composite structures at room temperature, reduced tooling cost and cure time, and improvements in <b>component</b> <b>durability.</b> This presentation covers the results of material property evaluations for electron beam-cured composites made with either unidirectional tape or woven fabric architectures. Resin systems have been evaluated for performance in ambient, cryogenic, and elevated temperature conditions. Results for electron beam composites and similar composites cured in conventional processes are reviewed for comparison. Fabrication demonstrations were also performed for electron beam-cured composite airframe and propulsion piping subcomponents. These parts have been built to validate manufacturing methods with electron beam composite materials, to evaluate electron beam curing processing parameters, and to demonstrate lightweight, low-cost tooling options...|$|R
