50|$|Development of USB {{began the}} next year, in 1994, and the {{consortium}} included {{a number of}} the members of the A.b group, notably DEC and Microsoft. Interest in A.b waned, leaving Philips as the primary supporter. A.b had a number of technical advantages over USB, which would not re-appear on that system until years later, and it was also easier and less expensive to implement. However, it was also much slower than USB, ten to a hundred times. USB fit neatly into the performance niche between A.b and Firewire, which made it practical to design a system with USB alone. Intel's backing was another deciding factor; the company began including USB controllers in the standard motherboard control <b>chips,</b> <b>making</b> the cost of implementation roughly that of the connector.|$|R

50|$|Today, most dual-modulus prescalers exist {{inside of}} PLL <b>chips,</b> <b>making</b> it {{impossible}} to probe actual signals during operation. The first dual-modulus prescalers were discrete ECL devices, separate from the PLL chips. Here {{is an example of}} a dual-modulus prescaler in use. This circuit happens to use a Motorola MC145158 with a Fujitsu MB-501 dual-modulus prescaler operating in the 128/129 mode. The PLL is locked at 917.94 MHz (fo) with a channel spacing frequency of 30 kHz (fr). The total integer count therefore is 30,598. Dividing this by 128 (M) yields a quotient of 239 with a remainder of 6, N and A respectively. The result of this frequency choice is that the prescaler spends most of its time counting at 128, and just a brief period at 129.|$|R

Thus, the terminal stored its display of 25 rows of 72 columns of upper-case characters using fifty-four 200-bit shift registers, arranged in six tracks of nine packs each, providing storage for 1800 six-bit characters. The shift-register design meant that scrolling the terminal display could be accomplished by simply pausing the display output to skip one line of characters.|$|E

40|$|Main-stream {{general-purpose}} microprocessors {{require a}} collection of high-performance interconnects to supply the necessary data movement. The trend of continued increase in core count has prompted designs of packet-switched net-work as a scalable solution for future-generation chips. However, the cost of scalability can be significant and es-pecially hard to justify for smaller-scale chips. In contrast, a circuit-switched bus using transmission lines and corre-sponding circuits offers lower latencies and much lower energy costs for smaller-scale <b>chips,</b> <b>making</b> it a better choice than a full-blown network-on-chip (NoC) architec-ture. However, shared-medium designs are perceived as only a niche solution for small- to medium-scale chips. In this paper, we show {{that there are many}} low-cost mechanisms to enhance the effective throughput of a bus architecture. When a handful of highly cost-effective tech-niques are applied, the performance advantage of even the most idealistically configured NoCs becomes vanish-ingly small. We find transmission line-based buses to be a more compelling interconnect even for large-scale chip-multiprocessors, and thus bring into doubt the centrality of packet switching in future on-chip interconnect. ...|$|R
