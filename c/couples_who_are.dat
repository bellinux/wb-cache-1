5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
25|$|De facto relationships, {{defined in}} the federal Family Law Act 1975, are {{available}} to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. De facto relationships provide <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> living together on a genuine domestic basis {{with many of the}} same rights and benefits as married couples. Two people can become a de facto couple by entering into a registered relationship (i.e.: civil union or domestic partnership) or by being assessed as such by the Family Court or Federal Circuit Court. <b>Couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> living together are generally recognised as a de facto relationship and thus able to claim many of the rights and benefits of a married couple, even if they have not registered or officially documented their relationship.|$|E

25|$|Assisted {{reproductive}} technology (ART) is {{the technology}} used to achieve pregnancy in procedures such as fertility medication, {{in vitro fertilization}} and surrogacy. It is reproductive technology used primarily for infertility treatments, and {{is also known as}} fertility treatment. It mainly belongs to the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and may also include intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and cryopreservation. Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons (preimplantation genetic diagnosis). ART is also used for <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> discordant for certain communicable diseases; for example, HIV {{to reduce the risk of}} infection when a pregnancy is desired.|$|E

25|$|Legal {{recognition}} of same-sex unions in Australia takes {{a variety of}} forms depending on the jurisdiction. Under Australian federal law, same-sex couples can be recognised as de facto relationships, but have no access to marriage, civil unions or other federal relationship registration. Australian states and territories are entitled to create their own laws with respect to same-sex relationship registers and same-sex partnership schemes, with most offering civil unions or other forms of domestic partnership to same-sex couples. Same-sex couples are prevented from marrying by amendments to the Marriage Act 1961, passed in 2004 by the Howard Government and Mark Latham-led Australian Labor Party. Additionally, same-sex <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> married in countries where same-sex marriage is legal cannot divorce within Australia when they come back due to the same-sex marriage ban.|$|E
25|$|Gender is {{a factor}} that {{plays a role in}} both human and animal aggression. Males are {{historically}} believed to be generally more physically aggressive than females from an early age, and men commit the vast majority of murders (Buss 2005). This {{is one of the most}} robust and reliable behavioral sex differences, and it has been found across many different age groups and cultures. However, some empirical studies have found the discrepancy in male and female aggression to be more pronounced in childhood and the gender difference in adults to be modest when studied in an experimental context. Still, there is evidence that males are quicker to aggression (Frey et al. 2003) and more likely than females to express their aggression physically. When considering indirect forms of non-violent aggression, such as relational aggression and social rejection, some scientists argue that females can be quite aggressive, although female aggression is rarely expressed physically. An exception is intimate partner violence that occurs among <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> engaged, married, or in some other form of intimate relationship. In such cases, some research suggests that women are more physically aggressive than men, although differences are small and men are less likely to be injured than women are.|$|E
500|$|A University of Houston professor, Peter Nguyen, remarked in 2005, [...] "You almost get a {{different}} sense of feeling once you cross over to Bellaire." [...] Bellaire is an incorporated city consisting of single-family houses and a reputation for safety. Nguyen said that he believed the city should increase efforts to reduce crime in Gulfton. He added {{that it would be}} difficult to engage Gulfton's population of [...] "working people", living [...] "day to day", to participate in anti-crime activities like crime watches. Bruce Williams, a Houston Police Department Captain, states that it is difficult to fight crime with the reductions in manpower. Williams said that U.S. federal government agents began working with the Houston Police Department to arrest serious gang criminals in Gulfton, including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) members who were operating in the neighborhood. In 2007, Tammy Rodriguez, head of the Gulfton Super Neighborhood department for the City of Houston, and the Fondren Patrol Division announced that the division would expand its Police Apartments Clergy Team (PACT) into three Gulfton complexes. PACT places married <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> active in churches into the apartment complexes so they can work with tenants. The PACT program initially focused on the Napoleon Square and Chateaux Carmel complexes. In August 2009 a gang war erupted between the Southwest Cholos and other area gangs causing violence to increase in Gulfton and surrounding areas.|$|E

2500|$|In late May 2010, the Internal Revenue Service {{reversed}} a 2006 ruling, {{and declared}} that, {{with respect to}} community property, domestic partners in California must be treated the same as heterosexual couples due to a change to the California community property tax law in 2007. The IRS ruled the approximately 58,000 <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> registered as domestic partners in California must combine their income for federal tax purposes, and then each report half of the total income {{and half of the}} total withholdings on their separate tax returns. If one of the partners makes significantly more than the other, the net result is a lower tax obligation for the couple. [...] In December 2010, the Internal Revenue Service issued a revised edition of its Publication 555, , explicitly applying this ruling to registered domestic partners in Nevada as well, the other community property states with such registries, as well as, in California, both registered domestic partners and same-sex couples recognized by the state as married.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sexual Health Resource, [...] "The man-on-top sex {{positions}} {{are very good}} for <b>couples</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{trying to have a}} baby, because penetration can be very deep. If the woman holds on to her legs behind her knees and draws her thighs right back, sperm can be deposited deep in the vagina—at the neck of the womb. This provided the best chance of conception occurring." [...] Getting Pregnant Tips notes the importance of not using too large a sex pillow while in the missionary position as it can cause the sperm to pool behind the cervix. Francoeur states that [...] "male-above sex promotes fertility by keeping the opening of the vagina higher than the seminal pool, which, in turn, helps sperm get into the womb and find the egg." [...] However, according to BabyCenter, [...] "There is no evidence that any particular sexual position is more likely to lead to conception." [...] Donnica Moore agrees, stating that while there are no scientific studies regarding the best sexual positions for reproduction, the missionary (man on top) position is typically considered optimal for conception.|$|E

Lombard died three years later {{in a plane crash}} on her way home from a war bond rally. Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were the stars and producers of I Love Lucy, and have since been credited as an onscreen and offscreen supercouple. They divorced in 1960 after 20 years of marriage.
