First, the article reminds {{the definition of the}} ZPA worm and then presents details regarding the root fillet of worm's flank. In this regard is determined the contact line of a torus end mill tools and the helicoidally generated surface. This process is assisted by a CAD software, developed by the author. Controlling of the root fillet area is important to protect the edge of the flank finishing milling tool. The advantages of the ZPA worm type are: (i) the use of standard tools with reduced costs and also short processing time; (ii) the possibilities to cover other standard worms, using the standard <b>cylindrical</b> <b>milling</b> tools and non-specialized NC machining tools...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} a new {{approach}} to surface roughness parameters estimation during finish cylindrical end milling is presented. The proposed model includes the influence of cutting parameters, the tool’s static run out and dynamic phenomena related to instantaneous tool deflections. The modeling procedure consists of two parts. In the first stage, tool working part instantaneous displacements are estimated using an analytical model which considers tool dynamic deflections and static errors of the machine – tool-holder – tool system. The obtained height of the tool’s displacement envelope is then applied in the second stage to the calculation of surface roughness parameters. These calculations assume that in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>milling</b> process, two different mechanisms of surface profile formation exist. Which mechanism is present is dependent on the feed per tooth and the maximum height of the tool’s displacement envelope. The developed model is validated during <b>cylindrical</b> <b>milling</b> of hardened hot-work tool steel 55 NiCrMoV 6 using a stylus profiler and scanning laser vibrometer over a range of cutting parameters. The surface roughness values predicted by the developed model are in good agreement with measured values. It is found that the employment of a model which includes only the effect of static displacements gives an inferior estimation of surface roughness compared to the model incorporating dynamic tool deflection...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper results about {{simulation}} of surface topography in side milling with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>milling</b> tool are presented. Different values for grinding errors of tool radii and for eccentricity were taken into account. In addition, different helix angles were considered. When grinding errors increase, effective radius of some cutting teeth increases. This tends {{to reduce the number}} of machining marks per tool revolution. Eccentricity produces a similar effect. Provided that the tool has eccentricity and helix angle, different profiles will be obtained at different workpiece’s heights. If eccentricity is high enough, roughness heterogeneity bands are found at different heights on the workpiece’s surface. In the roughness bands the number of cutting teeth marks per revolution is higher than in other areas. The higher helix angle the narrower width of heterogeneity bands. However, maximum and minimum roughness values along the workpiece’s height are the same, regardless of helix angle. Postprint (published version...|$|E

Using a new technology for processing on NC machines, cylindrical worms type ZA of various modules can be processed, using the frontal-cylindrical milling tools of different diameters, the optimal position of the mill being different in each individual case. In this article, {{on the basis of}} contact between the surface of frontal-cylindrical milling tools used in processing and a helical surface, is determined the optimal position of the mill so that deviations from the nominal profile of the worm type ZA are minimal.

40|$|Background and aim: The {{volume of}} {{reconstructive}} surgery in traumatology {{in recent decades}} has increased significantly due {{to an increase in}} traumas, numbers of affected in local military conflicts, and environmental deterioration. This has led to an increase in demand for plastic materials, and the need to create modern high technologies to meet this need, including alternative sources of bone implants. Any solution to this problem would involve an in-depth study of bone biophysical properties with innovative techniques to develop requirements to elaboration of new effective implants based on natural bone, as well as on natural or synthetic analogues. This study aimed exactly at these aspects. Materials and methods: We studied human bone samples taken from various parts of the skeleton aged from 3 to 89 years and animal (bovine) bone samples aged from 1. 5 to 2 years. Biophysical characteristics of the studied materials were assessed at the stage of sample preparation with original author's methods of physical and mechanical processing, in the process of analysis of patterns of normal changes in the bone structure and function, as well as during changes in its composition with age, anisotropy of the material and the level of structural organization. Structure patterns were studied by classical (light, scanning electron microscopy) and advanced (acoustic microscopy) techniques. Methods of engineering biomechanics were used to assess functional changes in macro and micro volumes of bone samples. Results: The main study results involve the development of innovative methods of sample preparation and structural and functional analysis. First of all, these are the methods of mechanical processing of bone fragments based on the use of hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>milling</b> cutters in the environment of limited amounts of mineralized biological tissues, {{as well as on the}} application of hydrodynamic cutting ensuring a delicate and highly efficient bone cut. Another distinctive feature of the study is the elaborated methodology for morphological and mechanical analysis of bone samples at the macro and micro levels, with consideration of real physical and chemical condition of samples. To ensure sample sterility, the authors proposed innovative techniques using of ozone-oxygen mixtures. The study results gave a  complex of quantitative characteristics describing age-related compositional changes of the human bone, anisotropy of its physical and mechanical characteristics, osteon parameters and physical and mechanical characteristics of bone tissue depending on its composition. Conclusion: The use of the proposed methodology allowed for obtaining of new data on biophysical properties of bone tissue that are of interest for bioimplantology, biomaterial science and expands basic information on the bone as a natural biocomposite.

It is an indirect process and requires the utmost care at every stage. The pattern or design is first altered in size to repeat evenly round the roller. One repeat of this pattern is then engraved by hand on a small highly polished soft steel roller, usually about 3 in. long and 1/2 in. to 3 in. in diameter; the size varies according {{to the size of}} the repeat with which it must be identical. It is then repolished, painted with a chalky mixture to prevent its surface oxidizing and exposed to a red-heat in a box filled with chalk and charcoal; then it is plunged in cold water to harden it and finally tempered to the proper degree of toughness. In this state it forms the die from which the mill is made. To produce the actual mill with the design in relief a softened steel cylinder is screwed tightly against the hardened die and the two are rotated under constantly increasing pressure until the softened cylinder or mill has received an exact replica in relief of the engraved pattern. The mill in turn is then hardened and tempered, when it is ready for use.

As part of the studies milling tools with diamond based cutting ma-terial are investigated. To examine the applicability of standard milling tools {{and the influence of}} the tool geometry on the cutting process of natural stone, end mill cutters with two polycrystalline diamond (PCD) teeth using negative, neutral and positive rake angle are compared. For the investigation on the cutting material and the cutting forces a <b>cylindrical</b> end <b>milling</b> cutter with a single indexable insert and different diamond based cutting tool materials, especially polycrystalline diamond, is used. The results show that a specific cutting force is not measurable for the tested material and that the wear behavior of the tool is influenced by the grade of the cutting material and tool configuration...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation {{thesis is}} focused on development, design and {{production}} of the new milling cutter which is used for roughing operations. High-speed steels, coating technology and milling technology are described in first chapters of dissertation thesis. The main part of this thesis is {{the design of the}} new milling cutter that has been designed {{on the basis of the}} machining simulation. The milling cutter is designed as a three-flute <b>cylindrical</b> end <b>mill</b> made of high speed steel. The each flute is composed of two special compensation edges. The compensation edges are used for reducing (at best suppression) tensile stress in the heel of the tooth. The milling cutter was made by lost wax technology, followed by grinding and thermal treatment. New designed tools were deposited by PVD coatings (e. g. (Al,Ti) N). Standard catalog milling cutters (producer ZPS - milling tools, Zlín, Czech Republic) were used for comparison the designed milling cutter. Carbon steel CSN 41 2050 (DIN 1. 1191) was used for milling, which was carried out with using process liquid. The monitored parameters were force loading, flank wear and tensile stress during milling. The dynamometer Kistler was used for measuring force loading and data obtained during machining was used for stress analysis...|$|R
