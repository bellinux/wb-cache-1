5|$|Bolliger & Mabillard {{currently}} manufactures {{nine different}} roller <b>coaster</b> styles: Stand-Up <b>Coaster,</b> Inverted <b>Coaster,</b> Floorless <b>Coaster,</b> Flying <b>Coaster,</b> Hyper <b>Coaster,</b> Dive <b>Coaster,</b> Sitting <b>Coaster,</b> Wing <b>Coaster</b> and Family <b>Coaster.</b> Bolliger & Mabillard {{has been involved}} in developing new technologies and concepts in roller coasters almost since its inception. It has often worked with engineer Werner Stengel, and with designers and management of client theme parks.|$|E
5|$|A Floorless <b>Coaster</b> {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller <b>coaster</b> {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless <b>Coaster</b> began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa (now known as Bizarro) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless <b>Coaster.</b> Floorless Coasters also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the <b>coaster.</b> Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters, such as Griffon and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters as B classifies them as another model. Also, Maurer Söhne have designed their own version of the Floorless <b>Coaster,</b> a variant of their X-Car called X-Car Floorless, but currently do not have any installations.|$|E
5|$|A Wing <b>Coaster</b> {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller <b>coaster</b> {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where pairs of riders sit on either side of a roller <b>coaster</b> track in which nothing is above or below the riders. Development of the Wing <b>Coaster</b> began between 2007 and 2008 leading to the opening of Raptor at Gardaland, the world's first Wing <b>Coaster,</b> on 1 April 2011. There are currently eight Wing Coasters operating worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Bolliger & Mabillard {{has built}} {{thirteen}} Floorless <b>Coasters</b> with two additional roller <b>coasters</b> converted from Stand-up <b>Coasters.</b> The roller <b>coasters</b> {{are listed in}} order of opening dates.|$|R
50|$|New {{designs and}} {{technologies}} {{are pushing the}} limits {{of what can be}} experienced on the newest <b>coasters.</b> Flying <b>coasters</b> like Tatsu and electromagnetically-launched <b>coasters</b> like Maverick are examples of the latest generation of technologically advanced <b>coasters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Roller <b>coasters</b> {{are divided}} into two main categories: steel roller <b>coasters</b> and wooden roller <b>coasters.</b> Steel <b>coasters</b> have tubular steel tracks, and {{compared}} to wooden <b>coasters,</b> they are typically known for offering a smoother ride {{and their ability to}} turn riders upside-down. Wooden <b>coasters</b> have flat steel tracks, and are typically renowned for producing [...] "air time" [...] through the use of negative G-forces when reaching the crest of some hill elements. Newer types of track, such as I-Box and Topper introduced by Rocky Mountain Construction, improve the ride experience on wooden <b>coasters,</b> lower maintenance costs, and add the ability to invert riders.|$|R
5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive <b>Coaster</b> began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive <b>Coaster,</b> Oblivion, opened at Alton Towers. Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive <b>Coaster,</b> {{it does not have}} a true vertical drop as the drop angle is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive <b>Coaster</b> built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive <b>Coaster</b> to feature a 90-degree drop and a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive <b>Coaster</b> to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive <b>Coaster</b> opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E
5|$|Afterburn is a steel {{inverted}} roller <b>coaster</b> {{located at}} Carowinds amusement park. After {{more than two}} years of planning and construction, the roller <b>coaster</b> opened on March 20, 1999. The ride previously operated as Top Gun: The Jet <b>Coaster,</b> before it was renamed Afterburn following Cedar Fair's purchase of the park in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{depending}} {{on the model of}} the roller <b>coaster,</b> the track size can vary. Models such as the Flying, Wing, and Dive <b>Coaster</b> have heavier trains which require a larger track size while models with lighter trains, such as the Stand-Up and Hyper <b>Coaster,</b> do not and use a smaller sized track.|$|E
50|$|Some fairs may feature compact roller <b>coasters</b> {{to attract}} {{teenagers}} and preteens. Roller <b>coasters</b> feature steep drops, sharp curves, and sometimes loops. Roller <b>coasters</b> are generally {{the most attractive}} aspect of a fair, but many people come for other reasons. Fairs usually only feature one or two <b>coasters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{geometry}} of Giant Cyclone Safety <b>Coasters</b> was extreme {{compared to other}} roller <b>coasters</b> of the time period. The <b>coasters</b> featured very tight turns, spirals, and figure eights. These elements drew inspiration from the swoops and spirals of earlier Prior and Church roller <b>coasters</b> like The Bobs. Curves on Giant Cyclone Safety <b>Coasters</b> were often banked to much steeper angles, with some approaching 85 degrees. Beyond the many curves, another element common to the steel-framed Traver <b>coasters</b> were undulating [...] "jazz tracks", meaning that Traver's Cyclones had almost no straight track in their entire course.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s Carl Miler founded Miler Manufacturing. The company built a variety steel roller <b>coasters</b> aimed at {{children}} and families such as Wild Mouse roller <b>coasters.</b> Miler Manufacturing roller <b>coasters</b> were popular in the 1950s. Production of new roller <b>coasters</b> by Miler Manufacturing stopped in the mid 1970s.|$|R
5|$|As {{construction}} progressed {{with the}} theme park in early 2013, {{the owners of the}} park gave no details about the roller <b>coaster</b> other than that it would be the largest roller <b>coaster</b> in India. Even after the Roller <b>Coaster</b> Database reported that a Bolliger & Mabillard Floorless <b>Coaster</b> would be built at the park, the owners still released no details. In April 2013, the first pieces of the roller <b>coaster</b> were erected. By the end of August, all of the coaster's track was installed. Then {{in the third quarter of}} 2013, Adlabs Imagica released the details of Nitro.|$|E

It is Cedar Point's third B roller coaster; the park also has Raptor, an inverted roller <b>coaster,</b> and Rougarou, a floorless roller <b>coaster.</b> GateKeeper {{was the fifth}} Wing <b>Coaster</b> {{in the world and}} the third one built in the United States following X-Flight at Six Flags Great America and Wild Eagle at Dollywood.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern <b>Coaster</b> is a steel roller <b>coaster</b> at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The ride is themed after DC Comics' Green Lantern and {{is located}} within the park's DC Comics superhero hub. The ride is an El Loco roller <b>coaster</b> {{manufactured}} by S Worldwide, characterised by a tight circuit featuring a beyond-vertical drop and an outward banked turn. It holds {{the record for the}} steepest drop of any roller <b>coaster</b> in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second steepest in the world. Green Lantern <b>Coaster</b> officially opened on 23 December 2011.|$|E

5000|$|Like steel roller <b>coasters,</b> wooden roller <b>coasters</b> usually use {{the same}} three-wheel design, pioneered by John Miller. Each set of wheels {{includes}} a running wheel (on top of the track), a side friction (or [...] "guide") wheel (to guide motion in the lateral plane and reduce excessive side-to-side movement known as [...] "hunting") and an upstop wheel (beneath the track to prevent cars from flying off the track). Some wooden <b>coasters,</b> such as Leap-The-Dips, do not have upstop wheels and are known as side friction roller <b>coasters.</b> As a result, the turns and drops are more gentle than on modern wooden roller <b>coasters.</b> Scenic Railway roller <b>coasters</b> also lack upstop wheels but rely on a brake operator to control the speed so that upstop wheels are not necessary. A handful of wooden <b>coasters</b> use flanged wheels, similar to a rail car, {{eliminating the need for}} side friction wheels.|$|R
5|$|In Griffon's opening year, it {{was voted}} the third best new ride for 2007 and the 27th best steel roller <b>coaster</b> in Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards. The roller <b>coaster</b> peaked at {{position}} 19 in 2010 when it tied with SheiKra, another Dive <b>Coaster.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Roller <b>coasters,</b> {{especially}} launched roller <b>coasters</b> {{or those}} {{that rely on}} electromagnetic propulsion, can provide linear acceleration [...] "gravity", and so can relatively high acceleration vehicles, such as sports cars. Linear acceleration {{can be used to}} provide air-time on roller <b>coasters</b> and other thrill rides.|$|R
5|$|Note: Although some Dive <b>Coasters</b> (such as SheiKra and Griffon) feature floorless trains, {{they are}} not {{considered}} Floorless <b>Coasters.</b>|$|R
