50|$|A {{countersink}} (symbol: ⌵) is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object, or the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolt</b> or screw, when placed in the hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material (by comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a socket-head capscrew). A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation thereby improving the finish of the product and removing any hazardous sharp edges.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the bolt clampup force relaxation behavior in countersunk, single-lap bolted joints between glass/vinylester resin laminates and steel panels. Additionally, the effect of bolt clampup force relaxation on the bearing strength of such joints was studied. Specially-instrumented bolts were used to measure clampup force relaxation in ten countersunk joint specimens. A 100, 000 pound capacity MTS testing machine {{was used to evaluate}} the bearing strength in tension of sixteen countersunk bolted joint specimens torqued to four different levels of initial torque, as well as four similar protruding-head bolted joint specimens (at the same levels of torque). The results of the relaxation experiments indicate that clampup force varies widely in nominally identical joints at identical torque levels, by as much as a factor of two. In <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolt</b> joints with sufficiently high initial clampup force, the clampup force relaxed in accordance with the inverse power equation proposed by Shivakumar and Crews for protruding-head bolt joints in graphite/epoxy laminates. Relaxation in the present experiments proceeded faster than in the protruding-head joints studied by Shivakumar and Crews; this {{is believed to have been}} due to the relative lack of constraint provided at the GRP surface by the <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolt.</b> The results from the bearing strength experiments suggest that clampup force has only a small beneficial effect on bearing strength in both countersunk and protruding head single-lap joints, when compared to double-lap joints. The reduced effectiveness of clampup force in increasing the bearing strength is believed to be a result of the increased joint rotation and bolt bending inherent in single-lap joints. These phenomena lead to delamination and brooming failure in the GRP, which can be avoided in double lap joints with sufficient bolt clampup force. The countersunk joints failed at a load approximately 20 % lower than the protruding head joints. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Connections with <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} to connect cold-formed steel (CFS) structural elements because they allow even surfaces {{which can be}} easily cladded. They consist of bolts with conically shaped heads which sit in a similarly shaped hole, punched into the sheet metal. However, these connections cannot be relied upon to transfer a bending moment, as their moment-rotation behaviour is currently unknown. The project aims to investigate the behaviour of countersunk connections in cold-formed steel through experimental and numerical studies, with particular attention to their initial (pre-slip) stiffness, slip load, elongation (post-slip) stiffness and bearing capacity. Hence the tensile lap joint test and beam-to-column connection test were conducted on CFS <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolted</b> connection to study the load-elongation behaviour and moment-rotation behaviour respectively. As the main focus was on the structural connections, the rotational stiffness of the full connection was predicted on the stiffness of single bolted connection. Finally the Finite Element models were used to verify both of the structural behaviours and confirm this link...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and computational {{investigation of the}} influences of <b>countersink</b> and <b>bolt</b> torque on the progressive failure of single-lap composite joint. Using the Abaqus® software, delamination damage and ply fracture are modelled using cohesive element approach and continuum damage mechanics method, respectively. The model is first validated against a filled-hole tension test to calibrate the composite damage model. Comparison with the experimental results indicates that the computational model is capable of accurately predicting the joint strength and the damage progression process...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted into {{the effects of}} bolt-hole clearance on the static strength and damage progression behaviour of single lap <b>countersunk</b> composite <b>bolted</b> joints. Joints were manufactured from carbon/epoxy plain weave fabric and tested with three different bolt clearance levels. The experimental {{results showed that the}} bolt-hole clearance had a minimal effect on the ultimate failure load of the bolted joint. However, a significant reduction (approx. 22 %) was observed in the bearing damage initiation load, consistent with difference in the through-thickness damage profile. Finite element analysis was conducted, and was able to accurately capture the load-displacement behaviour and through-thickness damage profile of the joints...|$|R
40|$|For {{laminar flow}} to be achieved, any protuberances {{on the surface}} must be small enough to avoid {{transition}} to turbulent flow. However, the surface must have joints between the structural components to allow assembly or replacement of damaged parts, although large continuous surfaces can be utilized to minimize the number the number of joints. Aircraft structural joints usually have many <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolts</b> or rivets on the outer surface. To maintain no mismatch on outer surfaces, it is desirable to attach the components from the inner surface. It is also desirable for the panels to be interchangeable, {{without the need for}} shims at the joint, to avoid surface discontinuities that could cause turbulence. Fabricating components while pressing their outer surfaces against an accurate mold helps to ensure surface smoothness and continuity at joints. These items were considered in evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the joint design concepts. After evaluating six design concepts, two of the leading candidates were fabricated and tested using many small test panels. One joint concept was also built and tested using large panels. The small and large test panel deflections for the leading candidate designs at load factors up to + 1. 5 g's were well within the step and waviness requirements for avoiding transition. The small panels were designed and tested for compression and tension at - 65 F, at ambient conditions, and at 160 F. The small panel results for the three-rib and the sliding-joint concepts indicated that they were both acceptable. The three-rib concept, with tapered splice plates, was considered to be the most practical. A modified three-rib joint that combined the best attributes of previous candidates was designed, developed, and tested. This improved joint met all of the structural strength, surface smoothness, and waviness criteria for laminar flow control (LFC). The design eliminated all disadvantages of the initial three-rib concept except for unavoidable eccentricity, which was reduced and reacted satisfactorily by the rib supports. It should also result in a relatively simple low-cost installation, and makes it easy to replace any panels damaged in the field...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{mechanical}} behaviour of 2 -bolt single-lap CFRP joints with <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolts</b> is investigated, both numerically and experimentally. A detailed 3 D non-linear FE model of composite bolted joints has been developed. The model replicates with good agreement the experimental tensile tests {{up to the}} point where bearing damage occurs and reproduces the joint behaviour correctly. Five stages are identified in the joint behaviour. The evolution of contact during the test is studied showing a correlation with the joint stiffness. Parametric studies investigate the influence of bolt clamping force, coefficient of friction and bolt-hole clearance on the joint behaviour. Using the developed FE model, the distribution of the six stress components around the holes of the composite joints is studied together with the effects of head height, shank-hole clearance and position of bolts. The stress along the fibres is identified as the critical stress component and the compressive fibre failure of the 0 ° oriented plies as the start of the bearing damage. The 0 ° oriented plies in the cylindrical part of the hole are found to be the plies carrying the bearing load. Increasing clearance reduces the extent of the bolt shank-hole contact and leads to higher stresses and lower joint stiffness. The 45 ° and - 45 ° oriented plies are found to have {{a key role in the}} joint bearing strength and shear-out failure. Fatigue tests are run with the introduction of a novel method to monitor the loss of clamping force and detect crack initiation in the fasteners during the test itself, using strain gauges and a real-time algorithm. The clamping force is found to remain constant until crack initiation and progressively drop until final failure. Load transfer and interaction between the bolts is observed during the fast but stable fatigue crack propagation. The fatigue tests are conducted on joints with differing plate thicknesses and countersunk head geometries to assess the influence of these on the number of cycles to crack initiation and to final failure. A link between fatigue and static test results is highlighted and, in addition, a fatigue failure mechanism of the joint is proposed. Open Acces...|$|R
50|$|Weatherby's {{requirements}} {{included a}} bolt face which was <b>countersunk</b> into the <b>bolt</b> which would enclose the cartridge's casehead while the bolt head was enclosed in a counterbored barrel breach, {{which in turn}} would prevent the casehead from rupturing. If a rupture should occur, the bolt would have holes through which hot gases could be vented safely towards the side {{and away from the}} shooter's face. Further as an extra safety measure he required an enclosed or shrouded bolt sleeve that would prevent the hot gases from making their way through the bolt mechanism to the shooter's face. To Weatherby, the safety and strength of the design were paramount.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{advantages}} of adhesive bonding, bolted joints are still used to fasten composite aircraft structures {{because of the}} ease of assembly/disassembly, minimal surface preparations, use of common tools between metal and composite structures and airworthiness certification. Joining or repairing external aircraft structures inevitably {{involves the use of}} countersunk fasteners, which can induce complex three-dimensional stress fields near the bolt hole. Since bolted joints incur significant penalty of low strength compared to pristine composite laminates, {{it is important to understand}} the damage mechanisms and develop design tools to enable better design and optimisation of composite joints so as to take full advantage of composite structures. This investigation focuses on single lap joints using countersunk fasteners, using both experimental testing and computational simulation techniques. Joints were tested in shear to failure at a range of bolt torques, hole clearances and countersunk depths to thickness ratio levels. To assist the development of predictive tools, straight-shank bearing tests were carried out to calibrate model parameters. Detailed microscopy analysis of failed specimens was conducted to characterise the through-thickness failure profile of <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolted</b> joints. Detailed finite element analyses using Abaqus/Explicit were conducted to gain insight into the behaviour of the single lap joints. The models accounted for in-plane and through-thickness composite damage, frictional contact, bolt torque and secondary bending effects in bolted joints under shear. The experimental investigation and finite element analyses showed that the through-thickness damage contained mainly interlaminar and intralaminar shear cracks and delamination. The variations in selected parameters had marginal effects on ultimate failure load of the joints; however the bearing load was significantly affected. The variation in bolt-hole clearance and countersunk depth to thickness ratio can produce significant variation in the through-thickness damage profile. As the countersunk depth to thickness ratio increased, the damage to the bearing plane of the joint increased. Catastrophic bending failure occurred for the highest ratio of countersunk depth to thickness. The finite element investigation showed that stress concentration factor at the hole edge increases with hole clearance. A detailed analysis of initiation and progression of damage, in the plane and through the thickness of the laminate has been performed. A review of the literature indicates that the detailed investigation of damage mechanisms and joint parameters presented in this thesis appears to be the first for joints involving countersunk fasteners. The present research also highlights a new method for determining the fracture energy associated with composite compression failure. The issues associated with the use of literature in determining material properties, friction coefficient and other modelling parameters are identified and discussed. The implications of capturing the overall effect of damage modes without a true mechanistic representation are also discussed. These new findings demonstrate that whilst capturing the overall behaviour and effect of joint parameters is possible, reliable predictive capability such as that required for aerospace design purposes remains a critical aspect for ongoing research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{progression}} of damage in carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) <b>countersunk</b> composite <b>bolted</b> joints (CBJs) with neat-fit clearance, subjected to quasi-static loading. Damage mechanisms, comprising of fibre buckling and breakage, matrix damage, shear damage and inter-laminar delamination within the CFRP composite parts of the joints have been studied. Load-displacement curves, X-ray and optical microscopic images in single- and three-bolt CBJs were used to investigate damage and deformation characteristics. The observations were then employed to further investigate the type of failure {{and the extent of}} damage. The evolution of damage within the composite parts was correlated to the failure characteristics of the joints: It was found that the type and extension of damage is strongly correlated with the ultimate failure load point of the joint in single-bolt CBJs. A combined inter/intra-laminar damage consisting of fibre cluster breakage, extensive fibre buckling, debonding and delamination was observed at the ultimate failure load. This study was then extended to three-bolt CBJ where damage surrounding each bolt and its corresponding failure load was strongly correlated: The final study showed that the ultimate failure point in single-bolt CBJ and the first-bolt-failure point in three-bolt CBJ correspond to the composite plies undergoing intra-laminar damage with the size reaching {{to the edge of the}} countersunk head. This damage developed extensively through the thickness of the composite parts underneath the countersink, and in the direction opposite to the loading direction. Outside the countersunk head, debonding and delamination were found to be the dominant damage driving mechanisms. Finally, a new design rule has been proposed to predict the response of multi-bolt joints (damage area and failure load) by using the response in single-bolt CBJ as an initial baseline...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are seeing increasing {{use in the}} engineering industry, in particular the aerospace sector. The move towards light weight high stiffness structures that have good durability and corrosion resistance {{has led to the}} move from metal structures to composite structures. With this brings the added concern of certifying new components as they must meet the same structural integrity, safety and durability requirements as those in metals and hence this is where the challenge now lies. When a metallic structure is damaged at some point during its life, there is a possibility it will be repaired however if the damage is significant then the component(s) will be replaced. With composite materials on the other hand, the flexibility in design and fabrication has led to larger single component pieces and thus repairing these structures is more economical than replacement. This puts further emphasis in creating new and efficient repair methods that can be certified whilst still withstanding the various stresses and loads inflicted on the aircraft during its remaining service life. In this study, a comparison is made between three fundamental joint structures - mechanically fastened joints, bonded joints and hybrid joints. The work is targeted towards the repair of aircrafts made from fibre reinforced polymer matrix composites known for their high strength, high stiffness, long fatigue life and low density. Stage 1 of the investigation focused on testing thin double lap joint repairs and Stage 2 focused on testing thick step lap joint repairs containing a total of five steps. The aim was to compare the static strength and fatigue resistance of a hybrid joint configuration consisting of both bonding and fastening, a purely fastened joint and a purely bonded joint. Rivets and <b>countersunk</b> <b>bolts</b> were selected as the fasteners for thin and thick joint repairs respectively. The effect of changing various parameters such as the mechanical fastener array, clamping pressure, bond strength, initial defects and curing conditions were also investigated. The experimental results for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 found {{there was no significant difference}} between the static strength of a bonded joint compared to a hybrid joint. However, the fatigue resistance of a hybrid joint was superior to a bonded joint configuration particularly where bondline defects such as initial cracks or a semi-cured adhesive was present. Finite element analysis (FEA) was also performed to verify the static and fatigue strength of the various configurations. Nonlinear adhesive material properties, fastener surface contacts and frictional forces were all included in the three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) models. The Multicontinuum Theory (MCT) is used to simulate the progressive failure process and determine the stress states in the various specimen configurations. The strain energy release rate (SERR) as a function of crack length for the bonded and hybrid specimens were also compared. Results found that it was vital to position fasteners closer towards the ends of the bondline to suppress rapid crack growth. As soon as a crack enters the fasteners’ clamping zone, there is a significant drop in the SERR which reduces the crack growth rate, leading to an improvement in fatigue resistance. The key advantage in this case, is being able to detect damage before catastrophic failure. A final extension to the investigation looked into optimising the individual step length, step heights and the number of steps for the thick joint repair cases. The previous step lap joint containing five steps with a 90 mm long overlap was able to achieve only a 52 % load recovery at best compared to a pristine undamaged parent structure. Through the parametric studies conducted using Abaqus CAE, two new step lap joint designs were numerically analysed and experimentally tested. One of the optimised step lap joint designs contained seven steps (with thin outer step heights and thicker inner step heights) and the second contained six steps (with an outer overlap). Overall, the static and fatigue resistance was improved in both of the new step lap joint designs. A bonded step lap joint with seven steps was now able to achieve a 70 % load recovery with a 95 % increase in fatigue resistance. Overall the work discussed as part of this dissertation provides detailed methods in optimising composite joint repair whilst providing benchmark comparisons between thin and thick fastened, bonded and hybrid joint cases. This is an area of research which has seen limited attention in the past but is crucial for the continual growth of composite material usage in both commercial and military sectors. Achieving composite joint repair certification is a stringent and costly process, through this research various methods have been presented to not only improve repair durability but to assist damage detection and prevent final catastrophic failure, all of which will greatly assist composite repair certification...|$|R
