40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of <b>computer</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>instructions</b> on {{learning}} effectiveness in computer aided design and manufacturing modules which are integral to mechanical engineering related courses. These courses require learners to understand and know the basics of design and manufacturing processes as well as use specialist software and CNC machines. Use of <b>computer</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>instructions</b> enables learner to grasp complex information in an easier way because of the embedded visual element in such instructions. To quantify the effect of integration of computers in traditional teaching three groups of students were exposed to different teaching methodologies as given below. 1. Traditional classroom lecturing and laboratory work in classroom. 2. Traditional teaching with supervised exposure to available computer simulation. 3. Traditional teaching with un-supervised exposure to available computer simulation. At the end of teaching learning process these students has been evaluated for their proficiency in CAD/CAM/CNC applications. The learning outcomes the students have been measured using blooms taxonomy in knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation cognition levels. The {{analysis of the data}} indicates that groups exposed to <b>computer</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>instructions</b> performed better than the group taught using traditional teaching method.
