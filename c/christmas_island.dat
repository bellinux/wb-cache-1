5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> red crab) mate seasonally {{and return to the}} sea to release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land, albeit in damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.|$|E
5|$|South Pacific Air Lines (SPAL) {{had been}} granted {{permission}} by the United States and British governments to operate a flying boat service from <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island.</b> Patrick Dean asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Roger Makins to sound out the U.S. government about terminating the contract. Makins reported in March 1956 that Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was willing to help {{so long as the}} dormant American claim to the island was not prejudiced. The lease on the island facilities, including the airfield and the port, {{had been granted}} to SPAL with a clause in the contract that said it could be terminated if there was a military necessity to do so. The Americans proposed that the British tell SPAL that they were establishing an airbase on the island, and that the United States would support this so long as SPAL was paid fair compensation. An official letter was sent to the president of SPAL on 1 May 1956, withdrawing the permit to operate from <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island,</b> regretting any inconvenience, and offering to consider compensation.|$|E
5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had to remain on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island.</b> The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have {{to remain on the}} island {{for more than a year}} unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one day a week off work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E

5|$|About 60 Gilbertese {{civilians were}} {{relocated}} to Fanning island in January 1957 on the copra ship Tungaru, and another 40 on the Tulgai the following month. By mid-March 44 Gilbertese men, 29 women and 56 children remained. By {{the end of}} April, 31 of the men, and all {{the women and children}} hadd been taken to Fanning Island by RAF Hastings. The civilians would remain there for the next three months, before returning to <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island.</b> During the later test series, the Gilbertese civilians remained on the island, marshalled in areas like the military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
5|$|The Fregatidae are {{a sister}} group to Suloidea which {{consists}} of cormorants, darters, gannets, and boobies. Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread, (the magnificent, great and lesser frigatebirds) while two are endangered (the <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> and Ascension Island frigatebirds) and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus Limnofregata, the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Vivienne-Fanja are unclear {{as a result}} of sparseness of data, due to a {{disruption}} in satellite imagery coverage. It is estimated that a tropical low formed on January23 west of <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> in the Australian basin. The Bureau of Meteorology named the storm Vivienne, which gradually intensified while moving to the west. On January27, the cyclone crossed 80Â°E into the southwest Indian Ocean, at which time it was renamed Fanja. While in the basin, the storm reached peak winds of 80km/h (50mph). It continued moving to the southwest before dissipating on January30.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on March22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} disturbed {{weather in}} the central Indian Ocean, approximately 685km (425mi) southeast of <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island.</b> The system was embedded mostly in the monsoon trough, surrounded by favorable environmental conditions, which prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0030UTC on March24. Convection increased as vertical wind shear decreased, and the system developed a curved band pattern. Throughout the day, the storm showed signs of potential rapid intensification, due to its quick organization. The Bureau of Meteorology's Perth Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (Perth TCWC) noted {{the system as a}} tropical low at 1000UTC on March24, and the JTWC issued its first warning two hours later. However, for reasons which remain unclear, the Bureau of Meteorology did not extensively monitor the system.|$|E
5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another Â£1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{grey reef shark}} is {{native to}} the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to India, {{including}} Madagascar and nearby islands, the Red Sea, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China to northern Australia and New Zealand, including the Gulf of Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This species has also been reported from numerous Pacific islands, including American Samoa, the Chagos Archipelago, Easter Island, <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island,</b> the Cook Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotu Archipelago, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, the Marianas Islands, Palau, the Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, the Hawaiian Islands, and Vanuatu.|$|E
5|$|His initial posting to the Pacific Theater {{was delayed}} by a month, {{during which he}} {{completed}} further training on the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat. By virtue of this additional training, and because Roddenberry's height made it unlikely {{that he would be}} suitable for a combat fighter pilot, he was assigned to bombers. He received orders to report to Bellows Field, Oahu, to join the 394th Bomb Squadron, 5th Bombardment Group, of the Thirteenth Air Force. The squadron flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, which had previously been used by the 19th Bomb Group, and were en route to a maintenance overhaul when they had to flee due to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Roddenberry was assigned as Captain William Ripley's co-pilot for the flight that the squadron took to <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island,</b> and the following day to Canton Island. An additional flight on November 17 took the squadron to Nadi, Fiji, where they were expected to go on to the New Hebrides. Instead they were ordered to remain in Nadi to fly reconnaissance missions.|$|E
5|$|In {{his role}} as Controller of Atomic Energy, Morgan was present for Operation Hurricane, the first British atomic weapons tests at the Montebello Islands in October 1952. His {{position}} was gradually reduced to a figurehead, with his authority largely supplanted by the Atomic Energy Board, which was chaired by Lord Cherwell, and was abolished in 1954 {{with the creation of}} the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Morgan then became Controller of Nuclear Weapons. Nonetheless, he was still an important figure in the push for higher-yield weapons. He pressed for the testing of the Green Bamboo boosted fission weapon during Operation Mosaic. This resulted in Mosaic becoming a two-test series, although Green Bamboo could not be made available in time. A Green Bamboo assembly was subsequently taken to <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> for Operation Grapple, but was deleted from the test series to save money. Morgan was also instrumental in putting the case {{for the development of the}} H-bomb on operational grounds.|$|E

5|$|The four cruisers then {{departed}} {{the central}} Pacific, bound for Chile. On 13 August {{the captain of}} the Emden, Commodore Karl von MÃ¼ller, persuaded Spee to detach his ship for commerce raiding. The ships again coaled after their arrival at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 20 August. On 6 September Spee detached NÃ¼rnberg, along with the tender Titania, to cut the British cable system at Fanning Island. The cruiser flew a French ensign to deceive the defenders, and succeeded in destroying the station on 7 September. NÃ¼rnberg then rejoined the fleet at <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island.</b> later that day. In order to keep the German high command informed of his activities, Spee sent NÃ¼rnberg on 8 September to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. Spee chose the ship because the British were aware she had left Mexican waters, and so her presence in Hawaii would not betray the movements of the entire East Asia Squadron. She was also ordered to contact German agents to instruct them to prepare coal stocks in South America for the squadron's use. NÃ¼rnberg brought back news of the Allied conquest of the German colony at Samoa.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} LeonâEline {{were from a}} low {{pressure}} area that developed within the monsoon trough on February1 in the eastern Indian Ocean, about 250km (155mi) south of the Indonesian island of Bali. The low formed due to a surge of energy within the monsoon that had crossed the equator from the northwest. Associated convection, or thunderstorms, was initially sparse. Over the subsequent few days the system tracked west-southwestward without much development, moving around a large ridge over northwestern Australia. There was initially moderate wind shear in the region. However, a developing anticyclone allowed the convection to persist over the center and develop outflow. At 22:00UTC on February3, the Perth Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (PTCWC) upgraded the tropical low to a Category1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale, estimating 10âminute sustained winds of 65km/h (40mph). At 04:00UTC the next day, the PTCWC named the storm Tropical Cyclone Leon. On the same day at 03:00UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 11S. Around that time, the storm was located about 215km (130mi) south-southeast of <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the five}} species are {{considered}} at risk. In 2003, {{a survey of the}} four colonies of the critically endangered <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> frigatebirds counted 1200 breeding pairs. As frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs. Larger numbers formerly bred on the island, but the clearance of breeding habitat during World War II and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease. The population of the vulnerable Ascension frigatebird has been estimated at around 12,500 individuals. The birds formerly bred on Ascension Island itself, but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815. The birds continued to breed on a rocky outcrop just off the shore of the island. A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats and a few birds have returned to nest on the island.|$|E
50|$|The crazy ant has a {{significant}} destructive impact on the island's ecosystem, killing and displacing crabs on the forest floor. The super-colonies also devastate crab numbers migrating to the coast. This has seen a rapid depletion {{in the number of}} land crabs, which are vital to <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island's</b> biodiversity - land crabs are a keystone species in the forest ecology: they dig burrows, turn over the soil, and fertilize it with their droppings.|$|R
50|$|In 1888 he was {{assigned}} to the Prussian embassy in Hamburg, and thereafter served as Consul in Kovno, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire (1889-1892), Basel, Switzerland (1893-1895) and Bucharest, Romania (1895-1905). On 28 March 1905 he was appointed to succeed the deceased Hans Hermann Eschke as Consul-General of Germany at Singapore, with responsibility for the Straits Settlements and Cocos Keeling and <b>Christmas</b> <b>Islands,</b> Johore, the Federated Malay States, the Colony of Labuan, British North Borneo, Brunei and the Kingdom of Sarawak.|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} impacts of crazy ants on red crabs and <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island's</b> {{ecosystems}} the Parks Australia carried out a major aerial baiting program in 2009, to follow up the first aerial baiting conducted in 2002. The first step was conducting an extensive island-wide survey to determine the exact locations of the supercolonies. For several months, staff traversed the island surveying over 900 sites. The result was a map of crazy ant supercolonies and red crab burrow densities, together with other biodiversity data.|$|R
