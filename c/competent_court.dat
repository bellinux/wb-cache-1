Spain's attorney, David Hoffman, future {{law professor at the}} University of Maryland and author of a treatise that would be used {{as the basis for the}} curriculum of Harvard Law School, insisted that regardless of whether the prize court of Venezuela was competent to judge as good prey the capture Spanish goods on behalf of Buenos Aires, the real question was whether [...] "possession had been acquired by illegal means in connection with this country." [...] If Almeida could acquire weapons, ammunition and U.S. crew to attack Spanish ships without obtaining a formal condemnation, [...] "all legislation on the subject of neutrality would be a solemn mockery." [...] In his opinion, Judge William Johnson announced that Almeida could not [...] "claim a right springing out of his own wrong".|$|E

50|$|According to § 1, genocide, {{crimes against}} humanity, and war crimes {{are subject to}} {{universal}} jurisdiction, thus German courts can punish offenses committed by foreign citizens abroad. Prosecutorial jurisdiction lies with the Public Prosecutor General. <b>Competent</b> <b>courts</b> at first instance are the Oberlandesgerichte (Higher Regional Courts). The prosecution of crimes committed outside German jurisdiction is limited by § 153f of the German Criminal Procedural Code, which gives the Public Prosecutor General a wide discretion of when to open a case via universal jurisdiction, if the offender is not of German nationality. So far the Public Prosecutor General's office has suspended persecator measures for 128 cases brought to its attention involving international crimes pursuant to the German International Criminal Code.|$|R
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, the Confederate government sought to counter the United States Navy in part by appealing to private enterprise world-wide to engage in privateering against United States shipping. Privateering was the practice of fitting ordinary private merchant vessels with modest armament, then sending them to sea to capture other merchant vessels in return for monetary reward. The captured vessels and cargo fell under customary prize rules at sea. [...] Prizes would be taken to the jurisdiction of a <b>competent</b> <b>court,</b> which could be in the sponsoring country or theoretically in any neutral port. If the court found that the capture was legal, the ship and cargo would be forfeited and sold at a prize auction. The proceeds would be distributed among owners and crew according to a contractual arrangement. Privateers were also authorized to attack an enemy's navy warships and then apply to the sponsoring government for direct monetary reward, usually gold or gold specie (coins).|$|E

If I were allowed to tell my tale to the Parliament in London, what might not happen to them, they wondered--to them who had ventured to pass sentence of death upon a subject of the Queen of Great Britain? Might not this turn the scale against them? Might not Britain arise in wrath and crush them, these men who dared to invoke her forms of law in order to kill her citizen? Those, as I learned afterwards, were the thoughts that passed through their minds.|$|E

It also involved twelve qualifying matches in the UEFA Europa League, and three in the UEFA Champions League.

The article examines approaches taken by courts in South Africa in determining the circumstances in which the South African Bill of Rights applies to private relationships, when private parties owe each other duties arising out of the Bill of Rights and the scope of a court’s authority to amend the common law in that regard. The article projects the debate, analysis and critique of these approaches onto the Malawian legal landscape through a discussion of the tenant worker contracted on the Malawi private estate...|$|R
60|$|Your Committee {{finds that}} a protest, with reasons at large, was entered by several lords against this {{determination}} of their court.[9] It {{is always an}} advantage to those who protest, that their reasons appear upon record; whilst the reasons of the majority, who determine the question, do not appear. This would be a disadvantage of such importance as greatly to impair, if not totally to destroy, the effect of precedent as authority, if the reasons which prevailed were not justly presumed to be more valid than those which have been obliged to give way: the former having governed the final and conclusive decision of a <b>competent</b> <b>court.</b> But your Committee, combining the fact of this decision with the early decision just quoted, and with the total absence of any precedent of an objection, before that time or since, allowed to pleading, or what has any relation to the rules and principles of pleading, as used in Westminster Hall, has {{no doubt that the}} House of Lords was governed in the 9th of Anne by the very same principles which it had solemnly declared in the 11th of Richard II.|$|E

40|$|When Member States violate Community law and {{affected}} persons bring a {{claim for}} damages, at first glance, {{there seems to be}} a clear and simple division of tasks between Community law and the ECJ on the one hand and national law and national courts on the other. It is a principle of Community law that the Member States are obliged to make good losses and damages caused to individuals by breaches of Community law for which they can be held responsible. And it is for the national legal order to designate the <b>competent</b> <b>courts</b> and lay down the procedural rules for the relevant legal proceedings. Indeed, a clear and simple division of tasks and competences. This paper discusses if that is really the case.

50|$|Until a {{decision}} of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO of 1994, namely G 9/93 (reverting earlier {{decision of the}} same instance of 1985, namely G 1/84), {{it was possible for}} the proprietor of a European patent to oppose its own patent with the aim of centrally limiting it. Decision G 9/93 however deprived patent proprietors of this opportunity. This means that, after G 9/93, the only possibility for the proprietor of a European patent to voluntarily limit the scope conferred by its patent (e.g. for instance to strengthen the patent in view of some newly discovered prior art documents and/or in advance of envisaged litigation) was to request such limitation at the national level, i.e. before the national patent offices or <b>competent</b> <b>courts</b> of the Contracting States, if permitted. The EPC of 1973 made no provision for a limitation procedure, and a fortiori no provision for centrally limiting a European patent before the EPO after the nine-month period for filing an opposition (nine months as from the date of grant of the European patent).|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} study we have {{examined}} the institution Sentenced Persons Held in Third Countries, in order to serve the sentence or the measure of deprivation of liberty in a penitentiary or a medical unit in Romania, focusing on {{the recognition of the}} foreign judgment by the <b>competent</b> <b>courts</b> in Romania. The conducted examination has revealed some shortcomings of the Romanian special law, which refers specifically to the absence of the convicted person from hearing to the appeal of the case, and his inability to defend. Also, it has been highlighted the fact that no Romanian legislator has taken into account the possibility of requesting the transfer of a minor convicted in a third State to a penalty or an educational measure of deprivation of liberty. The novelty of the work covers both examining the institution {{in the light of the}} Romanian jurisprudence and the formulated proposals de lege ferenda.

More precisely, the working paper first elaborates on categories of litigation {{in the field of}} data protection in order to identify potential claimants, defendants and competent administrative and judicial authorities that may decide on those remedies. Furthermore, building upon these categories of litigation, the working paper seeks to determine jurisdictional issues regarding data protection litigation within the EU, elaborating concretely on potential <b>competent</b> <b>courts</b> in case a data subject wants to file a private enforcement claim against a controller processing his personal data. Finally, the working paper addresses issues of applicable law in data protection litigation, dealing with questions such as the possibility of agreements on applicable law, the questions of applicable law if the controller is situated within the EU and the questions of extraterritorial application of EU data protection law if the controller is established outside of the EU. The working paper concludes with final remarks on the above issues...|$|R
