40|$|Writing {{code that}} talks to {{hardware}} {{is a crucial}} part of any embedded project. Both productivity and quality are needed, but some flaws in the traditional development process make these requirements difficult to meet. We have recently introduced a new approach of dealing with hardware, based on the Devil language. Devil allows to write a high-level, formal definition of the programming interface of a peripheral circuit. A compiler automatically checks the consistency of a Devil specification, from which it generates the low-level, hardware-operating code. In our original framework, the generated code is dependent of the host architecture (CPU, buses, and bridges). Consequently, any variation in the hardware environment requires a specific tuning of the compiler. Considering the variability of embedded architectures, this is a serious drawback. In addition, this prevents from mixing different buses in the same <b>circuit</b> <b>interface.</b> In this paper, we remove those limitations by improving our framework in two ways.
