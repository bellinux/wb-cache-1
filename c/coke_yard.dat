The northeast elevation windows, while having the appearance of sashes, are fitted with a patent device (magic stays) which raises and pivots the lower sash against the upper sash. These windows have hoods, and a corrugated iron lean-to garage has been added to the northern end, replacing the wood, coal and <b>coke</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, we taught an {{interdisciplinary}} studio at Iowa State University in which twentyfour upper level students in architecture, landscape architecture, and community and regional planning were asked to address a three hundred acre site {{just south of the}} Des Moines, Iowa central business district near the confl uence of the Raccoon and Iowa Rivers. Past uses of the site have included rail yards, newspaper and magazine printing, tanning, asphalt manufacturing, paint manufacturing, coal and <b>coke</b> <b>yards,</b> foundry operations, iron works, and industrial chemical manufacturing. In 1975, industrial solvent contamination was discovered in the Des Moines water supply by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR); the site is adjacent to the main pumping station for the city, the Des Moines Water Works. Portions of the site were placed on the EPA’s National Priority List (NPL) in 1983 when pesticide-contaminated soils were discovered during the construction of the groundwater treatment system. Remediation has included an air stripper system for treatment of contaminated groundwater and an asphalt cap for containment of contaminated soils...|$|R
