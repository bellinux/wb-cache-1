5000|$|In 1920, the Jewish {{members of}} the first High Commissioner's {{advisory}} council objected to the Hebrew transliteration of the word “Palestine” פלשתינה (Palestina) {{on the ground that}} the traditional name was ארץ ישראל (Eretz Yisrael), but the Arab members would not agree to this designation, which in their view, had political significance.

2500|$|Few {{requests}} for <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> non-citizenship <b>nationality</b> {{are made to}} the Department of State, which are issuable by the department.

The issued passport certifies {{the status of a}} non-citizen national.

It is also legally possible to renounce DPRK nationality; the DPRK issues <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> in such cases, which may be required by other states in which a former DPRK national seeks to naturalise.
