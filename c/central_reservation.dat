5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} built with two lanes in each direction, {{but with an}} unusually wide <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> to accommodate a third lane to be added each way at a later date. The work was a compromise between the Ministry of Transport and Drake, the latter who thought two lanes would not be adequate. Initially, the shoulders were hardened with gravel but not paved, a fact still reflected in the British term hard shoulder. A hedge was planted {{along the length of}} the <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> to help reduce dazzle from the headlights of oncoming traffic at night. The road was constructed to not be a long length of straight road and with the addition of various bridges and tree planting, in the hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a <b>central</b> <b>reservation.</b> All intersections of the A5 motorway are grade separated. There are four exits and four rest areas operating along the route. The motorway is tolled using a ticket system, integrated with the A3, and each exit includes a toll plaza.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction, separated by a <b>central</b> <b>reservation,</b> except at the two bridges. All intersections of the A9 motorway are grade separated, and as of September 2011, there are 10exits and 6rest areas along the route. Since the motorway is tolled, using a ticket system, each exit includes a toll plaza; and the A9 motorway and the A8 motorway have an integrated toll system in place.|$|E
50|$|In the {{hospitality}} industry, a <b>Central</b> <b>Reservations</b> Office or <b>Central</b> <b>Reservations</b> Center {{is a call}} center that handles room reservation calls and other related calls for a hotel chain or company. A <b>Central</b> <b>Reservations</b> Office usually handles calls from a 1-800 number or multiple numbers for a chain of hotels. Call centers usually consist of a large staff of phone operators that answer incoming phone calls and specialize as reservations agents.|$|R

5|$|Sabina {{got to her}} feet, whereupon a policewoman {{attempted}} to persuade her {{to stay on the}} ground and receive further medical attention. Sabina instead struck the officer and crossed the <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> again, running into traffic {{on the other side of}} the motorway. Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E
5|$|The twins {{had been}} in Ireland before {{travelling}} to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a service station on the M6 – including not allowing the bags they were clutching to be searched – caused the driver not to allow them back on the coach. The two were later seen on the <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> of the M6. When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women, they ran across the busy motorway. Ursula managed to dodge traffic; Sabina was first struck by a SEAT León.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} third lane {{was added}} {{in each direction}} in 1966 using the land reserved within the <b>central</b> <b>reservation,</b> without the need to modify existing bridges. Despite the relative ease in this work, the lack of hard shoulders at the bridges meant the number of available lanes during engineering works was inadequate {{to cope with the}} traffic volumes of the time, estimated to be have been in the region of 140,000 vehicles daily. Construction of the M61 motorway in 1969–1970 to carry Manchester traffic northbound had its northern terminus connect to a new junction on the by-pass at Bamber Bridge, requiring the construction of Blacow Bridge to carry the north-bound M61 traffic over the M6.|$|E

5|$|As {{the route}} {{traverses}} hilly terrain, {{it requires a}} substantial number of viaducts and tunnels, as well as two major bridges to span the Drava and Mura rivers. The motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a <b>central</b> <b>reservation.</b> There are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A4 motorway are grade separated. As of October 2010, there are 12exits and 3rest areas operating along the route. As the motorway is tolled using a ticket system, each exit includes a toll plaza. Exits south of the Sveta Helena mainline toll plaza have no toll plazas, as that part of the A4 route is not tolled. The same applies to the northernmost section between the Goričan exit and the Hungarian border.|$|E
5|$|The three {{sections}} of decking were assembled {{on the broad}} <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> of Princess Road, and were craned into position over a weekend when Princess Road was closed. The decking was temporarily supported by trestles until the arch was ready. The six sections of the arch were welded together on site into two halves before being lifted into position during a second weekend. The cables were connected on third weekend. The bridge was formally opened on 10 May 1997 by Alex Ferguson in a ceremony including the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Tony Wilson. The ceremony was concluded by them being driven over the bridge in a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, and {{was followed by a}} street festival.|$|E
5|$|The Hippodrome in Constantinople {{remained}} in use for races, games, and public ceremonies {{up to the}} sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In the 12th century, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) even staged Western-style jousting matches in the Hippodrome. During the sack of 1204, the Crusaders looted the city and, among other things, removed the copper quadriga that stood above the carceres; it is now displayed at St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. Thereafter, the Hippodrome was neglected, although still occasionally used for spectacles. A print of the Hippodrome from the fifteenth century shows a derelict site, a few walls still standing, and the spina, the <b>central</b> <b>reservation,</b> robbed of its splendor. Today, only the obelisks and the Serpent Column stand where for centuries the spectators gathered. In the West, the games had ended much sooner; {{by the end of}} the fourth century public entertainments in Italy had come to an end in all but a few towns. The last recorded chariot race in Rome itself took place in the Circus Maximus in 549 AD.|$|E

5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a <b>central</b> <b>reservation.</b> Sections of the motorway that have a gradient greater than 4% are divided into three lanes to prevent traffic problems caused by slower vehicles. These sections have no emergency lanes. Similarly, there are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A6 motorway are grade separated. As the route traverses rugged mountains it requires numerous long bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and other structures. As of 2010 there are nine exits and three rest areas situated along the route. The majority of the motorway is a ticket system toll road with pricing tied to vehicle classification. Each exit between Grobnik mainline toll plaza and Bosiljevo2 interchage has a toll plaza. No toll is charged at Bosiljevo2 where the traffic switches to the A1 motorway; traffic is tolled upon leaving the A1 motorway. Exits between the mainline toll plaza and Orehovica interchange have no toll plazas, as {{that part of the}} A6 route is not tolled.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction, separated by a <b>central</b> <b>reservation.</b> All intersections of the A3 motorway are grade separated, and the motorway comprises several large stack and cloverleaf interchanges at junctions with four other motorways in Croatia: A1, A2, A4 and A5. As of October 2010, another cloverleaf interchange is under construction on the A3 route, where the A11 motorway is scheduled to branch off. The route comprises {{a large number of}} bridges and culverts, but has no tunnels because it runs through plains. The Sava River Bridge is the most significant structure on the A3. Currently, there are 21exits and 18rest areas operating along the route. A large part of the motorway is tolled using a ticket system; one section uses an open toll collection system. The Zagreb bypass sections are not tolled. The toll is charged according to vehicle classification in Croatia. The A3 motorway is operated by Hrvatske autoceste.|$|E
5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E
