5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a <b>cooling</b> <b>duct</b> and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E

50|$|The main coil is {{the outer}} part of the line trap which is made from {{stranded}} aluminum cable. The reactor coil, depending on the device, {{can be made up}} of several aluminum wires, allowing equal distribution amongst the parallel wires. The stranded aluminum coil is wound in one layer. However, when the application of more than one layer is necessary, separation between layers is required to provide a <b>cooling</b> <b>duct</b> between them to avoid overheating. The <b>cooling</b> <b>duct</b> is created with spacer bars made out of epoxy resin and fiberglass. The coil carries rated continuous power frequency currents, therefore this is the power inductor in this system. It provides a low impedance path for the electricity flow. Since the power flow is rather large at times, the coil used in a line trap must be large in terms of physical size. Hence, a line trap unit is inserted between the busbar and connection of coupling capacitor to the line. It is a parallel tuned circuit containing inductance and capacitance. It has low impedance for power frequency and high impedance to carrier frequency. This unit prevents the high frequency carrier signal from entering the neighboring line.|$|E
50|$|Following Panoz's {{decision}} {{to abandon the}} LMP07, the cars were transferred to privateer hands. The cars were modified {{in an attempt to}} make them more competitive then they had been in Panoz's hands. The Zytek-built V8s were replaced by Mugen Motorsports MF408S 4.0 litre V8s which were small enough to allow for a decrease in the height of the engine cover. This led to the porthole intakes being replaced with the older NACA duct. The side bodywork was also revised to eliminate the large rear brake <b>cooling</b> <b>duct,</b> opting instead for large air exhaust exits from the front wheel well.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other coupé {{competitors}} in its class, the chassis on the R18 is not {{composed of two}} halves but rather is of single-piece construction for improved rigidity. The R18 has an engine <b>cooling</b> <b>duct</b> above the cockpit roof as well as redesigned rear wheel arches to channel more air to the rear wing. Like the Acura ARX-02a, Audi has chosen to install taller and wider tyres at the front for increased contact patch. Further changes include a lower rear wing, aluminium splitters and a small duct {{on the front of}} the car for improved driver comfort within the cockpit. The 2011 ACO regulations have limited the R18's fuel tank to 65 litres.|$|E

In Monaco, the car lacked mechanical grip, with Hamilton and Button qualifying fifth and eighth respectively.

40|$|Direct-driven {{permanent}} magnet synchronous generator {{is one of}} the most promising topologies for megawatt-range wind power applications. The rotational speed of the direct-driven generator is very low compared with the traditional electrical machines. The low rotational speed requires high torque to produce megawatt-range power. The special features of the direct-driven generators caused by the low speed and high torque are discussed in this doctoral thesis. Low speed and high torque set high demands on the torque quality. The cogging torque and the load torque ripple must be as low as possible to prevent mechanical failures. In this doctoral thesis, various methods to improve the torque quality are compared with each other. The rotor surface shaping, magnet skew, magnet shaping, and the asymmetrical placement of magnets and stator slots are studied not only by means of torque quality, but also the effects on the electromagnetic performance and manufacturability of the machine are discussed. The heat transfer of the direct-driven generator must be designed to handle the copper losses of the stator winding carrying high current density and to keep the temperature of the magnets low enough. The cooling system of the direct-driven generator applying the doubly radial air cooling with numerous radial <b>cooling</b> <b>ducts</b> was modeled with a lumped-parameter-based thermal network. The performance of the cooling system was discussed during the steady and transient states. The effect of the number and width of radial <b>cooling</b> <b>ducts</b> was explored. The large number of radial <b>cooling</b> <b>ducts</b> drastically increases the impact of the stack end area effects, because the stator stack consists of numerous substacks. The effects of the radial <b>cooling</b> <b>ducts</b> on the effective axial length of the machine were studied by analyzing the crosssection of the machine in the axial direction. The method to compensate the magnet end area leakage was considered. The effect of the <b>cooling</b> <b>ducts</b> and the stack end area effects on the no-load voltages and inductances of the machine were explored by using numerical analysis tools based on the three-dimensional finite element method. The electrical efficiency of the {{permanent magnet}} machine with different control methods was estimated analytically over the whole speed and torque range. The electrical efficiencies achieved with the most common control methods were compared with each other. The stator voltage increase caused by the armature reaction was analyzed. The effect of inductance saturation as a function of load current was implemented to the analytical efficiency calculation...|$|R

50|$|On the outside, the SE30 {{differed}} from other Diablo models with a revised front fascia featuring straked brake <b>cooling</b> <b>ducts</b> and a deeper spoiler, while the rear <b>cooling</b> <b>ducts</b> were {{changed to a}} vertical body-colored design. The raging bull emblem was moved {{from the front of}} the luggage lid to the nose panel of the car between the front indicators. The engine lid had slats covering the narrow rear window, while a larger spoiler was installed as standard equipment. The single rear fog lamp and rear backup lamp, which had been on either side of the rear grille, were moved into the bumper; this change would be applied to all Diablo models across the lineup. Completing the exterior variations were special magnesium alloy wheels, SE30 badging, and a new metallic purple paint color (this could be changed upon request).|$|R
40|$|The project ”Design {{solution}} {{in the end}} stripper system for the Grate, to define {{the impact of the}} thermal properties” is about the design {{solution in}} the end stripping system that has been suggested to keep the clearance between the Grate conveyor and the tip of the end stripper more constant. In order to investigate the reason behind the varying clearance, the idea was to make measurements on different parameters in the system. Due to some difficulties in getting the measurement equipment in to the system without affecting the production, the measurements could not be done during the project time. For this project, much time where spent on collecting information and drawings, as well as interviewing employees at LKAB that has experience of working with the end stripping system, or in other way is familiar with the problem the system has caused. The collected information and drawings have formed the basis for a CAD model of the end stripping system, as well as a set of requirements that the new solution must meet. The design solution suggested in this work to define the impact of the thermal properties on the steering rod and thus the clearance, is an extension of the <b>cooling</b> <b>duct</b> and the heat insulation as well as a relocation of the attachment between the end stripper plate and the steering rod. The extension of the <b>cooling</b> <b>duct</b> resulted in an additional 500 millimetres of the steering rod, being cooled. After some minor changes in {{the upper part of the}} steering rod, could the heat insulation be extended by 553 millimetres. The efforts to move the attachment between the end stripping plate and the steering rod resulted in a decreased factor for the change in clearance, from 4, 2 to 2, 2. The extension of the <b>cooling</b> <b>duct</b> and the heat insulation was validated by inserting the new steering rod in the model for the system. To validate the durability of the components after the modifications, a FEM (Finite Element Method) -analyses was performed with Nastran as solver.
