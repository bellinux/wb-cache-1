5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases <b>costs,</b> <b>is</b> associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
25|$|When the employers' social {{security}} contribution is included, the maximum marginal tax rate on labour <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> 54,3%.|$|E
25|$|A pilot {{with this}} licence cannot work for hire, {{although}} reimbursement for some <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> permitted.|$|E
50|$|When average <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> declining as output increases, {{marginal}} <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> {{less than}} average cost. When average <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> rising, marginal <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> greater than average cost. When average <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> neither rising nor falling (at a minimum or maximum), marginal cost equals average cost.|$|R
5000|$|By Nature or Traceability:Direct Costs and Indirect <b>costs.</b> Direct <b>Costs</b> <b>are</b> Directly attributable/traceable to Cost object. Direct <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> {{assigned}} to <b>Cost</b> Object. Indirect <b>Costs</b> <b>are</b> not directly attributable/traceable to Cost Object. Indirect <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> allocated or apportioned to cost objects.|$|R
5000|$|Non-manufacturing <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> those <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> not {{directly}} incurred in manufacturing a product. Examples of such <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> salary of sales personnel and advertising expenses. Generally non-manufacturing <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> further classified into two categories: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{increase}} in healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} primary drivers of long-term budget deficits. The long-term budget situation has considerably improved in the 2015 forecast versus the 2009 forecast per the Trustees Report.|$|E
25|$|Costs: Securitizations are {{expensive}} due to management and system costs, legal fees, underwriting fees, rating fees and ongoing administration. An allowance for unforeseen <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> usually essential in securitizations, {{especially if it}} is an atypical securitization.|$|E
50|$|Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> {{that change}} in {{proportion}} to the good or service that a business produces. Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also <b>be</b> considered normal <b>costs.</b> Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct <b>costs,</b> however, <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> that can easily be associated with a particular cost object. However, not all variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> direct <b>costs.</b> For example, variable manufacturing overhead <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> variable <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> indirect <b>costs,</b> not direct <b>costs.</b> Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.|$|R
5000|$|Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> whereby {{materials}} and labor may be allocated based on past experience. Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> a classification of costs by time. Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> incurred in the past. Predetermined <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> computed in advance on basis of factors affecting cost elements. In the 19th century and early 20th century time books {{were used to}} register working time, and eventually determine historical costs.|$|R

25|$|Students {{may also}} choose to rent {{housing in the}} {{bordering}} community of Isla Vista. An estimated average for rent <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> US$500–$800/month to share a bedroom, and includes trash pickup and water utilities. Low-cost housing is limited, with the cheapest source being the Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative.|$|E
25|$|A common {{method used}} to express {{economic}} <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> to calculate a price per delivered kilowatt-hour (kWh). The solar cell efficiency {{in combination with the}} available irradiation has a major influence on the costs, but generally speaking the overall system efficiency is important. Commercially available solar cells (as of 2006) reached system efficiencies between 5 and 19%.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species may}} hold an air bubble within the mouth during ASR. This may assist {{buoyancy}} {{as well as}} increase the oxygen content of the water passing over the bubble {{on its way to}} the gills. Another way to reduce buoyancy <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> to perform ASR on rocks or plants that provide support near the water surface.|$|E
50|$|Indirect <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> not {{directly}} accountable to a cost object (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). Indirect <b>costs</b> may <b>be</b> either fixed or variable. Indirect costs include administration, personnel and security <b>costs.</b> These <b>are</b> those <b>costs</b> which <b>are</b> {{not directly}} related to production. Some indirect <b>costs</b> may <b>be</b> overhead. But some overhead <b>costs</b> can <b>be</b> directly attributed to a project and <b>are</b> direct <b>costs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Costs</b> <b>are</b> “wasted” {{when the}} {{services}} for which those <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> charged are {{of no use}} to {{the parties to the}} action.|$|R
5000|$|In {{this method}} {{overhead}} is calculated {{as a percentage}} of the material <b>cost.</b> This <b>is</b> used where the material <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> high and of prime importance. Here other <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> negligible or are dependent on the material <b>cost.</b> This <b>is</b> calculated as (Amount of overhead/Material cost)x 100If the production overhead is 3,000 and the material <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> 10,000 then the absorption rate will be ...|$|R
25|$|The {{total cost}} of the disaster, {{including}} victims' compensation, refloating, towing and scrapping <b>costs,</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be around $2 billion, {{more than three times the}} $612 million construction cost of the ship. Costa Cruises offered compensation to passengers (to a limit of €11,000 a person) to pay for all damages, including the value of the cruise. One-third of the survivors took the offer.|$|E
25|$|Another {{way to look}} at <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> to {{determine}} the expected cost of establishing a pregnancy. Thus if a clomiphene treatment has a chance to establish a pregnancy in 8% of cycles and costs $500, the expected cost is $6,000 to establish a pregnancy, compared to an IVF cycle (cycle fecundity 40%) with a corresponding expected cost of $30,000 ($12,000/.4).|$|E
25|$|Even so, it {{has been}} {{estimated}} that population ageing only explains 0.2 percentage points of the annual growth rate in medical spending of 4.3 percent since 1970. In addition, certain reforms to the Medicare system in the United States decreased elderly spending on home health care by 12.5 percent per year between 1996 and 2000. This would suggest that the impact of ageing populations on health care <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> not inevitable.|$|E
5000|$|Resource Costs: Resources {{consist of}} labor, {{equipment}}, materials, subcontractors, trucking, {{and any other}} cost detail items. Labor and equipment <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> internal crew <b>costs,</b> whereas all other resource <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> received from vendors, such as material suppliers, subcontractors, and trucking companies. Labor <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> usually calculated from wages, benefits, burden, and workers compensation. Equipment <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> calculated from purchase price, taxes, fuel consumption, and other operating expenses.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{average cost}} curve {{will have a}} U-shape, because fixed <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> all {{incurred}} before any production takes place and marginal <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> typically increasing, because of diminishing marginal productivity. In this [...] "typical" [...] case, for low levels of production marginal <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> below average <b>costs,</b> so average <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> decreasing as quantity increases. An increasing marginal cost curve will intersect a U-shaped average cost curve at its minimum, after which point the average cost curve begins to slope upward. For further increases in production beyond this minimum, marginal <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> above average <b>costs,</b> so average <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> increasing as quantity increases. An example of this typical case would be a factory designed to produce a specific quantity of widgets per period: below a certain production level, average <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> higher due to under-utilized equipment, while above that level, production bottlenecks increase the average cost.|$|R
30|$|Two suffix {{selection}} algorithms are investigated here. In {{the first}} approach, only target <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> used and weights of concatenation <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> set to zero. In the second approach, both target and concatenation <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> used. The two algorithms for suffix selection are described below.|$|R
25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in Egypt {{are among the}} lowest in the world. Despite their affordability, almost half the bills are not paid and {{politicians}} are reluctant to increase tariffs, especially since the Arab Spring. Thus only a fraction of <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> recovered through revenues from tariffs. The shortfall in revenues is partly made up by government subsidies for investment and operations at the tune of USD 2.5bn per year, of which only about 10 percent is financed by external donors.|$|E
25|$|Canada has {{the tenth}} largest coal {{reserves}} in the world, an enormous amount considering the sparse population of the country. However, {{the vast majority of}} those reserves are located hundreds or thousands of kilometres from the country's industrial centers and seaports, and the effect of high transportation <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> that they remain largely unexploited. As with other natural resources, regulation of coal production is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial governments, and it only enters federal jurisdiction when it is imported or exported from Canada.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there are}} seven parties {{participating}} in the ITER program: the European Union (through the legally distinct organisation EURATOM), India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea, and the United States. Canada was previously a full member, but has since pulled out {{due to a lack}} of funding from the federal government. The lack of funding also resulted in Canada withdrawing from its bid for the ITER site in 2003. The host member of the ITER project, and hence the member contributing most of the <b>costs,</b> <b>is</b> the EU.|$|E
30|$|Prices were {{calculated}} and reported in European Euros (€). Since all <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> realised approximately 12  months after treatment, a correction for differential timing of economic <b>costs</b> <b>was</b> not performed. Direct <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> calculated {{using data from}} all of the patients included in the trial, whereas calculation of total <b>costs</b> <b>was</b> limited to those patients who completed the questionnaire. The CI around the mean costs of each treatment and around the difference in <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> obtained using a bootstrap sampling procedure [8]. For this purpose, 2000 random samples with replacement were drawn from the distribution of total costs in the two treatment groups.|$|R
50|$|Since {{constructed}} wetlands are self-sustaining {{their lifetime}} <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> {{significantly lower than}} those of conventional treatment systems. Often their capital <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> also lower compared to conventional treatment systems. They do take up significant space, and are therefore not preferred where real estate <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> high.|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturing <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> those <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> {{directly}} involved in manufacturing of products. Examples of manufacturing costs include raw materials costs and charges related to workers. Manufacturing <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> divided into three broad categories: ...|$|R
25|$|The non-health direct {{expenditures}} primarily concern {{costs associated}} with the criminal justice system and crime victim costs, but also include a modest level of expenses for administration of the social welfare system. The total for 2002 was estimated at $36.4 billion. The largest detailed component of these <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> for state and federal corrections at $14.2 billion, which is primarily for the operation of prisons. Another $9.8 billion was spent on state and local police protection, followed by $6.2 billion for federal supply reduction initiatives.|$|E
25|$|For {{conventional}} {{sewage treatment}} plants, around 30 {{percent of the}} annual operating <b>costs</b> <b>is</b> usually required for energy. The energy requirements vary with type of treatment process as well as wastewater load. For example, constructed wetlands have a lower energy requirement than activated sludge plants, as less energy {{is required for the}} aeration step. Sewage treatment plants that produce biogas in their sewage sludge treatment process with anaerobic digestion can produce enough energy to meet most of the energy needs of the sewage treatment plant itself.|$|E
25|$|After {{more than}} a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses {{released}} the long-awaited album Chinese Democracy (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production <b>costs,</b> <b>is</b> the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Former members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016, embarking on the Not in This Lifetime... Tour. The tour is currently the fifth highest-grossing concert tour of all-time, grossing over $430 Million by November 2017.|$|E
