40|$|A {{comparative}} {{review of}} material models for polymers subjected to impact loading is presented. Due {{to the different}} material models, polymers are classified in incompressible elastomers, <b>compressible</b> <b>foams</b> and thermoplastics. Elastomers and recoverable foams {{are based on the}} same theoretical description: hyperelasticity. We present a material law which allows fast generating of input data based on uniaxial static and dynamic tensile tests at different strain rates. As an application, the deformation behavior of a Hardy disk during a frontal offset impact is investigated. For thermoplastics, we give an overview of suitable material laws and show how the behavior can be characterized approximately by using metal plasticity. On the basis of a three-point bending test, the predictions of the presented approaches are compared critically. Some typical applications of polymer modeling in modern crash simulation are shown by means of pedestrian protection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a full-scale laboratory {{study of the}} axial sliding behaviour of a trenched pipeline surrounded by sand backfill. Cyclic axial displacements are applied to a heavy pipe buried in a narrow trench (less than three pipe diameters wide), using various backfill cover depths and two different soils: dry Hostun sand and a damp silty sand. A novel testing tank is employed, with <b>compressible</b> <b>foam</b> seals to allow the pipe to settle as it moves axially, and a pressure bag system to simulate backfill depths exceeding {{the height of the}} tank. The test pipe is instrumented to measure (a) the axial soil resistance developed on an isolated central section of pipe (thus avoiding tank boundary effects), and (b) the normal and shear contact stresses at a number of points around the pipe circumference. The results indicate that both the axial resistance and the normal stress distribution around the pipe can undergo considerable changes when a pipeline experiences cyclic axial displacements. An extreme case identified here is the potential for a compacted damp sand backfill to ‘arch’ completely over the pipe as a result of differential settlement, leading to unexpectedly low axial resistance. To address some limitations of the design method currently used in industry, a new approach for estimating axial resistance is suggested and applied to the present test data...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{isolation}} {{is an important}} requirement for many engineering systems. In particular, {{in the context of}} vibration isolation for light-weight automotive vehicles that exhibit wide variation in sprung mass, several limitations are associated with passive isolation systems. Such passive systems cannot obtain wide variations in the suspension parameters which required for reliable performance. While these technical drawbacks can be overcome by implementing active systems, these are associated with an increase in complexity, cost and potentially negative impact on reliability. In this context, composite fluid materials, which combine different components in a way that enhances an isolator’s performance, could represent a possible alternative approach with promising potential. However, the application of composite fluid materials for vibration isolations is still an underdeveloped area. The composite fluid material {{that is the subject of}} this research is referred to as Foam Filled Fluid (FFFluid). It is composed of three components, namely <b>compressible</b> (<b>foam)</b> particles, a viscous carrier fluid and a packaging material. This composite material has recently been investigated for applications in impact energy management but is not understood in anti-vibration application. Thus, the objective of this research was to understand the mechanisms, to characterise design parameters and to predict the responses of such composite material when used for vibration isolation systems. A theoretical understanding of the working principle for a FFFluid-based isolator was first achieved. Then, experimental work was conducted to assess the performance of such a device. The characterisation of the composite material was carried out via a systematic study; this study was then validated by an experimental -ivprogramme based on a Design of Experiments approach. Finally, empirical prediction models of the system were extracted by analysing the obtained data statistically. The conducted research shows that a FFFluid-based isolator possesses several advantages over commonly used existing solutions. Its main benefit is the potential capability of adjusting stiffness and damping coefficients by changing one component or more of this composite material. It was shown that increasing the volume of the composite material led to increased stiffness and damping coefficients. Besides, increasing the ratio of fluid in the mixture caused to increase the stiffness coefficient. The most important parameters that have an influence on the response of FFFluid were: the size of foam, the ratio of foam to fluid, volume of the material and fluid viscosity. Therefore, empirical models were established based on these parameters, the accuracy of these models were 85...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of Lithium-ion batteries {{continues to grow}} {{with the introduction of}} more electronic devices, electric cars, and energy storage. Yet the optimization approach taken by the manufacturers and system designers is one of test and build, an approach that nearly every other industry has long abandoned. A computational model is required to reduce the expensive build-test cycle and allow safer, cheaper batteries to be built. The path to building this computational model will involve many different processes and one of those processes dictates the homogenizing of the interior of the battery casing by treating the interior as a homogenized Representative Volume Element. This study explains this process and outlines a procedure for the development of this particular model for both cylindrical and prismatic / pouch cells. Over twenty different mechanical tests were performed on fully-discharged cylindrical and pouched / prismatic lithium-ion batteries, in casings and without casings under multiple loading conditions. These included lateral indentation by a rod, axial compression, through-thickness compression, in-plane unconfined compression, in-plane confined compression, hemispherical punch indentation and three-point bending. Extensive testing on the battery cell and jelly roll of 18650 lithium ion cylindrical cell, combined with the use of analytical solutions to estimate material properties of the cell, yielded the development of a finite element model. It was found that the suitably calibrated model of high density <b>compressible</b> <b>foam</b> provided a very good prediction of the crash behavior of cylindrical battery cell subjected to high intensity lateral and axial loads. For the prismatic / pouch cell, the measured load-displacement data allowed calculation of the individual compression stress-strain curves for the separator, the active anode and cathode materials. The average stress-volumetric strain relation was derived from averaging the properties of individual layers as well as from direct measurement on the bare cell. This information was then used as an input to the FE model of the cell. The model was composed of shell elements representing the Al and Cu foil and solid elements for the active material with a binder lumped together with the separator. Very good correlation was obtained between LS-Dyna numerical simulation and test results for the through-thickness compression, punch indentation and confined compression. Closed form solutions were also derived for the latter three problems which helped explain the underlying physics and identified important groups of parameters. It was also demonstrated that a thin Mylar pouch enclosure provided considerable reinforcement and in some cases changed the deformation and failure mechanism.

40|$|International audiencePolyurethane foam {{is widely}} used {{in such areas as}} the {{automotive}} industry and sport, and in the field of packaging because of its low stiffness, high compressibility and its ability to absorb strain energy. The quasi-static behaviours of polyurethane foam are highly nonlinear and elastic. This paper demonstrates that the nonlinear elastic mechanical behaviour of <b>compressible</b> polyurethane <b>foam</b> during the loading and unloading quasi-static compression tests can be described by applying Ogden's modified model. The experimental data from a uniaxial compression of three types of polyurethane foam in three different strain rates are used for parameter identification. A nonlinear optimization method helps to ensure that the parameters are satisfied with stability conditions. Thanks to the optimized parameter results, the numerical simulations agree with the experimental data. Finally, the errors between the model results and the experimental results are analyzed and the unloading phases are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of low-density and compressible polymer/graphene composite (PGC) foams for adjustable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding remains a daunting challenge. Herein, ultralightweight and <b>compressible</b> PGC <b>foams</b> {{have been developed}} by simple solution dip-coating of graphene on commercial polyurethane (PU) sponges with highly porous network structure. The resultant PU/graphene (PUG) foams had a density as low as similar to 0. 027 - 0. 030 g/cm(3) and possessed good comprehensive EMI shielding performance together with an absorption-dominant mechanism, possibly due to both conductive dissipation and multiple reflections and scattering of EM waves by the inside 3 D conductive graphene network. Moreover, {{by taking advantage of}} their remarkable compressibility, the shielding performance of the PUG foams could be simply adjusted through a simple mechanical compression, showing promise for adjustable EMI shielding. We believe that the strategy for fabricating PGC foams through a simple dip-coating method could potentially promote the large-scale production of lightweight foam materials for EMI shielding...|$|R

A reference sample built by forcing a highly <b>compressible</b> melamine <b>foam</b> with conical shape inside a constant diameter rigid tube is studied first. In this process, a radial compression varying with depth is applied. With {{the help of}} an assumption on the compressed pore geometry, properties of the reference sample can be modelled everywhere in the thickness and it is possible to use the classical transfer matrix method as theoretical reference. In the mixture approach, the material is viewed as a mixture of two known materials placed in a patchwork configuration and with proportions of each varying with depth. The properties are derived from the use of a mixing law. For the reference sample, the classical transfer matrix method is used to validate the experimental results. These results are used to validate the mixture approach. The mixture approach is then used to characterize a porous aluminium for which only the properties of the external faces are known. A porosity profile is needed and is obtained from the simulated annealing optimization process...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sandwich plates used {{in marine}} {{structures}} {{are made of}} laminated face sheets bonded to a structural foam core. Low-velocity impact by a stiff indenter may cause local deflection of the face sheet and permanent deformation or crushing of an underlying volume of the foam core. Upon unloading, the face sheet tends to spring back, while the permanent strain in the core gives rise to residual stresses that may nucleate local interfacial cracks. Extension of such interfacial cracks by applied loads can compromise structural integrity. This article examines the protective effect of thin, ductile interlayers, inserted between the face sheet and the foam core, that absorb the face sheet deflection and thus prevent or reduce the extent of damage to the foam core. Finite element solutions are obtained for a stiff, incompressible, and very ductile polyurethane (PUR) interlayer, and also for a compliant and <b>compressible</b> elastomeric <b>foam</b> (EF) layer, in a sandwich plate made of quasi-isotropic AS 4 / 3501 - 6 laminated face sheets and H 100 PVC core. Loading is applied by a concentrated force acting on a rigid cylindrical indenter. Results show that the PUR interlayer better supports the impacted face sheet than does the foam core or the EF interlayer. The PUR layer also reduces the extent of permanent deformation of the foam core. At a given magnitude of applied load, the energy release rate for cracks extended by residual stresses at the interface between the foam core and either interlayer is much lower than that at the interface between the face sheet and the foam core in the conventional design.

50|$|Most modern jigsaw puzzles {{are made}} out of {{paperboard}} since they are easier and cheaper to mass-produce than the original wooden models. An enlarged photograph or printed reproduction of a painting or other two-dimensional artwork is glued onto the cardboard before cutting. This board is then fed into a press. The press forces a set of hardened steel blades of the desired shape through the board until it is fully cut. This procedure is similar to making shaped cookies with a cookie cutter. The forces involved, however, are tremendously greater and a typical 1000-piece puzzle requires a press that can generate upwards of 700 tons of force to push the knives of the puzzle die through the board. A puzzle die is a flat board, often made from plywood, which has slots cut or burned in the same shape as the knives that are used. These knives are set into the slots and covered in a <b>compressible</b> material, typically <b>foam</b> rubber, which serves to eject the cut puzzle pieces.|$|R
40|$|The goal of our {{research}} is a practical robot skin that covers a large area of a robot surface, senses various touch feelings, and is soft and stretchable. We are developing a tactile sensor array by linking the sensor elements proposed in the previous sensor symposium. The sensor element acquires not only a contact force but also a contact area within its large (several cm sq.) sensing area. The structure of the sensor element is very simple; two layers of <b>compressible</b> insulators (urethane <b>foam)</b> which are sandwiched between three layers of stretchable conductive sheets (conductive fabric). The structure enables us to obtain the two parameters from the capacitances between the conductive layers. In linking the sensor elements, we apply the “cell-bridge-based networking system ” in which no long wires are included. CMOS LSI sensor/communication chips are arranged at {{the boundaries of the}} sensor elements, and the chips measure the capacitances between the conductive layers and send signals through the same conductive layers. In the array structure, the contact position can be estimated with finer resolution than the size of the sensor element by calculating the spatial centroid from the measured contact forces...|$|R
40|$|Currently, in the {{military}} and civilian fields, there is an increasing demand for using hybrid systems, which are manmade structural systems combining two or more distinct materials. By carefully studying and designing such kind of structural systems, one can take advantage of heterogeneity of the structure, thus significantly improving the overall structural performance. Hence, the demand for robust analytical and numerical models to predict blast performance of such system has become more important. The primary aim of the present research is to investigate and understand the structural behaviour of several hybrid systems under extreme dynamic loads and to propose concepts for optimisation. Three types of hybrid systems have been studied, improved and their performance has been validated. They are the metal-to-composite hybrid joints, sandwich panels, and the metamaterial. Analytical, numerical and experimental studies have been conducted to analyse the structural behaviour of hybrid joints and sandwich panels under transient high intensity dynamic loading, in order to ensure these systems possess the desired capacity, designed strength, and robustness. Therefore, they are able to resist not only static loadings but also shocks induced by various explosions. For frequency analysis purposes, the perforated hybrid joints and metamaterials have been considered as a 2 D lattice. The primitive cell (unit cell) of the lattice is formulated in the Fourier space (k-space) and studied using the Floquet-Bloch’s principle to investigate the attenuation-free shock response characteristics. Plane wave propagation in the hybrid system is thus investigated by constructing the first Brillouin zone and extracting the band structure diagram. As another case for a hybrid system, the structural performance of a circular sandwich panel with symmetric through-thickness architecture subjected to a pulse loading of arbitrary temporal and spatially uniform distribution (UDL) has been investigated by using the third order shear deformation theory. Based on the Hamilton’s principle, the governing partial differential equations (PDE’s) are derived. By applying the weak form Galerkin’s method of weighted residuals, the PDE’s are transformed into ODE’s. By solving the ODE’s with their boundary and initial conditions, results show that there is a strong correlation with finite element results obtained from ABAQUS 6. 9. The third-order shear deformation theory allows for accurate assessment of out-of -plane shear in the core where the failure usually occurs. Due to the fact that core of a sandwich panel is more often to be the weakest link, a remedy must sought, e. g. employing additional core layers, to improve its performance. Dynamic response of four circular sandwich panel constructions with different proposed core designs under global and local blast loading conditions has been investigated. Numerical finite element (FE) models have been set up to study the effect of additional core inter-layers on blast resistance enhancement of these sandwich panels. A ductile elastomeric layer of polyurea, and a fairly <b>compressible</b> Divinycell-H 200 <b>foam</b> layer have been selected as the additional core inter-layers and have been placed in different arrangements to protect the core of the standard sandwich panels, and maximise overall blast resistance. Comparison of specific kinetic and strain energies shows the effect of additional core layers on blast energy absorption of a sandwich system. The study shows the improvement in shear failure prevention in the core {{as a result of the}} use of additional core layers. One qualitative 2 DoF system with a viscoelastic spring element representing the integral effects of sacrificial additional core inter-layers and a nonlinear spring representing the stiffness of the conventional sandwich system; and a similar qualitative SDoF model of a conventional sandwich panel have been developed for dynamic analysis. The conclusions drawn from the numerical tests are confirmed by the output of this analysis. The results of this research work give a better understanding of the performance of some generic hybrid systems under blast, which allows the optimised hybrid system to be more confidently designed and should be able to fill the gap in the currently growing demand for high strength, light weight, reliable hybrid systems in various civilian and military industries.
