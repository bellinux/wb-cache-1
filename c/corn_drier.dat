40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{compares the}} modifications {{induced by the}} heat-moisture treatment of native starch (HMT) and by the hot-air <b>drying</b> of <b>corn</b> on wet-milled starch granules. High temperatures applied during both <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> and HMT reduced the swelling capacity of granules, increased the starch gelatinization temperatures and decreased their residual enthalpy. Pasting behaviour of pre-treated starch showed a decrease of peak and breakdown viscosity when <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> and HMT temperatures increased. Microscopic analysis showed that after hydrothermal treatment, starch granules extracted from <b>corn</b> <b>dried</b> at lower temperature swell more significantly than those extracted from <b>corn</b> <b>dried</b> at higher temperature. All these changes suggest the occurring of structural modifications within starch granules during high-temperature pre-treatments. At similar temperatures and initial moisture contents, HMT affected the physicochemical and functional properties of cornstarch more dramatically than hot-air drying. Differences induced by these two treatments were attributed to the availability of water around granules during these two pre-treatment procedures. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Charred plant remains have been found throughout the occupation of the town usually together with animal bones and fish remains as domestic rubbish. Occasionally larger groups of charred plant remains have been found including cereal chaff used as fuel in a Roman period <b>corn</b> <b>drier</b> at Norfolk Street villa (Jones 1982) and charred hay from a Roman pit at Causeway Lane (Monckton 1999 a) providing evidence of other activities within the town. Such deposits were not found here and few remains {{were found in the}} samples from Roman contexts. In contrast abundant grain deposits of medieval to post-medieval date were found here. These were quite unlike the samples from the town at the time, which were thought to represent only domestic activity. Other plant remains were preserved by mineralization caused by impregnation with calcium salts, this occurs in such conditions as found in cesspits, these were found here as in the town. The remains included fruit stones and pips, which had been eaten and deposited in the pit as sewage. These were found with fish bone from food consumed, as well as fly puparia from the insects living in the cesspits. Parasite eggs of worms of the human gut were found by testing these deposits, confirming the presence of sewage. Hence these remains show the presence of cesspits and give evidence of domestic activity and diet in the past. These remains were considered together over the phases of the site from Roman to post-medieval to help to interpret the activities on the site in the past.

40|$|To assess {{modifications}} induced in starch granules {{during high}} temperature <b>drying</b> of <b>corn</b> grain and {{their effect on}} the nutritive value of corn-starch, physicochemical and structural characteristics of starch granules from <b>corn</b> grains <b>dried</b> at different temperatures have been determined. Additionally, their in vitro digestibility and fermentation patterns were investigated, using a two steps in vitro model of the pig digestive tract. High drying temperatures induced a partial gelatinization of starch granules and produced a very favorable substrate for porcine pancreatic amylase and led to an altered physical structure which affected the rate and extent of starch granules digestion by gastric and pancreatic enzymes. Starch micrographs showed that granules extracted from <b>corn</b> <b>dried</b> at 130 °C were less angular, bigger, and had smoother surface than granules extracted from <b>corn</b> <b>dried</b> at lower temperature. High-temperature drying increased the digestibility of wet-milled starch granules, while the residues of starch from <b>corn</b> <b>dried</b> at lower temperature produced higher volume of gas during their in vitro fermentation, despite their more pronounced crystalline characteristic. The residues from pepsin–pancreatic digestion of overall samples analyzed showed highly degraded and pitted granules or fragmented external shells, starch from <b>corn</b> <b>dried</b> at 130 °C being the most degraded.

The mathematical model of grain drying plays an essential role in developing grain dryer structure and obtaining the drying technological parameters. Furthermore, an accurate mathematical model is a reference for automated control during drying process. In this paper, using mathematical models and quality model of the <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> process, a digital simulation of <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> machine system based on a virtual instrument was established for 5 HSZ dryer. Finally, an on-line measurement and automated control software of grain parameters were developed providing the changes of moisture, temperature, humidity, and germination rate in the process of drying.

CORNSIM simulates a complete corn production enterprise. Given a specific management strategy, machinery capacity, and cropping season, CORNSIM simulates planting, crop development, yield, and harvesting. CORNSIM was developed to provide the simulated flow of harvested grain. FALDRY simulates a system of low-temperature <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> bins. FALDRY inputs include bin specifications, weather data, and the incoming flow of harvested grain. FALDRY was developed to predict {{the success or failure}} of a low-temperature <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> system and the amount of electrical energy it would consume;The simulation study addressed three major objectives: (1) Determine the relative benefits of additional fan power versus the use of supplement heat to enhance the performance of a low-temperature drying system. (2) Test the feasibility of designing a low-temperature drying system to match the corn harvesting capacity of a typical Central Iowa farming enterprise. (3) Develop the optimum daily filling strategy and design recommendations for a low-temperature <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> system for Central Iowa;The following conclusions are given for Central Iowa conditions. It is expected the findings would be similar for most of the Corn Belt. (1) CORNSIM is a valid simulation model of a corn production enterprise. It can be used to determine the relative effects of changes in production strategy. (2) FALDRY is a valid simulation model of a low-temperature <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> system. It has the flexibility to accommodate layer-filling and is able to predict the grain moisture profile. (3) The most efficient method of using electrical energy to increase drying rate, improve the probability of drying in the fall, and reduce grain deterioration is to increase fan power. (4) If the daily harvest rate is 1 / 16 or less of the total production, it is feasible to match the capacity of the harvesting and low-temperature drying system. (5) The following design criteria and management strategy are recommended for low-temperature <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> systems: (a) Maximum grain depth of 16 - 20 feet. (b) Fan-power-to-grain ratio of 1. 25 to 1. 75 horsepower per 1000 bushels of bin storage capacity. (c) Use a high-performance axial fan (large bin may require 2 or more fans).

40|$|Abstract—Drying is an {{important}} step to find high quality of corn. Based on Standard of National Industry, populer as SNI, number 01 - 3920 - 1995, the corn was well stored at moisture content 14 % or below (wet basis). However, conventional <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> dealed with in-efficient energy process and corn quality degradation. This research evaluated the performance of <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> assisted by zeolite as moisture adsorbent. In this process, the zeolite and corn were placed in the dryer fluidized by warm air as drying medium under 40 - 50 oC. The air evaporated water product from corn, and at same time the zeolite adsorbed moisture in air. So, the relative humidity of air in dryer can be kept low in which enhanced the driving force for drying. Beside that, the moisture adsoprtion by zeolite was exothermic process that can supply the energy for drying or keep the dryer temperature. Thus, the drying rate can be faster. This work foccussed to observe the effect of drying temperature, air velocity, and corn to zeolite ratio on drying time as well as corn quality. As indicators, the drying rate was estimated and the proxymates content such as protein, fat, and carbohydrate content were analyzed. The results showed that compared with conventional fluidised bed dryer, <b>corn</b> <b>drying</b> with zeolite, can speed up drying time as well as improving the constant of drying rate. In addition, the corn proximate nutrition content can be well retained. At operating temperature 40 oC, air velocity 9 m. s- 1, and zeolite to corn ratio 1 : 2, the drying time can be 60 minutes shorter compared to that without zeolite...|$|R
