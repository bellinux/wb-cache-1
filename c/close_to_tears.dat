25|$|Tanaka {{initially}} planned out 50 songs, {{but this}} was far too many to record and fit into the game within allotted time and budget estimates, so the number was cut down to 24. The number was further cut down toe seven, but Hiroi was brought <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>tears</b> by this. Faced with this issue, Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage, {{and was told that}} one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game. The lyrics of all the songs were written by Hiroi, despite his repeated protests about not being a professional lyricist. Due to Hiroi's self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him. As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter Yū Aku, and bought old records of vintage songs. The learning process took between one and two months before Hiroi was competent at writing song lyrics. The songs of Sakura Wars all started with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.|$|E

25|$|In other respects, however, {{both the}} Baptism and Burial {{services}} imply {{a theology of}} salvation that accords notably less with Reformed teachings than do the counterpart passages in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion. In the Burial service, {{the possibility that a}} deceased person who has died in the faith may nevertheless not be counted amongst God's elect, is not entertained. In the Baptism service the priest explicitly pronounces the baptised infant as being now regenerate. In both cases, conformity with strict Reformed Protestant principles would have resulted in a conditional formulation. The continued inconsistency between the Articles of Religion and the Prayer Book remained a point of contention for Puritans; and would in the 19th century come <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> the Church of England apart, through the course of the Gorham judgement.|$|R
25|$|The Second Battle of El Alamein {{began on}} 23 October 1942, and ended 12 days later {{with one of}} the first large-scale, decisive Allied land {{victories}} of the war. Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500). Soon after Allied armoured units and infantry broke through the German and Italian lines and were pursuing the enemy forces at speed along the coast road, a violent rainstorm burst over the region, bogging down the tanks and support trucks in the desert mud. Montgomery, standing before his officers at headquarters and <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>tears,</b> announced that he was forced to call off the pursuit. Historian Corelli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit the breakthrough, but nevertheless the Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000 prisoners of war were taken, including the German second-in-command, General von Thoma, as well as eight other general officers. Rommel, having been in a hospital in Germany {{at the start of the}} battle, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after Stumme – his replacement as German commander – died of a heart attack in the early hours of the battle.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, Thorpe withdrew from the {{selection}} trials for the 2007 World Championships and announced his retirement on 21 November 2006. Thorpe {{said that he had}} been contemplating retirement for some time, but was afraid of the future because swimming had given him a [...] "safety blanket". Thorpe stated that he retired despite reaching higher levels of fitness, noting [...] "As I got fit, physically fit, my mind also got fit". He said a clear mind allowed him to reach his decision.

50|$|Among the {{policies}} {{that had to be}} addressed was the party's approach to European integration. Having opposed membership of the EC (EU) in 1972, and then campaigned against ratification of the Single European Act in 1986, the party had by the late 1980s grudgingly reconciled itself to Danish membership, dropping the demand for withdrawal in 1990. However when the Maastricht Treaty came up for approval by referendum in 1992 the party remained true to its roots and recommended a 'NO' vote. Holger K. Nielsen became one of the leaders in this campaign, and was later judged to have swung far more than his own socialist voters towards the NO-side, which to great surprise emerged victorious by a wafer-thin margin. The following year, however, he reversed that position, recommending acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty, supplemented with the four Danish opt-outs. This decision came <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> the party apart, with some 60% of its voters remaining opposed, but this time the yes-side prevailed.|$|R
40|$|European {{sea bass}} (Dicentrarchus labrax), an {{important}} species for the Mediterranean aquaculture industry, {{has been reported}} to escape from sea cage installations. Fish escapes are caused mainly by operational and technical failures that eventually create tears. Escapees may interact with wild stocks through interbreeding, transfer of pathogens and competition for food. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine to what extent the presence of a visible obstacle <b>close</b> <b>to</b> a <b>tear</b> in the net influences sea bass propen-sity to escape. Fish were initially confined into small sea cages, with a tear on one side. The escape behaviour was tested under experimental conditions. It is clearly demonstrated that sea bass were able <b>to</b> locate a <b>tear</b> in the net pen, immediately after its appearance. Crossings occurred in all cages, in singles or in a series of up to seven individuals. The presence of an obstacle <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the net <b>tear</b> altered the escape behaviour of D. labrax, resulting in a delay that eventually reduced the escape rate. To conclude, it is highly recommended that sea bass cages should be kept internally the culture array. Furthermore, the placement of artificia...|$|R

Tom goes on a blind date with a woman named Alison. The date does not go well as he spends it complaining about Summer until an exasperated Alison ends up taking Summer's side. Months later, Tom attends co-worker Millie's wedding and tries to avoid Summer on the train, but she spots him and invites him for coffee. They have a good time at the wedding, dance together, and Summer catches the bouquet. She invites Tom to a party at her apartment and falls asleep on Tom's shoulder on the train ride back. He attends the party hoping to rekindle their relationship but barely gets to talk to Summer and spends most of the night drinking alone, until he spots her engagement ring.

After a few days, he returns to work with a hangover and, after an emotional outburst, quits his job.

6000|$|Then I {{returned}} to Sligo {{for a few}} weeks as I was to do once or twice in every year for years, and after that we settled in London. Perhaps my mother and the other children had been there all the time, for I remember my father now and again going to London. The first house we lived in was close to Burne Jones's house at North End, but we moved after a year or two to Bedford Park. At North End we had a pear tree in the garden and plenty of pears, but the pears used to be full of maggots, and almost opposite lived a school-master called O'Neill, and when a little boy told me that the school-master's great-grandfather had been a king I did not doubt it. I was sitting against the hedge and iron railing of some villa-garden there, when I heard one boy say to another it was something wrong with my liver that gave me such a dark complexion and that I could not live more than a year. I said to myself a year is a very long time, one can do such {{a lot of things in}} a year, and put it out of my head. When my father gave me a holiday and later when I had a holiday from school I took my schooner boat to the round pond, sailing it very commonly against the two cutter yachts of an old naval officer. He would sometimes look at the ducks and say, [...] "I would like to take that fellow home for my dinner," [...] and he sang me a sailor's song about a coffin ship which left Sligo after the great famine, that made me feel very important. The servants at Sligo had told me the story. When she was moved from the berth she had lain in, an unknown dead man's body had floated up, a very evil omen; and my grandfather, who was Lloyds' agent, had condemned her, but she slipped out in the night. The pond had its own legends; and a boy who had seen a certain model steamer [...] "burned to the water's edge" [...] was greatly valued as a friend. There was a little boy I was kind to because I knew his father had done something disgraceful, though I did not know what. It was years before I discovered that his father was but the maker of certain popular statues, many of which are now in public places. I had heard my father's friends speak of him. Sometimes my sister came with me, and we would look into all the sweet shops & toy shops on our way home, especially into one opposite Holland House because there was a cutter yacht made of sugar in the window, and we drank at all the fountains. Once a stranger spoke to us and bought us sweets and came with us almost to our door. We asked him to come in and told him our father's name. He would not come in, but laughed and said, [...] "Oh, that is the painter who scrapes out every day what he painted the day before." [...] A poignant memory came upon me the other day while I was passing the drinking-fountain near Holland Park, for there I and my sister had spoken together of our longing for Sligo and our hatred of London. I know we were both very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>tears</b> and remember with wonder, for I had never known anyone that cared for such momentoes, that I longed for a sod of earth from some field I knew, something of Sligo to hold in my hand. It was some old race instinct like that of a savage, for we had been brought up to laugh at all display of emotion. Yet it was our mother, who would have thought its display a vulgarity, who kept alive that love. She would spend hours listening to stories or telling stories of the pilots and fishing people of Rosses Point, or of her own Sligo girlhood, and it was always assumed between her and us that Sligo was more beautiful than other places. I can see now that she had great depth of feeling, that she was her father's daughter. My memory of what she was like in those days has grown very dim, but I think her sense of personality, her desire of any life of her own, had disappeared in her care for us and in much anxiety about money. I always see her sewing or knitting in spectacles and wearing some plain dress. Yet ten years ago when I was in San Francisco, an old cripple came to see me who had left Sligo before her marriage; he came to tell me, he said, that my mother [...] "had been the most beautiful girl in Sligo." ...|$|E
