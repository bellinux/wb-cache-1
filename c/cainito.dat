In addition, the colloidal PdNPs has shown excellent catalytic activity for the sodium borohydride reduction of 3 - and 4 -nitrophenol also. As the colloidal PdNPs synthesized and stabilized with the leaf extract of C. <b>cainito</b> showed excellent catalytic activity for both C–C coupling and reduction reaction, it is evident that the leaf extract of C. <b>cainito</b> has played a crucial role as an excellent reducing as well as stabilizing agent to synthesize the surface active PdNPs.|$|E

The star apple or caimito tree (Chrysophyllum <b>cainito</b> L., Sapotaceae) is cultivated throughout the New World tropics for its edible fruits. We studied this species in central Panama, where it grows wild in tropical moist forests {{and is also}} commonly cultivated in backyard gardens. Using fruits collected over two harvest seasons, we tested the hypothesis that cultivated individuals of C. <b>cainito</b> show distinctive fruit and seed characteristics associated with domestication relative to wild types. We found that cultivated fruits were significantly and substantially larger and allocated more to pulp and less to exocarp than wild fruits. The pulp of cultivated fruits was less acidic; also, the pulp had lower concentrations of phenolics and higher concentrations of sugar. The seeds were larger and more numerous and were less defended with phenolics in cultivated than in wild fruits. Discriminant Analysis showed that, among the many significant differences, fruit size and sugar concentration drove {{the great majority of}} the variance distinguishing wild from cultivated classes. Variance of pulp phenolics among individuals was significantly higher among wild trees than among cultivated trees, while variance of fruit mass and seed number was significantly higher among cultivated trees.

30|$|From the DLS {{study it}} is {{revealed}} that the hydrodynamic diameters of the PdNPs were {{in the range of}} 169.24  nm when the concentration of the leaf extract was 100 mg L− 1, whereas the hydrodynamic diameters were decreased to 59.18  nm when the concentration of the leaf extract was 200 mg L− 1 due to better stabilization of the small-sized PdNPs by the leaf extract. This observation is in agreement with the better efficacy of the colloidal PdNPs synthesized and stabilized with 200 mg L− 1 C. <b>cainito</b> leaf extract than that of the colloidal PdNPs which were synthesized and stabilized with 100 mg L− 1 C. <b>cainito</b> leaf extract because literature study {{revealed that the}} smaller size PdNPs posses relatively larger surface to volume ratio which helped the better adsorption of the reactant molecules on the surfaces of the nanoparicles [5].

40|$|Abstract: Chrysophyllum <b>cainito</b> L., a {{traditional}} herbal medicine, {{could have the}} potential for management of hy-pertension due to presence of polyphenolic compounds. The extracts and fractions of the pulp of plant were evalu-ated for in vitro (inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme/ACE assay), ex vivo (isolated aorta relaxation assay) and in vivo (salt induced hypertensive rat assay). The alcoholic and aqueous extract (ALE and AQE respectively) of fruit of plant C. <b>cainito</b> was having 14. 8 and 9. 2 % yield respectively. The fractionation with ethyl alcohol (EAF) and butanol (BTF) yielded 2. 52 & 2. 17 % respectively from ALE and 0. 46 & 0. 31 % respectively from AQE with respect to fruit pulp dry weight. More phenolic content was found in ALE (3. 75 ± 0. 15 mg gallic acid equivalent or GAE g- 1 of dry power of fruit pulp) compared to AQE and maximum in ethyl acetate fraction of ALE (ALE-EAF) (2. 32 ± 0. 21 mg GAE g- 1 of dry power of fruit pulp) among all fractions. ACE inhibition activity was found to be maximum in ALE-EAF 62. 5 ± 7. 34 %.

30|$|A simple green {{chemical}} method for the one-step synthesis of palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) {{has been described}} by reducing palladium (II) chloride with the leaf extract of Chrysophyllum <b>cainito</b> in aqueous medium. The synthesis of the palladium nanoparticles completed within 2 – 3  h at room temperature, whereas on heat treatment (70 – 80  °C), the synthesis of colloidal PdNPs completed almost instantly. The stabilized PdNPs have been characterized in detail by spectroscopic, electron microscopic and light scattering measurements. The synthesized PdNPs have been utilized as a green catalyst for C–C coupling reactions under aerobic and phosphine-free conditions in aqueous medium.

The pulp and seed showed {{varying levels of}} antimicrobial activities against some clinical isolates such as Escherichia coli and species of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, Candida and Penicillium. The microbial count of the fruits ranged from 1. 0 × 109 to 2. 4 × 1010 for total aerobic plate count, 1. 0 × 107 to 2. 0 × 107 for fungal count and 1. 0 × 108 to 1. 2 × 109 for coliform count. The identities of the normal flora on the surfaces and pulp of healthy fruits and of spoilage organisms were confirmed to include species of Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas. The fungal isolates include species of Rhizopus, Aspergillus, Penicillum and Saccharomyces. The high microbial counts and their presence, portends serious health implication. Aspergillus and Penicillium species produces mycotoxins involved in mycotoxicosis of humans and animals. Staphylococcus and Bacillus species produce potent toxins implicated in food borne illnesses, while the presence of Enterococcus indicates feacal contamination. Varying concentrations of phytochemicals such as saponin, flavonoids, tannin, steroid and cardiac glycoside were detected. Vitamins such as vitamin A (0. 027 to 0. 089 mg) and vitamin C (10. 00 to 43. 54 mg) were also present.

Our data suggest that caimito was domesticated in a geographically restricted area while incorporating a diverse gene pool. These results refute the generally accepted Antillean origin of caimito, as well as alternative hypotheses that the species was domesticated independently in the two areas or over a broad geographic range including both. Human-mediated dispersal from Panama to the north and east was accompanied by strong reductions in both genotypic and phenotypic diversity.  Within Panama, cultivated and wild trees show little neutral genetic divergence, in contrast to striking phenotypic differentiation in fruit and seed traits. In addition to providing a rare example of data that support the hypothesis of a narrow geographic origin on the Isthmus of Panama for a now widespread cultivated plant species, this study is one of the first investigations of the origins of an edible species of the large pantropical family Sapotaceae...|$|E
30|$|Metal {{nanoparticles}} {{has been}} area of intense research interest {{in recent years}} because of their applications in diversified areas such as catalysis, cancer therapy, drug delivery, medicine, biotechnology, electronics, etc. [1 – 7]. Among various metal nanoparticles, the studies on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) {{have been carried out}} most extensively due to its least toxicity to animal and microorganism cells compared to the other metal nanoparticles. AuNPs have different physicochemical properties compared to the bulk solids because of its large surface to volume ratio. Depending upon their shape, size, degree of aggregation and stabilizing ligands, AuNPs exhibit different colors [8 – 11]. AuNPs are widely applied in enzyme immobilization in biosensor for the detection of virus, bacteria and pathogen and in biomedical science such as the nanobiodiagnostics and controlled drug delivery [12 – 14]. It has also been applied in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, optical sensor and in biomedical application [15]. Colloidal AuNPs stabilized with phytochemicals in aqueous medium are required for many of its applications. In a bottom-up synthetic strategy, plant and fungi extract mediated solution phase synthesis of AuNPs involving reduction of Au(III) to Au(0) has gained profound significance in recent years because of the renewable and biocompatible nature of the plant and fungi extracts, eco-friendly aqueous medium and mild reaction condition [16 – 18]. Additional advantage of this method is that the extract itself acts as a stabilizer and no additional stabilizers are required. The extracts of Aspergillus fischeri [19], Epicoccum nigrum [20], bark of Mimusops elengi [21], leaf of Chrysophyllum <b>cainito</b> (Star apple) [22], bark of Abroma augusta Linn, [23] Backhousia citriodora [24], Breynia rhamnoides [25], Piper betle [26], pear extract [27] etc. have been utilized for the synthesis of AuNPs.|$|E
