40|$|The CrossScale {{mission will}} advance our {{understanding}} of fundamental <b>plasma</b> processes in <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas.</b> It will exploit the excellent natural plasma laboratory provided by the Earth's magnetosphere and the near-Earth solar wind and, in particular, carry out multi-scale studies that will strongly complement plasma studies in ground-based laboratories. Previous studies of <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas</b> in space environments across the solar system have shown the ubiquitous nature of suprathermal particles and that these particles exhibit a power-law energy spectrum. In this paper we discuss the great significance of these suprathermal particles for CrossScale studies. We show {{that the presence of}} these particles is a natural consequence of the collisionless regime as they can propagate across the heliosphere with little spectral change and are not thermalised by collisions. They are a key indicator of the non-equilibrium nature of <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas</b> and an important source of free energy that can drive plasma processes. We discuss how these suprathermal particles influence the overall properties of the plasma. In particular, the energy distribution of particles follows a Kappa, rather than Maxwellian, distribution and thus the plasma does not have a single thermodynamic temperature. We also discuss the importance of the suprathermal tail as a tool to diagnose the processes responsible for particle energisation in <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas.</b> Such energisation is a common feature in <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas,</b> especially in terms of the primary science targets for CrossScale: reconnection, shocks and turbulence. Finally we also touch on the value of using CrossScale studies to provide ground truth measurements for a number of astrophysical techniques that exploit the effects of energetic electrons in the distant universe. Throughout the paper, we stress that suprathermal (30 keV- 1 MeV) measurements are essential to fully characterise particle distributions. We show that such measurements will benefit greatly from the improved spatial and temporal resolution (compared to Cluster) that is proposed for the HEP instrument on CrossScale.

5000|$|The {{next step}} in {{developing}} a more realistic model for current collection is to include the magnetic field effects and plasma flow effects. Assuming a <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasma,</b> electrons and ions gyrate around magnetic field lines as they travel between the poles around the Earth due to magnetic mirroring forces and gradient-curvature drift.

In addition to this theory (which has been derived for a non-flowing plasma), current collection in space occurs in a flowing plasma, which introduces another collection affect. These issues are explored in greater detail below.|$|E
40|$|In collisional fluids, {{a number}} of key {{processes}} rely on the frequency of binary collisions. Collisions seem necessary to generate a shock wave when two fluids collide fast enough, to fulfill the Rankine-Hugoniot relations, to establish an equation of state or a Maxwellian distribution. Yet, these seemingly collisional features are routinely either observed or assumed, in relation with <b>collisionless</b> astrophysical <b>plasmas.</b> This article will review our current answers to the following questions: How do colliding <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas</b> end-up generating a shock as if they were fluids? To which extent are the Rankine-Hugoniot relations fulfilled in this case? Do collisionless shocks propagate like fluid ones? Can we use an equation of state to describe <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas,</b> like MHD codes for astrophysics do? Why are Maxwellian distributions ubiquitous in Particle-In-Cell simulations of collisionless shocks? Time and length scales defining the border between the collisional and the collisionless behavior will be given when relevant. In general, when the time and length scales involved in the collisionless processes responsible for the fluid-like behavior may be neglected, the system may be treated like a fluid.

40|$|In {{the past}} {{years we have}} {{experienced}} an increasing interest in understanding of the physical properties of <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas,</b> mostly {{because of the large}} number of astrophysical environments, e. g. the intracluster medium (ICM), containing magnetic fields which are strong enough to be coupled with the ionized gas and characterized by densities sufficiently low to prevent the pressure isotropization with respect to the magnetic line direction. Under these conditions a new class of kinetic instabilities arises, such as firehose and mirror ones, which were extensively studied in the literature. Their role in the turbulence evolution and cascade process in the presence of pressure anisotropy, however, is still unclear. In this work we present the first statistical analysis of turbulence in <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas</b> using three dimensional double isothermal magnetohydrodynamical with the Chew-Goldberger-Low closure (CGL-MHD) numerical simulations. We study models with different initial conditions to account for the firehose and mirror instabilities and to obtain different turbulent regimes. We study the probability distribution functions, spectra, structure functions and anisotropy of density and velocity fluctuations. The results indicate that in some cases the instabilities significantly modifies the statistical properties of turbulence and even though preliminary and restricted to very specific conditions, show that the physical properties of turbulence in <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas,</b> as those found in the ICM, may be very different from what has been largely believed. Implications can range from interchange of energies to cosmic rays acceleration. Comment: 20 pages, 9 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} local shearing box {{simulations of}} turbulence {{driven by the}} magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasma.</b> Collisionless effects may be important in radiatively inefficient accretion flows, such as near the black hole in the Galactic Center. The MHD version of ZEUS is modified to evolve an anisotropic pressure tensor. A fluid closure approximation {{is used to calculate}} heat conduction along magnetic field lines. The anisotropic pressure tensor provides a qualitatively new mechanism for transporting angular momentum in accretion flows (in addition to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses). We estimate limits on the pressure anisotropy due to pitch angle scattering by kinetic instabilities. Such instabilities provide an effective ``collision'' rate in a <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasma</b> and lead to more MHD-like dynamics.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{evolution of}} <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas</b> is typically a multi-scale process where the energy is injected at large, fluid scales and dissipated at small, kinetic scales. Accurately modelling the global evolution requires {{to take into}} account the main micro-scale physical processes of interest. This is why comparison of different plasma models is today an imperative task aiming at understanding cross-scale processes in plasmas. We report here the first comparative study of the evolution of a magnetized shear flow, through a variety of different plasma models by using magnetohydrodynamic, Hall-MHD, two-fluid, hybrid kinetic and full kinetic codes. Kinetic relaxation effects are discussed to emphasize the need for kinetic equilibriums to study the dynamics of <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas</b> in non trivial configurations. Discrepancies between models are studied both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime of the magnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, to highlight the effects of small scale processes on the nonlinear evolution of <b>collisionless</b> <b>plasmas.</b> We illustrate how the evolution of a magnetized shear flow depends on the relative orientation of the fluid vorticity with respect to the magnetic field direction during the linear evolution when kinetic effects are taken into account. Even if we found that small scale processes differ between the different models, we show that the feedback from small, kinetic scales to large, fluid scales is negligable in the nonlinear regime. This study show that the kinetic modeling validates the use of a fluid approach at large scales, which encourages the development and use of fluid codes to study the nonlinear evolution of magnetized fluid flows, even in the colisionless regime...|$|R
