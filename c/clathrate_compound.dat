40|$|Type-I <b>clathrate</b> <b>compounds</b> have {{attracted}} {{a great deal}} of interest in connection with the search for efficient thermoelectric materials. These compounds constitute networked cages consisting of nano-scale tetrakaidecahedrons (14 hedrons) and dodecahedrons (12 hedrons), in which the group 1 or 2 elements in the periodic table are encaged as the so-called rattling guest atom. It is remarkable that, though these compounds have crystalline cubic-structure, they exhibit glass-like phonon thermal conductivity over the whole temperature range depending on the states of rattling guest atoms in the tetrakaidecahedron. In addition, these compounds show unusual glass-like specific heats and THz-frequency phonon dynamics, providing a remarkable broad peak almost identical to those observed in topologically disordered amorphous materials or structural glasses, the so-called Boson peak. An efficient thermoelectric effect is realized in compounds showing these glass-like characteristics.

Here we report the observation of diffuse magnetic neutron scattering induced by an application of magnetic field along either the [110] or the [001] direction within phase II. The broad elastic magnetic signal that surrounds the (111) structural Bragg peak can be attributed to a short-range G-type antiferromagnetic arrangement of field-induced dipoles modulated by the underlying multipolar order on the simple-cubic sublattice of Ce ions occupying the 8 c Wyckoff site. In addition, for magnetic fields applied along the [001] direction, the diffuse magnetic peaks in Ce 3 Pd 20 Si 6 become incommensurate, suggesting a more complex modulated structure of the underlying multipolar order that can be continuously tuned by a magnetic field.
