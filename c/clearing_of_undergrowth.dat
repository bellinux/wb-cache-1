5|$|After many years, {{the site}} was finally <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth</b> in the 1850s, {{revealing}} more of the castle's remains, and William Wynne, {{the owner of the}} site, carried out the first archaeological investigations. In 1949 Charles Corbett, the last private owner of the ruins, placed them into the guardianship of the state. In the 21st century the site is in the care of Cadw and is protected as a scheduled monument and maintained as a tourist attraction. In the light of Welsh devolution and other political changes, the history of Castell y Bere and similar Welsh castles has become increasingly prominent. In response, Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes.|$|R
60|$|The {{cemetery}} {{was made}} when I {{was a little}} boy of five or six; I was in the full tide of building and growth from the first; the second railway with its station at Bromstead North and the drainage followed when I was ten or eleven, and all my childish memories are of digging and wheeling, of woods invaded by building, roads gashed open and littered with iron pipes amidst a fearful smell of gas, of men peeped at and seen toiling away deep down in excavations, of hedges broken down and replaced by planks, of wheelbarrows and builders' sheds, of rivulets overtaken and swallowed up by drain-pipes. Big trees, and especially elms, <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth</b> and left standing amid such things, acquired a peculiar tattered dinginess rather in the quality of needy widow women who have seen happier days.|$|R
50|$|Until 1983 Badbury Rings was {{privately owned}} {{as part of}} the Kingston Lacy estate, and the owners {{discouraged}} investigation of the site. The site now belongs to the National Trust. A survey of the hillfort by the RCHME was begun in 1993. The summit area was <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth</b> by the National Trust in 1997 and the conifer plantation was thinned out. This allowed the RCHME to complete the survey in 1998, which recorded 28 potential hut sites within the ramparts, although some depressions are probably caused by uprooted trees. The first excavations, led by Martin Papworth, took place in 2004, when three evaluation trenches were dug. Almost all of the pottery found was dated to the Late Iron Age. The current evidence does not suggest that the hillfort was a principal settlement in the Early Iron Age. It seems likely that the hillfort became depopulated {{towards the end of the}} Late Iron Age, perhaps as the Vindocladia settlement near Shapwick developed.|$|R

5000|$|The castle was {{neglected}} in the 19th century, {{and was used}} as a fodder warehouse for local farmers. It was definitively abandoned {{at the start of the}} 20th century. Since 1968 it has been recovering its past glories owing to a team of volunteers who restore it lovingly. The main restoration work took place in the late 60's and 70's, requiring tonnes of rubble to be removed from the cellars and ground floor, and the castle grounds to be <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth.</b> Since then some buildings, including two of the towers, have been rebuilt, including adding wooden roofs to the towers and some buildings. Historical documents and 19th-century paintings showing the castle as a romantic ruin were used to guide reconstruction efforts. The 18th-century pavilion has been fully restored with roof, floors, a staircase, windows and electricity, allowing it to be used for exhibitions and cultural events. The latest renovation work concentrates on the formal gardens: only the shape of the gardens can currently be seen, with no paths or planting ...|$|R
5|$|Ian Graham {{published}} {{a plan of}} the site in 1980, based on explorations in preceding years. Further explorations have taken place {{on behalf of the}} Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala and the Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo Project. The Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo Project started work at the site in 1994 with preliminary work consisted of mapping and photographing the ruins. In 1995 the ruins were <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth</b> and in 1996 the Unidad de Arquelogía Regional de Guatemala (Guatemalan Regional Archaeology Unit) surveyed the ruins, recorded damage by looters and sank test pits, all under the direction of Vilma Fialko. From 1997 to 1998 looting damage was repaired and architecture deemed at risk of collapse was underpinned. In 1999 further underpinning work was undertaken as a result of earthquake damage and detailed plans were made of the architecture in 2000. The Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala included La Blanca in its survey of three sites in the lower Mopan valley in 2001. More recently, investigations have been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Culture together with the University of Valencia and the Polytechnic University of Valencia. Excavations continued in 2004 both in the city centre and in the South Group, where looting damage was recorded and repaired.|$|R
50|$|H. canaliculatus {{was named}} for the {{distinctive}} groove on the upper surface of the narrow, succulent leaves formed by the arching over of the leaf edges. It was collected {{for the first time}} at Betty's Bay in 1943 following a fire, but was only described after another fire by Margaret Levyns in the Journal of South African Botany in 1966. The belief has arisen that fires are necessary to stimulate flowering, but since the same species flowers regularly under cultivation, it would seem as if <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>undergrowth</b> is the important requirement.|$|R
60|$|The general {{aspect of}} the region is prepossessing. It is a rolling surface sinking towards the Atlantic, in parts broken by hills and dwarf chains, either {{detached}} or pushed out by the Ghats; a land of short and abnormally broad rivers, which cannot, like the Congo, break through the ridges flanking the Central African basin, and which therefore are mere surface drains of the main ranges. The soil is mostly sandy, but a thin coat of rich vegetable humus, quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns, produces a luxuriant vegetation; whilst the proportion of area actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush. In the tall forests, which abound in wild fruits, there are beautiful tracts <b>of</b> <b>clear</b> grassy land, and the woods, <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth,</b> resemble an English grove more than a tropical jungle. Horses, which die of the tsetse (Glossina morsitans) {{in the interior of}} North Guinea, and of damp heat at Fernando Po, thrive on its downs and savannahs. The Elais palm is rare, sufficing only for home use. The southern parts, about Cape Lopez and beyond it, resemble the Oil River country in the Biafran Bight: the land is a mass of mangrove swamps, and the climate is unfit for white men.|$|R
50|$|They are {{commonly}} found in deciduous forests in between Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Ontario and south to Kentucky, and are easily recognizable by their large, white, overlapping mandibles. The adult is 12 - 14 mm (1/2-5/8") in length, and has fairly long legs. The mandibles give these attractive insects a ferocious appearance. While tiger beetles are voracious predators of small arthropods, they do not bite humans unless handled, and their bite is such a mild pinch that it is barely noticeable. Both the common name and the species name refer to the six small white spots on the beetle's metallic-green to metallic-blue-green elytra. This {{is not always the}} case, however, as some individuals may have more spots, fewer spots, or none at all, presumably due to genetic variation. This species is associated with wooded areas and they are often found in sunlit patches <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth</b> such as dirt paths and fallen logs where they hunt caterpillars, ants, spiders, and many other kinds of arthropods. Although tiger beetles are not gregarious, many beetles may sometimes be seen in one suitable hunting area. The female lays her eggs in sandy patches, and the larvae burrow into the ground after they hatch. Here they lie in wait until small arthropods pass by, at which time the larvae lunge out of their burrows at their prey like jack-in-the-boxes. The beetles develop as larvae for about one year before pupating, and the insect has a total lifespan of just under 5 years.|$|R
6000|$|The path led {{through a}} new clearing; a field of fern and some patches of grass {{breaking}} the forest, which, almost <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> thicket and <b>undergrowth,</b> was a charming place for deer. The soil, thin sand overlying humus, suggested rich crops of ground-nuts; its surface was everywhere cut by nullahs, now dry, and by brooks, running crystal streams; these, when deep, are crossed by tree-trunks, the Brazilian [...] "pingela."

6000|$|Early {{next morning}} we started after breakfast, {{carrying}} blankets and provisions, as we intended to sleep upon the mountain. After passing a little tangled jungle and swampy thickets through which our men had cleared a path, we emerged into a fine lofty forest pretty <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth,</b> and in which we could walk freely. We ascended steadily up a moderate slope for several miles, having a deep ravine on our left. We then had a level plateau or shoulder to cross, after which the ascent was steeper and the forest denser until we came out upon the [...] "Padang-batu," [...] or stone field, a place of which we had heard much, but could never get anyone to describe intelligibly. We {{found it to be}} a steep slope of even rock, extending along the mountain side farther than we could see. Parts of it were quite bare, but where it was cracked and fissured there grew a most luxuriant vegetation, among which the pitcher plants were the most remarkable. These wonderful plants never seem to succeed well in our hot-houses, and are there seen to little advantage. Here they grew up into half climbing shrubs, their curious pitchers of various sizes and forms hanging abundantly from their leaves, and continually exciting our admiration by their size and beauty. A few coniferae of the genus Dacrydium here first appeared, and in the thickets just above the rocky surface we walked through groves of those splendid ferns Dipteris Horsfieldii and Matonia pectinata, which bear large spreading palmate fronds on slender stems six or eight feet high. The Matonia is the tallest and most elegant, and is known only from this mountain, and neither of them is yet introduced into our hot-houses.|$|R
5000|$|Lescudjack Hill fort is {{the name}} given to the unexcavated Iron Age {{settlement}} located in Penzance, Cornwall. The name might originate from the Cornish words lan (enclosure) and scosek (shielded)- shielded enclosure or, more likely, [...] "nans" [...] (valley) and [...] "cosek" [...] (wooded); however, compare: [...] "lesky" [...] (to burn), [...] "cunnys" [...] (fuel) and [...] "ack" [...] (a place where found), since [...] "LESKInnick" [...] terrace is just below {{on the west side}} of the hill; therefore it could mean a [...] "beacon place". It is positioned on the summit of a steep hill in the east of Penzance and consists of a single rampart enclosing an area of 3 acre. The site has been damaged and contains allotments and an open area of land which has recently been <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> thick <b>undergrowth.</b> It is reported that a small lead-copper mine was situated [...] "just outside" [...] the ramparts, however all trace of this appears to have vanished.|$|R
50|$|Wolseley was {{appointed}} on 13 August 1873 {{and went to}} the Gold Coast to make his plans before the arrival of his troops in January 1874. On 27 September 1873 a team of Royal Engineers landed at Cape Coast Castle. Their job was to expand the single file track that led to Coomassie, 160 mi away into a road that was suitable for troop movements. At the end of each day's march, roughly every 10 mi a fortified camp would be built with 70 ft long huts inside a stockade in an area that had been <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> trees and <b>undergrowth</b> to provide some protection against hostile natives.|$|R
60|$|After a ride {{which seemed}} {{a long one}} to the ladies, who wished they had attired {{themselves}} in walking-costume, {{the road and the}} forest suddenly came to an end, and before them stretched out the waters of a small lake. Camp Rob was not far from the head of the lake, and for some distance above and below the forest stood back from the water's edge. In the shade of a great oak tree there stood a small log-house, rude enough to look at, but moderately comfortable within, and from this house to the shore a wide space was <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> bushes and <b>undergrowth.</b>|$|R

Out in the boat sat Mr. Archibald, trusting that some fish might approach the surface in search of insects disabled by the rain.

5000|$|In 1934-35 a {{significant}} advance {{was made with}} around 25 acres (10 hectares) of the reserve on the lower slopes <b>of</b> Mt Islay <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>undergrowth</b> and planted with young trees. The mayor of Cairns advised that the reserve would be planted with [...] "permanent trees which are noteworthy for their ornamentation and their regularity of design, planted at pre-determined distances, {{so that they will}} provide permanent avenues of great beauty." [...] Trees and shrubs of a less [...] "permanent" [...] nature were to be removed and relocated {{to other parts of the}} reserve allowing for the development of avenues lined with pine, acacia, palms, Poinciana and others. This project continued until 1940 when part of the recreation reserve (suburban section 74, north of the council nursery) was converted to a Quarry Reserve for war purposes and part of the 1930s gardens work was destroyed by quarrying. It appears that oil palms, poincianas, hoop pines, two rubber trees, a Dillenia, a Schizolobium, an Indian mango, a Wongi plum, a Terminalia and a Malay Apple were planted during this period by Les Wright.|$|R

With a good horse and provisions he could yet escape his enemies, and the man looked scarcely human as he stood watching the sleeper with a sullen glow in his eyes.|$|R
40|$|Structural and Ecological Characteristics of Commercial Timber species' population: a Basis for Silviculture in Niaouli Forest Stands (Southern Benin). This {{study was}} carried out to provide {{silvicultural}} guidance in the Niaouli forest (6 ° 43 '- 6 ° 44 'N and 2 ° 07 '- 2 ° 08 'E), Southern Benin, based on commercial species. Twenty-three 0. 25 ha plots (50 m x 50 m) were set to characterize the structure and the ecology of these species' populations. Within each plot of 0. 25 ha, three 100 m² sub-plots (10 m × 10 m) were set {{for the assessment of}} regeneration. A multidimensional scaling was performed with SPSS 16. 0 on presence-absence data of species, and led to the identification of four forest stands. Overall, the number of species and their abundance in the stands were linked to the presence of water. Diameter structure and regeneration revealed that the populations of the studied species were not at equilibrium. The silvicultural interventions suggested to equilibrate them were as follows: enrichment of the forest stands with the studied species; removal <b>of</b> liana and <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>undergrowth</b> to enable the germination of seeds and the growth of the seedlings of commercial species, and the protection of the forest from illegal logging by improving security...|$|R
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas <b>of</b> <b>clear</b> <b>undergrowth</b> or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|R
40|$|Cicadas use {{acoustic}} {{signals to}} find mates and therefore offer a phylogenetically independent opportunity {{to test the}} generality of ideas about acoustic communication that were developed from studies of other animals. Pycna semiclara (Germar, 1834) (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) is a forest-dwelling platypleurine cicada that uses its calling song to form choruses and attract mates. Additionally, P. semiclara produces an encounter call that is involved in courtship and also in spacing males within choruses. Males generally call from exposed trunks and branches within the understory but <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> the <b>undergrowth</b> and fight with other males that call within about 50 cm of them. Choruses sing sporadically throughout the day but focus most of their calling activity into half-hour bouts at dawn and dusk. Body size and ambient temperature had no significant effect on spectral or temporal characteristics of the calling song. Body temperature measurements indicate that P. semiclara thermoregulates endothermically, with a body temperature of more than 22 °C above ambient temperature being measured during calling activity at dusk. Such endothermy provides an advantage to the cicadas {{by allowing them to}} call during crepuscular hours when atmospheric conditions are most optimal for acoustic communication and predation risks are minimal. Coincidentally, endogenously regulating body temperature allows the temporal characteristics of the call to be unaffected by ambient temperature changes...|$|R
50|$|Several graves {{have been}} {{identified}} at {{the southwest corner of}} the site, near the road frontage. This area has been <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> saplings and <b>undergrowth,</b> leaving naturally re-vegetated eucalypts and grasses. The remainder of the block is open woodland of principally casuarina, wattle and grass tree. There has been a high level of disturbance of the reserve through frequent fires and later grazing, which may account for the high proportion of more resilient casuarina and wattle {{at the expense of other}} indigenous species such as eucalypts and bloodwood. While there are no old-growth trees on the reserve, the original mix of species survives, and there is a particularly high diversity of indigenous flora, including one species of wildflower found only within the reserve. The vegetation mix is similar to that in the nearby Serpentine Creek Conservation Park, and, with so much of Redland Bay's indigenous vegetation lost to farming and encroaching residential development, remains important to the genetic exchange among plant species.|$|R
40|$|The {{forests of}} the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) in the southeastern part of Bangladesh occupy about 30 % of the nation’s total forest area and {{represent}} the most valuable watersheds in the country. Their importance lies not only in providing {{soil and water conservation}} for sustainable natural resources management {{in this part of the}} country but also in supporting the shifting cultivation subsistence farming of 13 forest-dwelling indigenous communities. Traditionally, the communities practice a farming method called jhum, which involves cultivation of food crops in forest land through <b>clearing</b> and burning <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth</b> in the dry season, usually leaving a fallow period (3 - 15 years) between successive crops on the same piece of land. However, over the last two centuries land use in the area has undergone tremendous change, including the <b>clear</b> felling <b>of</b> forest trees to make way for establishment of mostly monoculture plantations of valuable timber species such as teak (Tectona grandis), fruit trees, and other economically important cash crops. Due to land scarcity and almost yearly flood havoc in other parts of the country, people have been migrating to the CHTs. Population explosion has necessitated an expansion and intensification of agricultural activities in the hilly landscape, which together with deforestation, is causing serious degradation of the watersheds.

60|$|In a {{few moments}} we had passed out of the {{singular}} oasis that had so marvelously escaped the desolation of battle, and now the evidences of the previous day's struggle were present in profusion. The ground was tolerably level here, the forest less dense, mostly <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>undergrowth,</b> and occasionally opening out into small natural meadows. Here and there were small pools--mere discs of rainwater with a tinge of blood. Riven and torn with cannon-shot, the trunks of the trees protruded bunches of splinters like hands, the fingers above the wound interlacing with those below. Large branches had been lopped, and hung their green heads to the ground, or swung critically in their netting of vines, as in a hammock. Many had been cut clean off and their masses of foliage seriously impeded {{the progress of the}} troops. The bark of these trees, from the root upward to a height of ten or twenty feet, was so thickly pierced with bullets and grape that one could not have laid a hand on it without covering several punctures. None had escaped. How the human body survives a storm like this must be {{explained by the fact that}} it is exposed to it but {{a few moments}} at a time, whereas these grand old trees had had no one to take their places, from the rising to the going down of the sun. Angular bits of iron, concavo-convex, sticking in the sides of muddy depressions, showed where shells had exploded in their furrows. Knapsacks, canteens, haversacks distended with soaken and swollen biscuits, gaping to disgorge, blankets beaten into the soil by the rain, rifles with bent barrels or splintered stocks, waist-belts, hats and the omnipresent sardine-box--all the wretched debris of the battle still littered the spongy earth as far as one could see, in every direction. Dead horses were everywhere; a few disabled caissons, or limbers, reclining on one elbow, as it were; ammunition wagons standing disconsolate behind four or six sprawling mules. Men? There were men enough; all dead, apparently, except one, who lay near where I had halted my platoon to await the slower movement of the line--a Federal sergeant, variously hurt, who had been a fine giant in his time. He lay face upward, taking in his breath in convulsive, rattling snorts, and blowing it out in sputters of froth which crawled creamily down his cheeks, piling itself alongside his neck and ears. A bullet had clipped a groove in his skull, above the temple; from this the brain protruded in bosses, dropping off in flakes and strings. I had not previously known one could get on, even in this unsatisfactory fashion, with so little brain. One of my men, whom I knew for a womanish fellow, asked if he should put his bayonet through him. Inexpressibly shocked by the cold-blooded proposal, I told him I thought not; it was unusual, and too many were looking.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, {{and indeed}} for over 25 years, St Mary's churchyard has bordered on utter dereliction. It is a closed graveyard, with the {{apparently}} empty spaces {{to the south}} of the graveyard harbouring the final resting places of numerous paupers whose names are recorded in the Church Register but whose remains were interred without coffins or visible memorials, beyond the unevenness of the overgrown ground above them. The condition of the churchyard-—as a place that feels unsafe to some, whose memorials have become inaccessible to many, their inscriptions overgrown with ivy, headstones broken, unstable or unreachable through the surrounding undergrowth—-is recognised as a reproach to all who know the place.

It is intended it should become a safer place, a more attractive place and a place of education for visitors of all ages. To this end there has been a marked increase in voluntary work in the graveyard while local community leaders have voted neighbourhood renewal funds that they hope will be matched by other regional agencies to implement a plan drawn up by the City Council's Landscape Practice Group to end years of neglect and bring about a rejuvenation similar to the great improvements they have funded in the neighbouring park between 2000 and 2006.|$|R
