50|$|A line-clipping method {{consists}} of various parts. Tests are conducted {{on a given}} line segment {{to find out whether}} it lies outside the view volume. Afterwards, intersection calculations are carried out with one or more <b>clipping</b> <b>boundaries.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{one example}} application, {{consider}} an image editing program. A user application may render the image into a viewport. As the user zooms and scrolls {{to view a}} smaller portion of the image, the application can set a <b>clip</b> <b>boundary</b> so that pixels outside the viewport are not rendered. In addition, GUI widgets, overlays, and other windows or frames may obscure some pixels from the original image. In this sense, the clip region is the composite of the application-defined [...] "user clip" [...] and the [...] "device clip" [...] enforced by the system's software and hardware implementation. [...] Application software {{can take advantage of}} this clip information to save computation time, energy, and memory, avoiding work related to pixels that aren't visible.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{extended}} {{formulation of}} the “continuous mode” voltage waveform equation is presented for RF power amplifiers. This leads to the complete determination of a new design tool termed the “second harmonic clipping contour”. This tool allows the designer to quantify {{the effect of a}} non ideal fundamental load impedance on the Class B/J second harmonic matching conditions. This tool is shown to enable the designer to work more effectively with complex wide band matching networks that avoid areas of the smith chart which will cause clipping of the current waveform and hence, undesirable nonlinear behavior. Complex waveform analysis is shown displaying the predicted current waveform clipping when the second harmonic impedance violates the <b>clipping</b> contour <b>boundary...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vector tiles, tiled vectors or vectiles are {{packets of}} {{geographic}} data, packaged into pre-defined roughly-square shaped [...] "tiles" [...] for transfer over the web. This is an emerging method for delivering styled web maps, combining certain benefits of pre-rendered raster map tiles with vector map data. As with the widely used raster tiled web maps, map data is requested by a client {{as a set}} of [...] "tiles" [...] corresponding to square areas of land of a pre-defined size and location. Unlike raster tiled web maps, however, the server returns vector map data, which has been <b>clipped</b> to the <b>boundaries</b> of each tile, instead of a pre-rendered map image.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a point-based method for animating {{incompressible}} flow. The advection term is handled by moving the sample points through the flow in a Lagrangian fashion. However, unlike most previous approaches, the pressure term is handled by performing a projection onto a divergence-free field. To perform the pressure projection, we compute a Voronoi diagram with the sample points as input. Borrowing from Finite Volume Methods, we then invoke the divergence theorem and ensure that each Voronoi cell is divergence free. To handle complex boundary conditions, Voronoi cells are <b>clipped</b> against obstacle <b>boundaries</b> and free surfaces. The method is stable, flexible and combines many of the desirable features of point-based and grid-based methods. We demonstrate our approach on several examples of splashing and streaming liquid and swirling smoke...|$|R
40|$|The {{data are}} {{organized}} {{as a set}} of ESRI shapefiles (*. shp, *. shx, *. dbf, *. prj files) mapping the distribution ranges of the main European tree and shrub species. For each species and in some cases subspecies, one or more shapefiles have been created containing: a) polygon features (name suffix “plg”), which define continuous areas of occupancy of the species range and b) point features (name suffix “pnt”), which identify more fragmented and isolated populations. For species with reported synanthropic occurrences outside the natural range, an additional point and/or polygon shapefile has also been created (suffix “syn”). The polygon borders delimiting the range have been generalized across the mainland and sea <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Clipping</b> to a specific coastline has been avoided, as this can vary considerably in its geometry depending on scale and precision of the respective source. This offers the possibility to mask sea areas, or to clip and extract the species’ terrestrial range parts using GIS data layers of the users’ choice. Finally, an accompanying text document is included with the data, which provides more details on methodology and a list of all mapped species with related file names, taxonomical delimitation of the mapped species and references used to compile the respective chorological dataset...|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} of volume ray casting {{can be derived}} directly from the rendering equation. It provides results of very high quality, usually considered {{to provide the best}} image quality. Volume ray casting is classified as image based volume rendering technique, as the computation emanates from the output image, not the input volume data {{as is the case with}} object based techniques. In this technique, a ray is generated for each desired image pixel. Using a simple camera model, the ray starts at the center of projection of the camera (usually the eye point) and passes through the image pixel on the imaginary image plane floating in between the camera and the volume to be rendered. The ray is <b>clipped</b> by the <b>boundaries</b> of the volume in order to save time. Then the ray is sampled at regular or adaptive intervals throughout the volume. The data is interpolated at each sample point, the transfer function applied to form an RGBA sample, the sample is composited onto the accumulated RGBA of the ray, and the process repeated until the ray exits the volume. The RGBA color is converted to an RGB color and deposited in the corresponding image pixel. The process is repeated for every pixel on the screen to form the completed image.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Several 3 D {{rendering}} {{techniques have}} been developed in which part of the final image {{is the result of}} rendering from a virtual camera whose position in the scene differs from that of the primary camera. In these situations, there is usually a planar surface, such as the reflecting plane of a mirror, that can be considered the physical boundary of the recursively rendered image. In order to avoid artifacts that can arise when rendered geometry penetrates the boundary plane {{from the perspective of the}} virtual camera, an additional clipping plane must be added to the standard six-sided view frustum. However, many 3 D graphics processors cannot support an extra clipping plane natively, or require that vertex and fragment shaders be augmented to explicitly perform the additional clipping operation. This paper discusses a technique that modifies the projection matrix in such a way that the conventional near plane of the view frustum is repositioned to serve as the generally oblique <b>boundary</b> <b>clipping</b> plane. Doing so avoids the performance penalty and burden of developing multiple shaders associated with user-defined clipping planes by keeping the total number of clipping planes at six. The near plane is moved without affecting the four side planes, but the conventional far plane is inescapably destroyed. We analyze the effect on the far plane as well as the related impact on depth buffer precision and present a method for constructing the optimal oblique view frustum. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we review}} {{some of the}} {{theoretical}} solutions used to describe swirl dominated flows in both unidirectional and bidirectional flow orientations. This short survey starts with the Rankine vortex and culminates in the presentation of an essentially viscous solution of the bidirectional vortex. After classifying representative swirl motions as external or internal depending on physical boundary conditions, their commonalities are identified along with their relevance to either geophysical or industrial applications. For example, all swirl dominated flows comprise a forced vortex core centered about their axis of rotation. The core is due to viscous forces and increases in size with successive increases in viscosity. It is delineated by {{the point where the}} swirl velocity reaches its maximum. Within the forced vortex core, the tangential velocity is linearly proportional to the radius, a characteristic of rigid body rotation. Outside the forced vortex core, the tangential velocity gradually becomes inversely proportional to the radius, thus exhibiting a free vortex tail. In internal flows, this free, irrotational tail is <b>clipped</b> at the <b>boundaries</b> in fulfillment of the no slip requirement. In external flows, it extends out to infinity. Finally, all swirl dominated flows decay axially and their vorticity is confined to either the core vortex or wall boundary layers. These will be described {{in the context of the}} bidirectional vortex confined in a cylindrical chamber. What is most prevalent here, and perhaps, what sets the analysis of the bidirectional vortex apart lies in its formal prediction of essential flow attributes directl...|$|R
40|$|Context: Bar overdentures {{are popular}} choices among clinicians {{worldwide}} but configurations that provide an optimal biomechanical distribution of stress are still debatable. Aims: To compare the stresses and elastic flexion between implant supported bar overdentures in various configurations using finite element analysis. Settings and Design: A CAT scan {{of a human}} mandible was used to generate an anatomically accurate mechanical model. Materials and Methods: Three models with bars and clips in three different configurations were constructed. Model 1 had a single bar connecting two implants, Model 2 had three bars connecting all the four implants, and Model 3 had two bars connecting the medial and distal implants on the sides only. The models were loaded under static conditions with 100 N load distributed at the approximate position of the <b>clip.</b> The mandibular <b>boundary</b> conditions were modeled considering the real geometry of its muscle supporting system. Maximum von Mises stress {{at the level of}} the bar and at the bone implant interface were compared in all three models. The flexion of mandible and the bar was also compared qualitatively. Statistical Analysis Used: The analyses were accomplished using the ANSYS software program and were processed by a personal computer. Stress on these models was analyzed after loading conditions. Results: Qualitative comparisons showed that stress {{at the level of the}} bar and at the bone implant interface were in the following order: Model 1 > Model 3 > Model 2. The flexion of the mandible and the bar were in the following order: Model 2 > Model 1 > Model 3. Conclusions: Four implant bar systems connected by bars on the sides only is a better choice than two implant bar systems and four implant bar systems with bars connecting all four implants...|$|R
