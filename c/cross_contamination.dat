5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid <b>cross</b> <b>contamination.</b> For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E

40|$|The {{bacterium}} Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, intracellular, ubiquitous, and facultative food-borne pathogen {{of humans}} and animals. They may occur naturally in environmental sources such as soils, faeces and intestinal tracts of animals and humans. The pathogen causes listeriosis characterized by gastroenteritis, meningitis, abortion, and sometimes death in systemic cases. Neonates, infants, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and the elderly in particular are most susceptible to listeria infections. In recent times, contamination of foods by L. monocytogenes {{has become a major}} concern to all stake holders in the food industry and the health sector. Their infection has been associated with a number of food-borne outbreaks resulting from the consumption of various foods especially, cooked and chilled ready-to-eat foods.

An association of anorexia nervosa with celiac disease has been found. The role that gastrointestinal symptoms play {{in the development of}} eating disorders seems rather complex. Some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis may create a food aversion in these persons, causing alterations to their eating patterns. Other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk. It has been documented that some people with celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease who are not conscious about the importance of strictly following their diet, choose to consume their trigger foods to promote weight loss. On the other hand, individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety, food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around <b>cross</b> <b>contamination</b> of their foods. Some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder, especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom (such as [...] decreased appetite, abdominal pain, bloating, distension, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation), weight loss, or growth failure; and also routinely ask celiac patients about [...] weight or body shape concerns, dieting or vomiting for weight control, to evaluate the possible presence of eating disorders, especially in women.|$|E
2500|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} {{is one of}} {{the premier}} gamefish of the Indo-Pacific region, although is often overshadowed by its larger cousin, the giant trevally. The fish makes long powerful runs on light tackle, and is a determined fighter. The species readily accepts both bait and lures, with live fish or squid often used as bait and a variety of lures also used on the species. Lures may include poppers, plugs, spoons, jigs, soft plastic lures and even saltwater flies. The species inshore habits make it a popular target for spearfishermen also. In Hawaii the species has bag and size limit restrictions in place to prevent further overexploitation. It {{is considered to be a}} good to excellent food fish, however many cases of ciguatera poisoning have been attributed to the bluefin trevally. Laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of the toxin in the species flesh, with fish greater than 50cm likely to be a carrier. The risk of poisoning has also affected the sales of the fish in the marketplace in recent years. [...] Also of concern is one report of infection by a dracunculoid parasite while preparing the fish for eating. In this case, the parasite invaded the victim's body by entering an open wound while he was filleting the species, and is believed to be one of the first records for such <b>cross</b> <b>contamination.</b> The bluefin trevally has been successfully kept in large saltwater aquaria, but require large water volumes to adapt well.|$|E

5000|$|It was not {{realized}} {{at the time}} that nearly all attempts to establish human cell cultures resulted in cell lines with limited life spans. Dr. George Gey, the originator of HeLa, had sent his cells to all who requested them, and this problem arose because many workers were growing the immortal HeLa cell and mortal human cell strains in the same lab. Since the use of genetic markers to characterize and distinguish cell lines at the time was virtually non-existent, contamination by HeLa went undetected. In spite of the evidence, initially, the idea of laboratory errors leading to <b>cross</b> culture <b>contamination</b> was not universally accepted: an alternative explanation was that, when cultures became established, their G6PD phenotype changed. [...] Gartler's original paper to Nature went to lengths to dismiss this possibility, surveying over 100 tumors {{to see if there was}} a phenotypic change in either G6PD or PGM, as well as trying other experimental approaches to test the idea. He concluded that [...] "all evidence seems to point to the stability of the G6PD and PGM phenotypes both in vivo and in vitro." [...] Further evidence against the possiblity came when Nellie Auesperg and Gartler found a truly independently established human cell line, which demonstrated unique genetic markers. <b>Cross</b> culture <b>contamination</b> is now a generally accepted risk, and there are many genetic markers available to accurately characterize human cell cultures.

The maximal pH of 6. 0 - 7. 0 and the inhibition by fluoride, Ca 2 + and detergents were similar for both adult and fetal. Phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity was located in both mitochondria and microsomes.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of the tongue handling practice on the contamination of the pork carcasses: the tongue removed with the pluck set (3 slaughterhouses) vs the intact tongue inside the head (3 slaughterhouses). A total of 1920 pigs from 120 different farms were sampled both on their tonsils and carcass surfaces over a one year period. The individual prevalence of Y. enterocolitica on tonsils and carcasses was unexpectedly low and estimated respectively to be 5. 7 % [4. 7 - 6. 9] and 0. 6 % [0. 3 - 1. 0] from the pooled samples. The presence of Y. enterocolitica on the carcasses was statistically linked to its presence on tonsils. It was nearly five times higher on pigs with positive tonsils, than on pigs with negative tonsils. Despite the experimental design, we were not able to confirm that the removal of the tongue on the slaughter line had a significant impact on the carcass contamination with Yersinia enterocolitica.

The participants agreed that, from the scientific angle, no fat from ruminants should be fed to ruminants in future. Only when suitable methods and systems in production and marketing can guarantee that feed for cattle, sheep and goats does not contain any fat from their own species and thus <b>cross</b> <b>contaminations</b> can be ruled out, could feed with fat from other species be fed again to ruminants. In the opinion of BfR and FLI the currently available slaughter techniques are not able to extract ruminant fats without any nerve tissue and are not, therefore, definitely free of BSE. In the run-up to the closed meeting other changes relating to safety measures for the protection of consumers from BSE were discussed. This prompted BfR and FLI to reaffirm their position on the protection measures in place. Both institutes reject a loosening of the protection measures after determining BSE in the slaughterhouse.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the Pulsed Light technology (PL) for its efficiency {{to reduce the}} microbial loads on mung bean sprouts and endive salad during a simulated wash process for up to 60 s. The microbicidal action of PL {{proved to be more}} efficient than the sanitizers electrolyzed water (40 ppm free chlorine) and chlorine dioxide (15 ppm) within the same treatment time. Reductions of the microbial count up to 2. 5 log were found in case of PL treated endive salad while both sanitizers only caused maximum reductions by about 1. 5 log. A combination of PL and sanitizers did not have pronounced additional effect for both endive salad and mung bean sprouts. Overall, the decontamination treatments were more effective in case of endive salad compared to mung bean sprouts. It was also shown that the microbial loads in the washing water may be kept on a low level during PL treatments as count reductions of approx. 3 log were found in relation to simply washing in tap water. This study reveals that PL may be a suitable approach to reduce microbial hazards of industrially manufactured fresh produce.
