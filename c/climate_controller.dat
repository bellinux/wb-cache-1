In Part I, we introduce the test facility and develop relevant building models.

We formulate the reserve scheduler as a robust optimization problem and introduce several approximations to reduce its complexity.

40|$|The subject {{discussed}} in this thesis is the dosing of droplets in the femto (10 - 15) liter range. In this study, droplets were dispensed using a hollow cantilever atomic force microscope (AFM). Dispensing small volumes finds its applications in for example in single cell manipulation, where a drug is delivered inside a single cell to study {{the reaction of the}} cell to the drug. The working principle of an AFM can be compared with a vinyl player: a small needle is scanning a surface, which can be used for imaging with atomic resolution. For controlled dispensing of small droplets the needle and the cantilever were made hollow and a commercially available AFM system was adapted for fluidic applications. The hollow cantilever AFM chip is connected by tubing to a syringe which acts as fluidic reservoir. Small droplets of water will evaporate almost immediately; to increase the “lifetime” of the droplet a <b>climate</b> <b>controller</b> was added to increase the humidity. Therefore the influence of the <b>climate</b> <b>controller</b> on the AFM system was studied. With the described system droplets in the femto liter range were dispensed on a surface, however controlled dispensing remained a challenge. Therefore this research investigates the parameters influencing the droplet size and how these parameters can be controlled to dispense a desired volume. Two different ways of dispensing are experimentally investigated: just by touching the substrate and using the surface forces to pull liquid from the cantilever onto the substrate and by applying pressure to the liquid reservoir. For dispensing by surface forces, parameters such as surface energy and contact time are investigated to deliver a desired volume. A trend was observed that with increasing contact time an increase in volume is dispensed. For dispensing with additional pressure, a correlation was found between the time of applied pressure and dispensed volume. Dispensing of droplets of around 0. 4 ? with a variation of 0. 05 ? has been shown.

The {{main purpose of}} the project has been to develop a physical model of the climate in construction vehicles that later on {{can be used in}} the development of an electronic <b>climate</b> <b>controller.</b> The focus of the work has been on one type of wheel loader and one type of excavator. The temperature inside the compartment has been set equal to the notion climate. With physical theories about air flow and heat transfer in respect, relations between the components in the climate unit and the compartment has been calculated. Parameters that has had unknown values has been estimated. The relations have then been implemented in the modeling tool Simulink. The validation of the model has been carried out by comparison between measured data and modeled values by calculation of Root Mean Square and correlation. Varying the estimated parameters and identifying the change in the output signal, i. e the temperature of the compartment, have performed a sensitivity analysis. The result of the validation has shown that the factor with the greatest influence on the temperature in the vehicle is the airflow through the climate unit and the outlets. Minor changes of airflow have resulted in major changes in temperature. The validation principally shows that the model gives a good estimation of the temperature in the compartment. The static values of the model differs from the values of the measured data but is regarded being as within an acceptable margin of error. The weakness of the model is mainly its predictions of the dynamics, which does not correlate satisfyingly with the data...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{glasshouse}} <b>climate</b> <b>controllers</b> {{are based}} upon continuous-time PI controllers manually tuned to achieve adequate, although rather poor, tracking of set point changes. In this paper we consider the alternative, model based, Proportional-Integral-Plus (PIP) control system design (Young et al, 1987) which, although only slightly more complex than a PI controller, achieves much tighter control of the climate variables, allowing optimal setpoints (Chalabi, 1992) to be realised. A linear control model is identified and estimated from experimental data collected in a Venlo glasshouse at Silsoe Research Institute (SRI). A Non Minimum State Space (NMSS) representation of this control model is then used to design a robust PIP controller which was implemented during the 1993 / 94 winter growing season with a tomato crop. Control results were excellent with very tight control to the desired setpoints in all three variables.

The objective {{of this research is}} to conduct a spatial-temporal analysis of Uchoa Mill Woods through the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (UAI) and the surface temperature, emphasizing the importance of this forest fragment as primarily responsible for promoting a less thermal sensation.

40|$|It {{is known}} {{that there can be}} a {{significant}} temperature difference between the position of the <b>climate</b> <b>controller</b> sensor (room temperature) and the animal-occupied zone (AOZ) in a pig room. This study explores the advantages of using AOZ temperature in climate control. The objectives were: (1) to evaluate a current climate control system in a practical room with ground channel ventilation for weaned piglets by comparing AOZ and room temperature, and (2) to determine advantages of control of the heating system based on AOZ temperature by a model-based predictive (MBP) controller. Comparison of AOZ and room temperature showed that during the first 10 days of the two experimental batches, AOZ temperature was lower and showed greater fluctuations than room temperature, most likely due to the switching of the heating system (on/off). Animals close to the sensor could disturb the AOZ measurement. This was not the case during colder nights, when animals moved away from the sensor and the measured AOZ temperature was a good indicator of the air temperature around the animals. The data for those periods were suitable for use in this climate control study, but when applying the system in practice the disturbing effect needs to be prevented by better protection of the AOZ sensor. For the second objective, the course of the AOZ temperature was modeled based on data for five nights when the heating switched on and off several times (goodness of fit Rt 2 = 0. 77). One of the models was integrated in a simulated MBP controller that uses the model to predict future AOZ temperature; the controller switches the heating system on before the AOZ gets too cold and off before it gets too warm.

40|$|As mankind {{is passing}} time in {{enclosures}} (offices, meeting rooms, hospitals, vehicles, passenger airplanes, ships,….) {{and also in}} agricultural and industrial applications (livestock houses, incubation process, baking and malting processes,…) {{it has been more}} and more mandatory to improve and control indoor environments in the described enclosures in order to guarantee comfort, health and product quality with the minimum use of energy. However fulfilling the task of providing these requirements remains a great challenge because in all these ventilated structures there is an imperfectly mixed 3 D fluid. This means that there are 3 D spatial gradients and time variations of micro-environmental variables. In this doctoral thesis this issue is addressed. Thereby the overall goal is to gain more insight in the behaviour of micro-environment within the imperfectly mixed fluid in a ventilated space. A well known parameter that is used for long in the literature and in engineering of climate control and analysis is ‘the local mean age of air’. This parameter is defined as the time that incoming air particles need on average to reach a specific point within a ventilated room. The Data Based Mechanistic (DBM) model approach which is based on the Well Mixed Zone concept, has a physically meaningful parameter called the local mean fresh air flow concentration, β [m 3 /s. m 3]. This parameter shows the number of fresh air changes a WMZ receives per second. By using analytical analyses and experimental data, it is claimed in literature that this β parameter is an inverse of the local mean age of air. A first problem however is that the system excitation which is introduced by the inlet conditions during dynamic experiments was not always sufficient enough to supply the necessary informative 3 D dynamic data. Another problem is {{that it is impossible to}} measure accurately in experiments at finely spaced sensor locations the energy and mass transfer through 3 D well mixed zones with time varying shapes, dimensions and positions inside a ventilated room. The first objective of this thesis is to gain insight into this relation between the local mean age of air and the β parameter. In previous researchescharacterisation of the behaviour of shapes and volumes of well mixed zones were not studied sufficiently. Therefore the second objective is to analyse the behaviour of these 3 D well mixed temperature zones with respect to shape and volume inside a transient ventilation system. The third objective is to combine a complex and a low order modelling approach in order to supplement each other so that <b>climate</b> <b>controller</b> development can be integrated into the design of systems. In order to fulfil the first two objectives and to cope with the limitation of experiments in supplying the required informative data, dynamic mass and heat transfer numerical simulations were performed. The conclusion of the research shows that the inverse relation between the β parameter and the local mean age of air is justified by an average deviation of 6 % for the studied 36 monitoring positions. It was also possible by using the numerically simulated data to quantify the volumes, shapes and thermal interaction between neighbouring well mixed temperature zones. Moreover it is shown that the shapes and volumes of the transient well mixed zones are a function of position and acceptable temperature difference, i. e., process dependency. It was shown that to define a well mixed zone in an accurate way, beside an acceptable gradient as used by others, also the value of the considered variable (e. g. temperature) in a specific monitoring position must be taken into account. It was also highlighted that the results of the analysis have a positive impact in room partition procedures which is crucial in zonal modelling practices. Finally a methodology of using the results of numerical simulations in combination with low order data based models for temperature controller design purposes was developed. This might have important practical implications when experimental data are scarce or not available at all. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Since May 2010, the {{directive}} 2010 / 31 /EU of the European Parliament compels its Member States to drastically decrease the energy use of buildings, {{to increase their}} energy efficiency and to increase the relative amount of renewable energy they use. One of the technologies recommended by {{the directive}} is the heat pump which efficiently uses electricity to extract thermal energy from a heat or cold source. In this work, buildings equipped with the particularly efficient hybrid GEOTABS system are considered, consisting of a {{ground source heat pump}} (GSHP) coupled to a thermally activated building structure (TABS) system and optionally extended with a gas boiler, radiators or other auxiliary systems. The main objective of this research is to improve the thermal comfort and the energy efficiency of large hybrid GEOTABS buildings by applying model predictive control (MPC) and to improve their economic viability by optimizing the size of the GSHP and of the auxiliary systems as well as the type of the auxiliary systems to install. To this end, Building Energy Simulation (BES) models of an existing office building, a school, a retirement home and a block of flats were created using and extending the open-source Modelica library IDEAS to represent a wide set of hybrid GEOTABS buildings. The models include the building envelope, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, the occupancy and a default rule-based building <b>climate</b> <b>controller</b> (RBC). Additionally, a method to linearise the building envelope of the developed Modelica models was developed in order to obtain highly accurate controller models for MPC. The method automatically precomputes the non-linear equations which do not depend on the model states and linearises the other equations. The obtained controller models are then used by a toolchain which semi-automatically generates a linear MPC and tests its control performance on a full year simulation of the developed BES models. Finally, a python tool was created to optimize the economic viability and CO 2 emissions of hybrid GEOTABS systems. As main results, it was found that hybrid GEOTABS systems were capable of providing very high thermal comfort in all investigated buildings when controlled by MPC, showing that hybrid GEOTABS systems are suitable {{for a wide range of}} buildings when appropriate control is used. The developed MPCs could further save between 30 to 50 % of the energy cost compared to standard RBC controllers while significantly improving thermal comfort when both the thermal powers to the TABS and the auxiliary emission system and the ventilation supply temperature were optimized simultaneously. However, current practice RBC were found not to always be able to provide the required comfort when, for example, the building was not equipped with a fast reacting system such as an air handling unit with heating and cooling coils to complement the TABS or when parts of the building with significantly different thermal needs were coupled to the same production system. Furthermore, the lack of correlation between the optimal control actions computed by MPC and the past or future ambient temperature indicates that the optimal behaviour achieved by MPC cannot be mimicked by RBC based on heating/cooling curves. Finally, the economic optimization and CO 2 emissions analysis of HVAC designs showed that GEOTABS systems without auxiliary production and emission systems are in general 1. 0 to 1. 8 times more expensive than conventional systems composed of a condensing gas boiler, a compression cooling machine and fan coil units but that properly sized hybrid GEOTABS systems (thus including an auxiliary production and emission system) have in general a lower present cost (PC) over the 20 years life time of the building while they emit between 20 % to more than 50 % less CO 2 than conventional systems. Hybrid GEOTABS systems are thus very advantageous both economically and for the environment and it is advised to always consider their installation for large buildings. This work significantly contributed to the fields of building simulation and optimal control by developing new models and tools such as a novel borefield model, contributing to the development of the open-source libraries IDEAS and Annex 60, and creating a highly automated method to generate accurate linear building models for MPC. Furthermore, the MPCs developed in this work achieved between 30 to 50 % energy cost savings and significant thermal comfort increase compared to current practice rule-based-controllers which goes beyond the typical 15 to 25 % cost savings found in the literature. This work also helped the industry forward by designing a tool to help design engineers to choose and optimally size the most appropriate HVAC system for a given building. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{to discharge}} excess heat and vapour from the greenhouse environment has serious drawbacks. Pests and diseases {{find their way}} through the openings; carbon dioxide fertilisation becomes inefficient and the inescapable coupling of heat and vapour release results often in sub-optimal conditions for either temperature or humidity. The present trend, therefore, is to reduce ventilation as much as possible, also in Mediterranean conditions. This relies obviously on improved means for diminishing the heat load and proper use of cooling equipment. Especially the latter can combine the benefits of cooling the greenhouse air with serious energy conservation. However, opposite to the clear benefits there are also serious investments associated with active cooling of greenhouse. Therefore, there is a growing demand for some computational tool that enables quantitive comparisons between the vast number of alternatives with respect to the different components of (semi) closed greenhouse systems. The benefits in terms of improved production (quality, ornamental value and quantity) are quite difficult to quantify, due to the complexity of the biological processes involved. On the energy side of the balance, however, since the physics of greenhouses, <b>climate</b> <b>controllers</b> and horticultural hardware can be described very well, it is quite possible to develop such a tool for predicting the energy consumption of a (semi) closed greenhouse {{for a wide range of}} horticultural and outside climate conditions.

40|$|Simulations in the authors’ {{previous}} {{studies have shown that}} a modified temperature integration regime with a 6 -day averaging period and increased set-point flexibility was able to reduce annual energy consumption by up to 9 % as compared to a regular temperature integration regime. The commonly applied fixed set-point for relative humidity (RH) of 80 – 85 % strongly reduced the potential for energy saving with this regime. Therefore, a more flexible humidity control regime was developed. Simulations indicated that yearly energy consumption could be reduced by 18 % as compared to a fixed set-point of 80 % RH. By combining the two regimes (temperature integration and humidity control), it was predicted that the energy saving would be even greater. To test this prediction, the combined regimes were applied in two experiments with cut-flower chrysanthemum crops investigating the effect on plant development and growth. Different temperature bandwidths for temperature integration (± 2, ± 4, ± 6 and ± 8 °C) were also compared within the joint regime. Crop development was only delayed with the ± 8 °C temperature bandwidth. The best regime with respect to plant development, growth, quality and energy saving (± 6 °C temperature bandwidth) was compared in a spring experiment with a climate regime used in commercial practice. Energy consumption was 23. 5 % less with the joint regime. No negative consequences of high humidity were observed, but there was a strong increase in the dry weight of all plant organs. Total plant dry weight was 39 % higher than in the regular regime. It can be concluded that energy saving and crop yield increase can be achieved simultaneously, although the dynamic temperature control has to be adjusted to the chrysanthemum developmental stage. The combined dynamic climate regime forms a promising basis for future <b>climate</b> <b>controllers</b> and is easily extendable to other greenhouse crops...|$|R

Demand Response (DR) is an important element in the emerging smart grid paradigm and is paving way for the more sophisticated implementation of Energy Hub Management Systems (EHMSs). Utilities are looking at Demand Side Management (DSM) and DR services that allow customers to make informed decisions regarding their energy consumption which in return, can help the energy providers to reduce their peak demand and hence enhance grid sustainability. Ice rinks are large commercial buildings which facilitate various activities such as hockey, figure skating, curling, recreational skating, public arenas, auditoriums and coliseums. These have a complex energy system; in which an enormous sheet of ice is maintained at a low temperature {{while at the same time}} the spectator stands are heated to ensure comfortable conditions for the spectators. Since indoor ice rinks account for a significant share of the commercial sector and are in operation for more than 8 months a year, their contribution in the total demand cannot be ignored. There is significant scope for energy savings in indoor ice rinks through optimal operation of their climate control systems. In this work, a mathematical model of indoor ice rinks for the implementation of EHMS is developed. The model incorporates weather forecast, electricity price information and end-user preferences as inputs and the objective is to shift the operation of climate control devices to the low electricity price periods, satisfying their operational constraints while having minimum impact on spectator comfort. The inside temperature and humidity dynamics of the spectator area are modeled to reduce total electrical energy costs while capturing the effect of climate control systems including radiant heating system, ventilation system and dehumidification system. Two different pricing schemes, Real Time Pricing (RTP) and Time-of-Use (TOU), are used to assess the model, and the resulting energy costs savings are compared. The expected energy cost savings are evaluated for a 8 month period of operation of the rink incorporating the uncertainties in electricity price, weather conditions and spectator schedules through Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|Several space-based climate {{engineering}} methods, including shading the Earth with a particle ring for active cooling, {{or the use}} of orbital reflectors to increase the total insolation of Mars for climate warming have been considered to modify planetary <b>climates</b> in a <b>controller</b> manner. In this study, solar reflectors on polar orbits are proposed to intervene in the Earth's climate system, involving near circular polar orbits normal to the ecliptic plane of the Earth. Similarly, a family of displaced polar orbits (non-Keplerian orbits) are also characterized to mitigate future natural climate variability, producing a modest global temperature increase, again to compensate for possible future cooling. These include deposition of aerosols in the stratosphere from large volcanic events. The two-body problem is considered, taking into account the effects of solar radiation pressure and the Earth's J 2 oblateness perturbation...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{high demand}} for aesthetically {{pleasing}} urban landscapes from continually increasing population in Florida, new methods must be explored for outdoor water conservation. Three brands of evapotranspiration (ET) controllers were {{selected based on}} positive water savings results in arid <b>climates.</b> ET <b>controllers</b> were evaluated on irrigation application compared to a time clock schedule intended to mimic homeowner irrigation schedules. Three ET controllers were tested: Toro Intelli-sense; ETwater Smart Controller 100; Weathermatic SL 1600. Other time-based treatments were TIME, based on the historical net irrigation requirement and RTIME that was 60 % of TIME. Each treatment was replicated four times {{for a total of}} twenty St. Augustinegrass plots which were irrigated through individual irrigation systems. Treatments were compared {{to each other and to}} a time-based schedule without rain sensor (TIME WORS) derived from TIME. The study period, August 2006 through November 2007, was dry compared to 30 -year historical average rainfall. The ET controllers averaged 43 % water savings compared to a time-based treatment without a rain sensor and were about twice as effective and reducing irrigation compared to a rain sensor alone. There were no differences in turfgrass quality across all treatments over the 15 -month study. The controllers adjusted their irrigation schedules to the climatic demand effectively, with maximum savings of 60 % during the winter 2006 - 2007 period and minimum savings of 9 % during spring 2007 due to persistent dry conditions. RTIME had similar savings to the ET controllers compared to TIME WORS indicating that proper adjustment of time clocks could result in substantial irrigation savings. However, the ET controllers would offer consistent savings once programmed properly. Drought Turfgrass Water conservation...|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in pervasive communication, sensing and computing of {{wireless sensor networks}} technologies are leading {{to the emergence of}} wireless sensor-actor networks. The spreading merit of WSAN has led to in-creasing interest in rendering them with expert knowledge to be smart and autonomous networks, which have the potential to enable a large class of applications in multiple fields. Fusion of artificial intelligent with wire-less sensor actor networks (WSAN) is emerging as a new generation of smart autonomous WSAN. Primarily two most important greenhouse climate parameters are considered which are the temperature and humidity during diurnal and nocturnal time. Actuator and sensor nodes has been managed by cognitive wireless sen-sor-actor network based greenhouse (CWSAN-GH) Coordinator node (MGHSN) which mimics the brain of the laborer to provide reliable, power conserving, autonomous control system of a greenhouse <b>climate.</b> Fuzzy logic <b>controller</b> enables engineers to control more complex systems more effectively than the conventional control methods which are not efficient in terms of energy, labor interference, productivity and flexibility. This paper presents the fusion of artificial intelligence represented by FIS with WSAN for greenhouse climate control. Also the long life operation of network nodes based on the low power consumption is presented. Smart algo-rithm of the network sensor nodes, which contributes of reducing the power consumption, is addressed in detail. Initial field test for the CWSAN-GH is presented too.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of energy demand and {{consequently}} growth in supply, increasing energy costs, and environmental concerns, there is a critical need {{to find new ways to}} make better use of existing energy systems and resources and decelerate the demand growth towards a sustainable energy system. All of these facts are leading to the proposal of novel approaches to optimize the utilization of energy in different sectors to reduce the customer's total energy costs, demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while taking into account the end-user preferences. Utilities have implemented Demand Side Management (DSM) and Demand Response (DR) programs to better manage their network, offer better services to their customers, handle the increase in electricity demand, and at the same time increase system reliability and reduce environmental impacts. Smart Grid developments such as information technology, communication infrastructure and smart meters improve the effectiveness and capability of Energy Management Systems (EMSs) and facilitate the development of automated operational decision-making structures for energy systems, thus assisting DSM and DR programs to reach their full potential. The literature review indicates that whereas significant work has been done in DSM and DR in utilities, these works have mostly focused on direct load control of particular loads, and there is a lack of a general framework to consider all types of energy hubs in an integrated Energy Hub Management System (EHMS). In this context, mathematical modeling of energy systems for EMSs, which is the main concern of the present work, plays a critical role. This research proposes mathematical optimization models of energy hubs which can be readily incorporated into EHMS in the context of Smart Grids. The energy hub could be a single or multi-carrier energy system in residential, commercial, agricultural and/or industrial sectors. Therefore, mathematical models for energy hubs in residential, commercial, and agricultural sectors have been developed and are presented and discussed in this thesis. In the residential sector, this research presents mathematical optimization models of residential energy hubs which can be readily incorporated into automated decision making technologies in Smart Grids, and can be solved efficiently in a real-time frame to optimally control all major residential energy loads, storage and production components while properly considering the customer preferences and comfort levels. Mathematical models for major household demand, i. e., fridge, freezer, dishwasher, washer and dryer, stove, water heater, hot tub, and pool pumps, are formulated. Also, mathematical models of other components of a residential energy system including lighting, heating, and air-conditioning are developed, and generic models for solar PV panels and energy storage/generation devices are proposed. The developed mathematical models result in a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problem, whose objective is to minimize demand, total costs of electricity and gas, emissions and peak load over the scheduling horizon while considering end-user preferences. The application of this model to a real household are shown to result in savings of up to 20 % on energy costs and 50 % on peak demand, while maintaining the household owner's desired comfort levels. In the commercial sector, mathematical optimization models of produce storage facilities to optimize the operation of their energy systems are proposed. In the storage facilities, climate control of the storage rooms consumes considerable energy; thus, a mathematical model of storage facilities appropriate for their optimal operation is developed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing <b>climate</b> <b>controllers.</b> The proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing climate control systems in storage facilities. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of storage facilities; in particular, inside temperature and humidity should be kept within acceptable ranges. Effects of uncertainty in electricity price and weather forecast on optimal operation of the storage facilities are studied via Monte-Carlo simulations. The presented simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints. In the agricultural sector, this work presents mathematical optimization models of greenhouses to optimize the operation of their energy systems. In greenhouses, artificial lighting, CO 2 production, and climate control consume considerable energy; thus, a mathematical model of greenhouses appropriate for their optimal operation is developed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing greenhouse controllers. The proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing control systems in greenhouses. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of greenhouses; in particular, inside temperature and humidity, CO 2 concentration, and lighting levels should be kept within acceptable ranges. Effects of uncertainty in electricity price and weather forecast on optimal operation of the storage facilities are studied via Monte-Carlo simulations and robust optimization approach.

40|$|Night setback is {{a common}} {{strategy}} used to reduce energy use in buildings. It involves increasing the cooling setpoint and decreasing the heating setpoint in a zone during unoccupied periods. To ensure occupant comfort and maximize energy savings, the zone temperature must {{be returned to the}} range defined by the occupied cooling and heating setpoints at occupancy, but not before. The time required to cool down or warm up a zone from a night setback condition {{is referred to as the}} return time and algorithms for predicting return time are commonly referred to as optimal start algorithms. Optimal start algorithms generally employ a model for predicting return time. This study describes the selection of separate return time models for cooling (i. e., a model for predicting the return time when cooling is required) and heating from 57 candidates. The following model forms were considered: Ï„ = f (Tf - Ti), Ï„ = f ((Tf - Ti), u), Ï„ = f ((Tf - Ti), Tout), and Ï„ = f ((Tf - Ti), u,Â Tout) where Ï„ is the return time, Tf is the zone temperature at the end of the optimal start period, Ti is the zone temperature at the beginning of the optimal start period, u is exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of the zone cooling or heating demand at the beginning of the optimal start period, and Tout is the outdoor air temperature at the beginning of the optimal start period. Computer simulations were used to generate year-long data sets relating return time to the model inputs. The simulations considered the influence of <b>climate,</b> building mass, <b>controller</b> tuning, zone orientation, and the unoccupied control strategy on the return time. In all, 140 cooling data sets and 104 heating data sets were generated. For each data set, least squares regression was performed to determine the parameters for each of the 57 models considered. The performance of each model was quantified using the average root mean square prediction error across all simulations. The study revealed that the best models for predicting return time use the zone temperature change and the EWMA of the zone cooling or heating demand as inputs. The EWMA of the zone cooling or heating demand provides an indication of the recent history of the cooling or heating load on a zone and can account for intermittent cooling or heating that is required to keep the zone temperature within the bounds of the unoccupied setpoints. Notably, outdoor air temperature, a common input in optimal start algorithms, is not used. Â To the best of the authors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge,Â zone cooling and heating demand have not been previously used as an input in an optimal start algorithm. The full paper will provide a detailed description of the simulations and model comparison undertaken in this study...|$|R
