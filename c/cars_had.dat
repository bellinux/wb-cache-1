5|$|LMP2, GT1, and GT2 class <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> to {{be fitted}} with 5% smaller air restrictors {{than they had}} run in 2006, in order to {{decrease}} power.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, {{and were}} delivered unpainted to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of the cars in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot in an attempt to clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely with giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> been built. The failure was {{due in part to}} the price tag of $9695, an extraordinary amount of money for the time. The Continental thereafter became a successful car model under Ford's Lincoln brand.|$|E
25|$|The {{first digit}} {{identifies}} the car number, where the trailer <b>cars</b> <b>has</b> a 3, {{the second and}} fifth <b>cars</b> <b>has</b> a 1 & the middle <b>cars</b> <b>has</b> a 2.|$|R

5|$|Over the years, {{at least}} two fatal {{accidents}} have occurred on the portion of NY210 that runs alongside Greenwood Lake. On July15, 1940, a Brooklyn couple was killed when their car struck a stone ledge near the lake. Two others were injured in the accident. On December1, 1968, three were killed and one person was injured when two <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> a head-on collision {{just north of the}} New Jersey state line.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. It retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives and 1,190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s and 1950s. No new sleeping <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> been built for service in the United States since 1955.|$|E
5|$|Between 2:00am and 3:00am on Sunday morning, July 22, {{the peace}} was again broken and fire alarms began to ring {{throughout}} the city. To the west, at the Mount Clare Shops of the B, a 37-car train of coal and oil {{had been set}} on fire. Police, firefighters, and thousands of citizens flocked to the scene. A contingent of 50 marines was dispatched to the area to provide assistance. The cars which had not yet caught fire were detached from those burning, {{and by the time}} the flames were extinguished between seven and nine <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> been burned. Between $11,000 and $12,000 in damage was sustained.|$|E
5000|$|Electric and nitro <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> come a {{long way}} in terms of power. Electric <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> gone from non-rebuildable brushed motors and NiCad {{batteries}} to brushless motors and LiPo. Nitro <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> gone from small engines to huge [...]36-.80 engines that are used in big monster trucks.|$|R
2500|$|Weakening (W) {{allows the}} {{addition}} of arbitrary elements to a sequence. [...] Intuitively, this is allowed in the antecedent because we can always restrict the scope of our proof (if all <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> wheels, then it's {{safe to say that}} all black <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> wheels); and in the succedent because we can always allow for alternative conclusions (if all <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> wheels, then it's safe to say that all <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> either wheels or wings).|$|R
3000|$|... 6 Other {{requirements}} included, for example, {{that the}} <b>car</b> holder <b>had</b> to {{be a private}} person, that the old <b>car</b> <b>had</b> to be destroyed, and that the new <b>car</b> <b>had</b> to meet a specific emission standard.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, {{at about}} 11:00 am, 16 tanks, 2 armored {{personnel}} carriers and 30 <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> been sent from the Officer School of Armored and Mechanized Formations, a Poznań garrison, to protect the designated buildings, but no shots were exchanged {{between them and the}} insurgents. These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed. Then the Soviet General Konstantin Rokossovsky, the Minister of National Defense, who was then in command of all armed forces in Poland, decided to take personal control, and the situation changed dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona died {{without ever}} having {{returned}} to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on the pretext of insufficient funds in the colonial coffers. The exiled queen died suddenly at her villa in Algeria on May 23, 1917, {{the victim of a}} severe embolism. Ranavalona was buried at the Saint-Eugene cemetery in Algiers at 10:00a.m. on May 25. Her funeral was attended by dozens of personal friends, admirers, Red Cross colleagues, members of her church congregation and prominent figures of the political and cultural elite of Algiers. By nine in the morning, a long line of <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> already formed {{at the entrance to the}} memorial site.|$|E
5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
50|$|The KuMoHa 719 <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> one PS16 lozenge-type pantograph. Sets H10 to H18 have single-arm pantographs. The KuHa 718 <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> a toilet.|$|R

5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E
5|$|In {{that race}} at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 to {{first place in}} the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One Race of Champions against many {{established}} Formula Three drivers such as Roger Williamson, Jochen Mass and James Hunt. So large was Pryce's advantage {{at the end of the}} race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during practice for the support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix his car came to a stop at Casino Square after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a shop window and broke a leg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bräck set the fastest {{time of the}} day with a lap of 31:676 seconds, ahead of Junqueira and Tracy. Tagliani was fourth-fastest; Memo Gidley was fifth and Shinji Nakano sixth. Carpentier, Bryan Herta, Takagi and da Matta followed in the top ten. The session was temporarily stopped when a track inspection was required after Fernández's right-rear tire blew, and Jourdain's engine failed after exiting turn four. Bräck was fastest in the third practice session with a lap of 31.219 seconds; Papis was second and da Matta third. Kanaan was fourth-fastest, ahead of Tracy and Junqueira. Christian Fittipaldi was seventh-fastest, Herta eighth, Tagliani ninth and Gidley completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. A track inspection stopped the session for eight minutes after several teams reported that their <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> sustained cut tires.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} stock consists of 149 high-floor, bi-directional, single-articulated cars, each 28 metres (92 feet) long. The <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> four doors {{on each side}} and each train is normally composed of two cars coupled together. A third <b>car</b> <b>has</b> been added on the busiest routes since 2010. Each <b>car</b> <b>has</b> 70 seats and has a total capacity of 284 passengers.|$|R
50|$|The two M1 <b>cars</b> each <b>have</b> two single-arm pantographs, and the M1' <b>car</b> <b>has</b> one.|$|R
50|$|Another {{mechanical}} {{difference between}} the two types of car is that the 'D' end <b>car</b> <b>has</b> a spring-loaded buffer at the driving cab end whereas the 'A' end <b>car</b> <b>has</b> a solid buffer.|$|R
5|$|Serial {{production}} {{started in}} 1964, with the bodies built at Strømmens Værksted, the motors built by NEBB and the electrical equipment by AEG. By 1978, 162 <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> been delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, named T1 through T4, with varying specifications. T1 was manufactured in 90 units from 1964 to 1966 {{for the opening}} of the Grorud Line and the conversion of the Lambertseter Line. The first 30 have driver's cabs in both directions (designated T1-2), while the latter 60 have it in only one end (designated T1-1). In 1967, 15 T2s were built for the conversion of the Østensjø Line. Although given a new designation, they are in all ways identical to the T1-1s. From 1969 to 1972, 30 T3s were built for the Furuset Line. Further expansions of the lines resulted in 37 T4s being built from 1976 to 1978. The T1000s are numbered 1001–1162.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of {{qualifying}} started problematically, as the red {{light at the end}} of the pitlane, indicating that <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> to stop, was still on when the clock began to run. A marshal with a green flag then indicated the drivers to take to the track. During the session, Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, but a mistake by Nico Rosberg meant that Vettel was able to place second. Daniil Kvyat was the first driver to be eliminated, lining up behind the two McLaren drivers, with debutant Vandoorne out-qualifying his teammate Button. Nico Hülkenberg was the only driver to go out to improve his time, managing to proceed into Q3 in eighth place, leaving Grosjean, Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr. behind.|$|E
5|$|Three works XJ220-Cs {{were entered}} in the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans race, in the newly created Grand Touring Class. John Nielsen, David Brabham and David Coulthard won the GT class, beating Porsche by two laps; the other two cars retired, both through engine failure. However, the class win was revoked when the Jaguar XJ220-C was {{controversially}} disqualified for failing to run with catalytic converters. The Jaguars had passed scrutiny and completed {{the first day of}} qualifying when senior steward Alain Bertaut complained that Jaguar were not running catalytic converters. The <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> been entered under the IMSA GT category and Bertaut claimed that they needed to run with catalysts. The cars ran in the race under appeal.|$|E

5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{purchased}} the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, {{then president of}} Disney, {{saw it as a}} perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used <b>Cars)</b> <b>had</b> been box office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.|$|E
5|$|With the Empire Builder in operation, Amtrak began re-equipping the {{remaining}} long-distance trains in the west. The second permanent Superliner train was the Desert Wind, then a day train between Los Angeles and Ogden, Utah, which gained coaches on June 30, 1980. The San Francisco Zephyr, a long-distance train {{on the traditional}} Overland Route between Chicago and San Francisco, followed on July 7, 1980; it received {{the first of the}} Sightseer lounges on January 6, 1981. Amtrak assigned Superliners to another long-distance train, the Los Angeles–Chicago Southwest Limited, in October 1980. The Southwest Limited, formerly the Super Chief, traveled the same route as the El Capitan, whose Hi-Level <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> inspired the design. The management of the Santa Fe, impressed by the design, permitted Amtrak to restore the name Chief to the train, and Amtrak renamed it the Southwest Chief on October 28, 1984. The Chief was the first train to receive Superliner II sleeping cars in September 1993.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} got under way, Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari {{remained}} motionless {{on the spot}} and only started after all other <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> passed the Finn. Meanwhile, Hamilton got through the first chicane in front of Vettel, but his teammate Rosberg had to avoid Räikkönen's car and lost two places to the two Williams of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Both Lotus drivers were forced to retire {{before the end of}} the second lap, Grosjean due to contact with another car, while Maldonado damaged his chassis when he went over a kerb. While Räikkönen charged through the field to get back up to twelfth place by lap three, Lewis Hamilton quickly increased his advantage over Vettel and moved out of the one-second DRS window. Nico Rosberg was unable to pass Bottas on track and was told by his team to cool his brakes. Further back, the Red Bull sponsored cars moved up the order as well, with Carlos Sainz Jr., Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat fighting for tenth position. Sainz yielded his place on lap 11, when he needed to go into the pit lane for a five-second penalty handed to him for cutting the chicane at the start. By lap 14, Hamilton led Vettel by over eight seconds, with Rosberg still behind both Williams in fifth place, pushing Bottas by enabling DRS on the long straights. Behind the German were the two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg.|$|E

The <b>car</b> <b>has</b> a brake operated energy recovery system, developed from the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (RESS) technology developed for Formula E cars.|$|R
2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. We decide {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a <b>car</b> <b>having</b> a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|R
