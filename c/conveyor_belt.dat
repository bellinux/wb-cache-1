5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> attached to the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> is sharp due {{to higher}} density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of {{stratiform}} precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> also referred to as the warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> originated in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The two establishments were {{constructed}} in South East Northumberland {{as part of}} an incentive to lower the high unemployment numbers. The site was also chosen because of the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries. Ellington Colliery sunk in 1909, with Lynemouth Colliery sinking 18 years later. However, in 1968, the two collieries were connected underground by the Bewick Drift, from which coal was brought to the surface. The Drift had no rail connection, and so coal was sent to the washery at Lynemouth by <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> The power station was constructed nearby the end of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E

5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> to move the cargo. The first bulkers with diesel propulsion {{began to appear in}} 1911.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E
5|$|The Perfect Storm {{originated}} from a cold front that exited {{the east coast}} of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened {{as a result of the}} temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States. It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years. Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{currents}} only {{affect the}} top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, {{but there are}} also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} ice houses made it {{difficult}} to load ice into them; in 1827 Wyeth invented a lever and horse-drawn pulley system to raise blocks of ice through the roofs of the warehouses. Later improvements to loading included the use of lift systems to raise the blocks of ice {{to the top of the}} building, first using horse power, then steam power; the largest warehouses later introduced <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> systems to bring the ice into storage. Power houses containing the equipment to support these were built alongside the ice houses, and care was taken to avoid the risk of fire from this machinery. Warehouses were typically painted either white or yellow in order to reflect the sun during the summer. A typical Hudson River warehouse might be 400 feet (120 m) long, 100 feet (30 m) deep and three stories high, able to hold 50,000 tons (four million kg) of ice. The later railroad ice houses could hold up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) apiece.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E
