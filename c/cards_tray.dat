Shell collections sometimes suffer from Byne's disease which also affects birds eggs.The study of dry mollusc shells is called conchology as distinct from malacology (wet specimens).|$|R

50|$|The game of Canasta was {{devised by}} Segundo Santos and Alberto Serrato in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1939. In the 1940s the game quickly spread in myriad {{variations}} to Chile, Peru, Brazil and Argentina, where its rules were further refined before {{being introduced to}} the United States in 1948, where it was then {{referred to as the}} Argentine Rummy game by Ottilie H. Reilly in 1949 and Michael Scully of Coronet magazine in 1953. The game quickly became a card-craze boom in the 1950s providing a sales avalanche of <b>card</b> sets, <b>card</b> <b>trays</b> and books about the subject.|$|R

50|$|The {{board is}} a 6x6 grid with grooves in the tiles to allow cars to slide, <b>card</b> <b>tray</b> {{to hold the}} cards, current active card holder and an exit hole. The game comes with 16 {{vehicles}} (12 cars, 4 trucks) which each are colored differently and 40 puzzle cards. Additionally the cars take up 2 squares each and the trucks take up 3 squares each. Also all vehicles can only be moved within a straight line along the grid and they cannot be rotated. Lastly, the puzzle card shows which colored cars and trucks get placed {{on the board and}} where they should be placed. In addition to that, each card has a different level number. The higher the level number, the more difficult the challenge is.|$|R

40|$|Computational {{steering}} is {{the ultimate}} goal of interactive simulation. Steering enables users to supervise and dynamically control the computation of an ongoing simulation. We describe CSE : a modular architecture for a computational steering environment. The kernel of the architecture is designed to be very simple, flexible and minimalistic. All higher level system functionality is pushed into modular components outside of the kernel, resulting in a rich and powerful environment. For these modular components (called satellites) a uniform user interface metaphor for users, based on a <b>tray</b> of <b>cards,</b> has been used. The <b>card</b> <b>tray</b> metaphor is very simple to understand and provides users with a simple mechanism to organize and retrieve the tools. Several applications of the environment are shown.

50|$|The {{device is}} {{slightly}} smaller than its predecessor, the OnePlus 2. It's 2.5mm thinner, 0.9mm shorter, and 0.2mm narrower, but {{still has the}} same screen size, at 5.5in (139.7mm) across diagonally. The display is still 1920×1080 px, {{comparable to that of}} the previous two models, but the 3 is the first flagship OnePlus to have an optic AMOLED display. As is typical for most smartphones, the OnePlus 3 features Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection.The OnePlus 3 is also the first OnePlus phone to ship with only 64 GB of storage available, as all other OnePlus devices have shipped with a 16 GB option also. The onboard storage is UFS 2.0, but there is no option for memory expansion via an SD card. The OnePlus 3 does include a dual-sim <b>card</b> <b>tray,</b> but fails to have compatibility with LTE band 13, making LTE unavailable to Verizon customers in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|Many names, {{some of them}} trademarked, {{have been}} used for {{marginal}} punched-card systems:edge-notched cards, slotted cards, E-Z Sort, Zatocards, McBee, McBee Keysort, Flexisort, Velom, Rocket, etc.The center of each card held the relevant information—typically the name and author of a book, research paper, or journal article on a nearby shelf; and a list of subjects and keywords.Some sets of cards contained all the information required by the user on the card itself, handwritten, typewritten, or on microfilm (aperture card).Every card in a stack had the same set of pre-punched holes.The user would find the particular cards relevant to a search by aligning the holes in the set of cards (using a card holder or <b>card</b> <b>tray),</b> inserting one or more knitting-needle-like rods {{all the way through the}} stack, so the desired cards (which had been notched or cut open) fell out from the irrelevant cards in the collection (left un-notched), which remain on the needle(s).A user could repeat this selection many times to form a complex Boolean searching query.A card that was relevant to 2 or more subjects would have the slot(s) for each of those subjects cut out, so that card would drop out when either one or the other or both subjects was selected [...]The [...] "superimposed code" [...] coding systems, such as Zatocoding, saved space by entering several or all subjects in the same field; such a [...] "superimposed code" [...] stores much more information in less space, but at the cost of occasional [...] "false" [...] selections.|$|R

50|$|When {{a book is}} reserved, {{somebody}} {{needs to}} check the catalog, and, if the book {{is not on the}} shelf, look for the relevant <b>card</b> in the <b>trays.</b> This involves manually looking for the card with the matching 'key' in the trays, sequentially looking in each date until found. A reserved item is flagged with a piece of colored card, so that when it is returned it can be set aside and checked against the file of reservations.|$|R

5000|$|Due to a {{mastering}} error, {{the tracks}} {{printed on the}} cover copy for the CD differ somewhat from the tracks actually included on the album. Two songs were listed on the <b>tray</b> <b>card</b> that are not included on the album: [...] "Crackin' Up", by The Wig (which was included on both the original LP {{as well as the}} BFD reissue) and [...] "I Need Love" [...] by The Third Booth (which was to have been a bonus track).

50|$|The {{original}} 1993 USA release as Elektra 61545-2 had {{the songs}} {{on the back of}} the <b>tray</b> <b>card</b> listed incorrectly. One can notice that there is no track number 8 listed. The listing order goes from track 7 to track 9. The glitch had gone unnoticed when it went into print. Although all the songs are listed there, it would give the impression that there are 12 tracks on the CD instead of eleven. The discrepancy would then be noticed when the CD was being played because the playback readout would truly show its 11 tracks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game has}} five [...] "worlds" [...] with twenty levels each, and beating each level allows the dragons that the player {{possesses}} {{to grow into}} a new, more advanced form. To beat each level, the player must play a puzzle minigame in which they organize <b>cards</b> on two <b>trays.</b> While the <b>cards</b> are initially icons of various creatures and objects, the game uses them to abstractly demonstrate mathematical equations before later replacing them with variables and numbers. The player gets bonus stars if they complete the level in as few moves as possible, and with as few cards left as possible.|$|R
