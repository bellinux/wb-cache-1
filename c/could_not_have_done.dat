5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} {{what is going}} on with Michael. They both see it as a coping mechanism, and both insist that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} further uncovered {{that before}} joining the Navy, Warnke had {{been involved with the}} college Christian ministry Campus Crusade for Christ. The investigation also revealed the unflattering circumstances surrounding Warnke's multiple marriages, affairs, and divorces. Most critically, however, the investigation showed how Warnke <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the many things he claimed to have taken part in throughout the nine months he claimed to be a Satanist - including his claims to be a drug-addicted dealer or a Satanic high priest.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better.|$|E

500|$|After {{talks with}} an {{organisation}} in Paris, which later {{turned out to}} be French multinational oil company Total, Bernaudeau set his sights on another company, a banking group, and at best, rated his team's chances of survival as [...] "6 out of 10". Voeckler was equally pessimistic about the team's chances of survival, having stated that the team <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> any better, than they had in 2010. Voeckler had also received offers from rival French squads [...] and [...] about joining their respective teams, if in the worst-case scenario that [...] folded.

He marveled {{at the way the}} Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, and said this nation was witnessing 'another example of economy of effort...in the conquest of this country for communism.' He added, 'One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other.'

500|$|The Scottish {{legal system}} was {{effectively}} suspended after the English occupation. All courts that derived from [...] "Charles Stuart", including Sheriff's Courts were suspended. Kirk sessions, however, continued to meet largely unhindered, neither sanctioned nor recognised by the Commonwealth. The legal {{functions of the}} Privy Council and Court of Session were taken over by seven commissioners, four Englishmen and three Scots. These proved more impartial than previous judges, probably {{because they were not}} tied to the major families and political factions by patronage and kinship. Local barony courts and heritable jurisdictions, in abeyance from 1651, were officially abolished in 1657. Sheriff's courts were re-established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656. The result was a small flood of witchcraft cases, with 102 between 1657–59, which compares with over 600 after the Scottish courts were fully re-established after 1660. Generally the regime has been seen as successful in enforcing law and order, suppressing the banditry of moss-troopers. In 1655 it was claimed that [...] "a man may ride all over Scotland with £100 in his pocket, which he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> these five hundred years".|$|E
500|$|In 1925, Eliot {{became a}} poetry {{editor at the}} London {{publishing}} firm of Faber and Gwyer, Ltd., after a career in banking, and subsequent {{to the success of}} his earlier poems, including [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] (1915), [...] "Gerontion" [...] (1920) and [...] "The Waste Land" [...] (1922). In these years, Eliot gravitated away from his Unitarian upbringing and began to embrace the Church of England. He was baptised into the Anglican faith on 29 June 1927 at Finstock, in Oxfordshire, and was confirmed the following day in the private chapel of Thomas Banks Strong, Bishop of Oxford. Eliot converted in private, but subsequently declared in his 1927 preface to a collection of essays titled For Lancelot Andrewes that he considered himself a classicist in literature, a royalist in politics, and an Anglo-Catholic in religion. When his conversion became known, it was [...] "an understandable choice to those around him" [...] given his intellectual convictions, and that [...] "he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> anything less than seek what he regarded as the most ancient, most sacramental, and highest expression of the Christian faith that forms the indisputable basis for the culture and civilization of modern Europe". Eliot's conversion and his adherence to Anglo-Catholicism informed and influenced his later poetry.|$|E

500|$|Steven Moffat {{contacted}} Chris Chibnall, {{asking him}} to return to writing for Doctor Who. Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode [...] "42" [...] as well as episodes of the spin-off series Torchwood. Moffat and executive producer Piers Wenger gave him the brief of Silurians, a drill, and that it was a two-parter. The Silurians were villains who had previously appeared in the 1970 serial Doctor Who and the Silurians and the 1984 serial Warriors of the Deep. For research, Chibnall read the original novel Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters and watched the original serial, noting the freedom writer Malcolm Hulke took with the novel in things he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in the television format. Chibnall wanted there to be a large Silurian city in contrast to the small human village on the surface. Knowing that the Silurians were not as popular and recurring as other villains, Moffat instructed Chibnall to bring the creatures to a new audience, and Chibnall decided to start out with knowing nothing about them and then introducing them in [...] "the most exciting and scary way possible for people who've never seen them before". Chibnall also considered bringing back the Silurians' amphibious cousins the Sea Devils, but decided that doing two races of monster was much tougher and the story was [...] "so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want".|$|E
500|$|Some 16,000 spectators {{turned out}} to watch. From the start, both sides had good attacking opportunities. Early on, through the kicking of Verge and Blarney (playing threequarter), NSW got to within 25 yards of the Queensland try line but the {{visitors}} {{managed to get the}} ball away. Shortly after, Queensland kicked the ball hard towards Verge, who was back at the NSW goal line, and the Queensland threequarter—and captain—Lonnie Spragg, chased fast after it but Verge kicked the ball away safely. NSW scored the first points with a goal from a mark by Stan Wickham and Queensland responded with a penalty goal before half time. The score at the break was 4–3 to NSW. Verge's defensive work in the first half was noted by The Sunday Times of Sydney. Straight after the break, Wickham kicked a drop goal for NSW but Queensland scored a try moments later, which was converted and gave Queensland the lead 7–8. Another penalty and a try for NSW put the home side ahead 13–8 for the victory. The game was considered one of the best between the two states. Verge, according to The Sunday Times, [...] "made a highly creditable debut in representative football, in a match that required the full back to have his wits about him." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald noted that [...] "Verge on several occasions saved splendidly, generally finding the line with useful punts and never losing his head." [...] Playing for University against South Sydney soon after, Verge gave a [...] "brilliant exposition... sure in catching, very quick and tricky on his feet, and excellent in finding the line, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better work." ...|$|E
