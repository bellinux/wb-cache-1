40|$|Ireland {{became a}} member of the European Economic Community on January 1 1973. The {{decision}} to join an enlarged EEC had many motives, political and economic. Among the most important was the belief that membership would contribute positively to the further development of the Irish economy both in terms of the stimulus it would give to investment and growth and, more directly, because of the flow of funds that we could expect to obtain from Europe. The purpose of the present paper is to assess how far financial assistance to Ireland from the Community has contributed to development of the economy. The analysis is intended to answer a number of questions: (I) how has <b>Community</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> to Ireland grown since 1973 ? (ii) how has Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s share of the Community budget and of other finances developed as compared with our Community partners?

The adoption of the sole currency implies, beforehand, finding other methods of economical adjustment, {{as a consequence of the}} renunciation of the internal monetary policy.

On the one hand, <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> can help to avoid defaults by bridging times of fundamental crises or resolving coordination failures among private investors. On the other hand, the insurance effect of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> lowers borrowing costs which induces the sovereign to accumulate higher debt levels. To assess the overall effect of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> on the probability of default we construct a quantitative model of endogenous credit structure and sovereign default that allows for self-fulfilling expectations of default. Calibrating the model to Argentinean data {{we find that the}} availability of <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> reduces the number of defaults that occur due to self-fulfilling runs by private investors.

40|$|AbstractFor many years, the use {{of mercury}} in Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining has afforded an income for many persons without better options, but has brought with it {{extensive}} harm to the environment, the miners and their <b>communities.</b> Technical and <b>financial</b> <b>assistance</b> have focused on raising awareness of the affected mining communities and encouraging the transition to mercury-free techniques.

This paper analyzes the stakeholders and their diverse roles with regard to the trade and supply of mercury for Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining. The paper applies a supply chain management approach to stakeholder theory. This is done through an extensive literature review, a qualitative content analysis, an online survey and the development of supply chain diagrams that were validated by experts in the field. By providing a comprehensive picture of the stakeholders and their roles, this paper helps governments, inter- and non-governmental organizations and others to better understand stakeholders and their interactions with the mercury supply chain at multiple levels, permitting the development of appropriate policies {{within the context of the}} Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the preparation of better adapted National Action Plans...|$|R
