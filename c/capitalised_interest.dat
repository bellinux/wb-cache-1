40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the case for <b>capitalising</b> <b>interest</b> on self-constructed and {{maturing}} assets. Three perspectives on interest capitalisation- cost matching, opportunity cost, and valuation—are compared and contrasted. The paper's principal contributions are twofold: (i) to show how interest capitalisation can be related to the concept of deprival value; and (ii) to analyse the issues of capital structure, the choice of an appropriate capitalisation rate and the treatment of the resultant credits that have plagued the efforts of accountants in this area...|$|R

The taxpayers {{took out a}} wealth {{optimiser}} split loan product {{to enable them to}} purchase a home and retain their former residence as an investment property. The product was structured such that, {{in the early years of}} the loan, all repayments were directed towards paying off the home loan while allowing the interest on the investment property loan to be <b>capitalised</b> (and compound <b>interest</b> imposed). In essence, the progressive shift of the loan balance from the residential side of the account to the investment side permitted interest on the loan funds used to purchase the Hart's home to be claimed as a tax deduction...|$|R

This concept was new at the time as most of the bog bodies previously discovered had been re-buried, sometimes in consecrated ground, with the Tollund Man which had been discovered two years earlier having only its head preserved. Despite the warnings of some scientists who believed that the corpse should immediately undergo preservation, it was exhibited straight away in order to <b>capitalise</b> on public <b>interest.</b> Indeed, the scientists' fears were proved right, as mould started to appear on certain areas of the body as a result of it having to be kept permanently moist.|$|R

Provenance branding is a form of ‘credence marketing’ which suggests certain qualities to consumers that are not really testable in an objective or empirical fashion. Provenance branding suggests that the product concerned has certain qualities that result from its particular geographical origin.

We are very familiar with talk of terroir in the wine industry, but it is an emerging concept in relation to other foodstuffs...|$|R

5000|$|The band {{received}} {{another major}} boost {{when they were}} selected by Seaga, then the island's head of Social Welfare and Economic Development, in 1964 {{to travel to the}} New York World's Fair and perform as a backing band for a showcase of Jamaican talent, including Jimmy Cliff, Prince Buster, and Millie Small. The trip was not a great success, with the Dragonaires' [...] "uptown" [...] musicians not fitting in with the other [...] "downtown" [...] artists. Realising that their appeal to ska crowds was diminishing, Lee took the band in a new direction, incorporating calypso and touring Trinidad & Tobago in 1963 and 1964. Also the band contributed the instrumental part of Mighty Sparrow's recording of Only A Fool in 1966. Lee's relationship with Atlantic Records (he acted as head of distribution for the US company in Jamaica) led to the label releasing Dragonaires records in the US, including two albums timed to <b>capitalise</b> on <b>interest</b> generated from the World's Fair performances, Jump Up and Jamaican Ska (on which the Dragonaires backed the likes of The Blues Busters, The Charmers, The Maytals, Stranger Cole, Ken Boothe, and Patsy Todd). The band also targeted the international rocksteady market with albums of mainly cover versions such as Rock Steady Beat and Rock Steady '67. Further, Atlantic Records tried to push the album Jamaican Ska by using house producer and sound engineer Tom Dowd, who produced all of Aretha Franklin's greatest singles, to produce the album. [...] In addition, the Dragonaires were renamed as [...] "The Ska Kings" [...] on the album.

40|$|Compound {{interest}} {{is a concept}} that, historically, has been tainted with an essentially mercantile flavour. It relates to the custom of banks in <b>capitalising</b> on the <b>interest</b> due by a client upon the expiry of a certain interval (the rest). Such practice, zealously vilified in some quarters whilst acclaimed as a prosperous enterprise in others, has been challenged more recently, at both judicial level and under statute, {{in the case of}} Italy. This contribution, in briefly recalling the origin of the concept of anatocism (the orthodox definition of compound interest) and, therefore, its Roman predecessor, the usurarum usurae and the futurarum usurarum usurarae (usurae), seeks to examine the state-of-the-art apparatus applicable to compound interest in the British common law. Such deliberations will thereupon give rise to what this paper aspires to describe as a peculiar development. In this respect, attention is drawn to the recent Consumer Rights Act 2015 {{and the manner in which}} the bank customer is theoretically entitled to rely upon it, with specific reference to the compound interest clause. As regards the 'Continental experience', the Italian jurisdiction, awash with judicial twists and incandescent doctrinal views on this topic, is discussed and analysed as a compelling and stimulating comparator...|$|R
40|$|Achievement {{disparities between}} Indigenous {{students}} and their non-Indigenous peers in education continue to be documented across the globe.

What makes for quality STEM teaching for Indigenous students? What makes for successful learning for Indigenous students in STEM subjects?

40|$|Purpose – It is not {{uncommon}} for sports fans to follow multiple sports teams across different sports and even several teams across different leagues of the same sport. Whereas this might be considered a competitive situation, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to examine how interest in overseas football (soccer) leagues played a symbiotic role in the successful development of an Australian national soccer league. Design/methodology/approach – Results of survey data are presented from two clubs in Australia’s newly formed A-League. Three surveys were conducted over a two year period with over 3, 700 season ticket holders. Specific attention is paid to fans’ previous interest and exposure to football, which is then related to attitudes and behaviour associated with the new clubs. Findings – Interest in overseas clubs and leagues is found to be a major antecedent of interest in the Australian league. Those who follow teams in overseas leagues are more likely to be heavy consumers of the new local league than those who follow local leagues or had no prior experience. They also exhibit stronger attitudinal and behavioural loyalty, such as higher attendance and renewal rates of season tickets. Practical implications – Recognising fan interest in multiple teams/leagues as positive involves a shift in management thinking away from a competitive to a collaborative stance. In this case, rapid adoption of new teams is encouraged by <b>capitalising</b> on strong <b>interest</b> in overseas leagues. This requires careful structuring and branding of the competition that mimicks familiar foreign leagues, while minimising unfavourable comparisons in areas like quality of play. Originality/value – This study capitalises on the rare opportunity to examine foundation teams in a new national league. The findings highlight the importance and value of taking a ‘‘global’’ perspective to the marketing of sports, and of carefully leveraging the interest in other elite competitions to build interest in new leagues. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{answers the}} {{question}} “How does {{the application of}} the Swedish adjustment rule correspond to the OECD point of view regarding intragroup loans to thinly capitalised companies?” The question is answered by using the traditional legal method and by examining the way the adjustment rule is applied by the Supreme Administrative Court, the Swedish approach when using the arm’s length principle in Swedish law is then compared to the approach recommended by the OECD. From a tax point of view intragroup prices on commodities and services are of vital importance for multinational enterprises, since these prices in the end affects the total corporate taxation. Also the way of financing a company can have tax implications since it could be an advantage for an MNE to arrange financing of companies within the group through loans rather than contribution of equity capital. A company with a disproportionate debt to equity ratio is considered thinly <b>capitalised</b> and since <b>interest</b> payments are considered deductible expenses, which dividends are not, it provides a way to transfer untaxed profits within a group. This may be an incentive for MNEs to intentionally thinly capitalise companies by providing them with capital through loans instead of equity contributions. The Swedish provision regulating transfer pricing between associated enterprises is the adjustment rule which expresses the arm’s length principle. The purpose of the rule is to adjust erroneous pricing between associated enterprises and it has four requisites that have to be fulfilled in order to be applicable. In the thesis it is concluded that nothing in the preambles to the adjustment rule points at the provision being applicable to thin capitalisation, on the contrary they indicate that it should have a narrow application. Through case law it has been established that the adjustment rule is not applicable to thin capitalisation situations {{in the sense that it}} can not be used to reclassify a loan into equity contribution. The provision is, in such a situation, only applicable to adjust interest rates that deviate from rates on the open market. The arm’s length principle expressed in article 9. 1 of the OECD Model Tax Convention however seems to have a broader application than the adjustment rule. It is stated in the commentary to the article that it may be applied to prima facie loans, i. e. it can reclassify a loan into equity contribution if the surrounding circumstances points at it being the true nature of the transaction. The conclusions drawn when comparing the reasoning of the Supreme Administrative Court with the OECD regarding {{the application of the}} arm’s length principle, is that the way the OECD reason regarding the true nature of a transaction is based on the same idea as the reasoning of the Swedish court. The Swedish Supreme Court however uses this type of reasoning when applying the substance over form principle and not when applying the adjustment rule. In other words, the difference is that the adjustment rule is not acknowledged the same scope of application as article 9. 1. Regarding the need to legislate against thin capitalisation in Sweden it is the authors’ opinion that since no examination of the problem has been performed, it is necessary to examine whether thin capitalisation in reality constitutes a problem for the Swedish revenue. Not until it is established if a problem exists should there be a discussion regarding the construction of such a provision...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Although coordinated {{tobacco control}} {{approaches}} {{have been successful}} in reducing population prevalence rates of smoking, tobacco continues to account for significant morbidity and mortality. There also persists an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and smoking prevalence that is evident both within and between countries. In Australia smoking rates are disproportionately high among groups who experience multiple levels of social and economic disadvantage such as those with low-income, indigenous populations, the long-term unemployed, individuals who are homeless and those with a mental illness. Limited research has assessed the impact of tobacco control interventions among highly socioeconomically disadvantaged groups with high smoking rates. The aim of this thesis was to explore how socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers in Australia respond to and engage with three tobacco control measures (mass media campaigns, plain packaging and health warning labels, and price). Participants were clients accessing non-government social and community service organisations for the provision of crisis aid and social and financial welfare assistance. Paper one “Anti-tobacco mass media and socially disadvantaged groups: a systematic and methodological review” presents the results of a literature review examining evidence of the differential effectiveness of mainstream and targeted mass media campaigns according to socio-demographic group. Findings varied across studies and outcome measures. While socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers may be less likely to recall general population campaigns compared to more advantaged groups, they may be equally likely to perceive these campaigns as effective and to quit in response. Overall, {{there is a lack of}} methodologically rigorous research investigating the effectiveness of anti-tobacco mass media campaigns, particularly among highly socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. It appears that some mainstream campaigns have the potential to be effective among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, however more research is needed. Paper two “What type of anti-smoking advertisement is perceived as more effective? An experimental study with a sample of Australian socially disadvantaged welfare recipients” evaluated responses to key anti-smoking message types (‘why-to-quit’ and ‘how-to-quit’ messages) among highly socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers (n = 354). The influence of nicotine dependence and cessation cognitions on ratings of message effectiveness was also assessed. To effectively promote cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, mass media campaigns should include a high rotation of ‘why-to-quit’ television advertisements featuring negative emotive content and graphic imagery. Socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers reported high interest in quitting, but had limited quit success. Research on ways to improve the ‘how-to-quit’ message to <b>capitalise</b> on quit <b>interest,</b> motivate quit attempts and support cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups with high smoking rates is needed. Paper three “Tobacco health warning messages on plain cigarette packs and in television campaigns: A qualitative study with Australian socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers” describes a qualitative study using six focus groups to explore how socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers engage with health-risk and cessation-benefit messages communicated via mass media campaigns and cigarette pack health warning labels. Some tobacco warning messages may not be resonating with disadvantaged smokers. Participants reported message avoidance behaviours, self-exempting beliefs towards warning message content and considered themselves to be desensitised to tobacco-related health warnings. Warning messaging should continue to use emotive content and address false beliefs about tobacco health-effects, but might also explore featuring more immediately relatable health concerns and providing more practical cessation advice. Discussions also indicated cigarette plain packaging negatively impacted on product perceptions and experience. Paper four “Socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers’ ratings of plain and branded cigarette packaging: an experimental study” tested the potential impact of cigarette plain packaging among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers (n= 354) prior to policy implementation in Australia. The experimental quantitative study used computer touchscreen survey methodology. Plain cigarette packs stripped of branding elements and featuring larger health warning labels were associated with reduced positive brand appeal and purchase intentions. This is the first study of its type providing evidence of the potential effectiveness of cigarette plain packaging policy among disadvantaged smokers. Paper five “Paying the price: A cross-sectional survey of Australian socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers’ responses to hypothetical cigarette price rises” assessed the use of strategies to minimise the impact of cigarette price rises across two hypothetical price rise scenarios, and measured the possible influence of financial stress. Consistent intended use of price-minimisation strategies to manage smoking costs was reported, and financial stress appeared to have little effect. Larger cigarette price increases (i. e. 20 %) are significantly more likely to motivate smokers to consider quitting compared with smaller price rises (i. e. 10 %). Smokers who indicated they would not change their smoking behaviour in response to price rises had heavy nicotine dependence, large weekly tobacco expenditures, and made fewer quit attempts in the past year indicating they may require additional cessation support. Paper six ““Cigarettes are priority”: A qualitative study of how Australian socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers respond to rising cigarette prices” used qualitative interviews with socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers (n= 20) to further examine the wider social and economic impacts of increasing cigarette taxes. To maintain smoking despite rising prices, socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers reduced household spending, consequently leading to further social and economic deprivation. Participants reported going without meals, substituting meal choices and not paying bills. The provision of additional assistance to smokers who may find it difficult to quit unaided, particularly during times of tobacco taxation increases, should be considered. In conclusion, the research contained within this thesis is the first in Australia to recruit highly socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers to examine responses to population-level tobacco control measures. The findings highlight ways current tobacco control interventions might be improved to increase effectiveness among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. Increasing the effectiveness of tobacco control strategies and adequately monitoring the impact of these interventions among highly disadvantaged groups with the highest smoking rates and documented poor quit success is pivotal to addressing the social gradient in smoking rates...|$|R
