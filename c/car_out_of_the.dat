5|$|The BT49's racing career {{got off to}} an {{unsettled}} {{start when}} Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, abruptly quit the sport after 10 laps of the first practice session at the penultimate race of the 1979 season, the Canadian Grand Prix. The car soon showed promise: Piquet ran third in the race on the high speed Circuit Île Notre-Dame before retiring with a broken gearbox. Lauda's replacement, Argentine novice Ricardo Zunino, was seventh of the nine who completed the race. At the season finale in wet conditions at the Watkins Glen International circuit, Zunino spun off although Piquet set the fastest lap before a driveshaft failed, putting his <b>car</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his success}} with Cooper, Brabham {{was sure he}} could do better. He {{considered}} buying Cooper in partnership with Roy Salvadori and then in late 1959 he asked his friend Ron Tauranac {{to come to the}} UK and work with him, producing upgrade kits for Sunbeam Rapier and Triumph Herald road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars. Brabham continued to drive for Cooper, but on the long flight back from the 1960 season-opening Argentine Grand Prix, he had a heart-to-heart with John Cooper. John's father Charlie and the designer Owen Maddock had been reluctant to update their car, but although a Cooper had won in Argentina, other cars had been faster before they broke down. Brabham helped design the more advanced Cooper T53, including advice from Tauranac. Brabham spun the new <b>car</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next championship race, the Monaco Grand Prix, but then embarked on a series of five straight victories. He won from the front at the Dutch, French, and Belgian Grands Prix, where title rival Moss was badly injured in a practice accident that put him out for two months. Two other drivers were killed during the race. At the British Grand Prix, Brabham was closing on Graham Hill's BRM before Hill spun off, leaving Brabham the victory. He then came back from eighth place to second at the Portuguese Grand Prix after sliding off on tramlines and won after race leader John Surtees crashed. Brabham's points total was put out of reach when the British teams withdrew from the Italian GP on safety grounds. Mike Lawrence writes that Brabham's expertise in setting up the cars was a significant factor in Cooper's 1960 drivers' and constructors' titles.|$|E
500|$|The race {{began at}} 15:00 Japan Standard Time (...) [...] The track {{had a large}} amount of {{standing}} water on its surface, since Typhoon Phanfone had brought heavy rain to the area. The air temperature was , and the track temperature was [...] About 142,000 people attended the race. The standing water caused heavy spray and impaired visibility, and all cars used full wet tyres. The race began behind the safety car, with no formation lap; despite the slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. Ericsson lost control of his car after accelerating out of the final turn, and spun into the gravel trap at the corner. Marshals pushed his <b>car</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravel, enabling him to keep driving. Following complaints from Hamilton about poor visibility, the race was suspended after two laps. The cars drove back into the pit lane, lined up in grid formation and their engines were shut off. Several cars had their ride heights raised to make them less prone to aquaplaning on their underbody planks. The race was restarted 20 minutes later behind the safety car, after the rain let up. Alonso stopped his car with an electrical issue (possibly a short circuit from the wet conditions), and was the race's first retirement on lap three. His departure promoted Ricciardo into fifth place, Magnussen sixth and Button seventh.|$|E

500|$|Method Studios was {{contracted}} {{to handle the}} film's visual effects work. The studio's supervisor Sean Faden, worked alongside the film's visual effects supervisor, Brad Parker throughout the production. Several of the film's scenes {{proved to be a}} challenge for the team. Director Reeves wanted the [...] "car-crash" [...] sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first-person. Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the <b>car</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas station and swerving, the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a [...] "rotisserie" [...] in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car's roll down the hill. Jenkins' stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with additional effects work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled. The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot. Houdini software was used for much of the film's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form. Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, [...] "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn’t have allowed us enough control." [...] Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference. Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood from her face.|$|E

2500|$|For the US market, two limited {{production}} GTV-6 models stand out. The Balocco (named {{after the}} famous Balocco test track in Italy) appeared in 1982 with a production run of only 350 cars. The Balocco was {{available only in}} red with sunroof and black interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel and red piping on the seats. There were also two green Quadrifoglio badges fixed on the rear quarter trim pieces above a badge with the [...] "Balocco SE" [...] designation. A plaque inset in the glove box door designated {{the number of the}} <b>car</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series of 350 (XXX of 350). Later there was the GTV6 2.5 Maratona, of which only 150 were built. The Maratona model included a more aggressive aerodynamic trim package, lightweight Speedline wheels, clear engine view port, sunroof, wood steering wheel and shift knob, rear louvers and Carello fog lamps. All 150 cars were available only painted silver and with a black leather interior; and came with [...] "Maratona" [...] badging on the rear decklid, front fenders and glove box door. (The most notable feature of the Maratona, its aerodynamic kit, was also available as a dealer-installed option on other GTV-6 models.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental <b>car</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keating {{started off}} the 2015 season pulling double-duty at the 2015 24 Hours of Daytona, taking turns {{in both the}} No. 93 and No. 33 Vipers. Keating would score his first win of the young season in the No. 93 Viper with {{previous}} Daytona co-drivers Dominik Farnbacher (2011–2013) and Kuno Wittmer (2013), along with American Al Carter. The No. 33 Viper would come in 9th in the event. Keating would drive in both cars again in the subsequent race, the 2015 12 Hours of Sebring, guiding the No. 93 car (with Carter and German Marc Goossens) to a Top Five finish. The No. 33 Viper (with Jeroen and Sebastiaan Bleekemolen) would again come in 9th after a radiator issue late in the race knocked the <b>car</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead. After Sebring, a string of technical and track issues befell Keating and the No. 33 car. Early in Keating's opening shift of the 2015 Monterey Grand Prix, a storm drain grate that was jutting out of the track did massive damage {{to the right side}} of the Viper, forcing significant repairs and knocking the No. 33 out of contention. The No. 33 car was then forced to pit for significant repairs early at Belle Isle after damage to the oil tank. Keating and Bleekemolen would experience another early issue at the 2015 Six Hours of The Glen, but were able to recover and finish the race in the 6th place overall. Running a full race without any stops for repairs, Keating and Bleekemolen rebounded with a second-place finish at the 2015 Northeast Grand Prix, finishing just three and a half seconds behind the leader. Keating and Bleekemolen followed up with another strong performance and snagged their first class win of the year in the Continental Tire Road Race Showcase at Road America. As a result of their win at Road America, the No. 33 car was placed under some competitive restrictions limiting the performance of the car during the next race, the Oak Tree Grand Prix at VIR. These restrictions limited the No. 33 Viper to a 7th-place finish, preventing Keating from taking a third consecutive podium. Keating and Bleekemolen would come back strong though, and charged back into the winner's circle with a come-from-behind victory at Circuit of the Americas. Keating was hit with a penalty early, but strong driving from him and Jeroen allowed them to overcome that setback and take the victory. For the season's final race, the 2015 Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta, Sebastiaan Bleekemolen joined Keating and brother Jeroen in the No. 33 Viper. Unfortunately, Keating's early spin-out on the rain-soaked track resulted in a lap deficit the team could not overcome, and the No. 33 car finished 12th in class. However, Keating's late season push of three podiums and two wins in the last five events were enough to help overcome the No. 33 team's early troubles, and Keating [...] and Bleekemolen finished in 6th place in the points standings for the GTD Class.|$|E
