5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that {{the view from the}} rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to the rear of the house in the 1730s; because of the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E
25|$|On 25 July 1814 the Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy put {{her up for}} sale.

She was sold on 11 August 1814 for £4,700.|$|E
25|$|First, {{rather than}} {{succumbing to the}} {{foreseeable}} consequences of his criminality, de Hory became something of a folk hero in the anti-establishment atmosphere that pervaded the late 1960s, an age of rebellion and social unrest. Secondly, his ensuing notoriety, he thought, would finally afford him the lifelong recognition he sought, {{to be seen as}} a fine artist in his own right. He was wrong. De Hory often referred to himself as “famously infamous,” and he enjoyed his time in the spotlight as a bad-boy media darling, though, that attention never translated into a demand for artwork in his own avant-garde style. It was a bitter but real irony for him for the rest of his life. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, rather than learning from the mistakes made by art dealers, and collectors, de Hory’s target audience, the commerce of art remains little changed from the halcyon days of his midcentury fakery. The degree of complicity de Hory enjoyed with art dealers is open to speculation, though, even today, art sellers face no fallout from unlawful dealings unless it can be proven that they are ‘knowingly’ complicit in fraudulent transactions (see Knoedler Gallery scandal). Plausible deniability is a commonly used defense to deflect accountability. Furthermore, auction houses distance themselves in issues of provenance or authorship as they are not in the business of ascribing authenticity. (See the standard wordage explaining terms and <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> for Christie’s or Sotheby’s, for example.) These loopholes that allowed many of de Hory’s fakes to fast track to public institutions and private collections are the same pathways that facilitate present-day forgers and fakers.|$|E

Another condition of purchase was to give up her annuities and thus give up her birthright of being Indian. so again she refused. Her remarks made in 1861 were [...] "I am Indian; and the blood of my forefathers runs through my veins and I am not ashamed to own it; for my forefathers were a noble race before the pale-faces came to possess their lands and homes”. She refused to dishonor her ancestors and leave her children without a home.|$|E

[...] Catherine died on Sept 26th 1865 before these negotiations were finalized. [...] In the end he paid $5.00 an acre. [...] Finally, he received the deeds for Lots 32 and 33.

50|$|It is {{controversial}} whether tickets are goods {{which can be}} privately resold.

50|$|The <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> {{for land}} in the Huron Tract were open to interpretation. Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto, an {{important}} member of the 9th Parliament of Upper Canada, felt that those persons who automatically became American citizens after 1783 {{should be required to}} renounce their American citizenship to qualify as a Loyalist. The opposition, the Colborne Clique, had a different opinion and were able to sway a victory in defiance of the Family Compact and Sir John Robinson's position. This issue is one of many that lead to the Rebellion of 1837. Another issue pertinent to the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> was who qualified for the Government free grants and who did not.|$|E
50|$|Thus {{for many}} years, {{the only known}} legally viable means of {{acquiring}} the trackbed, lay in the Liquidator (or later, the Official Receiver) first obtaining an Abandonment Order, before any sale could go through. The share/debenture holders were reluctant to provide any funds to the liquidator or the Official Receiver and thus it seemed likely {{that the cost of}} obtaining an Abandonment Order, would have to be borne by the prospective purchaser. In fact this later became a <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> which helped to delay the winding up of the 1922 WHLR Company until 2003.|$|R
