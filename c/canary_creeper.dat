60|$|She {{went out}} by the front door, going that way not {{because she wanted to}} go to Hickleybrow (her goal was Cheasing Eyebright, where her married {{daughter}} resided), but because the back door was impassable on account of the <b>canary</b> <b>creeper</b> that had been growing so furiously ever since she upset the can of food near its roots. She listened for a space and closed the front door very carefully behind her.|$|E

60|$|About eleven the <b>canary</b> <b>creeper,</b> {{which had}} been quietly active all the morning, began to clamber over the window and darken it very greatly, and the darker it got the more and more clearly Mrs. Skinner {{perceived}} that her position would speedily become untenable. And also that she had lived many ages since Skinner went. She peered out of the darkling window, through the stirring tendrils, for some time, and then went very cautiously and opened the bedroom door and listened....|$|E

I 'aven't theen any big ratth, Thir, but 'ow do I know, Thir. We been frightened for dayth becauth of the earwigth we've theen--like lobthters they wath--two of 'em, Thir--and the frightful way the <b>canary</b> <b>creeper</b> wath growing, and directly I heard the waptheth--directly I 'eard 'em, Thir, I underthood.

His first impression was {{that the house was}} smaller than he had thought--very much smaller; his second was to perceive that all the vegetation between the house and the pine-wood had become extremely large. The roof over the well peeped amidst tussocks of grass a good eight feet high, and the <b>canary</b> <b>creeper</b> wrapped about the chimney stack and gesticulated with stiff tendrils towards the heavens. Its flowers were vivid yellow splashes, distinctly visible as separate specks this mile away. A great green cable had writhed across the big wire inclosures of the giant hens' run, and flung twining leaf stems about two outstanding pines. Fully half as tall as these was the grove of nettles running round behind the cart-shed. The whole prospect, as they drew nearer, became more and more suggestive of a raid of pigmies upon a dolls' house that has been left in a neglected corner of some great garden.|$|E
