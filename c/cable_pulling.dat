5000|$|Cyclocross Cantilever brake bosses {{are more}} often {{equipped}} with traditional center-pull cantilever brakes than the more contemporary and powerful linear-pull brakes ("V-brakes") due to two reasons: native compatibility (insufficient brake <b>cable</b> <b>pull)</b> {{with the majority of}} drop-bar brake levers; and the cantilever brake's greater brake pad-to-rim clearance, which minimizes drag in muddy conditions. [...] "Mini-V's" [...] are gaining in popularity as they have both the native <b>cable</b> <b>pull,</b> and some of the increased power of traditional linear-pull brakes over cantilever brakes.|$|R

5000|$|... top pull : This type is more {{commonly}} seen on mountain bikes without rear-suspension. The derailleur is actuated by a <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> upwards, {{which is usually}} routed along the frame's top tube, using cable stops and a short length of housing to change the cable's direction. This arrangement keeps the cable away from {{the underside of the}} bottom bracket/down tube which get pelted with dirt when off-road.|$|E

50|$|The Speedhub is {{provided}} with a twist shifter for shift operation, with one <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> in each direction. The indexing mechanism {{is part of the}} hub. In 2016 the Bpod psh'R, a hydraulic MTB lever and integrated road shifters for the Rohloff hub were announced. The new shifters allow for more convenient mounting, especially on road bars. The hydraulic feature alleviates some of the issues with traditional cable systems, such as friction and cable tension.|$|E

5000|$|... {{bottom pull}} : Commonly used on road and touring bikes, {{this type of}} {{derailleur}} is actuated by a <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> downwards. The cable is often routed across the top or {{along the bottom of}} the bottom bracket shell on a cable guide, which redirects the cable up the lower edge of the frame's down tube. Full-suspension mountain bikes often have bottom pull routing as the rear suspension prevents routing via the top tube.|$|E

50|$|Traditional <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> {{methods are}} very {{sensitive}} to the condition of the duct and to the number of bends and undulations throughout the duct route. Therefore, for microducts, Air-Blown (AB) cable installation techniques are expected to be the most useful. AB cable installation requires the use of a device that injects a high volume of air into the duct, at pressures as high as 20-25 psi. The viscous drag forces generated by the rushing air {{along the length of the}} cable act to reduce or overcome the friction between the cable and the duct.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical tape is very {{frequently}} used to install low voltage cabling such as voice, data, video, alarm, and access control cabling. For this function {{it is used}} to attach the <b>cable</b> to <b>pull</b> strings, fish rods, cable snakes, and other devices. It {{can also be used to}} <b>pull</b> new <b>cable</b> by connecting it to old cable and using the old <b>cable</b> to <b>pull</b> the new <b>cable</b> in.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>pulled</b> the specially-designed {{passenger}} cars up the mountain, {{with the car}} having a mechanism that hooked onto the cable. To balance the system there were two cars. The cars were built by Jackson & Sharp Co. in 1892, and each car could seat 75 passengers. The cars were named Rickerson and Van Santvoord. A small open-air baggage car was coupled to the downhill end of each passenger car.|$|R
5000|$|Chicago {{historian}} Greg Borzo {{calls the}} LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse, [...] "the crown jewel of Chicago’s cable car remnants." [...] He also notes, [...] "This powerhouse drove two cables: one that <b>pulled</b> <b>cable</b> cars through a tunnel under the Chicago River along LaSalle Street {{and around the}} downtown and another shorter <b>cable</b> that <b>pulled</b> cars along Illinois Street between Clark Street and Wells Street." [...] Those <b>cables,</b> in turn, <b>pulled</b> the thousands of cable cars that, {{at the peak of}} their operation, brought approximately 100,000 workers into downtown Chicago each day.|$|R
5000|$|The Electromote {{built by}} the Siemens & Halske company was a {{converted}} four-wheel landau carriage, equipped with two 2.2 kW electric motors transmitting the power using a chain drive to the rear wheels. The voltage used was 550 V DC. The electric power transmission to the coach was by a flexible <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> a small eight-wheeled [...] "contact car" [...] (Kontaktwagen) that ran along the overhead power lines. In English language use, the Kontaktwagen was later named the [...] "trolley", giving the trolley car and trolley bus their names.|$|E
5000|$|Simple {{activities}} such as <b>cable</b> <b>pulling,</b> fencing, road surfacing can be drawn as a single line: The work crew starts on a given location {{at a given time}} and continues with linear progress. Exhibit 1 shows two such activities: Activity 1 starts in Week 1 on Day 3 from km 0+000 and continues until Week 2, Day 13, progressing until km 1+100. Activity 2 starts the next day at km 2+000 and continues until Day 19 to km 1+100. These two activities could be performed by a single work crew as the second activity starts right after the first.|$|E
50|$|A.P.Fiber Grid Phase-I {{is to set}} up a {{high-speed}} Optical Fiber Network Infrastructure across the 13 Districts of the State with the help of assets of the Electricity Department. A 24-Core ADSS Optical Fiber Cable will be laid for a length of around 23000 km over the electrical poles with its back-end electronic systems being set up at the Points of Presence (PoPs) at 2449 identified sub-stations. Phase one of the AP Fibre Grid Project for broadband connectivity is expected to be ready by July-end. Against the target of laying around 22,500 km of aerial optical fiber cable across the State, 16,000 km of <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> has been completed as of June 2016. A Network Operations Centre (NOC) has also been commissioned at Visakhapatnam to look after the project in the state.|$|E
50|$|The {{actuation}} {{ratio is}} the ratio between {{the amount of}} shifter cable length and the amount of transverse derailleur travel that it generates. Shift ratio is the reciprocal of actuation ratio and is more easily expressed for derailleurs than actuation. There are currently several standards in use, and in each the product of the derailleur's actuation ratio and the length of <b>cable</b> <b>pulled</b> must equal the pitch of the rear sprockets. The following standards exist.|$|R
5000|$|Most s saw {{service on}} the Eastern Front, where {{they were used to}} lay {{communication}} <b>cables,</b> <b>pull</b> heavy loads and carry soldiers through the deep Russian mud. Later in the war, s were used as runway tugs for aircraft, especially for the [...] jet fighter, and sometimes the [...] jet reconnaissance-bomber. In order to save aviation fuel, a German jet aircraft would be towed to the runway, rather than taxiing under its own power.|$|R
40|$|Improved {{cable grip}} reduces wear due to sliding {{friction}} between cable and gripping surfaces. Drive wheels are grooved with a helical pattern that meshes with {{the lay of}} cable, analogous to a worm gear. Cable is gripped between drive wheels and guide rollers, and <b>cable</b> <b>pull</b> is exerted on the grip when drive wheels are slowed by hydraulic clutches. Cable grip may be applicable to cable-operated systems, such as ore trams in mines, overhead cable cars and ski lifts...|$|R
5000|$|... "Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by the <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> {{a single}} two-sided sliding cam. (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) Each arm has a cam follower. As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart. As {{the top of each}} arm moves outward, the brake shoe below the pivot is forced inward against the rim.There is much in favor of the roller cam brake design. Since the cam controls the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. And they require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless re-adjusted it can eventually contact the tyre's sidewall.|$|E

40|$|The {{handling}} of mining machine cables in underground coal mines {{has been identified}} as a particularly stressful task and is a likely contributor to low back pain. In this experiment, seven experienced miners performed a <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> task while ground reaction forces and cable tension were measured. The independent variables were two levels of cable resistance (low and high) and lifting conditions (kneeling under a 1. 2 meter [48 inch] roof, stooping under a 1. 2 meter [48 inch] roof, stooping under a 1. 5 meter [60 inch] roof, and unrestricted standing). The dependent variables were the peak values of the following: actual tension measured in the cable, ground reaction forces in the X (anterior), Y (lateral), and Z (vertical) directions and the magnitude of the resultant force vector. Work posture significantly affected the peak ground reaction forces in the Y-direction. The Y-forces were highest in the kneeling condition, indicating that there is less postural stability when performing <b>cable</b> <b>pulling</b> tasks in a kneeling posture. Thus, there may be a greater likelihood of injury in this posture. Additionally, biomechanical stresses which contribute to musculoskeletal injury may be greater in the kneeling posture...|$|E
50|$|In an {{alternate}} ending to The Guardian, {{found on the}} DVD, Randall survives. As he unhooks and tries to fall, Jake again grabs him and vows not to let go. Instead of unstrapping his glove, Randall lets the <b>cable</b> <b>pull</b> them up and it breaks just as {{they get into the}} helicopter. This ending was added because some of the writers were worried that the original ending was too strong for viewers. Nonetheless, it was scrapped when Disney chairman, Dick Cook, applauded the original ending.|$|R
50|$|Philips, however, used an 'M-wrap' {{similar to}} that in VHS machines. <b>Cables</b> <b>pulled</b> pins along tracks in order to pull the tape into the {{transport}} path. This drive was large, heavy and very complex to produce, although having the head drum, capstan, audio/erase heads and the respective drive motors all mounted on a common base plate meant it was produced to high tolerances. Philips referred to this assembly as the ‘microworld’. Second and third generation Philips drives replaced the cable-pulled pins with a reliable lever mechanism.|$|R
