40|$|What is {{the price}} {{relationship}} between a <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> in San Angelo, Texas, Sioux Falls, South Dakota and other major U. S. <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> markets and those in Ontario or Alberta Canada? How are these prices impacted by the price for lean beef trimmings or the price of imported lean beef from Australia or New Zealand? What impact did the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in North America in 2003 have on these price relationships? Answers to these and other questions are {{the purpose of this}} paper. Numerous market and price analysis studies exist on the fed cattle and feeder cattle markets in the U. S. However, there have been only a few recent studies on the U. S. <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> market. Yager, Greer and Burt, 1980, and Tronstad and Gum, 1994, looked at optimal culling and marketing decisions, but neither of these two studies compared markets over time. While only limited research has been done on this market, it {{is an important part of}} the total U. S. beef market. Ground beef represents about 44 % of all retail beef purchased and 59 % of all fresh beef consumed in U. S. households. The <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> market is a major supplier of lean beef and trimmings for the grinding industry. Beef from cull cows is also used for the low-end steak houses, for many of the thinly sliced deli beef products and for some of the other pre-cooked and further processed beef products for sale in retail grocer stores...|$|E
40|$|Mature {{cows are}} {{typically}} {{removed from the}} cow herd for various reasons, such as reproductive inefficiency and poor performance. It {{has been estimated that}} as much as 15 to 25 % of a ranch’s revenue may be from <b>cull</b> <b>cows.</b> When <b>cows</b> are <b>culled</b> from the herd, they are normally in thin condition and potentially can be fed to gain weight and increase income.

For each <b>culled</b> <b>cow</b> data related to parity at culling, last calving to culling interval and primary reason for culling were recorded. Annual herd exit rate was 20. 9 %. Out {{of a total of}} 652 <b>culled</b> <b>cows,</b> the proportions of <b>culled</b> dairy <b>cows</b> were due mainly to involuntary culling with very small proportion of voluntary culling (4 %). The involuntary culling were mainly from infertility or reproductive disorders (23. 6 %), udder disorders (17. 5 %) and digestive tract disorders (15. 9 %). Average ± SD of parity at culling was 3. 15 ± 1. 96. <b>Culled</b> <b>cows</b> from digestive tract disorders, injuries and infectious diseases were significantly younger than those of other culling reasons (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Cull {{cows are}} often {{overlooked}} {{as an important}} source of income to the cow-calf enterprise. Depending upon the relationships between <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> and calf prices, and the herd culling rate, <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> receipts generally account for 15 - 30 percent of income from the cow-calf enterprise. However, some producers give little attention to this source of income and ways of enhancing it. For many producers, cull cows are sold at the time culling takes place, and much of this culling is done in the late fall soon after calves are weaned. Is it most profitable to sell cows when they are culled, or should they be fed for a period of time? Several factors need to be considered to properly answer that question and that is {{the purpose of this paper}} and presentation. Cows are culled from a herd for a number of reasons and the reason for culling will most likely affect the time culling takes place and could alter the most profitable marketing strategy. Reproductive failure, problems resulting from old age, and unsatisfactory performance are the most common reasons for culling an animal. While reproductive failure is generally diagnosed in the fall of the year, culling for other reasons could take place at other times. Three factors of importance regarding the decision to sell cows when culled versus feeding them and selling at a latter time are: (1) the seasonality of <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> prices, (2) the price difference between <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> slaughter grades and the percentage of cull cows in each grade, and (3) the cost of feeding cull cows. Each of these factors will be discussed in some detail...|$|E

Methods: Bacteria were cultured from 188 quarter milk samples obtained from <b>cows</b> before <b>culling</b> (n= 139) and from cows affected with acute mastitis (n= 49) belonging to 10 dairy farms. The bacteria were identified using colony morphology, Gram staining and biochemical characteristics. S.  aureus isolates were then subjected to molecular characterization using PCR targeting 16 S rRNA and mecA gene to identify Methicillin resistant S.  aureus (MRSA). The antibiogram of all isolates was performed using the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method against 10 commonly used antibiotics in dairy farms. Results: S.  aureus was isolated from 19 (13. 7 %) samples obtained from <b>culled</b> <b>cows</b> and 11 (22. 4 %) samples obtained from cows with acute mastitis. In both <b>culled</b> <b>cows</b> and cows with acute mastitis, in vitro antibiogram revealed that 100 % of S.  aureus isolates were resistant to erythromycin, penicillin G, streptomycin, doxycyclin, and trimethoprim/sulpha. The prevalence of MRSA in milk of <b>culled</b> <b>cows</b> and cows with acute mastitis was 26. 3 % and 18. 2 %, respectively, {{with an overall}} prevalence of 3. 7 % among all samples. All MRSA isolates were completely resistant to all tested antibiotics. All MRSA isolates were positive {{for the presence of}} the mecA gene.

40|$|Beef {{cows are}} culled from herds because of {{reproductive}} inefficiency, poor performance, old age, or farm downsizing {{due to high}} production costs. The National Market Cow and Bull Beef Quality Audit of 1999 reported that challenges associated with <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> carcasses are undesirable dressing percentages and meat yields. Since 1999, {{an increasing number of}} producers are either selling cows in better physical condition or feeding cows a high concentrate ration for 50 to 100 days prior to harvest. According to the 2007 audit, cow carcasses were heavier and leaner and had more desirable muscle and fat color scores than in 1999. Although these improvements are positive steps toward increasing the value of cull cows, use of growth promoting agents, such as steroid implants and β-adrenergic agonists, can increase muscling and leanness more efficiently than feeding a concentrate ration alone. Currently, there are two β-agonists on the market for use in beef cattle in the United States: Optaflexx (ractopamine hydrochloride; Elanco, Greenfield, IN), a β 1 -agonist, and Zilmax (zilpaterol hydrochloride; Intervet Inc., Millsboro, DE), a β 2 -agonist. These growth promotants have been studied individually and in combination with implants (primarily in young steers and heifers), but no research published to date has investigated feeding a sequence of these growth promoting agents. Therefore, our objective was to investigate effects of feeding Optaflexx for 25 days followed by Zilmax for 20 days plus a 3 -day withdrawal on <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> performance, carcass traits, and meat quality...|$|E

40|$|A {{non-pregnant}} cow is a liability to a producer. Over {{the last four}} years, cow-calf producers have had an increased number of {{non-pregnant cow}}s due to factors like environmental conditions and diseases like trichomoniasis. While most {{research has indicated that}} culling a non-pregnant female and replacing the cow with retained heifers, purchased heifers, or purchased cows are the only economic alternatives, recent trends in the cattle market have suggested that keeping a non-pregnant cow may also be an alternative. Annual beef cow budgets were created based on typical Nebraska Sandhills conditions. Revenues and costs in these budgets vary according to different classes and age of cattle and replacement strategy. Cash flows are then projected for five years to compare the replacement alternatives. Five-year averages from 2006 - 2010, as well as an additional analysis that used Winter 2010 / 2011 prices, were used to determine the cash flow values. The Total 5 -year Discounted Cash Flow values showed unprofitable levels in the cow-calf industry based on five-year averages whereas the Winter 2010 / 2011 price data resulted in profits. Based on the Total 5 -year Discounted Cash Flow values using five-year averages, the replacement alternative of purchasing cows surfaced as the highest return. Retaining heifers was the highest return replacement alternative when Winter 2011 prices were used. Keeping the non-pregnant cow alternative did not prove to be the highest return alternative in either price data used. However, it was not the lowest return either. Different replacement alternatives become attractive at different <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> values. Lower <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> values created higher cash flow values when keeping a non-pregnant cow, whereas extremely valuable cull cows negated this alternative. Furthermore, Winter 2011 prices suggested that keeping a non-pregnant cow was a more feasible alternative than that of purchasing a bred heifer. Advisor: Darrell R. Mar...|$|E

The treatments consisted of: pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke) or sudan grass (Sorghum bicolor cv. Sudanense). Both treatments were submitted to continuous grazing of <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> over 63 experimental days subdivided into three periods. Using 20 Charolais x Nellore <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> at the average age of 8 years and average weight of 445 kg. The animals were divided into 10 paddocks, five paddocks used for each treatment comprising two cows. The behavioral assessments were carried out for 24 hours straight. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments and three periods. The grazing time of cows showed interaction (P = 0. 0035) between treatment and period, and the shortest time for the activity in the first period on pearl millet (504 minutes) compared to the second period of that same treatment (587 minutes) and the third period on sudan grass pastures (535 minutes). The times of rumination and idling were similar between treatments; however, the idling time decreased and rumination increased with time periods. The forage species did not affect the variables related to the strategies of displacement and feeding. With the advancement of cycle pastures the number of steps per minute, stations per minute and per day decreased while the bite rate and the number of bites per day increased. The behavioral parameters of <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> grazing sudan grass or millet are similar; however, the advancement of the vegetative cycle of these species provides changes in the behavioral pattern of the animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to benchmark carcasses and muscles from commercially identified fed (animals that were perceived to have been fed an increased plane of nutrition before slaughter) and nonfed cull beef and dairy cows and A-maturity, USDA Select steers, so that the muscles could be identified from <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> carcasses that may be used to fill a void of intermediately priced beef steaks. Carcass characteristics were measured at 24 h postmortem for 75 carcasses from 5 populations consisting of cull beef cows commercially identified as fed (B-F, n = 15); cull beef cows commercially identified as nonfed (B-NF, n = 15); cull dairy cows commercially identified as fed (D-F, n = 15); cull dairy cows commercially identified as nonfed (D-NF, n = 15); and A-maturity, USDA Select grade steers (SEL, n = 15). Nine muscles were excised from each carcass [m. infraspinatus, m. triceps brachii (lateral and long heads), m. teres major, m. longissimus dorsi (also termed LM), m. psoas major, m. gluteus medius, m. rectus femoris, and m. tensor fasciae latae] and subjected to Warner-Bratzler shear force testing and objective sensory panel evaluation after 14 d of postmortem aging. Carcass characteristics differed (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 05) among the 5 commercially identified slaughter groups for the traits of lean maturity, bone maturity, muscle score, HCW, fat color, subjective lean color, marbling, ribeye area, 12 th-rib fat thickness, and preliminary yield grade. Carcasses from commercially identified, fed cull cows exhibited more (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01) weight in carcass lean than did commercially identified, nonfed cull cows. There was a group 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #;muscle interaction (P = 0. 02) for Warner-Bratzler shear force. Warner-Bratzler shear force and sensory overall tenderness values demonstrates that muscles from the SEL group were the most tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01), whereas muscles from the BNF group were the least tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01).

40|$|The sale of cull cows {{contributes}} to the overall profit of dairy herds. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the factors associated with slaughter age (mo), cow carcass weight (kg), price ((sic) /kg of carcass weight), and value ((sic) /head) of dairy cull cows. Data included 20, 995 slaughter records in the period from 2003 to 2011 of 5 different breeds: 2 dairy [Holstein Friesian (HF) and Brown Swiss (BS) ] and 3 dual-purpose [Simmental (Si), Alpine Grey (AG), and Rendena (Re) ]. Associations of breed, age of cow (except when the dependent variable was slaughter age), and year and month of slaughter with slaughter age, carcass weight, price, and value were quantified using a mixed linear model; herd was included as a random effect. The seasonal trends in cow price and value traits were inversely related to the number of cows slaughtered, whereas annual variation in external factors affected market conditions. Relative to BS cows, HF cows were younger at slaughter (73. 1 vs. 80. 7 mo), yielded slightly lighter carcasses (242 vs. 246 kg), and received a slightly lower price (1. 69 vs. 1. 73 (sic) /kg) and total value (394 vs. 417 (sic) /head). Dual-purpose breeds were older and heavier and received a much greater price and total value at slaughter (521, 516, and 549 (sic) /head, respectively for Si, Re, and AG) than either dairy breed. Of the dual-purpose cows, Si carcasses were heavier (271 kg), whereas the carcasses of local breeds received a higher price (2. 05 and 2. 18 (sic) /kg for Re and AG, respectively) and Alpine Grey cows were the oldest at slaughter (93. 3 mo). The price per kilogram of <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> carcasses was greatest for very young cows (i. e., < 3 yr of age) and the differential in price and value between younger and older cows was greater in dual-purpose than in dairy breeds.

40|$|Beef {{production}} from <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> {{is an additional}} {{source of income for}} dairy farms and greatly contributes to red meat production, but the sources of variation of live animal characteristics and the carcass traits of <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> have rarely been examined. This study investigated the effects of the farm type, breed, age at slaughter (AGE) and calving to culling interval (Calv_Cull) on the body traits and carcass characteristics of dairy and dual-purpose <b>cull</b> <b>cows.</b> Data from 555 <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> from 182 herds belonging to five farm types, characterised by a combination of housing and feeding systems, were recorded and analysed. Dairy breeds, such as Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss, and dual-purpose breeds (Simmental, Rendena) were included in the trait assessments. The day before slaughter, the cows were weighed and scored for body condition (BCS) and fleshiness, and then, their heart girth and wither height were measured. At the slaughterhouse, the carcass weight (CW), dressing percentage (DP), carcass conformation and fatness scores, carcass price per kg and carcass total value were obtained. On average, the cows were slaughtered at nearly 71 ± 27 months of age, 285 ± 187 days after the last calving; 615 ± 95 kg BW; and provided a 257 ± 51 kg CW. Nearly 50 % of the cows fell within the BCS range of 2. 75 to 3. 50, and the carcasses were mostly graded in the lowest class of conformation and fatness scores. <b>Cull</b> <b>cows</b> from free-stall farms had a higher DP, carcass conformation score and price than those from traditional tie-stall farms. The breed influenced the AGE, live animal characteristics and carcass traits. Cows from dairy breeds were younger at slaughter, had a lower BCS and fleshiness, and greater body measurements, but a lower DP and carcass price than those from dual-purpose breeds, although differences between the breeds were found within both groups. The age of the cows at slaughter influenced the Calv_Cull and increased the BW, body measurements and CW, but not the fleshiness and fatness appreciation (both in vivo and postmortem) or carcass price. The increasing Calv_Cull improved the BW, BCS, fleshiness, CW and carcass conformation and fatness. In conclusion, the decision to <b>cull</b> dairy <b>cows</b> should also take into account the factors that affect their carcass value in regards to improving the carcass price of cows...|$|R

We used 12 steers and 12 <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> being the categories compounded for six 5 / 8 Ch 3 / 8 Ne animals and six animals 5 / 8 Ne 3 / 8 Ch. The average age of animals at the end of the experimental period was 23 and 68 months for steers and <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> respectively. The animals were feedlot-finished until reaching finishing degree for slaughter. The experimental diet had a roughage:concentrate ratio of 40 : 60 (dry matter basis). The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 x 2 (two categories and two genetic groups) factorial scheme. Data were submitted to analysis of variance by proc GLM, being the means classified by test "F" and the parameters with significant effects for interaction between genetic group and category compared by "test t", with 5 % significance level. Slaughter weight (SW) (509. 67 versus 414. 50 kg) and empty body weight (EBW) (433. 01 versus 355. 27 kg, respectively) were higher for cows in relation to steers. The <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> showed higher absolute weight for heart (1. 62 versus 1. 40 kg), liver (7. 07 versus 5. 95 kg) and for total internal organs, digestive tract and blood.

40|$|Abstract: Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} bowel disease, primarily affecting ruminants. The aetiologic agent is Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The disease is characterised by persistent diarrhea, {{weight loss and}} protein-losing enteropathy. Paratuberculosis can cause significant economic loss in affected herds, {{as a result of}} reduced milk yield, increased incidence of mastitis, altered milk constituents, increased somatic cell counts, poor feed conversion, increased susceptibility to disease in general, reduced reproductive efficiency, premature culling and reduced <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> values. The economic impact of paratuberculosis includes production losses due to sub-clinical and clinical cases, losses due to increased replacement of animals and costs of control measures. Due to the fact that most cases of paratuberculosis are subclinical and precise prevalence data are often lacking, it is difficult to assess the economic consequences of paratuberculosis. For instance, estimates of milk production losses are inconsistent. Some studies found equivalent or even higher milk productions in test-positive animals. Other studies showed losses in test-positive animals of up to 19. 5 % of the 0 to 305 days-in-milk production, depending on parity...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{beginning}} body condition scores on returns from feeding cull cows {{was investigated in}} a two year experiment. In each of two culling years, physical performance data and financial data were measured at approximately monthly intervals for culls on pasture versus dry lot. Specifically, data was collected for cows culled in October 2007 and held through April 2008 and for cows culled in October 2008 and held through March 2009. We examine the sensitivity of net returns relative to the choice of body condition score as a sorting trigger for heavy versus thin cows. In this two year study, while a pasture system was generally more profitable than a drylot system, thin cows were typically more profitable than cows with higher BCS, regardless of the feeding system. The importance of the sorting criteria is highlighted in year two. Using the lower BCS criteria for sorting is the only scenario that generates positive net returns, albeit small. Thus, decisions regarding <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> retention and feeding should consider body condition scores. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

Verotoxins were detected in 42. 6 % (95 % CI, 39. 8 % to 45. 4 %), E. coli O 157 :H 7 in 7. 5 % (95 % CI, 6. 1 % to 9. 1 %), and Salmonella in 0. 08 % (95 % CI, 0. 004 % to 0. 5 %) of the fecal samples. In yearling cattle, the median within-lot prevalence (percentage of positive samples within a lot) was 40 % (range, 0 % to 100 %) for verotoxins and 0 % for E. coli O 157 :H 7 (range, 0 % to 100 %) and Salmonella (range, 0 % to 17 %). One or more fecal samples were positive for verotoxins in 80. 4 % (95 % CI, 72. 8 % to 86. 4 %) of the lots of yearling cattle, whereas E. coli O 157 :H 7 were detected in 33. 6 % (95 % CI, 26. 0 % to 42. 0 %) of the lots. In <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> the median within-lot prevalence was 50 % (range, 0 % to 100 %) for verotoxins and 0 % (range, 0 % to 100 %) for E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella (range, 0 % to 0 %). Verotoxins were detected {{in one or}} more fecal samples from 78. 0 % (95 % CI, 70. 4 % to 84. 2 %) of the lots of <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> whereas E. coli O 157 :H 7 were detected in only 6. 0 % (95 % CI, 3. 0 % to 11. 4 %) of the lots of <b>cull</b> <b>cows.</b> The prevalence of verotoxins in fecal samples was lower in yearling cattle than in <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> whereas the prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in fecal samples was higher in yearling cattle than in <b>cull</b> <b>cows.</b> The prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in fecal samples was highest in the summer months. Rumen fill, body condition score, sex, type of cattle (dairy, beef), and distance travelled to the plant were not associated with the fecal prevalence of verotoxins or E. coli O 157 :H 7. The prevalence of verotoxins in fecal samples of <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> was associated with the source of the cattle. It was highest in cows from the auction market (52 %) and farm/ranch (47 %) and lowest in cows from the feedlot (31 %).

Repeated multiple-unit English auctions are created in a laboratory to measure the impact of shared agents on trade prices under alternative treatments with six, and as few as two, agents representing six principals. Treatments are constructed in which the agents either know or do not know quantity for sale, and {{in which there are}} progressively fewer agents bidding. Knowledge of quantity for sale can be anticompetitive. Evolution toward increased market concentration leads to consistent anticompetitive pricing, resulting in prices significantly lower than the predicted competitive equilibrium prices. Key words: English auction, laboratory market, shared agents. In 1998 approximately $ 16. 5 billion of live-stock was traded in the United States through registered firms selling on commission (United States Department of Agriculture 1998). Of this amount, 95 % or $ 15. 7 billion, was purchased by commissioned order buy-ers and dealers. There is a predominant use of dealers and commissioned order buyers in the livestock industries, both of whom may act as agents for multiple principals. 1 The use of shared agents by competing <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> packer-principals has been a cause of concern for livestock sellers and auction market own-ers (United States Department of Agriculture 2001).

Beef breeding values for cow {{survival and}} fertility are predicted with one multiple trait sire model for reappearance, lifespan and calving interval including beef, dairy and crossbred information. Since information on cow survival or reappearance is scarcely available in historical beef data, reappearance curves are proposed as survival indicators for animals {{that did not}} reappear within 300 - 450 days. Different breed effects were accounted for with a regression on the sire and dam breed percentage. Average lifespan for beef breeds was almost 3 years and survival ranged from 0. 73 to 0. 79 in parities 1 to 3. This was slightly lower than for dairy breeds with the difficulty of having more missing and censored records. Reappearance fractions as survival indicator were included in 8. 3 % to 2. 4 % of the censored records in parities 1 to 4. Heritability (first parities only) was 2 % for cow survival and calving interval respectively and 7 % for lifespan; correlations were- 0. 37 and- 0. 47 for reappearance and lifespan with calving interval and 0. 91 for reappearance with lifespan.
