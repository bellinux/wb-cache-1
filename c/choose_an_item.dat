500|$|Neutopia is {{an action}} {{adventure}} game {{which features a}} top-down perspective and labyrinthine exploration {{similar to that of}} The Legend of Zelda. The player controls Jazeta as he sets out to rescue Princess Aurora from Dirth. The game has four levels called spheres which Jazeta must explore and recover the two medallions from each. The medallions are hidden in crypts, where each medallion is guarded by a boss. After collecting all eight of them, Jazeta gains access to the North Pole, where Dirth resides. The player controls Jazeta by moving in any direction with the control pad. Jazeta can also attack with his weapons or use items, scroll through messages, or access the [...] "status screen" [...] with the controller. Jazeta's life meter, the weapons he is currently holding, and the amount of gold and bombs remaining are displayed during gameplay {{on the top of the}} screen. On the status screen, players can <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> to use, see which direction they must travel as indicated by the charmed compass (which also sounds an alarm when Jazeta is near a crypt or a medallion), and view the map of the crypt Jazeta is in, provided they have collected the Crystal Ball inside.|$|E

50|$|Injective f: After we <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> we set it aside, so we can't {{choose it}} again; hence we'll {{end up with}} n {{distinct}} items. Necessarily, then, unless n <= x, no lists can be chosen at all.|$|E
5000|$|Another way {{to think}} {{of some of the}} cases is in terms of sampling, in statistics. Imagine a {{population}} of X items (or people), of which we choose N. Two different schemes are normally described, known as [...] "sampling with replacement" [...] and [...] "sampling without replacement". In the former case (sampling with replacement), once we've <b>chosen</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> we put it back in the population, so that we might choose it again. The result is that each choice is independent of all the other choices, and the set of samples is technically referred to as independent identically distributed. In the latter case, however, once we've <b>chosen</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> we put it aside so that we can't choose it again. This means that the act of <b>choosing</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> has <b>an</b> effect on all the following choices (the particular item can't be seen again), so our choices are dependent on one another.|$|R

50|$|Surjective f: After we <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> {{we put it}} back, so {{we might}} choose it again — but at the end, we have to end up having chosen each item at least once. Necessarily, then, unless n >= x, no lists can be chosen at all.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{system was}} used for the game's {{numerous}} sex scenes. There are a total of five interactive sex scenes (and four non-interactive ones) in which the player would <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> to use (hands, lips, etc.) and click on a part of the girl's body, and this would cause her pleasure meter to either increase or decrease. If the player made too many mistakes, then the girl would get upset and leave. If the player filled her meter, then {{they would be able to}} finish the sex scene successfully.|$|E
50|$|Every {{summer the}} show will conduct a Bok-bul-bok {{marathon}}. At certain points in the race, Bok-bul-bok games are placed where the runners <b>chooses</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> which can either benefit them or make them suffer. These could be fish sauce, hot or cold coffee, water, salt-water or other various items. Two of the members are omitted from the race and rides on a truck to be commentators. Their first marathon winner was Lee Seung-gi. Their second annual marathon winner was Kim C who ran the race in a full-length parka.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyze an intra-personal {{game where}} a {{decision-maker}} is summarized by {{a succession of}} selves. Selves may (or may not) have conflicting interests, and earlier selves may have imperfect knowledge of the preferences of future selves. At date 1, self- 1 <b>chooses</b> <b>a</b> menu, at date 2, the preferences of self- 2 realize and self- 2 <b>chooses</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> from the menu. We show that equilibrium choice is consistent with either a preference for flexibility, a preference for betweenness or a preference for systematic re-striction. Overall, the analysis reconciles the decision-theoretic approach of choice over time with the game-theoretic multiple-selves approach...|$|R
40|$|We studied whether, when <b>choosing</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> out of n items, the {{internal}} noise associated with making this choice {{is affected by}} the number of items and/or their spatial arrangement. Each item is represented by a patch of Gabor segments with different orientations; the task is to identify the patch with vertical orientation. The patches are positioned around the clock, and some spatial jitter is applied to each patch. We found an increase in internal noise with the number of patches. Jitter causes higher internal noise compared with no jitter, but different jitter configurations do not affect internal noise...|$|R
50|$|If {{a hunter}} loses all HP in a battle, he/she is not killed. Instead, the hunter is warped to a random {{location}} in the dungeon and his/her maximum HP is reduced by 50%. The hunter will allow the attacker to <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> to take from their inventory, if it is another player. If GON, the monster that appears {{when there are no}} cards left in the deck, defeats the character with the Key Relic, the mission ends and all hunters lose all credits and any relics in their possession.|$|E
50|$|Other deals {{related to}} pricing {{merchandise}} are featured {{in order to}} win a larger prize or cash amounts. Sometimes traders are required to price individual items (either grocery products or smaller prizes generally valued less than $100) within a certain range to win successively larger prizes or a car. Other times traders must <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> that a pre-announced price, order grocery items or small prizes from least to most expensive, or two items with prices that total a certain amount to win a larger prize. These games are not used on the CBS version because of their similarities to The Price is Right.|$|E

Emily {{moves to the}} Red Team with Courtland, and the designers are challenged to design a kitchen {{to be used in}} a photo shoot for a Sears catalog. Each team selects a cultural-theme basket for inspiration, and each designer must <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> from the basket to incorporate into the team design. The Red Team chooses the Italian basket, and the Blue Team selects the French basket. Because the judges believe both teams did so well, no winning team is chosen; Casey is named the winning individual designer. The other four designers each record a hosting presentation. Alex and Emily are the bottom two designers, and Alex is eliminated.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePicking {{sequences}} are {{a natural}} way of allocating indivisible items to agents in a decentralized manner: at each stage, <b>a</b> designated agent <b>chooses</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> {{among those that}} remain available. We address the computational issues of the manipulation of picking sequences by an agent or a coalition of agents. We show that a single agent can compute an optimal manipulation in polynomial time. Then we consider several notions of coalitional manipulation; {{for one of these}} notions, we show that computing an optimal manipulation is easy. We temper these results by giving a nontrivial upper bound on the impact of manipulation on the loss of social welfare...|$|R

5000|$|Brands {{serve to}} connect {{consumers}} to the products they are purchasing either by establishing an emotional connection or {{by creating a}} particular image. It {{has been shown that}} when consumers are forced to <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> from a group in which a familiar brand is present the choice is much easier than when consumers are forced to choose from a group of entirely unfamiliar brands. [...] One MRI study found that there was significantly increased activation in the brain reward centers including the orbitofrontal cortex, the ventral striatum and the anterior cingulate when consumers were looking at sports cars as compared to sedans (presumably because the status symbol associated with sports cars is rewarding in some way). [...] Many corporations have conducted similar MRI studies to investigate the effect of their brand on consumers including Delta Air Lines, General Motors, Home Depot, Hallmark, and Motorola but the results have not been made public.|$|E

40|$|Typically a user prefers <b>an</b> <b>item</b> (e. g., <b>a</b> movie) {{because she}} likes certain {{features}} of the item (e. g., director, genre, pro-ducer). This observation motivates us to consider a feature-centric recommendation approach to item recommendation: instead of directly predicting the rating on items, we predict the rating on the features of items, and use such ratings to derive the rating on <b>an</b> <b>item.</b> This approach offers several ad-vantages over the traditional item-centric approach: it incor-porates more information about why <b>a</b> user <b>chooses</b> <b>an</b> <b>item,</b> it generalizes better due to the denser feature rating data, it explains the prediction of item ratings through the predicted feature ratings. Another contribution is turning a principled item-centric solution into a feature-centric solution, instead of inventing a new algorithm that is feature-centric. This ap-proach maximally leverages previous research. We demon-strate this approach by turning the traditional item-centric la-tent factor model into a feature-centric solution and demon-strate its superiority over item-centric approaches. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the correlation between}} users' satisfaction and diversity within recommenders, especially the fact that diversity increases users' confidence when <b>choosing</b> <b>an</b> <b>item.</b> Understanding the reasons of this positive impact on recommenders is now becoming crucial. Based on this assumption, we designed a user study {{that focuses on the}} utility of this new dimension, as well as its perceived qualities. This study has been conducted on 250 users and it compared 5 recommendation approaches, based on collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and popularity, along with various degrees of diversity. Results show that, when recommendations are made explicit, diversity may reduce users' acceptance rate. However, it helps increasing users' satisfaction. Moreover, this study highlights the need to build users' preference models that are diverse enough, so as to generate good recommendations...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the gradual emergence of visual and conceptual perspective-taking {{between three and}} four-year-old children. We hypothesized {{that the ability to}} perform non-egocentrically on visual perspective-taking would emerge before the ability to perform non-egocentrically on conceptual perspective-taking. Furthermore, we believed that four-year-olds would respond less egocentrically on both tasks in comparison to three-year-olds. We created a visual perspective-taking task, which consisted of identifying the viewpoints of a stuffed bear from a colorful box with distinct sides, and a conceptual perspective-taking task, which consisted of <b>choosing</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> for their mothers between <b>a</b> child <b>item</b> and <b>an</b> adult <b>item.</b> We found no support for our hypothesis regarding differences in performance across both tasks between three and four-year-olds. However, according to a binomial test of significance, we found that visual perspective-taking does emerge before conceptual perspective-taking. Thus, it is conceivable that conceptual perspective-taking requires a higher level of cognitive understanding and reasoning than visual perspective-taking...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} ranking and suggesting popular items based on user feedback that appears in applications such as social tagging and search query suggestions. In particular, {{we assume that the}} user feedback is generated as follows. The system suggests to each user a (small) subset of items from the set of all possible items. The user can then <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> from her suggestion set, or alternatively <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> from the set of all possible items. Using this feedback, the goal is to quickly learn the true popularity of items, and hence being able to suggest items to users that are indeed popular. The difficulty that arises in this context is that making suggestions to users can reinforce the popularity of some items, and hence distort the resulting item ranking. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this problem. We first formally show that suggesting items to users can indeed lead to a skewed popularity ranking of items. We then propose several algorithms for ranking and suggesting items, and study their performance. In addition, we illustrate our results using a numerical cased study that is based on the inferred popularity of tags from a month-long crawl of a popular social bookmarking service. While ”naïve ” algorithms can lead to a skewed ranking, our results suggests that there exist simple algorithms for ranking and suggesting items that lead to good performance...|$|E
40|$|The paging {{problem is}} defined as follows: We are given a {{two-level}} memory system, in which one level is a fast memory, called cache, capable of holding k items, and the second level is an unbounded but slow memory. At each given time step, a request to an item is issued. Given a request to an item p, a miss occurs if p is not present in the fast memory. In response to a miss, we need to <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> q in the cache and replace it by p. The choice of q {{needs to be made}} on-line, without the knowledge of future requests. Our goal is to design a replacement strategy with a small number of misses. In this paper we use the competitive analysis to study online randomized algorithms for paging. Our goal is to show how the concept of work functions, used previously mostly for the analysis of deterministic algorithms, can also be applied, in a systematic fashion, to the randomized case.

30|$|We {{met with}} the student before the {{experiment}} {{and gave her a}} list of food products. We explained that she had to <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> she did not know, then ask for explanations about it through the system. We showed the student the system and explained how the interaction with the system will take place. We also explained to the student that the system will help her understand the target concept and that she was interacting with a human being through the system. We also {{met with the}} wizard before the experiment and specified the behavior to be adopted during the experiment. The wizard received a training to become familiar with the objective of the dialogue, the actions that can be taken, and the database. We explained to the wizard that the dialogue strategy recommended by the system should be followed. We also provided the wizard with the two situations in which the systems’ recommendation can be ignored: (1) the system is asking the wizard to take the same action twice or more and the wizard knows that the action will not change the current state of knowledge and will keep the dialogue in the same state; (2) the agent is asking the wizard to present an information to the student while the information is unavailable.|$|E
50|$|A library card {{can refer}} to several cards {{traditionally}} used {{for the management of}} books and patrons in a library. In its most common use, a library card serves similar functions as a membership card. A person who holds a library card has borrowing or other privileges associated with the issuing library. The library card also serves as a method of identification. When <b>a</b> person <b>chooses</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> to borrow and presents his or her library card to the library, he or she takes responsibility for the borrowed item and promises to abide by certain rules, usually including a promise to return the item by the due date or face a library fine. If the cardholder violates these responsibilities, his or her borrowing privileges may be suspended. As of 2011, 62% of all Americans are library cardholders.|$|R
40|$|Online {{transactions}} (e. g. {{buying a}} book) typically involve {{a number of}} steps spanning several pages. Conducting such transactions under constrained interaction modalities as exemplified by small screen mobile device is a strenuous, fatigueinducing activity. But usually one needs to browse only a small fragment of a Web page to perform a transactional step (e. g. <b>choosing</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> from <b>a</b> search results list). We exploit this observation to develop an automata-based process model for online transactions that succinctly captures the transactional steps delivering only the “relevant” page fragments at each step. We realize this model by coupling techniques from content analysis of Web documents, automata learning and statistical classification. This process model and associated techniques have been incorporated into Guide-O-Mobile, a prototype system that facilitates online transactions with limited display size mobile device. Performance of Guide-O-Mobile and its user experience is reported...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{assigning}} indivisible items under the following constraints: 1) each item belongs {{to one of the}} p categories, 2) each agent is required to get exactly one item from each category, 3) no free disposal, and 4) no monetary transfer. We first characterize serial dictatorships by a minimal set of 3 properties: strategy-proofness, non-bossiness, and category-wise neutrality. Then, we analyze a natural extension of serial dictatorships called sequential allocation mechanisms, which allocates the items in muitple stages according to a given or-der over all (agent,category) pairs, so that in each stage, the designated agent <b>chooses</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> from the designated cate-gory. We then focus on the cases where each agent is either optimistic or pessimistic, and for any sequential allocation, we characterize a tight lower bound on the rank of the allo-cated bundle for each agent...|$|R

We present two results: we first show that the competitive ratio of the marking algorithm is exactly 2 Hk− 1. Previously, it was known to be between Hk and 2 Hk. Then we provide a new, Hk-competitive algorithm for paging. Our algorithm, as well as its analysis, is simpler than the known algorithm by McGeoch and Sleator. Another advantage of our algorithm is that it can be implemented with complexity bounds independent of the number of past requests: O(k 2 logk) memory and O(k 2) time per request...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{including}} humans {{engage in}} goal-directed behavior flexibly {{in response to}} items and their background, which is called contextual behavior in this review. Although the concept of context has long been studied, there are differences among researchers in defining and experimenting with the concept. The current review aims to provide a categorical framework within which not only the neural mechanisms of contextual information processing but also the contextual behavior can be studied in more concrete ways. For this purpose, we categorize contextual behavior into three subcategories as follows by considering the types of interactions among context, item, and response: contextual response selection, contextual item selection, and contextual item-response selection. Contextual response selection refers to the animal emitting different types of responses to the same item {{depending on the context}} in the background. Contextual item selection occurs when there are multiple items that need to be chosen in a contextual manner. Finally, when multiple items and multiple contexts are involved, contextual item-response selection takes place whereby the animal either <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> or inhibit such a response depending on item-context paired association. The literature suggests that the rhinal cortical regions and the hippocampal formation play key roles in mnemonically categorizing and recognizing contextual representations and the associated items. In addition, it appears that the fronto-striatal cortical loops in connection with the contextual information-processing areas critically control the flexible deployment of adaptive action sets and motor responses for maximizing goals. We suggest that contextual information processing should be investigated in experimental settings where contextual stimuli and resulting behaviors are clearly defined and measurable, considering the dynamic top-down and bottom-up interactions among the neural systems for contextual behavior...|$|E

40|$|Given {{that human}} memory is fallible, {{it is likely}} {{adaptive}} for people to preferentially encode, retain, and retrieve important items better than insignificant ones. Using a dynamic decision-making paradigm with a response deadline, we find that humans demonstrate a bias to better remember 1) items with positive rather than negative value, and 2) items with high-magnitude values. Performance was greater when participants were shown all item-value pairs simultaneously, and were thus able to selectively attend to high-magnitude values. The same magnitude bias is observed for sequentially studied positive items, but not for negative items. Decision trajectories show participants sometimes change their minds {{during the course of}} <b>a</b> trial, <b>choosing</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> after first moving toward the other. Changes of heart occurred more often for trials with negative items. These findings suggest that memory is sensitive to value, and that real-time game paradigms can be used to reveal dynamic memory processes...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} a general class of allocation problems called categorized domain allocation problems (CDAPs), where indivisible items from multiple categories are allocated to agents without monetary transfer and each agent gets {{at least one}} item per category.

We characterize serial dictatorships for basic CDAPs by a minimal set of three axiomatic properties: strategy-proofness, non-bossiness, and category-wise neutrality. Then, we propose a natural extension of serial dictatorships called categorial sequential allocation mechanisms (CSAMs), which allocate the items in multiple rounds: in each round, the active agent <b>chooses</b> <b>an</b> <b>item</b> from <b>a</b> designated category.
