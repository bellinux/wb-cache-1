40|$|Background: Facilitated by Community Outreach Centre, the Packaging Design {{class of}} Visual Communication Design major at Petra Christian University {{implements}} Service-Learning Program to assist micro-industries that have {{joined in the}} Family Empowerment and Welfare Program in Kabupaten Kediri. Students, in cooperation with lecturer assist micro-industries in solving the problems of how they market their products, due to the poor <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> design. Short after finishing the Service-Learning program, we find that micro-industries undergo some difficulties in implementing student’s packaging design. Aim: This study investigates the impact of packaging design Service-Learning project for micro-industries in Kediri. {{and how much it}} contributes the Family Empowerment and Welfare Program. Sample: Ten micro-industries are interviewed, from total population 12 manufacturers. There are totally 13 products are examined. Method: A research using qualitative method to know how much impact did our Service- Learning has on supporting the program. Researchers visit every respondent’ home industries and do in-depth interview in each of them. Result: The examination result show that Service-Learning is utterly beneficial. However, we find some obstacles that made micro-industries are not well motivated to implement the students’ packaging design. Conclusion: Many of producers’ expect that this program progressively persist. Family Empowerment and Welfare Center in Kediri fully nourish this Service-Learning Program. We have applied some condition to fulfill the expectation of the community and benefit all the participants of Service-Learning. Key words: Service-Learning, Family Empowerment and Welfare Program...|$|E
