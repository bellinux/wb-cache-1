25|$|By the mid-twentieth century, copper oxide-based paints {{could keep}} a ship out of drydock {{for as much}} as 18 months, or as little as 12 in {{tropical}} waters. The shorter service life was due to rapid leeching of the toxicant, and chemical conversion into less toxic salts which accumulated as a crust which would inhibit further leaching of active <b>cuprous</b> <b>oxide</b> from the layer under the crust.|$|E
25|$|Antifouling {{coatings}} {{are often}} used on nylon nets because the process is more economical than manual cleaning. When nylon nets are coated with antifouling compounds, the coatings repel biofouling {{for a period of}} time, usually between several weeks to several months. However, the nets eventually succumb to biofouling. Antifouling coatings containing <b>cuprous</b> <b>oxide</b> algaecide/biocide are the coatings technology used almost exclusively in the fish farming industry today. The treatments usually flake off within a few weeks to six to eight months.|$|E
50|$|Eraclius’ De Coloribus et Artibus {{includes}} {{instructions for}} creating {{green and red}} glass by adding copper (probably {{in the form of}} ore or copper filings) to the batch, a method practiced since ancient times. (The chapters on how to make red, green and blue glass are missing from De Divers Artibus.)As with the iron/manganese colours, the colours formed by the addition of copper oxide to the glass are dependent on the different oxidation states of the added copper. In an oxidising environment blue cupric (Cu2+) ions are formed, in a strongly reducing environment red colloidal <b>cuprous</b> (Cu1+) <b>oxide</b> is formed and if reoxidised then green <b>cuprous</b> (Cu1+) <b>oxide</b> results.|$|R

The structure consists of micro bumps with a width of 50 ?m and {{a height of}} 100 ?m, and nanoporous structures with a size of 70 – 150 nm on the micro bumps. XRD and XPS results confirm that these {{hierarchical structure}}s were made of Cu 2 O. For use in comparison, three additional structures with feature size in milliscale, microscale, and nanoscale were also prepared respectively by the proposed methods.

40|$|The role of {{temperature}} on the oxidation dynamics of Cu 2 O on ZnO (0001) was investigated during the oxidation of Cu (111) /ZnO (0001) {{by using the}} oxygen plasma as oxidant. A transition from single crystalline Cu 2 O (111) orientation to micro-zone phase separation with multiple orientations was revealed when the oxidation temperature increased from 300 ◦C to higher. The experimental results clearly showed the effect of oxidation temperature {{with the assistance of}} oxygen plasma on changing the morphology of Cu (111) film and enhancing the lateral nucleation and migration abilities of <b>cuprous</b> <b>oxides.</b> A vertical top-down oxidation mode and a lateral migration model were proposed to explain the different nucleation and growth dynamics of the temperature-dependent oxidation process in the oxidation of Cu (111) /ZnO (0001) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{application}} of copper fungicide {{has been shown}} to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria. Metalaxyl (Ridomil) and <b>cuprous</b> <b>oxide</b> (Perenox) were identified to be successful in increasing the number of harvested healthy pod compared to the {{application of}} fosetyl aluminium (Aliete) and control treatment. On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October.|$|E

2500|$|Normal (p–n) diodes, which {{operate as}} {{described}} above, are usually made of doped silicon or, more rarely, germanium. Before {{the development of}} silicon power rectifier diodes, <b>cuprous</b> <b>oxide</b> and later selenium was used. Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7V per [...] "cell", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often {{an extension of the}} diode's metal substrate), much larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all diodes are the p–n diodes found in CMOS integrated circuits, which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.|$|E

40|$|Black oxide is a {{conversion}} coating applied onto copper surface {{to improve the}} interface adhesion with polymeric adhesives and moulding compounds. State-of-the-art analytical instruments, including SEM, TEM, XPS, AFM, XRD, Goniometry, TEM, Dynamic SIMS and RBS were employed to characterize the coated surface and interphase with glob top resins. It {{was found that the}} copper oxide layer consists of cupric and <b>cuprous</b> <b>oxides</b> with a continuous change of oxide composition from the top surface to the inside without a distinct boundary in between. Crystallinity of the oxides was barely detected directly from the black oxide coated copper. The cupric oxide exist {{in the form of a}} long, fibril structure on nanoscopic scale. The interface bond strength between the copper oxide and glob-top resin increased rapidly in the low range of oxide thickness and became almost constant with further increase in oxide thickness. A functionally similar dependence of oxide thickness and interface adhesion on treatment time was also revealed. Fracture occurred mainly within the oxide layer for black oxide coated substrate (i. e. cohesive failure of black oxide), while fracture tended to occur along the coating-resin interface (i. e. adhesive failure) once the coated surface is debleeded by sandblasting...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis review {{introduces}} {{our study}} {{on the development of}} Cu-based nanoparticles suitable as fillers in the metal–metal bonding process. Colloid solutions of various nanoparticles such as <b>cuprous</b> iodide, cupric <b>oxide</b> (CuO), CuO mixed with silver oxide (Ag 2 O/CuO), cuprous-oxide (Cu 2 O), metallic Cu, plolypyrrole-coated metallic Cu, and metallic Cu containing metallic Ag (Ag/Cu) were prepared by liquid phase processes such as reduction and a salt–base reaction. Metal–metal bonding properties of their powders were evaluated by sandwiching the particle powder between metallic discs, annealing them at a pressure of 1. 2  MPa, and measuring the shear strength required for separating the bonded discs. Various particles (above-mentioned), various metallic discs (Cu, Ag, and Ni), various bonding temperatures (250 – 400  °C), and different atmospheres in bonding (H 2 and N 2) were examined to find nanoparticle filler suitable for metal–metal bonding. As a result, it was confirmed that the metallic Cu, the CuO, the Ag 2 O/CuO, and the Ag/Cu particles were suitable for CuCu bonding in H 2, low-temperature CuCu bonding in H 2, AgAg bonding in H 2, and CuCu bonding in N 2, respectively.

30|$|In recent times, {{the union}} between {{nanotechnology}} and biology has shaped a new ground of nanobiotechnology that integrates {{the use of}} biological bodies (i.e., bacteria, fungi, viruses, yeasts and plants) {{in a number of}} chemical and physical processes [1 – 4]. Green synthesis of nanomaterials using plant extract has emerged as a facile and viable route to traditional (chemical and physical) methods [1 – 3, 5]. Syntheses of nanoparticles (NPs) through nanobiotechnology processes have a significant potential to boost NPs production without the use of harsh, toxic, and expensive chemicals [2, 5, 6]. Studies have established that biomolecules identified from biological organisms can be used to control the nucleation and development of the inorganic nanostructures [3, 4, 7]. Metal oxide nanocomposites have shown great interest in many scientific fields [5 – 8]. Among others, copper and zinc oxide nanocomposites have attracted more attention due to their unique properties [6, 9 – 14]. In this view, novel Punica granatum L- binary (Cu/Cu 2 O) and ternary (Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO/ZnO) nanoscale materials in one dimension such as nanocubes, nanorods and nanoplatelets have been prepared via the green route. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an important n-type semiconductor with a bandgap energy of 3.37  eV, and it also has interesting chemical, acoustic, optical and electrical properties [9, 10, 15 – 17] whereas the p-type <b>cuprous</b> (I) <b>oxide</b> (Cu 2 O—band gap of ~ 1.2  eV) and cupric (II) oxide (CuO—band gap of ~ 1.7  eV) have shown massive significance in the fields of gas sensing, optoelectronics, catalysis and solar cells and exhibit good photoconductive, photovoltaic and in many other fields [6, 10, 18, 19]. The production of copper and zinc nanocomposite with controllable sizes, shapes and surface properties is vital for exploring copper-zinc-based nano-oxides for different applications. There are numerous reports on chemically and physically prepared nanocrystalline copper-zinc based oxides [1, 10, 15, 20]. Deraz et al. reported the synthesis and characterisation of new copper-based nanocomposite using glycine-assisted combustion method [7] while in his paper (Habibi et al.) [21] fabricated and characterised ternary CuO-ZnO-Cu 2 O nanocomposites by Sol-Gel Route at different temperatures [22]. Meanwhile, Sasmal and other produced ternary Cu 2 O-Cu-CuO nanocatalyst with astonishing activities for 4 -nitrophenol reduction in aqueous solution and synthesised catalytic Cu/Cu 2 O NPs prepared in aqueous medium [23, 24]. However, as far as we know, there are no green prepared binary/ternary copper-zinc oxide nanocomposites which have been reported. Therefore, the first-time green synthesised Cu/Cu 2 O and Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO/ZnO nanocomposite reveals a new route of synthesising the binary and ternary metal oxides relative to the chemical/physically modified routes. In this work, the nanocomposite will be used as a potential transducer for various applications, i.e., energy storage devices and catalysis. Further, the investigation will dwell much on the structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of the prepared Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO/ZnO system. Lastly, it will include the determination of a plausible mechanism of interaction between the biological entities and the nanocomposites.|$|R

5000|$|Poling is a {{metallurgical}} method {{employed in}} the purification of copper which contains <b>cuprous</b> <b>oxide</b> as an impurity {{and also in the}} purification of tin ("Sn") which contains tin oxide (stannic oxide or [...] "SnO2") as an impurity. The impure metal, usually in the form of molten blister copper, is placed in an anode furnace for two stages of refining. [...] In the first stage, sulfur and iron are removed by gently blowing air through the molten metal to form iron oxides and sulfur dioxide. The iron oxides are skimmed or poured {{off the top of the}} copper and the gaseous sulfur dioxide exits the furnace via the off-gas system. Once the first oxidation stage is complete, the second stage (reduction or poling) begins. This involves using a reducing agent, normally natural gas or diesel (but ammonia, liquid petroleum gas, and naphtha [...] can also be used), to react with the oxygen in the copper oxide to form copper metal. In the past, freshly cut ("green") trees were used as wooden poles. The sap in these poles acted as the reducing agent. The heat of the copper makes the pole emit a gas that reduces the <b>cuprous</b> <b>oxide</b> to copper.|$|E
