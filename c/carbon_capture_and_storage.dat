5|$|In 2006 Drax Power Limited, in {{response}} to a government consultation, stated they were sponsoring development studies into <b>carbon</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> (CCS), but noted that it was not then commercially viable, with costs comparable with nuclear or offshore wind power. On 17 June 2009, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband announced plans to require all UK coal-fired power stations should be fitted with CCS technology by the early 2020s or face closure.|$|E
5|$|The station {{would have}} had an {{efficiency}} of 46%, which in comparison to conventional subcritical coal-fired power stations, equates {{to a reduction in}} carbon dioxide (CO2) of 23% per unit of electricity generated. The station would have utilised pollution abatement and gas cleaning systems, including selective catalytic reduction, to remove nitrogen oxide, and Flue-gas desulphurisation, to remove sulphur dioxide. The station would also have been able to allow the installation of <b>Carbon</b> <b>Capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>Storage</b> (CCS) technology, when it becomes technically and commercially viable. There was also a possibility that the station may have co-fired biomass, and cogenerated heat as a combined heat and power plant.|$|E

40|$|Gasification {{appears to}} be the way of {{processing}} and utilizing coal cleanly. However, currently the main issue of coal utilization is CO 2 production that adversely impacts the environmental sustainability of this process. Some efforts have been made to control and reduce the CO 2 emission in the atmosphere, such as using CCS (<b>Carbon</b> <b>Captured</b> <b>and</b> <b>Storage)</b> or CCU (<b>Carbon</b> <b>Captured</b> <b>and</b> Utilization). As a part of those efforts, this work investigates the effect of utilizing CO 2 in the gasification process. Towards this aim, numerical simulations of single coal particle gasification are conducted. The benefits of adding CO 2 to the gasification process compared to that of air are examined thoroughly. It is found that H 2, CO and CH 4 productions are increased with CO 2 addition thus indicating an improvement in syngas generation from the coal gasification...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} the {{opportunities}} of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) for implementation of <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> of CO 2. Currently, both the technology of <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage,</b> <b>and</b> the flexible instruments to the Kyoto Protocol are developing fast. It is clear that JI and CDM will play a considerable role in achieving the required emission reduction in several countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Increasingly, <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> of CO 2 {{is seen as a}} potentially effective means of mitigating climate change. The flexible instruments under the Kyoto Protocol do not prescribe any technology and only acknowledge reductions in greenhouse gas emission. JI and CDM are currently the only structural policy incentive for <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> projects, especially in non-carbon constrained countries in Eastern Europe and developing countries. In the light of recent discussions on additionality with CDM, the fact that the only incentive for <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> is mitigation of climate change only may well be beneficial. The CDM Executive Board recently rejected most of the submitted baseline methodologies, mostly on the basis of lack of proof of additionality. It is argued that the issues of additionality and baseline methodology development can be resolved for CCS. The permanence and sustainable development criteria could be more problematic. For faster deployment and technology transfer of CCS technologies, it is essential that these issues are resolved...|$|R

25|$|Emissions may {{be reduced}} through more {{efficient}} and higher combustion temperature and through more efficient production of electricity within the cycle. <b>Carbon</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> (CCS) of emissions from coal-fired power stations is another alternative but the technology is still being developed and will increase the cost of fossil fuel-based production of electricity. CCS may not be economically viable, unless the price of emitting CO2 to the atmosphere rises.|$|E
25|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} of a {{coal-fired power plant}} also reduces emissions. For example, emissions can be reduced by upgrading existing plants or building new high-efficiency, low-emissions plants. Such plants emit almost 20% less CO2 than a subcritical unit operating at a similar load. Over the longer term, HELE plants can further facilitate emission reductions because coal-fired plants operating at the highest efficiencies are also the most appropriate option for <b>carbon</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> retrofit.|$|E
