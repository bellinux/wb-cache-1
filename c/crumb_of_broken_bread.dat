Presently Mrs. Verden cleared the supper table, sweeping together a few crumbs {{from the floor}} in the place where Helena had sat, carefully putting her pieces <b>of</b> <b>broken</b> <b>bread</b> under the loaf to keep moist. Then she sat down again. One could see she was keenly alert to every sound. The father had his hand to his head; he was thinking and praying.|$|R
25|$|Communion {{practices}} and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice {{is to have}} small cups of juice and plates <b>of</b> <b>broken</b> <b>bread</b> distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.|$|R

[...] "I will dine with you, but when I say dine, and people ask me to explain, I shall have to say, 'Why, the Sewells still dine at one o'clock, you know,' and laugh over your old-fashioned habits with them. I should like to do differently, and to respect the sacredness <b>of</b> <b>broken</b> <b>bread</b> {{and that sort of}} thing; but I'm trying to {{practise}} with every one an affectionate sincerity, which is perfectly compatible not only with the brotherliness of Christianity, but the politeness of the world."

25|$|Generally {{a loaf of}} leavened {{bread is}} used as an emblem of Christ's body – though many {{assemblies}} use unleavened bread or matzos. After giving thanks for the loaf, it is broken and circulated to the quiet, seated congregation. Congregants will break off small pieces, or take small pieces <b>of</b> <b>broken</b> unleavened <b>bread,</b> as it is passed, and eat them individually (i.e. not waiting for a group invitation to consume it together). At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|R
60|$|Years {{seemed to}} have passed over the girl in those few days. She had drunk <b>of</b> pain and <b>broken</b> <b>bread</b> with sorrow. Her face was pale and strained, with bluish, {{transparent}} shadows under her large wistful eyes, out of which the dream and laughter of girlhood had gone, but into which had come the potent charm of grief and patience. Thomas Gordon had shaken his head bodingly when he had looked at her that morning at the breakfast table.|$|R

Always {{after every}} dinner and supper all the {{brothers}} should give thanks to God in silence, {{if the church}} is near to the palace where they eat, {{and if it is}} not nearby, in the place itself. With a humble heart they should give thanks to Jesus Christ who is the Lord Provider. Let the remains <b>of</b> the <b>broken</b> <b>bread</b> be given to the poor and whole loaves be kept. Although the reward of the poor, which is the kingdom of heaven, should be given to the poor without hesitation, and the Christian faith doubtless recognises you among them, we ordain that a tenth part of the bread be given to your Almoner.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a bright}} Sunday morning of early summer, {{promising}} heat, but with a fresh breeze blowing. All {{the windows of the}} boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes. The belfry of George's Church sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands. Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind. Mrs. Mooney sat in the straw arm-chair and watched the servant Mary remove the breakfast things. She made Mary collect the crusts and pieces <b>of</b> <b>broken</b> <b>bread</b> to help to make Tuesday's bread-pudding. When the table was cleared, the <b>broken</b> <b>bread</b> collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night before with Polly. Things were as she had suspected: she had been frank in her questions and Polly had been frank in her answers. Both had been somewhat awkward, of course. She had been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been made awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother's tolerance.|$|R
