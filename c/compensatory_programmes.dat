40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to analyse the likely effects of {{compensatory}} social programmes such as Misiones Bolivarianas on community organisations in barrios and their participation in the planning and implementation of barrio upgrading projects, based on the case of the CAMEBA project in Caracas, Venezuela. The low level of community (target group) participation in Project CAMEBA has been compounded by a profoundly paternalistic approach of the national government that promised immediate relief and benefits in the form of <b>compensatory</b> <b>programmes</b> thus reinforcing habitual dependency amongst the poor people. These immediate-benefit programmes seem to have had an inhibiting effect on the community organisation and participation in the upgrading project, which had long term objectives and had aspired to create sustainable self-reliant communities in the project’s intervention areas. Such conclusion is reinforced by the results of the survey, which clearly shows that the awareness of the community regarding <b>compensatory</b> <b>programmes</b> is by and large greater than that of the upgrading project, even though project CAMEBA implementation started about four years before the apperance of the Misiones Bolivarianas. This situation has somehow hindered the process of community organisation which in any case involves training of communities to be legitimate and autonomous by getting rid of their chronic dependency syndrome.

Specifically, it examines the effects of race attitudes (i. e., symbolic racism, oldfashioned racism, racial affect and stereotypes) on attitudes towards racial policies such as affirmative action, busing and fair housing laws, among others. Furthermore, the effects of specific policy types (i. e., preferential treatment, <b>compensatory</b> <b>programmes,</b> desegregation and general legal policies) on racial policy attitudes were also examined. Finally, {{as a matter of}} interest, a racial attitude by racial policy type interaction was also analysed. 28 studies (N = 187 191, 216 effect sizes) were collected for analyses. Overall, results indicate that there is in fact a statistically significant correlation between race prejudice and racial policy attitudes. In terms of racial attitudes, all four dimensions of racial attitude types were significantly correlated with racial policy opinions, with symbolic racism presenting the strongest relationship. All four racial policy types were also significantly correlated with the four racial attitudes...|$|E
40|$|Volleyball is a sport {{with great}} {{unilateral}} load {{that can have}} a negative impact on a postural system. The aim of the study was to perform a detailed examination of posture and muscle imbalance in elite female volleyball athletes and, according to the results of the examination, to put together compensatory exercises and to assess their effect. A group of elite junior female volleyball players (n = 12) was examined by an experienced physiotherapist using a complex kinesiological analysis especially focused on body posture (from frontal, sagittal and dorsal plane), shortened muscles and performance of basic movement patterns (hip extension, hip abduction, sit-up, cervical flexion, shoulder abduction, push-up). The preliminary examination showed that every tested player had some kind of posture deficiency. The <b>compensatory</b> <b>programme,</b> consisting of breathing techniques, stretching exercises, strengthening exercises with an elastic band, and balance exercises with a Bosu balance trainer, was applied at the end of every training session over the competitive parts of two volleyball seasons. Before the application of the exercise programme we found flat back in 92 % subjects, whereas 33 % of subjects exhibited it after compensation. Improvement was noted in the intensified lumbar lordosis (from 50 % subjects to 42 %), and scoliotic body posture (from 50 % to 17 %). The biggest improvement in shortened muscles in the upper body was observed on the m. levator scapulae (from 83 % subjects to 8 %) and the m. trapezius (from 42 % subjects to 8 %); and in the lower body m. triceps surae (from 75 % subjects to 33 %) and hip abductors (from 83 % subjects to 25 %). The study suggests that balance exercises with a Bosu balance trainer and exercises with an exercise elastic band seem to be useful for volleyball since we noted improvement in body posture, movement patterns and muscle shortness. We therefore highly recommend this <b>compensatory</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to prove, that {{compensatory}} exercise affects positively locomotor system of SK Benešov U 16 football players. Theoretical part of this theses analyses all existing sources and literature {{from the field of}} compensatory exercises, muscle imbalance and body posture. Main research-method used in this thesis is an experiment. I choosed football players from the younger adolescents footballers category U 16 and U 17 of the team SK Benešov. Football players from group U 16 are the experimental group, while the others from U 17 are the controlling group. To test the locomotor system I have chosen testing methods for unstreched and weakened muscles invented by Janda, Kabelíková and Vávrová. To test the body posture I used Matthias's test. Suitable <b>compensatory</b> <b>programme</b> was created for the players, with regard to entrance testing, which they had to apply for six months. In the middle of the testing period a control testing was conducted, to help to evaluate the correctness of the chosen exercises. After the evaluation of the final testing a conclusion was drawn, that the compensatory exercises do {{have a positive impact on}} locomotive system and body posture of football players U 16.

Increasingly, pathologists {{are required to}} interpret molecular profiles of tumour specimens to target new treatments. This is challenging because cancer is a heterogeneous disease— tumours change over time in individual patients and genetic lesions leading from preneoplasia to malignancy can differ substantially between patients. For childhood tumours of the nervous system, the challenge is even greater, because tumours arise from progenitor cells in a developmental context {{different from that of}} the adult, and the cells of origin, neural progenitor cells, show considerable temporal and spatial heterogeneity during development. Thus, the underlying mechanisms regulating normal development of the nervous system also need to be understood. Many important advances have come from model mouse genetic systems. This review will describe several mouse models of childhood tumours of the nervous system, emphasising how understanding the normal developmental processes, combined with mouse models of cancer and the molecular pathology of the human diseases, can provide the information needed to treat cancer more effectively...|$|E

40|$|This paper, {{authored}} by Bassam Fattouh and Laura El-Katiri {{and published by}} the United Nations Development Programme, explores the issue of energy subsidies in the Arab World. The authors argue that while energy subsidies {{may be seen as}} achieving social objectives (such as expanding energy access and protecting poor households’ incomes); economic objectives (such as fostering industrial growth and smoothing domestic consumption); and political objectives (such as distributing the oil and natural gas rents to the population), they are a costly and inefficient way of doing so. Energy subsidies distort price signals, with serious implications on efficiency and the optimal allocation of resources. Energy subsidies also tend to be regressive, with high-income households and industries benefiting proportionately most from low energy prices. However, despite such adverse effects, energy subsidies constitute an important social safety net for the poor {{in many parts of the}} Arab world, and any attempts to reduce or eliminate them in the absence of <b>compensatory</b> <b>programmes</b> would lead to a decline in households’ welfare and erode the competitiveness of certain industries. Therefore, a critical factor for successful reforms will be the ability of governments to compensate their populations for the reduction or removal of subsidies through carefully designed mitigation measures. It is argued that reform of energy pricing mechanisms in the Arab world may be seen as beneficial from more than one perspective. Nevertheless, this paper recognises that the current political climate in the region will render the reform of domestic energy prices difficult in practice, such that reform may indeed be a medium- to long-term endeavour...|$|E

40|$|Research results, {{connected}} with learning difficulties in maths, {{show that the}} achievements in maths {{have a significant effect}} on one's educational success, their employment possibilities, and also their mental health. One of the most frequent difficulty in maths is learning arithmetics. With the students, who have learning difficulties in arithmetics, the arithmetic facts are not sufficiently automatized and neither are the procedures in algorithm for arithmetic operations. This is the most common reason for learning difficulties through the whole elementary school period, so the students need specific approaches and more intensive learning of different strategies. An efficient method of work with the students with learning difficulties in maths is group support on the third level of Slovene 5 -step model of learning support (response to intervention) to students with learning difficulties. It enables more students to get support and also an interaction between them, which has an important effect on learning progress. Multilevel models of support enable an efficient recognition of the students, who are at risk for being unsuccessful in maths or other subjects, and more efficient and intensive forms of support, which are organized and given earlier than the common forms of support. The basic aim of my post graduate paper was to build a <b>compensatory</b> <b>programme</b> of development of arithmetic knowledge and skills for the third-grade students with learning diffculties in arithmetics, and to form a model of support, which included group support and peer tutoring on the third level of the 5 -step model of learning support to students with learning difficulties. The programme included practice of arithmetic knowledge and skills in a group, with the integration of the peer tutoring, and practice of arithmetic facts and procedures in algorithm on the computer with an aim to reduce or eliminate learning difficulties with the third-grade students in arithmetics, and so prevent the low achievement levels in arithmetics in higher grades of primary school education. There were 16 students with learning difficulties in arithmetics, who were integrated in the group support on the third level of the 5 -step model of learning support. They represented an experimental group (group 1). There were 14 other students with learning difficulties in arithmetics, who did not receive our support, and they represented group 2. In group 3 there were 209 students, who did not have any learning difficulties in arithmetics. In the research we used different metric instruments, with which we assessed arithmetic and counting abilities, number knowledge, organizational skills and learning styles of the students. The collected data were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively according to the aim of the study and the research hypotheses. We made basic parametric statistics to describe the pattern and to present the whole pattern of variables, frequency arrangement of all variables and arithmetic mean, standard deviations for numerically presented answers, t-test, Levene's F-test of equality of variances and discriminative analysis. The results showed that the students in group 1 (experimental group) showed a statistically important progress in automatization of the arithmetic procedures in algorithm, in addition and substraction to 100 and 1000, and in automatization of multiplication. Practice of arithmetic knowledge and skills in group and with integration of peer tutoring, and the practice of arithmetic facts and procedures in algorithm on the computer resulted in a bigger number of transformational strategies and recall of facts, and accuracy in procedure implementation in algorithm and recall of facts. At the end of the programme there were also statistically important differences between the group 1 and the group 2 (control group) in the automatization of arithmetic facts and procedures in algorithm, in addition and substraction to 100 and 1000, and in automatization of multiplication. The progress of the group 1 was also seen at a final testing at the end of the programme, since the differences between the group 1 and the group 3 (students without learning difficulties in maths) did not prove statistically important at a test which assessed arithmetic facts and procedures with the sums for 1 and 2 points. The results of variance and discriminative analysis show that there are statistically important differences between the students from the group 1 and the group 2 in test results. We can make an efficient identification and a diagnostic evaluation of the students with learning difficulties in arithmetic with Ten-minutes arithmetic test for assessing arithmetic facts and procedures (Kavkler, Tancig, Magajna, Rugelj in Lipec-Stopar, 1996), a test Manual Mathematics Screening III (Adler, 2000), and Number Knowledge Test (Griffin, 2002). Research and development of models of support to the students with learning difficulties with an emphasis on group support and peer tutorinh on the third level of the 5 -step model of learning support (to the students with learning difficulties at elementary school represents an important contribution to scientific development of special and rehabilitation pedagogy. In the empirical part the paper contributes to development of pedagogic theory and practice with a presentation of an example of good practice how to give support to the students with learning difficulties in arithmetics. Applied contribution of the paper is in building the <b>compensatory</b> <b>programme</b> of development of arithmetic knowledge and skills for the third-grade students with learning diffculties in arithmetics. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{policy of}} {{maintaining}} tight control of domestic energy prices has characterized {{the political and}} economic environment in most Arab countries, together with many other parts of the world, for decades. The objectives behind such a policy range from overall welfare objectives such as expanding energy access and protecting poor households’ incomes; to economic development objectives such as fostering industrial growth and smoothing domestic consumption; and to politi- cal considerations, including the distribution of oil and natural gas rents in resource-rich countries. While energy subsidies may be seen as achieving some of a country’s objectives, this paper argues they are a costly and inefficient way of doing so. Energy subsidies distort price signals, with serious implications on efficiency and the optimal allocation of resources. Energy subsidies also tend to be regressive, with high-income households and industries benefiting proportionately most from low energy prices.

40|$|Abstract: Policies {{regarding}} maintaining domestic {{energy costs}} {{have been a}} menacing problem politically and economically within the Arab countries, as well as within {{other parts of the}} world. Many objectives have been put forward to assist with energy conservation. Of these objectives, there have been discussions about expanding residents access to energy sources, which will protect income strapped households; fostering the industrial growth of the energy sector, equally providing each individual with an allotted amount of energy that they are permitted to utilize, as well as enforcing that countries that are rich when it comes to natural gas and oil resources, renting out their resource to other countries that do not have the luxury of these two energy sources. Even though energy subsidies have been established as a means to distribute energy, this paper argues that distributing energy in this fashion is costly and an inefficient process of energy distribution. Energy subsidies contort the price of energy sources for their own personal gain, and not for the gain of the people that require the source but have no means to attain it. Energy subsidies do not render any benefits for median or low income households. Instead, the households that reap the benefits of energy subsidies are high income households and industries. Which high income households and larger corporations are benefiting from paying lower costs for their energy consumption, while households that are struggling to get by are being forced to chip away at the little scraps that they do have. However, despite all of the disadvantages of energy subsidies, they continue to play an important part in the safety net for poor individuals throughout the Arab world and all across the globe. Any attempts to eliminate the subsidies will lead to an absence in <b>compensatory</b> <b>programmes</b> that could in the end cause a further decline of the welfare of households and eliminate the competitive edge that certain industries possess. The only way that a successful reform can be attempted is if the government steps in an...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{successful}} schooling of Roma children remains {{among the major}} unsolved problems within the Slovenian education system. Roma children usually enter primary school without being previously included {{in any kind of}} pre-school education. Their knowledge of the official (Slovenian) language is poor, and their home environment often does not provide adequate living conditions; in most cases, it is quite discouraging for schooling in general. When they enter the school system, Roma children are faced with almost insurmountable difficulties in the acquisition of the required skills and knowledge. Despite the numerous legal solutions (individualization, differentiation, various forms of learning assistance), the gap between the Roma and other children only widens over the years: Roma pupils do not meet the standards of knowledge, they have difficulties in advancing to the next grade and in most cases they quit school (too) early. So far, the research has exposed the social and cultural deprivation as well as the fact that Roma children are in fact speakers of another language as the main reasons for such meagre results. However, the actual linguistic competences of the Roma children remained a black box as there was no empirical research in this field. With this survey, we intended to demonstrate that the proper early literacy development process is indeed crucial for the successful integration of Roma into the education system. Therefore, we wanted to determine the level of reading competences of the Roma pupils {{at the end of the}} third year of elementary school, when the literacy process is supposed to be already completed. In addition, we explored their oral skills; in particular, children’s storytelling has a significant prognostic value in the development of their literacy. The empirical part of the survey was conducted by using standardized tests (Ocenjevalna shema bralnih zmožnosti for reading competences and Preizkus pripovedovanja zgodbe: Žabji kralj for oral competences). It included 30 Roma pupils and 30 of their non-Roma peers from six primary schools in Dolenjska and Bela krajina (both groups were balanced in terms of gender and grade). The results of both tests shed a new light on the (increasingly) large gap between the knowledge of Roma pupils and their non-Roma peers. Namely, the results of Roma pupils both for reading and oral competences were significantly worse in comparison to the control group. Apart from that, the results of Roma children varied significantly in relation to the places they were living. Thus, the results of the quantitative research (and the statistical analysis) offer fresh insights on the differences between Roma and non-Roma children – especially in the light of the contemporary findings about “emergent” and early literacy. In the conclusion, the opportunities to develop new, more appropriate system solutions for literacy development within the school practice, are being discussed. Such solutions are the encouraging of an earlier inclusion of Roma children into the (preschool) education, implementation of <b>compensatory</b> <b>programmes</b> focused on literacy development (both at the preschool stage and at the beginning of elementary school), and additional training of teachers. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Previous {{studies have found that}} West Indian pupils under-achieve in English schools. Unlike other ethnic minorities their "English-speaking" classification often precludes special language assistance. This study investigated the language usage and cultural affiliations of pupils of West Indian descent, using a sample of 241 twelve year olds from 7 schools. A special English test based on differences between Standard English and West Indian Dialect and an Attitude Test based on children's statements about culture, language, race and education were constructed and administered with a Cognitive Test and Anxiety Test. Teachers' views were obtained from a Teachers' Questionnaire. The experimental group was composed of pupils of West Indian descent taught by a <b>compensatory</b> <b>programme</b> that attempted to boost pupils' cultural self-esteem and correct language errors stemming from differences between 'Standard' and 'Dialect'. One control group comprised pupils of West Indian descent who received no special programme. The other was composed of white indigenous English children in similar schools. The main findings of the study were as follows: 1. English Test results indicated significant differences of score between the English and West Indian pupils on key grammar terms. 2. Cultural 'poles' of attitude groupings indicated sharp differences between these groups despite the British birth and education of the pupils of West Indian descent. 3. The experimental group, supposedly withdrawn at random from main group classes for the special cultural and linguistic enrichment programme, expressed unhappy attitudes and obtained significantly lower scores on the English and Cognitive Tests than either of the other groups. 4. Subsequent testing was carried out in the schools from which the experimental group had been obtained. This offered further evidence of the experimental group’s unusual characteristics, and provided additional information in a comparison made with the original control groups. The findings indicate that children of West Indian descent experience some difficulty with elements of language where ‘Standard’ and 'Dialect' differ and that these language elements should be taught in the main class group. The method of withdrawing West Indian pupils for special language and cultural classes is not recommended, as neither linguistic nor cultural benefits were observed and definite contra-indications were noted. Futhermore, 'multiculturalism' appears to be as important for the ethnic majority as for the minorities. Future research could develop the Attitude Test for use in correlative studies with English and other tests. It has been a particularly useful tool for identifying linguistic and cultural attitudes of a minority and has revealed group characteristics not previously identified. The English Test could contribute to the construction of diagnostic tests and lay the basis for a teaching programme based on features of 'Dialect' and ‘Standard’, {{in order to meet the}} needs of pupils of West Indian descent within a multicultural context in an integrated classroom.

40|$|During the {{repeated}} {{execution of the}} swimming strokes, the shoulder adductor and internal rotator muscles {{have a tendency to}} become proportionally stronger when compared to their antagonist group. This can lead to muscle imbalances. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of a <b>compensatory</b> training <b>programme</b> on the strength and balance of shoulder rotator muscles in young swimmers. A randomized controlled trial design was used. Forty male swimmers took part in the study and were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (n = 20) and a training group (n = 20). A control group (n = 16) of young sedentary male students was also evaluated. The experimental group subjects participated in a 16 -week shoulder-strength programme with Thera-Band® elastic bands; the training group was restricted to aquatic training. Peak torque of shoulder internal rotator and external rotator (ER) was measured at baseline and after 16 weeks. Concentric action at 1. 04 rad s− 1 (3 reps) and 3. 14 rad s− 1 (20 reps) was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. The strength- training programme led to an improvement of the ER strength and shoulder rotator balance in the experimental group (data from both shoulders at 1. 04 rad s− 1). Moreover, concentric action at 3. 14 rad s− 1 presented significant differences only for the dominant shoulder. Findings suggest that the prescribed shoulder-strengthening exercises could be a useful training option for young competitive swimmers. They can produce an increase in absolute strength values and greater muscle balance in shoulder rotators...|$|R
40|$|The Penguin {{edition of}} Robin Pedley's The Comprehensive School has {{on its cover}} a piper being {{followed}} {{by a group of}} dancing children. The picture brings to mind the lines of Browning's poem spoken by the lame lad left {{at the entrance to the}} hill through which his mates had passed: It's dull in our town since my playmates left, I can't forget that I'm bereft Of all the pleasant sights they see Which the piper also promised me. The promise of course was of a place where flowers were prettier, birds brighter, dogs faster and bees kinder than ever they'd been. The reader, however, suspecting malice on the piper's part, feels less sadly for the boy who has been so captivated by a promise that is probably false. The Hamelin story is mirrored in the development of comprehensive education in Tasmania. What was promised for education and its outcomes during the debates of the fifties has never been realised. This study looks at the development of comprehensive education in Tasmania. It suggests that the Tasmanian experience of comprehensive education has been marred by a systemic misinterpretation of the principle. It considers the powerful social factors which militate against the realisation of the comprehensive education principle and questions whether the influence of these factors will ever weaken enough to allow it to succeed both in educational terms and with the social promise once expected. Warrane High School, an urban four-year comprehensive High School located east of the Derwent River in southern Tasmania, is the focus of this study because it was in this school that the writer, as Vice-Principal, began to see educational failure in terms of certain social factors which seemed not to accord with the school's educational programme or with the expectations held by the community and the education system itself. The study draws on the writer's experience and observation of the Tasmanian secondary school system and on various data which particularly refer to Warrane High School. In making judgements about the various intellectual and social aspects of the school's population and in assessing its feeder community, it looks at other studies and considers their findings in the light of the expectations held for comprehensive education. In its final stages, the study examines the federal government's <b>compensatory</b> education <b>programmes</b> and then suggests directions that planning for education should take to ensure that the system of education which prevails caters fairly for all children in Tasmania...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{represents an}} attempt to establish some normative data for the oral language performance of native-English speaking children aged 6 years 10 months to 8 years in conversation with an adult, and by examining the performance of Samoan children in the same age-group to determine those areas which discriminate most strongly between the performances of both groups. Children were interviewed individually and the conversations recorded over a thirty-minute period. Tapes were transcribed {{on the same day}} as the recording, and the data quantified according to the procedures of Developmental Sentence Analysis Lee, L. L. and Koenigsknecht 1974, Developmental Sentence Analysis., which established a rank-order for each group. A more detailed analysis of the data was then made in order to identify those areas of development and/or of uncertainty which were common to both groups, and those which appeared only, or mainly, among the Samoan children. The statistical analysis, based on the developmental weighting of syntactic items, (DSS scores) indicated that where errors were specific to the Samoan children they occurred in structures described as early-developing among native-English speaking children. At the higher developmental levels, the performance of Samoan children above the 50 th percentile (for that group) was similar to that of their English speaking age-mates. The classification of error-patterns also distinguished between 'growth errors' (where performance was characterized by over-generalizing or by substitution, for example), and 'deficiency errors' (where morphemes and syntactic items were omitted), the latter occurring more consistently among the Samoan children. In addition, a general indication of language development in relation to chronological age was derived by comparing the DSS scores of the Samoan children falling below the 25 th percentile for that group with those obtained by younger children at the 50 th percentile point for each one-year interval from age 4 to age 6. In the absence of New Zealand DSS norms for these age-levels, it was necessary to use those derived from a study of American children (Lee 1974), but the results are in accord with other New Zealand-based studies (See 0. 1, Introduction) which have noted the "two-year gap" appearing around age 7 among Polynesian children when their achievement on a variety of measures and tests is compared with that of their Pakeha age-mates. In the present study, the "gap" ranged from about 20 months at the 25 th percentile (for the Samoan group) to over 41 months at the 10 th percentile. The general intention has been to sharpen the focus for teachers wishing to develop <b>compensatory</b> language <b>programmes</b> so that effort may be directed to those specific areas where non-native speaking children appear to have missed a developmental stage in their acquisition of English. The findings also suggest that difficulty with certain syntactic structures, semantic concepts, and phonological realizations is a function of age-level and the language-situation for both groups of subjects rather than of the ethnic background of the Samoan group...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} de effects of 16 week compensatory strength training program in shoulder strength and respective conventional ratios (concentric ER/IR). METHODS A total of 40 national level male swimmers were assessed and randomly divided in two groups – experimental group (N= 20) -(age: 14. 65 ± 0. 67 years old, height: 173. 48 ± 6. 87 cm, body mass: 63. 15 ± 5. 68 kg) and control group (N= 20) -(age: 14. 60 ± 0. 60 years old, height: 170. 79 ± 6. 48 cm, body mass: 61. 73 ± 4. 68 kg). Experimental subjects participated in a 16 week shoulder strength program with Thera-Band® elastic bands (3 times a week). The peak-torque of shoulder internal (IR) and external rotators (ER) was measured in both groups at baseline and after 16 weeks. Concentric action at 60 º/s (3 rep) and 180 º/s (20 rep) were measured, in a seated position, with the shoulder at 90 º of abduction and the elbow flexed to 90 º, using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3 – Biodex Corp., Shirley, USA). Anova with repeated measures was used to determine significant main effects in shoulder rotators strength and unilateral ER/IR ratios. The level of significance was set at 0. 05. RESULTS Significant differences were found in all variables that measure the ER shoulder strength at 60 º/s in dominant(DT) (P= 0. 031) and non-dominant(NDT) shoulder (P= 0. 001). Meanwhile concentric action at 180 º/s, only showed significant differences on DT shoulder (P= 0. 032). In respect of ER/IR ratio, a <b>compensatory</b> strength training <b>programme</b> induces significant differences in both shoulders at 60 º/s (DT: P= 0. 001; NDT: P= 0. 001). At 180 º/s we just found significant effects on the DT ER/IR ratio (P= 0. 002). DISCUSSION The results of this study support earlier research [1] that showed that the unilateral shoulder strength ratios increases substantially after a period of a strength training program. Since the ratios describe the quality of muscular balance/imbalance [1], we can conclude that a 16 week compensatory shoulder strength training program using Thera-Band® elastic bands, reduces muscular imbalances in rotator cuff of competitive young swimmers. These results highlight the useful of this kind of compensatory program to prevent shoulder injuries...|$|R

Methods A total of 40 male swimmers were assessed and randomly divided in two groups: experimental group (n= 20; age: 14. 65 ± 0. 67 years old, height: 173. 48 ± 6. 87 cm, body mass: 63. 15 ± 5. 68 kg) and control group (n= 20; age: 14. 60 ± 0. 60 years old, height: 170. 79 ± 6. 48 cm, body mass: 61. 73 ± 4. 68 kg). Experimental subjects participated in a 16 week shoulder strength program with Thera-Band® elastic bands (3 times a week). The external rotator (ER) /internal rotators (IR) ratio and fatigue ratio were measured in both groups at baseline and after 16 weeks. Concentric action at 60 º/s (3 reps) and 180 º/s (20 reps) were measured, in a seated position, with the shoulder at 90 º of abduction and elbow flexion, using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3). The muscular fatigue protocol consisted in 20 maximal-effort repetitions of ER and IR at 180 º/s. Anova with repeated measures was used to determine significant main effects in unilateral ER/IR ratios and fatigue ratios. The level of significance was set at 0. 05. Results Considering ER/IR ratio, a <b>compensatory</b> strength training <b>programme</b> induces significant differences in both shoulders at 60 º/s (Dominant: P= 0. 001; Non dominant: P= 0. 001). At 180 º/s we just found significant effects on the Dominant shoulder ER/IR ratio (P= 0. 002). With respect to fatigue ratios, we found no differences between groups from baseline and 16 weeks. Discussion Our results show that 16 weeks of compensatory strength training improve ER/IR ratio, nevertheless, were not enough to improve fatigue ratios, representing the rotators shoulder muscular resistance. This results support earlier research (Malliou et al., 2004) that showed that the unilateral shoulder strength ratios increases substantially after a period of a strength training program. Since the ratios describe the quality of muscular balance/imbalance (Ellenbecker & Davies, 2004), we can conclude that a 16 week compensatory shoulder strength training program using Thera-Band® elastic bands, reduces muscular imbalances in rotator cuff of competitive young swimmers. These results highlight the useful of this kind of compensatory program to prevent shoulder injuries. References 1. 	Malliou, P. C. Giannakopoulos, K. Beneka, A. G. Gioftsidou, A. and Godolias, G.
