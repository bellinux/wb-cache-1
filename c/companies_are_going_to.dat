40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} unit root test at both {{individual}} company (Dickey-Fuller) and panel (Im-Pesaran-Shin) level, {{in order to provide}} some quantitative evidence of the univariate behaviour of Italian companies' debt-ratio. If it is mean-reverting, then at least a share of <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> behave according to the trade-off model, whereas if it is non-stationary, then companies may behave according to pecking order theory. Individual company test results support the pecking order theory in the case of more than 80 % of firms, while the panel test rejects the unit root null. These contradictory results {{can be explained by the}} heterogeneity of the firms which tends to characterise the entire panel. For this reason, we selected a number of sub-samples in which companies are supposed to follow either the pure trade-off or the pure pecking order model of behaviour. Results confirm that: a) heterogeneity may lead to a false rejection of the pecking order theory in panel unit root tests; b) both trade-off and pecking order theories contribute towards explaining the financial behaviour of Italian companies; c) the testing procedure we propose has the power to reject the pure pecking order model under the null hypothesis, but not the pure trade-off model...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well-known}} and well-studied fact that after the 1979 revolution, Iran's economy went {{through a process of}} fundamental change and as a result a totally different economic system was established. Among the most remarkable changes was the emergence of so-called para-statal organizations, which were supervised by some institution within the state, while not being controlled by the government. Because of their politically strong position, they enjoy many privileges such as tax exemption or easy access to credit. Although deeply {{regarded as one of the}} most striking features of the postrevolution economic system, published studies about para-statal entities have been very limited so far. In this paper, I will focus on one of the biggest para-statal organizations, Mostaz`afan (Oppressed) Foundation.

40|$|The Portuguese {{footwear}} {{industry had}} an excellent economic performance {{in the last six}} years. Innovation, own brands, entry in new markets and new products development are common approaches to the most competitive companies, some of them leaders in the European sector. This industry is traditional, mature and “low-tech”, with two main clusters in Portugal (both clusters are located in the north of Portugal). The paper will analyse the competitive strategies follow by seven footwear companies and will show the areas and components that the companies focus theirs resources and strategies to be more competitive and sustainable. The research methodology was qualitative and the strategy for obtaining data was the case study, with interviews, questionnaires and document analysis. The economic results of the footwear companies studied highlight the differences between all of them and these differences are related with the competitive strategy adopted. Cooperation is very strong in many common projects, coordinated by the sectorial organizations (APICCAPS and CTCP). Private label regime remains dominant in the sector but year by year <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> new directions: own products, own brands and entry in new markets.

40|$|MANY {{people in}} Japan today are having {{serious doubts about}} the future of the big Japanese {{companies}} that for so long maintained a virtual oligopoly in the domestic market. In their view, the majority of these <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have little chance to compete internationally in the face of global competition growing stronger each year. For example, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) 1 was notified in September 1999 by the Financial Reconstruction Commission that the commission had selected New LTCB Partners (Partners), an investment group formed by Ripplewood Holdings and other investors, as the preferred candidate for the acquisition of the LTCB. And at the 33 rd Tokyo Motor Show in the autumn of 1999, the most talked-about topic was neither Toyota's latest hybrid car nor Honda's urban style vehicle, but Mr. Carlos Ghosn, the new chief operating officer of Nissan, who had been brought in from Renault. A lot of Japanese were shocked to see the LTCB coming under the control of a U. S. financial institution and Nissan brought under the umbrella of a French motor company. Immediately they started talking about a “second defeat. ” The expression “second defeat ” implies the failure of Japanese companies to hold out against global competition. The November 1999 issue of Bungei shunju, one of Japan's most widely read monthlies, carried a feature story called “Reorganization of Japan: Only These Companies Can Survive. ” The article maintains that in the manufacturing sector, only the following companies can survive global competition under existing circumstances:...|$|E
40|$|The mineral {{sector has}} crucial {{importance}} for any economy as {{the availability of}} mineral resources in the world finite. The economic development of a nation depends on the availability and utilization of mineral resources. India has a rich variety of minerals and the Government has sole ownership of these resources. There {{are a number of}} Government trading companies engaged in the business of minerals, metals, agro based products and other allied goods at international as well as national level. State Trading Corporation (STC) of India Ltd. and Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) of India Ltd. are the two major trading companies of India involved in the business of minerals, metals, agro products and other allied products. Both companies are the major contributors in the foreign exchange earnings for India. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the financial performance of both companies comparatively from 2002 - 03 to 2011 - 12. Different financial ratios like liquidity, profitability, solvency and activity ratios are used to compare the performance of both companies. Business practices such as export, import and domestic trade have also been considered to measure the operational performance of STC Ltd. and MMTC Ltd. On the basis of financial ratios, the study concluded that liquidity performance of MMTC is better than STC while profit margins of both companies are poor. Return on invested fund of MMTC is as good as compare to STC. The trade practices of both the <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be positively increased...|$|E
40|$|With {{slowdown}} in {{the growth rate of}} petroleum product consumption, petroleum business is maturing and becoming commoditized. In maturing industries, cost leadership and operational excellence is important, but it is not sustainable. Inevitably, competition will squeeze margins, even for the cost leaders. In order to sustain growth, companies should continuously explore potential enlargement of its offering vis-a-vis its competitors and customers' expectation. A set of industry case studies in petroleum, energy utility, steel and airline industries have been performed to identify opportunities for differentiation and to examines how the successful companies manage the innovation in developing sustainable growth strategy. Analysis of industry case study identified some important differentiating factors and approaches. It suggests, in general, that successful companies focus on Customer Solution. The customer solution reflects a shift in strategic attention from product to customer-from product economics to customer economics and customer's experience. To capture a value position and enhance profitability-in other words, to decommoditize the commodity product/service-they redefine its services to reach into the customer's own business to solve more fundamental problems. They segmented the market to better design and deliver tailored, customer-specific services bundled with commodity products. Unless <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> compete mainly on price, value added solutions are a necessity. Innovation, and more importantly effective implementation of innovation, is a prerequisite for a sustainable growth. In conclusion, I made suggestion for one company to achieve sustainable growth and recommendations for future research. by YongTae Lee. Thesis (S. M. M. O. T.)
