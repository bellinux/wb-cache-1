40|$|AbstractTriosephosphate {{isomerase}} deficiency {{is associated}} with the accumulation of dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) to abnormally high levels, <b>congenital</b> <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> and a clinical syndrome of progressive neuromuscular degeneration leading to infant mortality. DHAP degrades spontaneously to methylglyoxal (MG) —a potent precursor of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). MG is detoxified to d-lactate intracellularly by the glyoxalase system. We investigated the changes in MG metabolism and markers of protein glycation, oxidation and nitrosation in a Hungarian family with two germline identical brothers, compound heterozygotes for triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, one with clinical manifestations of chronic neurodegeneration and the other neurologically intact. The concentration of MG and activity of glyoxalase I in red blood cells (RBCs) were increased, and the concentrations of d-lactate in blood plasma and d-lactate urinary excretion were also increased markedly in the propositus. There were concomitant increases in MG-derived AGEs and the oxidative marker dityrosine in hemoglobin. Smaller and nonsignificant increases were found in the neurologically unaffected brother and parents. There was a marked increase (15 -fold) in urinary excretion of the nitrosative stress marker 3 -nitrotyrosine in the propositus. The increased derangement of MG metabolism and associated glycation, oxidative and nitrosative stress in the propositus may be linked to neurodegenerative process in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary xerocytosis (HX) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} {{caused by}} defects of RBC permeability, associated with haemolytic anaemia of variable degree and iron overload. It is sometimes misdiagnosed as hereditary spherocytosis or other <b>congenital</b> <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia.</b> Splenectomy is contraindicated due to increased risk of thromboembolic complications. We report the clinical, haematological, and molecular characteristics of four patients from two unrelated Italian families affected by HX, associated with beta-thalassemia trait and heterozygous pyruvate kinase deficiency, respectively. Two patients had been splenectomised and displayed thrombotic episodes. All patients had iron overload {{in the absence of}} transfusion, two of them requiring iron chelation. The diagnosis of HX was confirmed by LoRRca Osmoscan analysis showing a left-shifted curve. PIEZO 1 gene sequencing revealed the presence of mutation p. E 2496 ELE, showing {{that this is one of}} the most frequent mutations in this disease. The concomitant defects did not aggravate the clinical phenotype; however, in one patient, the initial diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency delayed the correct diagnosis of HX for many years and resulted in splenectomy followed by thrombotic complications. The study underlines the importance of a precise diagnosis in HX, particularly in view of splenectomy, and the need of a molecular confirmation of suspected RBC enzymopathy...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This review {{summarizes}} pathobiochemical {{aspects of}} diseases, in which cytoskeletal components {{play a crucial}} role in pathogenesis. An attempt to classify the disorders on the basis of phenotypic changes that occur in microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubuli was unsuccessful. Three groups of disorders are presented: 1. cytoplasmic inclusions in specific diseases (merely descriptive); 2. diseases with genetic defects in cytoskeletal proteins (a chain of causality from defect to phenotype, in some cases with large gaps); 3. diseases with suspected involvement of cytoskeleton (hypothetical causal chain). Microfilaments are involved in certain pathogenetic processes on account of defects in their associated proteins; in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, dystrophin is defective, while the defective protein in Rett syndrome is synapsin. Defects in spectrin and membrane anchor proteins lead to disorders of the red cell membrane skeleton (<b>congenital</b> <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias).</b> Intermediate filaments accumulate in some types of cytoplasmic inclusions, together with ubiquitin (Mallory bodies, desmin accumulation in some myopathies and others). A pathogenetic interpretation of this phenomenon is lacking. A genetic defect in certain types of keratin is the cause of epidermolysis bullosa. Interesting preliminary results are reviewed that reveal the crucial role o...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Congenital</b> <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> may be {{associated}} with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) -like clinical manifestations. Methods: The cardiovascular system of 14 homozygous and double heterozygous Î²-thalassaemia patients with skin and retinal vessel alterations similar to those in genetic PXE was analysed over a period of 12 years and compared with that of 13 relatives (five sets of parents, one single parent, two thalassaemic brothers), and that of the control group composed of 16, age- and sex-matched, thalassaemic patients. Results: All patients with clinical PXE-like skin lesions exhibited, by light and electron microscopy, dermal alterations and mineralization of elastic fibres identical to those typical of inherited PXE. None of the relatives and none of the control group showed clinical or structural findings of PXE. The follow-up started in 1988. After 12 years of clinical observation, six patients showed dramatic progression of skin involvement, angioid streaks had progressed in two subjects. One patient had recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and underwent partial stomach removal for gastric artery aneurysm, one underwent colon resection for intestinal infarct, one patient had a transitory ischaemic attack, one died after an intracranial haemorrhage, two patients died from cardiovascular disease and one from neoplasia. Conclusions: Thalassaemic patients with PXE-like skin lesions also manifest PXE-like vessel alterations that progress with time. Considering the severe outcome of these lesions, accurate monitoring should be routinely performed on the cardiovascular system of thalassaemic patients with PXE-like skin manifestations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{important}} indication for {{bone marrow}} investigation {{is the presence}} of bone marrow failure, which manifests itself as (pan) cytopenia. The causes of cytopenia are varied and differ considerable between childhood and adulthood. In the paediatric age group, inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are important causes of bone marrow failure but they play only a minor role in later life. This review gives a comprehensive overview of bone marrow failure disorders in children and adults. We classified the causes of bone marrow failure according to the main presenting haematological abnormality, i. e. anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia. The following red cell disorders are discussed: red cell aplasia, sideroblastic <b>anaemia,</b> <b>congenital</b> dyserythropoietic <b>anaemia,</b> <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and megaloblastic anaemia. The neutropenias occur in the context of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, severe congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, immune-related neutropenia and non-immune neutropenia. In addition, the following causes of thrombocytopenia are discussed: congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenia with absent radii, immune-related thrombocytopenia and non-immune thrombocytopenia. Finally, we pay attention to the following pancytopenic disorders: Fanconi anaemia, dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and HIV infection...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia’s</b> are characterised by {{increased}} RBC destruction {{and evidence of}} accelerated erythropoiesis. Haemolysis due to intrinsic RBC disorders, i. e. the inherited <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias</b> are more common. Most of these anaemias are easily recognisable under the light microscope. MATERIALS AND METHODS To study the clinical and morphological profile {{of different types of}} <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> due to RBC defects in patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital of North Kerala, India. RESULTS A cross-sectional study was carried out among 217 patients of <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> admitted in a tertiary care hospital over a period of five years from January 2012 to December 2016.
