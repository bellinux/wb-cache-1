This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine whether basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> is elevated at the spastic site in patients with variant angina and to determine the significance of basal artery tone in predicting provocation of coronary artery spasm. Background. Previous data have been conflicting on whether basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> is elevated in patients with variant angina. Methods. We assessed basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> by obtaining the percent increase in coronary artery diameter induced by nitroglycerin in 20 patients with variant angina and 24 control subjects. We also examined the correlation between basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> and the constrictive response to ergonovine. Results. In the patients with variant angina in whom spasm was provoked by the lower doses (1 or 5 μg) of ergonovine, basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> was greater (p < 0. 05) at the spastic site (54 ± 15 % or 36 ± 16 %, respectively) than at the nonspastic site (40 ± 25 % or 25 ± 15 %, respectively). Basal coronary tone at the nonspastic site in these patients was greater (p < 0. 01) than that in control subjects (15 ± 6 %). In the patients with variant angina in whom spasm was provoked only by the higher doses (15 or 50 μg) of ergonovine, basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> was comparable at the spastic and nonspastic sites and was not different from that in control subjects.

40|$|In {{patients}} with variant angina, previous data have been inconclusive {{as to whether}} basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> is elevated at the spastic and non-spastic sites. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to assess the basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> and the responsiveness to acetylcholine (Ach) and ergonovine (Erg) in {{patients with}} variant angina. We compared the basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> and the constrictive responses to Ach and Erg between 31 patients (Group 1) with variant angina in whom spasm was provoked by the low doses of Ach (intracoronary 20 micrograms) or Erg(intravenous 50 micrograms) and 35 patients (Group 2) provoked by higher doses of Ach (intracoronary 100 micrograms) or Erg (intravenous cumulative dose of 350 micrograms), and 26 control subjects. Patients with variant angina in whom spasm was provoked by low doses of Ach or Erg, had a higher incidence of mixed disease, multi-vessel spasm and higher disease activity. The basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> at the spastic and nonspastic sites of spasm related artery was significantly more elevated in Group 1 than that in Group 2 (44 +/- 17 vs 14 +/- 11 % and 26 +/- 14 vs 16 +/- 10 % respectively, P < 0. 05), but not in the nonspasm related artery, The magnitudes of vasoconstrictive responses to Ach and Erg at the nonspastic sites were also greater in Group 1 than those in Group 2 and the control groups (Ach; 40 +/- 20 vs 26 +/- 11, 27 +/- 12 %: Erg; 37 +/- 18 vs 12 +/- 8, 13 +/- 10 % respectively, P < 0. 05). However, the basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> was not elevated at the spastic and nonspastic sites in Group 2 compared to the in control subjects.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} basal coronary artery diameter and development of coronary artery spasm, the diameters of the proximal, middle and distal segments {{of the three major}} coronary artery branches, together with that of the left main trunk, were measured on a control angiogram and after ergonovine and nitrate administration in 30 patients with vasospastic angina without significant organic stenosis, and in 35 patients without ischemic heart disease. The percent change in coronary diameter after ergonovine and nitrate administration compared with the control diameter was used as an index of coronary vasoreactivity. In patients with vasospastic angina, coronary artery responses to both ergonovine and nitrate were greater in the spastic segments than in the other segments (p < 0. 05), and those of the coronary arteries without spasm were greater than those of the coronary arteries in patients without ischemic heart disease (p < 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences between}} the coronary artery diameters in the two groups after nitrate administration, and the control diameters were less in patients with vasospastic angina than in patients without ischemic heart disease. These observations indicate that a coronary vasomotion disorder, which involves increased basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> and hypersensitivity to vasoconstrictive stimuli, not only at a localized segment but also in the entire coronary artery tree, is present in patients with vasospastic angina.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{measured}} phospholipase C (PLC) {{activity in}} the cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from patients with and without coronary spasm and examined its correlation with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> vasomotility. BACKGROUNDCoronary artery vasomotility is enhanced in coronary spastic angina (CSA), but no information is available for the intracellular signaling. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, PLC {{activity in the}} skin fibroblasts {{has been shown to}} be enhanced. METHODSSkin fibroblasts obtained from 24 patients with CSA— 14 with organic <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease (CAD) and 12 control subjects—were cultured by the explant method. Activity of PLC was determined by incubating the membrane fraction with 3 H-phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate and by quantifying 3 H-inositol trisphosphate. In patients with CSA and control subjects, the relations between PLC activity and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> basal <b>tone</b> and constrictor response to intracoronary acetylcholine (ACh) were examined. RESULTSActivity of PLC (pmol/protein [mg] per min) was 1. 74 ± 0. 19 in patients with CSA; 0. 90 ± 0. 12 in patients with CAD; and 0. 65 ± 0. 07 in control subjects (p < 0. 001, patients with CSA vs. patients with CAD and control subjects; p = NS, patients with CAD vs. control subjects). According to the Lineweaver-Burk plot, Michaelis constant (μmol/liter) of PLC was 28 ± 4 in patients with CSA; 49 ± 14 in patients with CAD; and 56 ± 10 in control subjects (p < 0. 05, patients with CSA vs. control subjects), whereas the maximal velocity was not different between the three groups. There were significant positive correlations between PLC activity and both basal tone (p = 0. 0108) and response to ACh (p = 0. 0053). Western blot analysis using membrane fraction demonstrated that 89 % of PLC isoenzymes detected was of the δ 1 isoform. CONCLUSIONSBecause the PLC activity measured was genetically defined and was positively correlated with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> vasomotility, enhanced PLC activity may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary spasm...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} developed that increased <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> vasomotor <b>tone</b> superimposed on a preexisting obstruction is a possible mechanism responsible for resting and exertional angina. In 18 patients (22 stenotic lesions), the maximal changes in <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> diameter (mm) induced by an ergometrine test followed by an injection of isosorbide dinitrate were assessed by a quantitative computer-based angiographic system. If we assume {{that there is no}} change in the length of the artery as the result of changes in its diameter, then at any point of the artery the area of the arterial wall on a transverse cross section of the vessel will be constant regardless of its state of its contraction or dilatation. As vasoconstriction occurs, the luminal diameter decreases proportionally more than the outer diameter of the vessel and the wall thickness increases. Using elementary geometric principles, we calculated and reconstructed the changes that might occur at the stenotic sites as the result of vasomotion acting on the entire coronary segment. From the reference diameter in the control state (Ri: 3. 7 +/- 1. 1 mm) and after vasoconstriction (Ric: 3. 3 +/- 1. 0 mm) and the obstruction diameter in the control state (ri: 2. 2 +/- 0. 9 mm), the minimal obstruction diameter after vasoconstriction (ric: 1. 0 +/- 0. 8 mm) was derived using the following equation: ric 2 = ri 2 - Ri 2 + Ric 2. In four of 22 lesions, the decrease in diameter of the lumen of the normal vessel was fully translated to the stenotic point and the decrease in diameter at the stenosis was correctly predicted.

40|$|We {{review the}} role of endothelin (ET) A-receptors (R) on the {{coronary}} circulation. ET- 1 maintains the normal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone.</b> ET- 1 plasma levels are increased during and after coronary angioplasty and this increase is related to myocardial ischaemia rather than to mechanical artery injury. ET A R antagonists inhibit coronary artery vasoconstriction induced by ET release after coronary angioplasty in humans. ET promotes neointimal formation and ET A R antagonism {{has been shown to}} inhibit restenosis after angioplasty in the animal model but not in humans.

40|$|Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD) remains {{the leading cause}} of death {{throughout}} the world, and postmenopausal women are at particularly high risk for CHD. A promising new avenue of study is the novel G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) which mediates estrogen action. The major purpose of my studies in this dissertation is to investigate the role of GPER in porcine <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> regulation. In a series of studies, we tested four hypotheses: 1) activation of GPER regulates <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> by paradoxically inducing relaxation and potentiating contraction; 2) activation of GPER induces coronary artery relaxation by Gs/cAMP-dependent pathway(s); 3) activation of GPER induces coronary artery relaxation via inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase pathway by cAMP downstream targets: the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) as well as PKA; and 4) activation of GPER potentiates coronary artery contraction by a G??/EGFR-dependent pathway. Isometric tension studies were performed on endothelium-denuded porcine coronary arteries to test the function role of GPER and its signaling pathways. RT-PCR, Western blots, patch-clamp experiments and kinase activity assays also were employed in these studies to confirm the expression and phosphorylation of subjective proteins, channel activities and kinase activities in porcine and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and coronary artery tissues. Results from these studies suggest: 1) GPER is expressed in porcine and human coronary artery SMCs; 2) GPER mediated coronary artery relaxation is NO-independent and involves BKCa channel activity; 3) activation of GPER stimulates the production of cAMP, thus activates its downstream targets PKA and Epac; 4) GPER mediates coronary relaxation through activation of MLCP via inhibition of RhoA activity by both PKA and Epac; 5) the interaction between AKAP and PKA is involved in the cAMP/PKA signaling mediated by GPER in coronary artery; and 6) GPER potentiates coronary artery contraction via G?? signaling to stimulate transactivation of EGFR and activation of ERK 1 / 2. These findings provided evidence of the dual effects of GPER in coronary regulation, which may help reveal the controversial actions of estrogen and provide a molecular basis for developing new compounds that better target estrogen signaling for a variety of clinical applications...|$|E
40|$|Endogenous estrogens {{protect from}} {{coronary}} artery disease in premenopausal women, but the mechanisms involved are only partly understood. This study investigated whether activation of the novel G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER, formerly known as GPR 30) affects <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone,</b> and whether this is affected by concomitant blockade of estrogen receptors (ER) α and β. Rings of epicardial porcine coronary arteries suspended in organ chambers were precontracted with prostaglandin F 2 α, and direct effects of G- 1 (GPER agonist) and ICI 182, 780 (GPER agonist and ERα/ERβ antagonist) were determined. In addition, indirect effects on contractility to endothelin- 1 and serotonin (a vasoconstrictor released from aggregating platelets during acute myocardial infarction) were assessed. ICI 182, 780 and G- 1 caused acute dilation of coronary arteries to a comparable degree (p < 0. 05 vs. solvent control). Both GPER agonists attenuated contractions to endothelin- 1 (p < 0. 05 vs. ethanol), but not to serotonin (n. s.). In summary, these findings provide evidence for direct and indirect coronary artery dilator effects of GPER independent of ERα and ERβ, and are the first demonstration of arterial vasodilation in response to ICI 182, 780...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} three {{oestrogens}} (including an oestrogen-progestogen combination) on the postexercise electrocardiogram was studied in 33 men and 18 women who earlier had shown ST segment abnormalities after exercise. When pretreatment exercise tests {{were compared with}} tests {{after two weeks of}} treatment, the postexercise ST segments which were abnormal before treatment became even more abnormal in 18 (90 %) of 20 subjects treated with conjugated oestrogens 10 mg daily, in 16 (89 %) of 18 subjects treated with stilboestrol 5 mg daily, and in 12 (92 %) of 13 subjects treated with norethynodrel (9 - 85 mg) and mestranol (0 - 15 mg) 1 daily. The ST segment abnormalities reverted to pretreatment appearance within 6 weeks of stopping oestrogens.

The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of diagnosing vasospastic angina based on <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> as assessed by M-mode echocardiographic measurement of the dilation response of the left main coronary artery to nitroglycerin. Background. The definite diagnosis of vasospastic angina is done by a coronary spasm provocative test using ergonovine maleate or acetylcholine during cardiac catherization. Current noninvasive, nonpharmacologic diagnostic methods are not sensitive enough for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina. Methods. Thirty-eight patients who had an angiographically normal left main trunk were studied. These patients were classified into four groups based on the presence or absence of more than 50 % stenosis in the coronary arteries except for the left main trunk and the results of the acetylcholine or ergonovine provocative test. At 7 a. m. and at noon on the same day, the left main trunk diameter was measured by M-mode echocardiography before and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (0. 3 mg), and its percent dilation was calculated to assess <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone.</b> Results. The percent dilation of the left main trunk diameter induced by sublingual nitroglycerin at 7 a. m. and at noon was 22. 4 ± 4. 7 % (mean ± SD) and 18. 1 ± 4. 0 % in 11 patients with vasospastic angina and without coronary stenosis, 14. 9 ± 7. 1 % and 11. 2 ± 6. 9 % in 9 patients with vasospastic angina and coronary stenosis, 6. 1 ± 3. 5 % and 7. 0 ± 5. 1 % in 8 patients without vasospastic angina but with coronary stenosis and 8. 1 ± 5. 6 % and 7. 8 ± 5. 7 % in 10 control subjects. The percent dilation at 7 a. m. was significantly greater in the vasospastic angina without coronary stenosis group than in the remaining three groups, and in the vasospastic angina groups, the percent dilation at 7 a. m. was significantly greater than that at noon. When percent dilation at 7 a. m. exceeding 15 % was defined as positive for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina, the sensitivity was 80 % and the specificity 94 %. Conclusions. Basal tone of the left main trunk is elevated in the early morning in vasospastic angina.

A pair of ultrasonic crystals, an electromagnetic flow probe and a cuff occluder {{were placed on}} the left circumflex coronary artery in 12 mongrel dogs under sterile conditions. Reactive hyperemia after 20 s of coronary occlusion dilated the epicardial coronary artery by 120 ± 14 μm (3. 8 ± 0. 6 %, p < 0. 01) from 3. 167 ± 0. 345 mm. This reactive dilation was abolished by flow-limiting coronary stenosis. However, vasodilation after nitroglycerin was 168 ± 26 μm (5. 1 ± 0. 5 %) and 162 ± 27 μm (4. 9 ± 0. 6 %), respectively, before and after flow limitation. After removal of the endothelium by a balloon catheter, dilation of the epicardial coronary artery after reactive hyperemia was markedly attenuated to 7 ± 4 μm (p < 0. 01 versus before denudation), despite the presence of a similar degree of reactive hyperemia. The extent of coronary dilation after nitroglycerin was unchanged before and after de-endothelialization. Thus, the endothelium contributed to reactive dilation but not to the nitroglycerin-induced dilation.

To determine the contributions of dynamic coronary artery diameter changes {{to the degree of}} coronary narrowing, 47 consecutive chest pain patients were studied without pre-medication by analysing selective coronary angiograms before and after glyceryl trinitrate. Proximal coronary diameters were measured in superimposed frames with callipers. Lumen diameter increased after glyceryl trinitrate 15 ± 2 per cent in the left main, 18 ± 2 per cent in the left anterior descending, 16 + 2 per cent in the circumflex, and 17 ± 2 per cent in the right coronary arteries (all P 90 per cent were excluded because ofmeasurement inaccuracy). Of 81 narrowings 50 per cent because of dilatation of the adjacent region. However, the diameter of the nar-rowed segment also changed significantly after glyceryl trinitrate, increasing in 28 and decreasing in 3. Of the 28 obstructions which dilated after glyceryl trinitrate, 4 were clinical and angiographic examples of coronary arterial spasm. In 4 other coronary arteries with only outline irregularities before glyceryl trinitrate a localised narrowing (25 to 50 %) was seen after glyceryl trinitrate as the proximal artery dilated.

40|$|The most {{dangerous}} and life-threatening manifestation of allergic diseases is anaphylaxis, {{a condition in}} which the cardiovascular system is responsible for the majority of clinical symptoms and for potentially fatal outcome. The heart is both a source and a target of chemical mediators released during allergic reactions. Mast cells are abundant in the human heart, where they are located predominantly around the adventitia of large coronary arteries and in close contact with the small intramural vessels. Cardiac mast cells can be activated by a variety of stimuli including allergens, complement factors, general anesthetics and muscle relaxants. Mediators released from immunologically activated human heart mast cells strongly influence ventricular function, cardiac rhythm and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone.</b> Histamine, cysteinyl leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor (PAF) exert negative inotropic effects and induce myocardial depression that contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of anaphylactic shock. Moreover, cardiac mast cells release chymase and renin that activates the angiotensin system locally, which further induces arteriolar vasoconstriction. The number and density of cardiac mast cells is increased in patients with ischaemic heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathies. This observation may help explain why these conditions are major risk factors for fatal anaphylaxis. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in cardiac mast cell activation may lead to an improvement in prevention and treatment of systemic anaphylaxis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{vasoconstrictor}} response to ergonovine and the vasodilator response to isosorbide dinitrate in spastic and non-spastic coronary segments from 31 patients undergoing serial angiographic follow up of variant angina. METHODS: Coronary angiograms and ergonovine provocation tests were repeated at an interval of 45 (SD 15) months apart. While all 31 patients showed {{a positive response}} to ergonovine initially, vasospastic responsiveness persisted in only 16 patients at follow up (group 1) {{and not in the}} other 15 patients in whom symptoms of variant angina had resolved (group 2). Mean luminal diameter of 170 normal or near normal entire coronary segments (American Heart Association classification) were measured (a) at baseline, (b) after the administration of ergonovine, and (c) after the administration of isosorbide dinitrate, during both the initial and follow up angiograms using a computer based quantitative angiography analysis system (CAAS II). RESULTS: In vasospastic patients (initial and follow up angiograms in group 1, and initial angiogram in group 2), basal tone was significantly higher in spastic segments compared to adjacent segments or segments in non-spastic vessels. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at 20 % increase in basal coronary tone for the prediction of vasospasm were 77 % and 73 %, respectively.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the basal release of nitric oxide at spastic sites in patients with variant angina. Background. We previously reported that endothelium-dependent dilator responses to acetylcholine, substance P and bradykinin are preserved at the site of coronary artery spasm. However, it is not known whether the basal release of endothelium- derived nitric oxide is altered at the spastic site. Methods. The effects of intracoronary NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis) at cumulative doses of 50, 100 and 200 μmol on basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> were investigated in eight patients with variant angina and normal coronary angiograms and in eight control subjects. The lumen diameters of large epicardial coronary arteries were assessed by quantitative coronary arteriography. Results. Coronary spasm was provoked by the intracoronary administration of acetylcholine in all patients with variant angina. l-NMMA did not alter the arterial pressure and heart rate but significantly decreased the coronary artery diameter at spastic and nonspastic sites. Constrictive responses to l-NMMA were significantly greater (p < 0. 01) at the spastic site (constriction by 200 μmol, 22 ± 7 %, mean ± SD) than at the nonspastic site (10 ± 7 %). Constrictive responses to l-NNMA at the nonspastic site in patients with variant angina were comparable to those in the control subjects. Conclusions. These findings support the hypothesis that the basal release of nitric oxide may not be decreased at the spastic site in patients with variant angina...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-life {{molecule}} {{produced by}} the enzyme known as the nitric oxide synthase (NOS), in a reaction that converts arginine and oxygen into citrulline and NO. There are three isoforms of the enzyme: neuronal NOS (nNOS, also called NOS 1), inducible NOS (iNOS or NOS 2), and endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS 3). It is now known {{that each of these}} isoforms may be expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types. This paper is a review of the current knowledge of various functions of NO in diseases. We discuss in more detail its role in Cancer, the role of NO in myocardial pathophysiology, in central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. Other diseases such as inflammation, asthma, in chronic liver diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), arthritis, are also discussed. This review also covers the role of NO in cardiovascular, central nervous, pancreas, lung, gut, kidney, myoskeletal and chronic liver diseases (CLD). The ubiquitous role that the simple gas nitric oxide plays in the body, from maintaining vascular homeostasis and fighting infections to acting as a neurotransmitter and its role in cancer, has spurred a lot of interest among researchers all over the world. Nitric oxide {{plays an important role in}} the physiologic modulation of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> and myocardial function. Nitric oxide from iNOS appears to be a key mediator of such glial-induced neuronal death. The high sensitivity of neurons to NO is partly due to NO causing inhibition of respiration, rapid glutamate release from both astrocytes and neurons, and subsequent excitotoxic death of the neurons. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose- As {{there is}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{in the regulation}} of vascular tone, {{the aim of this}} present study was to determine whether there are sex differences in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) - mediated regulation of the porcine coronary artery (PCA) tone. Experimental Approach- Isometric tension recording system was used to record changes in tone in PCAs. Western blot analysis was performed to examine the expression of adiponectin in PVAT and adiponectin receptors (adipo 1 receptor and adipo 2 receptor) and adiponectin binding protein (APPL 1) in PCA. The level of adiponectin released from PVAT was measured using ELISA. Key Results- In the presence of adherent PVAT, contractions to the thromboxane mimetic U 46619 and endothelin- 1 were significantly reduced in PCAs from females, but not males. In PCAs pre-contracted with U 46619, re-addition of PVAT caused relaxation in PCAs from females, but not males. This relaxant response in females was attenuated by combined inhibition of NO synthase (with L-NAME) and cyclooxygenase (with indomethacin). Pre-incubation with an anti-adiponectin antibody abolished the relaxant effects of PVAT. The adiponectin receptor agonist (adipoRon) produced a greater relaxation in PCAs from females compared to males. However, {{there was no difference in}} either expression or release of adiponectin from PVAT between sexes. Similarly, there was no difference in expression of adiponectin receptors or the adiponectin receptor adaptor protein APPL 1 in PCAs. Conclusion and Implications- These findings demonstrate a clear sex difference in the regulation of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> in response to adiponectin receptor stimulation, which may underlie the anticontractile effects of PVAT in females...|$|E

Here, we report an interesting case of a 34 -year-old woman with spontaneous <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> dissection that occurred 1 month after childbirth. Emergency coronary angiography showed stenosis of the left anterior descend-ing artery, but immediately afterwards, a new occlusion of the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> occurred. Intravascular ultrasound was used to image both right and left <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> The new occlusion of the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> was probably iatrogenic, but the left <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> occlusion was spontaneous.

MethodsOf 303 consecutive patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafting with 3 -vessel coronary disease and a dominant right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> tributary of an infarcted nonischemic territory, 154 were randomized to right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> revascularization and 149 to no right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting. In all cases, standard on-pump surgical myocardial revascularization was performed. ResultsOverall hospital mortality was 2 of 154 versus 1 of 149 (P =. 97); no difference in in-hospital outcome was observed between the 2 groups. At follow-up, cardiac event–free survival was 84 of 152 in the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting series and 62 of 148 in the non–right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting group (P =. 20). However, when the analysis was limited to surviving patients without new scintigraphic evidence of ischemia (to avoid confounding factors derived from ischemia in the left coronary system or right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> graft malfunction), we found that patients who received a right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> graft had fewer cardiac events, a lower incidence of arrhythmia, and less left ventricular dilatation than did the non–right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> revascularized series. ConclusionsSurgical grafting of a right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> tributary of an infarcted nonischemic territory in patients with 3 -vessel <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease submitted to <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafting improved late electric stability, ventricular geometry, and event-free survival but did not affect in-hospital or 10 -year survival...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in the anaesthetic manage-ment of patients with coronary artery disease, the occurrence of myocardial ischaemia is still a serious threat during the perioperative period. Ischaemia is usually associated with tachycardia, arterial hypertension, increased wall tension or coronary vasoconstriction [1]. Consequently, the ideal treatment should decrease arterial and ventricular filling pressures, and heart rate, and decrease <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> without having any adverse effects on myocardial contractility and conduction. Diltiazem {{is one of the}} recently-introduced calcium entry blockers available for i. v. use in man. In its oral form it is highly effective in the management of angina pectoris [2]. When administered i. v. to conscious subjects, it is a potent coronary and systemic vasodilator with-out evidence of untoward effects on heart rate or myocardial contractility [3, 4]. In addition, it possesses antiarrhythmic properties [5, 6], and protects the myocardium from ischaemic and reperfusion injury [7, 8]. Thus it may be well suited for the treatment of perioperative myo-cardial ischaemia. However, the efficacy and safety of diltiazem during anaesthesia remain to be determined as hypotension, bradycardia and abnormalities of conduction have been reported after i. v. administration in anaesthetized man, and anaesthetized animals [9, 10]. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of bolus injections and constant infusions of diltiazem on the systemic, pulmonary and coronary circulations, on global and regional left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function, and on the ECG during neuroleptanaesthesia. Admini-stration of nitroglycerin (TNG) before and after the administration of diltiazem served to assess the effects of anaesthesia and of diltiazem on baroreceptor function...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{sought to}} {{determine}} if isoflurane would attenuate effects of three different types of vasoconstrictors on isolated segments of canine epicardial coronary arteries removed from healthy dogs. As the endothelium has {{a major role in}} regulating epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone,</b> and as it modulates the effect of many vasoactive substances, experiments were conducted both on normal rings and on rings whose endothelium had been mechanically removed. In addition, the endothelium is thought to be damaged in human atherosclerosis. Rings were suspended in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, aerated with 95 % oxygen and 5 % carbon dioxide, and connected to strain gauges for the measurement of isometric tension. Isoflurane 2. 3 % (1. 5 MAC in the dog) was added to the aerating gas mixture in half the preparations, while the other rings served as control. The vasoconstrictors serotonin, phenylephrine, or prostaglandin F(2 α) were added in increasing concentrations to the bath solution. In the presence of endothelium, vasoconstrictor evoked contractions were attenuated by isoflurane. Maximal tension generated by prostaglandin F(2 α) in untreated rings was 114 ± 18 % (mean ± SEM) of a reference contraction, while, following isoflurane, it was 46 ± 8 % (P< 0. 005). In the absence of endothelium, isoflurane attenuated neither prostaglandin F(2 α) nor serotonin evoked contraction, and had decreased effectiveness against phenylephrine mediated contraction (P< 0. 001). It is concluded that isoflurane attenuates vasoconstrictor-evoked contraction of isolated canine epicardial coronary arteries, and that this effect is mediated by the endothelium. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{contribution}} of endothelin type A (ETA) receptor stimulation by endogenously generated endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) {{to the maintenance of}} coronary vascular tone in humans.  DESIGN—Controlled clinical study.  SETTING—Tertiary cardiovascular referral centre.  PATIENTS— 14 subjects were studied, seven with normal coronary arteries and seven with coronary artery disease, mean (SEM) age, 53  (2) years.  INTERVENTIONS—After diagnostic coronary arteriography, BQ- 123 (a selective ETA receptor antagonist; 100  nmol/min) in 0. 9 % saline, was infused into the left coronary artery at a rate of 1  ml/min for 60  minutes. Eight control subjects received saline alone.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery, measured using a Doppler flow guidewire; coronary arteriography performed at baseline and immediately {{at the end of the}} BQ- 123 or saline infusion to measure the diameter of proximal and distal left anterior descending coronary artery segments.  RESULTS—The diameter of the proximal segment increased by 6  (2) %, while that of the distal segment increased by 12  (3) % after BQ- 123 (both p <  0. 05 v baseline). Coronary blood flow increased from 75  (10) to 92  (10)  ml/min and coronary vascular resistance decreased from 1. 99  (0. 36) to 1. 44  (0. 22)  mm Hg/ml/min after BQ- 123 (both p <  0. 05 v baseline). The response to BQ- 123 of patients with and without coronary artery disease was similar. There was no effect of saline in the controls.  CONCLUSIONS—Endogenously produced ET- 1 contributes to the maintenance of basal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>tone</b> in humans by ETA receptor stimulation. The role of ETB receptors remains to be defined.    Keywords: endothelins; arteries; blood flow; coronary circulation; angiograph...|$|E
