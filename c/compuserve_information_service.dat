Recent U.S. versions of the CompuServe client software — essentially an enhanced Web browser — use the Gecko layout engine (developed for Mozilla) within a derivative of the AOL client and using the AOL dialup network. The previous CompuServe service offering, re-branded as [...] "CompuServe Classic", remains available in the US and also in other countries where CompuServe 2000 is not offered, such as the UK. In Germany, CompuServe 2000 was introduced in 1999 and withdrawn in 2001 because of failure on the German market, but the CompuServe Classic service also remains available. However, since then CompuServe Germany has introduced its own products for dialup and DSL internet access, and its own client software (called CompuServe 4.5 light).|$|R

For {{some areas of the}} service which did not support HMI, the older text-based interface could be used. WinCIM also allowed caching of forum messages, news articles and e-mail, so that reading and posting could be performed off-line, without incurring hourly connect costs. Previously, this was a luxury of the NavCIS, AutoSIG and TapCIS applications for power users.|$|R

50|$|CompuServe (<b>CompuServe</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service,</b> {{also known}} by its initialism CIS) {{was the first major}} {{commercial}} online service provider in the United States. It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major influence through the mid-1990s. At its peak in the early 1990s, CIS was known for its online chat system, message forums covering a variety of topics, extensive software libraries for most computer platforms, and a series of popular online games, notably MegaWars III and Island of Kesmai. They are also known for their introduction of the GIF format for pictures, and CIS was a very popular GIF exchange mechanism.|$|E
50|$|NavCIS, {{originally}} {{known as}} ForCIS, is a client program {{which was used}} to automate connections to the <b>CompuServe</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b> {{at a time when}} online use was priced by the minute. It operated largely in the fashion of an offline reader, downloading both email and new messages from selected forums, and then disconnecting. The user could then read and reply to these messages offline, and send all of their replies back in a similarly quick connection. Unlike most offline readers, NavCIS also allowed the user to select files for upload and download, and included a system for scripting the session.|$|E
50|$|In February 1998, John W. Sidgmore, then vice {{chairman}} of WorldCom, and the former CEO of UUNET, devised a complex transaction which ultimately met the goals of all parties. Step one was that WorldCom purchased all the shares of CompuServe with $1.2 billion of WCOM stock. Literally the next day, WorldCom sold the <b>CompuServe</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b> portion of the company to AOL, retaining the CompuServe Network Services portion. AOL in turn sold its networking division, Advanced Network Services (ANS), to WorldCom. Sidgmore said {{that at this point}} the world was in balance: the accountants were doing taxes, AOL was doing information services, and WorldCom was doing networks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{organisation}} itself {{claims to}} be the world's oldest continually-operated online forum. It was founded by The Aviation Safety Institute's John B. Galipault (1930-93) and Sandy Trevor on the <b>CompuServe</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b> in 1981. Forum participants represent all areas of the aviation industry, and core discussion ranges from airmanship to regulatory issues. The [...] "Special Interest Group" [...] phraseology in [...] "Aviation Special Interest Group" [...] derives from CompuServe service command line navigation convention where discussion forums were prefaced by SUBJECT/SIG, as in [...] "AVIATION/SIG" [...] or [...] "AVSIG." [...] AVSIG was the first [...] "SIG" [...] discussion site on the CompuServe service. The Aviation Safety Institute moved the AVSIG forum to the web concurrent with its termination of a hosting contract with CompuServe in 2004. AVSIG is the world's oldest continuously-operated online forum and {{one of a handful of}} pre-web online discussion forums operating today.

The following year Shades of Gray: an Adventure in Black and White, a game co-authored by a team of Compuserve Gamer’s Forum members, for which Pintar was the principle designer, won the 6th Annual AGT contest in the group category. [...] Shades of Gray is “generally considered the finest AGT game of all time.” The collaborative authorship of the game is referenced as an example of the kinds of creative possibilities that emerged within the early online IF community. [...] Both games were published in a book and CD by David Gerrold, Fatal Distractions: 87 Of the Very Best Ways to Get Beaten, Eaten, Maimed, and Mauled on Your PC, (Waite Group, 1997).|$|E

40|$|Accompanying {{infrastructure}} {{improvements and}} networking technology innovation, {{the development of}} digital home service industry has gotten more and more attention. However, the digital home service levels have not sufficiently met rising demand from users. Therefore, it is urgent to propose and develop new service modes for the digital home. Geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> can provide various spatial <b>information</b> <b>services</b> such as map search, spatial information query. It has become an inevitable trend to implement geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the digital home. This paper proposes three new geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> modes for the digital home after sufficient requirement analysis: pushed <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode, interactive <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode, personalized <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode. The key technologies to implement geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> on digital televisions are studied, involving digital television middleware technology, network transmission technology and visualization technology. According to the service modes’ characteristics mentioned above, a service system in the digital home is established to implement geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> {{on the basis of}} digital television. The implementation of geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the digital home not only enriches the digital home services content, but also promotes geographic information from specialization to public popularity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a market}} where {{the provision of}} <b>information</b> <b>service</b> is costly, but <b>information</b> <b>service</b> has {{the characteristics of a}} public good. Consumers, on the other hand, can use the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> to make an informed purchase decision and derive higher utility from consuming their ideal product. However, after receiving the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> from an <b>information</b> <b>service</b> provider, consumers can easily free ride by purchasing at low-price sellers who do not provide any <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> The paper examines the competition where sellers compete by providing <b>information</b> <b>service</b> for horizontally differentiated products and where technology reduces consumers' search cost. It is found that in this market a seller needs to establish itself as an <b>information</b> <b>service</b> provider in order to make positive profits, even when there is free riding. A seller, however, cannot make positive profits by free riding all the time. Also, with an increase in competition in the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> market, sellers have reduced incentives to provide <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> It is also found that in this market a decrease in search cost may increase or decrease social welfare. free riding, search cost, electronic markets, electronic commerce...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give a {{structured}} literature review, design concepts, and research propositions related to a product-oriented design theory for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Information</b> <b>services</b> facilitate the exchange of information goods with or without transforming these goods. Exemplar <b>information</b> <b>services</b> are e-publishing, electronic communities-of-practice, and management reporting. The importance of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the current economy merits the development of an explicit product- and process-oriented design theory. Design/methodology/approach – This article focuses on the product-oriented design theory by applying Walls et al. 's framework. A product-oriented design theory of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> identifies relevant descriptive and explanatory insights (i. e. content, use, value, and revenue), meta-requirements, and meta-designs. The paper describes design problems for <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> and gives key requirements for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> Next, it describes the information, organizational and information technological components of an <b>information</b> <b>service,</b> and identifies at least four <b>information</b> <b>service</b> architectures. Finally, it gives research hypotheses, research ideas, and discusses practical implications. Findings – The results form a product-oriented design theory for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> The paper gives a structured way for practitioners to analyze <b>information</b> <b>service</b> design challenges, and suggestions are given for requirements and design decisions on three aspects (content, use feature, and revenue).
