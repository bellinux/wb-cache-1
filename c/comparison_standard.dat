The findings support comparison-level theory coupled with the product-based norm as a <b>comparison</b> <b>standard,</b> which posits that consumers use the average quality of the product’s reference group as the relevant <b>comparison</b> <b>standard.</b> Furthermore, consumers are found to be more sensitive to negative deviations from the reference group’s quality than from positive deviations, which is consistent with prospect theory...|$|E

First, it sets out to examine the valid-ity of the five SERVQUAL dimensions using an alternative scaling methodology known as the Guttman scaling procedure. Second, it aims to determine the role of expectation in the evaluation of hotel services. Of the five SERVQUAL dimensions tested, only four are found to be valid.

40|$|Twin {{research}} has offered evidence that monozygotic (MZ) twins are more socially close than dizygotic (DZ) twins, {{but has not}} {{paid much attention to}} the way twins compare themselves with their co-twin. The few studies in this area suggest that 'horizontal comparisons' (social comparison motivated by solidarity or communion with others) matter more for MZ twins than for DZ twins, at least when the co-twin is the social <b>comparison</b> <b>standard.</b> Consistent with this view, we predicted higher interest in MZ twins relative to DZ twins to select their co-twin rather than other people in general as the social <b>comparison</b> <b>standard.</b> The Social Comparison Orientation (SCO) scale, which measures the inclination to compare with others in a horizontal rather than vertical mode (comparing either upward or downward), was administered in 90 MZ pairs and 57 same-sex DZ pairs (63 % female; average age 18. 06 years) from the Netherlands Twin Register. MZ twin pairs showed significantly higher SCO scores than DZ twin pairs (with a large effect size) on the co-twin SCO, whereas the two groups did not differ from each other on the general SCO excluding the co-twin as social <b>comparison</b> <b>standard.</b> In MZ twin pairs, anxiety was associated with social comparison with others in general, not with their co-twin. For both scales, twin resemblance was explained by additive genetic variance. The present findings provide direct evidence that horizontal comparisons with the co-twin are of particular importance for MZ twins...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} on inclusive identities {{suggests that the}} highly inclusive superordinate group “humans” is a relevant social category such that identification with all humans is related to various pro-social outcomes. In this research, we tested whether dual identity affects {{the extent to which}} the superordinate group humans serves as a relevant <b>comparison</b> <b>standard</b> for relations between developed and developing countries. Overall, participants from a developed country perceived their ingroup as more relatively prototypical for all humanity than people from developing countries. Study 1 revealed that relative prototypicality perceptions predicted weaker behavioral intentions to act against global inequality. In Studies 2 and 3, higher levels of relative prototypicality tended to predict fewer donations and a lower probability to seek fair trade information. Perceived legitimacy of global inequality explained the relation between relative prototypicality and donation behavior (Study 3). Dual identification with both developed countries and humanity did not predict relative prototypicality judgments. We discuss that the social representation of all humans can be a meaningful <b>comparison</b> <b>standard</b> for individuals, and we discuss the role of dual identity in international relations...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To assist clinicians {{with the}} {{analysis}} of an individual's profile of subtest strength and weaknesses on the Test of Everyday Attention (TEA). Design. The study applied psychometric methods for the quantitive analysis of subtest profiles (Silverstein, 1982, 1984 ^, b). Methods. Formulae to compute the standard error of the difference and standard deviation {{of the difference between}} a subtest and a client's mean subtest scores were applied to determine critical values for reliable and abnormal differences. The data used were derived from the TEA standardization sample (N = 154). Results. Tables for examining whether an individual's TEA subtest profile contains reliable and abnormal subtest discrepancies are presented. Conclusions. Elegant methods of analysing a subtest profile were extended for use with the Test of Everyday Attention. In keeping with the rationale underlying the measurement of neuropsychological deficit (Lezak, 1995), these methods comple-ment the existing TEA normative <b>comparison</b> <b>standards</b> by providing individual <b>comparison</b> <b>standards</b> for a client's performance.

40|$|This paper uses {{concurrently}} and - for {{the first}} time - retrospectively reported life satisfaction from the 1984 to 1987 waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel to study the importance of different <b>comparison</b> <b>standards</b> for the empirical correlation of unemployment and subjective life satisfaction. It is found that unemployed individuals do not only report significantly lower concurrent satisfaction, but also recall reduced satisfaction from past unemployment well, and retrospectively upgrade their past satisfaction scores. Therefore, the short-term negative effects of unemployment on individual life satisfaction reported in the literature so far are likely underestimated. At the same time, the empirical findings cast doubts on the usefulness of subjective life satisfaction for the precise quantification of welfare effects because of changing <b>comparison</b> <b>standards</b> which greatly limit the intertemporal comparability of the data. For this reason, such data also appear to be of limited use for monitoring long-term economic or social development.

The present thesis examines people’s preferences among various <b>comparison</b> <b>standards</b> (social <b>comparisons,</b> temporal past comparisons, temporal future comparisons and previous relationship comparisons) for relationship appraisal, {{the direction in which}} people prefer to make various relationship comparisons and the reported and actual impact of these <b>comparison</b> <b>standards</b> on relationship appraisals. The present research also examines the hypothesis that certain relationship beliefs and characteristics (controllability and satisfaction) affect how one interprets these <b>comparison</b> <b>standards.</b> In study 1, 140 undergraduate university students involved in dating relationships reported a preference for temporal comparisons to their relationship’s past or future. Also, participants reported a preference for comparisons, which enhanced their current relationship and suggested optimism for the future. Finally, people reported that comparisons to previous romantic relationships resulted in the most positive relationship appraisals. Many of these findings were more pervasive across privileged than public relationship traits. In study 2, 128 undergraduate university students involved in dating relationships felt most positively about the love in their current relationship when asked to make comparisons to inferior and equal relationships among one’s peers, superior and equal points in one’s relationship’s past and future and previous relationship comparisons of all directions. In addition, participants reported a preference for relationship-enhancing comparisons. Finally, one’s perceived control over love and relationship satisfaction influenced participants’ interpretations of relationship comparisons. However, these moderating effects were not found for all comparison types and were not always in the predicted direction...|$|R
