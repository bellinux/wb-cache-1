30|$|Since {{entry costs}} and {{transaction}} risks in internationalization can be high, {{the decision is}} necessarily affected by managerial willingness to commit resources with a long-term view. Thus, an earlier entry might be prompted by high market <b>commitments</b> <b>to</b> tangible (e.g., financial investment) and intangible (e.g., time, information search, patience) resources (Navarro et al. 2010). Firms’ <b>commitments</b> <b>to</b> international activities in turbulent markets are well documented. For instance, despite an internal crisis and war between Iran and Iraq (1982 – 1988), Swedish firms such as Volvo did not withdraw their businesses but maintained their market <b>commitments</b> due <b>to</b> the post-war market potential (Hadjikhani 1997). In this case, firms integrated all of their tangible and intangible <b>commitments</b> <b>to</b> their focal markets.|$|R

The 2016 Defence White Paper included a <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> further increases in spending beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.|$|E

5|$|Due {{in large}} part to surplus {{revenues}} from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. The spending issue in part led to the defeat of the Republicans in the 1890 mid-term elections. Cleveland defeated Harrison for re-election in 1892, due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending. Harrison returned to private life and his law practice in Indianapolis. In 1899 Harrison represented the Republic of Venezuela in their British Guiana boundary dispute against the United Kingdom. Harrison traveled to the court of Paris as part of the case and after a brief stay returned to Indianapolis. He died at his home in Indianapolis in 1901 of complications from influenza. Although many have praised Harrison's <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> African Americans' voting rights, scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below-average, and rank him in the bottom half among U.S. presidents. Historians, however, have not questioned Harrison's <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> personal and official integrity.|$|E
