Samples with commercially pure Al (Al) and Al- 12 wt % Si (AlSi 12) eutectic aluminum matrix, reinforced by hollow ceramic spheres, were compressed at room temperature. Concurrently, the acoustic emission response and the strain field development on the surface were monitored in-situ.

At large stresses, deformation bands form both in the Al and AlSi 12 foam. In Al foam, cell walls collapse in a large volume. In contrast, the AlSi 12 foam is more brittle; therefore, the fracture of precipitates and the crushing of the matrix take place within a distinctive deformation band, along with an occurrence of a significant stress drop.

40|$|Closed cell, high {{strength}} metallic foams, like ceramic hollow sphere reinforced metal matrix syntactic foams are distinguished materials to build light structural parts. The applications {{can range from}} load bearing structures to vibration damping structural parts like machine beds, spindles etc. In the latter case the fatigue properties are {{necessary in order to}} conduct proper design calculations. Simple and hybrid metal matrix syntactic foams with Al 99. 5 or AlSi 12 matrix, reinforced by 1. 5 mm and/or 0. 15 mm ceramic hollow spheres were produced by pressure infiltration technique. The hollow spheres were built up from alumina, silica and mullite and they were provided by Globomet GmbH. and Envirospheres Ltd. respectively. The fatigue tests were performed on a universal hydraulic testing machine under force control at different and lower loading levels (k= 0. 6 … 1, compared to the compressive strength of the actual foams). The cylindrical specimens were carefully lubricated and placed between polished plates incorporated in a four bar upsetting tool. The deformation of the specimens was measured by a strain gage as a function of cycles. The results showed that the metal matrix syntactic foams have exhibited fatigue limits, due to the high <b>ceramic</b> <b>sphere</b> content. The softer, more ductile Al 99. 5 matrix syntactic foams have higher fatigue strength and similarly, the larger hollow spheres could result in higher fatigue limits. The failure mechanism could be connected to the brittle fracture of ceramic spheres embedded in the ductile matrix.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{elaboration}} of the alumina zirconia composites, for orthopaedic application (femoral heads), through a colloidal method, which allows tailoring the size and distribution of zirconia grains. A {{first part of this}} work deals with the elaboration of the composite powder, obtained by surface modification of a commercial, submicrometer alumina powder. These powders were characterized in terms of phase evolution, thermal behaviour, kinetics and mechanism of the zirconia crystallization. The evolution and the kinetics of the zirconia crystallization were studied by conventional and high temperature X-Rays Diffraction. The crystallization mechanism was studied in detail, coupling the results of the kinetics investigations and the observations by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM and HRTEM) of the powders treated at different temperatures. This study allowed the optimization of the thermal treatment, in order to preserve the homogeneity and the desired characteristics in the final microstructure. Composite powders, containing different zirconia amounts (between 5 and 20 vol. %), were prepared by this procedure. Some samples obtained by slip casting of the dispersed suspension were sintered and used for a preliminary characterization. Indentation tests were performed on the different samples, in order to evaluate the Vickers Hardness and the threshold for slow crack propagation, KI 0. The composite containing 10 vol. % ZrO 2 exhibited the maximum KI 0. The toughening is due to the t ®m transformation induced at the crack tip. The last part of this thesis deals with the elaboration of the femoral heads prototypes, by following a procedure compatible with the industrial strategy. The prototypes were obtained by isostatically pressing the spray dried powder. The green density was about 58. 2 % of the theoretical density (TD). After natural sintering, the mean density was 99. 3 % TD. Finally, after hot isostatic pressing, the density was close to the theoretical one. Hardness measurements were performed to evaluate the homogeneity of this property inside the ceramic spherical bodies. The hardness values obtained near the external surface and in the centre are comparable (~ 1956. HV), demonstrating that the density and the mechanical properties are constant inside the <b>ceramic</b> <b>sphere,</b> independently from the position. Moreover, the threshold for slow crack propagation, KI 0, was determined by Vickers indentation carried out along a diameter of a sample cross section. The mean KI 0 is 3. 8 +- 0. 3 MPa·m 1 / 2. This value was comparable to that obtained for slip cast samples containing the same zirconia amount (3. 5 +- 0. 3 MPa·m 1 / 2), demonstrating that the good results obtained by slip casting, for small pellets, can be reproduced by cold isostatic pressing of atomized powder, in larger spherical componentsVILLEURBANNE-DOC'INSA LYON (692662301) / SudocSudocFranceItalyFRI...|$|E

40|$|A {{fragment}} of an L 6 chondrite (ALH 85017, 13) {{with an initial}} mass (M(sub 0)) of 464. 1 g was the target {{in a series of}} experimental impacts in which the largest remaining fragment (M(sub R)) after each shot was impacted by a 3. 18 -mm <b>ceramic</b> <b>sphere</b> at a nominal speed of 2 km/s. This continued until the mass of the largest remaining piece was less than half the mass of the target presented to that shot (M(sub S)). Two chunks of Bushveldt gabbro with similar initial masses were also impacted under the same conditions until M(sub R) was less than half M(sub 0). The two gabbro targets required a total of 1. 51 x 10 (exp 7) and 1. 75 x 10 (exp 7) erg/g to attain 0. 27 and 0. 33 M(sub R) /M(sub 0), respectively; the chondrite, however, was considerably tougher, reaching 0. 40 and 0. 21 M(sub R) /M(sub 0) only after receiving 2. 37 x 10 (exp 7) and 3. 10 x 10 (exp 7) erg g- 1, respectively. The combined ejecta and spallation products from the gabbro impacts were coarser than those from the chondrite and in sufficient quantities that the new surface areas exceeded those from the meteorite until the fifth shot in the chondrite series, which was the number of impacts required to disrupt each gabbro target (i. e., MR/M 0 = 0. 5). Unlike the behavior shown in previous regolith-evolution series, neither gabbro target produced an enhancement in the size fraction reflecting the mean size of the crystals composing the rock (about 3 mm), an effect possibly related to the width of the shock pulse. The original chondrite was so fine-grained and fractured, and the variance in its grain-size distribution so large, that effects related to grain-size were relegated to the < 63 - m fraction. Impacts into ALH 85017 produced abundant, fine-grained debris, but otherwise the slopes of its size distributions were comparable to those from other experiments involving natural and fabricated terrestrial targets. The characteristic slopes of the chondrite's size distributions, however, were notably more constant over the entire nine-impact series than those from any of the terrestrial targets, a testament to the control over comminution apparently exerted by pre-existing fractures and other, microscopic damage in the meteorite. The enhancement in the finer fraction of debris from ALH 85017 indicates that ordinary chondrites in solar orbit would be very efficient contributors to the cosmic-dust complex. At the same time, the greater resistance to disruption displayed by ordinary chondrites relative to that exhibited by igneous rocks indicates that a selection effect could be operative between the annealed, ordinary-chondritic breccias and relatively weaker, differentiated meteorites. Preferential survival from their time in the regoliths of their parent bodies through their transit to Earth and passage through the atmosphere suggests that meteorite collections could be biased in favor of the ordinary chondrites...|$|E

The reaction of condensation between the two polyelectrolytes leads to in situ formation of filaments acting as efficient binding agents. By selecting the suitable ratio between the two polymers, this formulation makes it possible to granulate the titania powder while retaining its purity.

Under a controlled rotation of the vessel, electrostatic attraction between the surface charges of opposite polarity induces a size increase of agglomerates until the formation of spheres occurs. It has been shown that the mechanism of growth is poisoned by species adsorbed such as ions. Nevertheless, this new process proves very promising because it leads to a narrow size distribution of spheres by colloidal way, which can be subsequently consolidated by sintering, with a smooth surface...|$|R
