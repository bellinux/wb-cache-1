40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the experience and}} attitudes of 189 family childcare pro-viders regarding their willingness to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities. Providers who had experience <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities {{were more likely to}} re-port a willingness to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> them in the future. Differences in reported services and supports needed to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities, as well as explanations <b>for</b> un-willingness to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities, were examined for those with and without experience in <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities. Family childcare providers who were not willing to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities indicated three primary bar-riers: a lack of knowledge about disabilities, the limitation that <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a child with a disability would impose on <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> other children, and the need to purchase spe-cial equipment. Finally, general attitudes concerning inclusion were compared for providers who had and had not had experience in <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities. As is becoming the norm for U. S. families, families of children with disabilities are increasingly relying on non-parental childcare for their children. Family childcare ac...|$|R

5|$|Octopuses inhabit various {{regions of}} the ocean, {{including}} coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and <b>cares</b> <b>for</b> them until they hatch, after which she also dies.|$|E

5|$|The altricial, downy chicks hatch after 33days of incubation. After hatching, {{the female}} <b>cares</b> <b>for</b> and feeds the chicks {{for the first}} 8–14days of life, and also during bad weather after that. The male {{provides}} food, up to six kills per day {{in the first week}} increasing to eight per day in the third and 10per day in the last week in the nest, by which time the female is also hunting.|$|E
5|$|About forty {{days after}} mating, the female giant Pacific octopus {{attaches}} strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in total) to rocks in a crevice or under an overhang. Here she guards and <b>cares</b> <b>for</b> them {{for about five}} months (160 days) until they hatch. In colder waters, such as those off of Alaska, it may take as much as 10 months for the eggs to completely develop. The female aerates the eggs and keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch. She does not feed during this time and dies soon afterwards. Males become senescent and die {{a few weeks after}} mating.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{awareness}} and behaviour of nurses with experience of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families who have lost a child. Eleven nurses with experience of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families who have lost a child were questioned in semi-structured interviews. Data was analyzed both qualitatively and inductively. The results classified the awareness and behaviour of nurses into five categories: awareness of <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families utilizing the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s own distress, grief <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families, difficulty of <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families, scarcity of <b>care</b> systems <b>for</b> bereaved families, and discovery of the value of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families. The results of this survey showed that awareness of <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families utilizing the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s own distress is the basis <b>for</b> bereavement <b>care.</b> In addition, the findings indicate that bereavement care consistsnot only of <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the distress of a bereaved family but is also linked to working through the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s own distress. 小児専門病院および小児病棟を有する病院計 11 施設に勤務する看護者で、子どもを亡くした遺族のケアをした経験のある 11 名を対象に、「遺族へのケアを体験した看護者の認識と行動」に関する半構成的インタビューを行い、語られた内容を質的帰納的に分析した。結果、以下の 5 カテゴリーが抽出された。 1) 看護者自身の悲嘆による遺族ケアの意識化。 2) 遺族への悲嘆ケア。 3) 遺族ケアの難しさ。 4) 遺族ケア体制の乏しさ。 5) 遺族ケアの価値の見出し。調査報告日本死の臨床研究会 奨励賞受賞平成 21 - 23 年度科学研究費補助金基盤研究(C...|$|R

The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine nurses' attitudes toward <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> {{patients}} with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The study also compared the attitudes of nurses who had <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> AIDS patients with the attitudes of nurses who had not <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> AIDS patients. Educational background was also examined to see if education influences attitudes. The Ajzen-Fishbein Model of Reasoned Action was the framework used for this study. A descriptive design was used for the purpose of gaining more information regarding nurses' attitudes toward <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients with AIDS. A random sample of all registered nurses in the state of Indiana was used for this study. The data obtained were analyzed using frequency distributions, independent t-tests, and analysis of variance. Nurses in general are sill uncomfortable with <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> AIDS patients. Between 40 % and 50 % of nurses are fearful of contracting the AIDS virus and fearful of putting their family at risk. On the other hand, approximately the same percentage are comfortable <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> AIDS patients. Furthermore, nurses believe that health care agencies should <b>care</b> <b>for</b> AIDS patients, but believe that nurses should have the right to refuse to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> AIDS patients. Results of this study indicated that educational background does not influence nurses' attitudes toward <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients with AIDS. However, as nurses have more experience <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> patients with AIDS, they appear to develop more positive attitudes. School of NursingThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
