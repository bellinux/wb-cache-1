25|$|As {{with many}} Japanese designs, {{it had a}} very low profile and was {{intended}} to be operated from a squat or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner and open carriage-style legs which could be spread to improve the stability. The breech had a semi-automatic <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> ejection system to improve reloading time. When the shell was loaded, the rear of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> tripped a catch closing the breechblock. The recoil action of firing opened the breech and extracted the <b>cartridge</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

25|$|The M5 used fixed ammunition, {{with the}} same 76.2x585R <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> - {{designated}} 3inch <b>Cartridge</b> <b>Case</b> Mk IIM2 - as other descendants of the 3inch M1918 anti-aircraft gun, and had basically the same barrel. This meant that the gun had the same anti-tank characteristics as those of vehicle mounted anti-tank guns derived from the T9, namely the M6 (used in the 3inch Gun Motor Carriage M5, which never reached production) and the M7 (which was the main armament of the 3 inch Gun Motor Carriage M10 and the M6 Heavy Tank). The ballistic characteristics of the gun were, interestingly, also {{essentially the same as}} the 76 mm gun M1, despite the two being completely different weapons.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the German {{practice}} of sliding block breeches {{that required a}} metallic <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> to seal the gun's chamber against combustion gases, Škoda preferred to use an interrupted screw breech with a deBange obdurator to seal the chamber. This lowered the rate of fire, but had the great economic advantage of allowing bagged propellant charges that didn't use scarce brass or steel <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> when those metals were in short supply. The other unusual feature of the gun was that it used a monobloc auto-frettaged barrel. This was {{a single piece of}} steel that was radially expanded under hydraulic pressure. This had the advantage of placing the steel of the barrel under compression, which helped it resist the stresses of firing and was simpler and faster to build since the barrel didn't require assembly as with more traditional construction techniques.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the tubes or chutes {{coming out of the}} fixed mounted aviation LMG 08/15 fixed guns were for expended <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases.</b> In actuality these attachments were for guiding the empty cartridge belts into a container inside the fuselage of the aircraft so that the belts would not interfere with the operation of the aircraft. As the entire MG 08 Spandau family of German machine guns ejected their empty <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> forward through a round hole in the receiver under the barrel (as can be clearly seen on many videos), these <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> were guided out of the aircraft (except on Martin Kreutzer-designed Fokker biplane fighter aircraft, and the Fokker fighters designed by Kreutzer's successor Reinhold Platz) through tubes from under the barrel {{to the bottom of the}} fuselage. With Fokker designed aircraft following the Eindecker, the <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> were ejected without tubes from the receiver hole directly into open trays that guided the tumbling <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> backward and sideways onto the sloped fuselage decking, which then streamed down past the cockpit on either side. These trays are clearly visible in photographs but have rarely been recognized for their purpose.|$|R

5000|$|... "There {{were many}} German {{military}} {{versions of the}} cartridge, and Germany never stopped its development of different variations until the end" [...] of World War II. [...] "The bullet lengths varied a great deal through the different types, but all were loaded to an overall length" [...] of 80.5 mm. The Germans had started using steel cases in World War I, [...] "and {{by the end of}} 1943, most German ammunition had that type of case." [...] The weights and case capacities of the World War II military <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> varied somewhat. The German military ammunition manufacturer Polte produced brass <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> weighing 10.32 g (159 gr) with 4.03 ml (62 gr) H2O case capacity and steel <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> weighing 10.90 g (168 gr) with 3.95 ml (61 gr) H2O case capacity. The steel <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> were produced in copper plated and lacquered executions.|$|R
25|$|The {{barrel of}} the M-30 was of {{built-up}} construction and consisted of a liner, jacket and breech. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, with forced <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> extraction. The gun was equipped with a hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire.|$|E
25|$|The shells {{for this}} gun were loaded {{by two men}} using a tray. It had eyes which engaged hooks on the breech of the gun and then the shell and powder was {{manually}} rammed. It used the German naval system of ammunition, where the base charge was held in a metallic <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag that was rammed first.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a modern}} {{revolver}} of Russian design, the OTs-38, which uses ammunition that incorporates the silencing mechanism into the <b>cartridge</b> <b>case,</b> making the gap between cylinder and barrel irrelevant {{as far as the}} suppression issue is concerned. The OTs-38 does need an unusually close and precise fit between the cylinder and barrel due to the shape of bullet in the special ammunition (Soviet SP-4), which was originally designed for use in a semi-automatic.|$|E
25|$|The gun fired semi-fixed {{ammunition}}, {{similar to}} the ammunition of the M2; it used the same projectiles and the same 105mm <b>Cartridge</b> <b>Case</b> M14, but with different propelling charge. The latter used faster burning powder to avoid incomplete burning; it consisted of a base charge and four increments, forming five charges from 1 (the smallest) to 5 (the largest). In an emergency, gunners were authorized to fire M1 HE rounds prepared for the Howitzer M2, but only with charges from 1 to 3. M1 HE rounds for the M3 could be fired from an M2 with any charge.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works began {{producing}} {{smokeless powder}} for firearms ammunition {{in the early}} 1890s. Peyton Powder, prepared at Santa Cruz {{under the direction of}} assistant superintendent William Peyton, had an unusual addition of ammonium picrate to the conventional double-base formulation of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Peyton Powder was selected by the United States Army in 1893 for early cartridges for the new Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. The powder works also produced CPW Smokeless powder and loaded shotgun ammunition marketed as Native Son Cartridges after the army adopted W.A. powder in 1896 to avoid <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> corrosion caused by picric acid in the Peyton Powder.|$|E
30|$|The {{microscopic}} examination of fired <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> and fired bullets helps the expert {{to determine if}} a suspect firearm/firearms were, or were not, discharged in a shooting incident. This is achieved by using a combination of class and individual characteristics.

50|$|The CETME design {{inherits}} the StG45(M)'s fixed-barrel. However, the CETME Model 58 {{introduced a}} novel {{solution to the}} problem of cartridges sticking in the chamber. That is a fluted chamber, which are horizontal grooves in the chamber, that allow the <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> to float on a layer of gas to aid extraction. The horizontal marking left on spent <b>cartridge</b> <b>cases</b> has become a signature of this design.|$|R

25|$|The 46-caliber21-K was {{a minimal}} {{adaptation}} of the 53-K anti-tank gun that was created by taking the latter's barrel and mounting it on a simple pedestal mount. Its semi-automatic breech automatically ejected the <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> and locked open, {{ready for the next}} round. This was less than ideal for an anti-aircraft weapon that relied on its rate of fire to inflict damage on aircraft because every round had to be hand-loaded. Fully automatic weapons of roughly this caliber like the 40 mm Bofors typically used 4-5 round clips of ammunition to produce rates of fire four times as high.|$|E
25|$|Dando's BBC {{colleague}} Nick Ross stated on Newsnight on {{the night}} of her death that retaliatory attacks by criminals against police, lawyers and judges were almost unknown in Britain. Finally, forensic examination of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> and bullet recovered from the scene of the attack suggested that the weapon used had been the result of a workshop conversion of a replica or decommissioned gun. It was argued that a professional assassin would not use such a poor quality weapon. The police therefore soon began to favour the idea that the killing had been carried out by a crazed individual acting on an opportunist basis. This assumed profile of the perpetrator led to the focus on Barry George.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short distance. As the bolt carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a slot on the bolt carrier, forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty <b>cartridge</b> <b>case</b> from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|E
