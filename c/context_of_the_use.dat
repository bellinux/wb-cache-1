5|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media {{only in terms of}} the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of Native American names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. The accumulation of research on the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT I {{review in}} this paper how J. L. Austin relativizes <b>the</b> {{question}} <b>of</b> truth to <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> sentence-tokens, especially to the specific purposes with which a given user employs them. This has the consequence that truth becomes more matter of only being 'roughly' accurate, relative to a certain uses of sentence-tokens, rather than an inherent property of sentences in their putative correspondence to the world 'out there'. Austin's unease with the way philosophers have traditionally handled <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> truth thus stands out independently of his trademark thesis of verediction taking precedence over verum, the latter only taking its strength from the authority commanded by the one behind the former. This in turns opens up several new avenues of research, a fact that goes to prove that Austin {{has a lot to}} teach future generations of researchers...|$|R

50|$|In Brazil, CONFEN (the Federal Drug Council) has {{consistently}} upheld {{the right of}} the Daime Church to practice its religion and healing practices using the Daime. A study was made of the Daime by the CONFEN in 1987 which included visits to the various churches and observation of the making of the Daime. It also included study of another group of Ayahuasca users, who call the drink vegetal (União do Vegetal - UDV). The work group which made the study included representatives not only of the CONFEN but also of several other government agencies. The conclusion of the study was that the Daime was a very positive influence in the community, encouraging social harmony and personal integration. The study noted that, rather than simply considering the pharmacological analysis of the plants, it was essential to consider the whole <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of the tea—religious, social, and cultural.|$|E
40|$|Education in Australia, {{it could}} be argued, has {{undergone}} a "digital turn"(Buchanan, 2011). That is to say, digital technologies are no longer simply something that students learn "about," but are now something that they increasingly learn "with. " It is a common expectation that digital competencies are embedded {{in all areas of}} teaching across all years <b>of</b> education. <b>The</b> push for <b>the</b> increased <b>use</b> <b>of</b> technology in education can be understood as a product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> globalization <b>of</b> education, evident not only in the Australian education system, but in education systems worldwide. Within this global <b>context,</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> research into educational technology is also undergoing a shift and an expansion in focus. Selwyn highlights the need for researchers in this area to be "looking beyond learning" (2010, p. 65). He calls for a critical research approach, one that incorporates a richer account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contexts</b> in which educational technologies are employed; one that examines wider political, social, and cultural <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> digital technologies, and one that queries the implications for social justice and democracy...|$|R

Euro-Americans exposed to mascots {{may be more likely}} to believe not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research demonstrates the harm of stereotyping, with studies showing that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking among citizens with regard to other groups.|$|E

Text normalization for a token seems very straightforward without it's context. But given <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>used</b> token and then normalizing becomes tricky for some classes. We present a novel approach in which <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> our classification algorithm is used by our sequence to sequence model to predict <b>the</b> normalized text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input token. Our approach takes very less time to learn and perform well unlike what has been reported by Google (5 days on their GPU cluster).
