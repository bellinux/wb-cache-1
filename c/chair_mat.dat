40|$|Boredom and {{disengagement}} metrics {{are crucial}} to the correctly timed implementation of adaptive interventions in interactive systems. psychological research suggests that boredom (which other HCI teams {{have been able to}} partially quantify with pressure-sensing <b>chair</b> <b>mats)</b> is actually a composite: lethargy and restlessness. Here we present an innovative approach to the measurement and recognition of these two kinds of boredom, based on motion capture and video analysis of changes in head and shoulder positions. Discrete, three-minute, computer-presented stimuli (games, quizzes, films and music) covering a spectrum from engaging to boring/disengaging were used to elicit changes in cognitive/emotional states in seated, healthy volunteers. Interaction with the stimuli occurred with a handheld trackball instead of a mouse, so movements were assumed to be non-instrumental. Our results include a feature (standard deviation of windowed ranges) that may be more specific to boredom than mean speed of head movement, and that could be implemented in computer vision algorithms for disengagement detection...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: The common bedbug Cimex lectularius Linnaeus 1758 (Hemiptera:Cimicidae) is a {{globally}} re-emerging pest {{of serious}} public health concern. We investigated bedbuginfestation in randomly selected apartments in Gbajimba community in Guma Local Governmentarea in Benue state, Nigeria. Methods: Beddings and furniture (bed frames, pillows, mattresses, cushion <b>chairs,</b> <b>mats,</b> mosquitonets and bamboo beds) were thoroughly inspected for bedbug infestation using the hand-pickingtechnique. Data were analysed using chi-square analysis {{for differences in}} the infestation levels inharbourages and sampling locations. Results: Only 16 % of the apartments investigated showed no evidence of bedbug infestation asegg cases and faecal marks were sighted in 62. 2 % of apartments surveyed. The highest infestationrate was observed in Angwan Jukun area and infestation here was higher compared to other studylocations within the town though {{the difference was not}} statistically significant ( 2 = 7. 92, df = 6,p > 0. 05). Bamboo beds harboured the highest number of bedbugs collected, accounting for 35. 8 %,while other harbourages like iron bed frames and sleeping mats had 23 and 22. 7 % infestationrates respectively. The infestation rates in these household items were significantly higher thanother items inspected ( 2 = 11. 8, df = 4, p > 0. 05). Interpretation & conclusion: This study demonstrates the urgent need for identification of evidencesof infestation and bedbug management involving community participation in inspection, detectionand education, including physical removal and exclusion as well as pesticide application...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of high-rise flats to minimize urban slum areas in Indonesia still create space use behavior problems for its residents {{due to the}} changes of space configuration between high-rise landed housing. Conventional high-rise flats cannot well accommodate the needs of social interactions happened in landed housing because of its spatial limitation that leads to uncertainty of space use behavior settings. This study aims to {{understand the relationship between}} spatial configuration on high-rise flats and social interaction levels of its residents. The object of study is Jatinegara Barat high-rise flats built to relocate slums community from the landed housing in Kampong Pulo. This study applies mix method research using space syntax method to analyze spatial configuration by looking at connectivity and space integration values, and then comparing it with social interaction data from place centered observation to find out the level of interaction and spaces tendency used interaction place. The results of this study indicate that: (1) the relationship of spatial configuration to social interaction level in Jatinegara Barat flats can be positive or negative. (2) Positive relationships are found on the 1 st and 2 ndfloor areas. High configuration values with high interaction levels are found in shared spaces on the 1 st and 2 nd floors with characteristics such as open space, large space, and availability of interaction supporting elements, while low configuration values with low interaction levels are found in more confined spaces such as private spaces and narrow corridors. (3) Negative relationships are found in the corridor and shared space in front of the elevator on each typical floors. Shared space in front of the elevator that has high spatial configuration value with large area show a low level of social interaction. While corridor with lower configuration value with the narrow area but have supporting elements such as <b>chairs,</b> <b>mats,</b> and shops have a higher level of social interaction. (4) This study shows {{that in the case of}} the relationship between spatial configuration and social interaction, availability of interaction supporting elements has greater influence rather than any other spatial factors...|$|R

Elders are served first at meals, and in their absence a spoonful of rice is put aside first in the pot as a token of respect ( [...] u cha) before serving the meal. Young people would avoid sitting on a higher level than the elders or passing in front of them unless unavoidable, and then only treading softly with a slight bow.

After Gunn again interjected himself, Snow was able to go underneath the mat to find some weapons including a Philadelphia Flyers hockey stick much to the delight of the crowd. The match ended when Gunn put Snow through a table in the corner, originally intended for Gunn and then used the Fameasser on Snow, driving him into a <b>chair</b> on the <b>mat.</b> As the referee counted, Holly struck Gunn with a weapon, quickly covering Snow to steal his second championship reign. [...] The WWF Tag Team Championship match began with Jeff Jarrett and D'Lo Brown exchanging running maneuvers before both tagging in their respective partners at which point Test used a pumphandle slam on Owen Hart, but tried again after a failed pincount only to be met with an enziguiri and then the Sharpshooter. Brown came in illegally to break it up but was tagged in straight afterwards, dominating both Hart and Jarrett with power slams and dropkicks, almost winning the match after a Sky High that was broken up by Jarrett. Referee Jimmy Korderas was distracted when Debra (Debra Marshall) came to the apron to distract Brown only to be pulled down by Ivory (Lisa Moretti), at which point PMS (Terri Runnels and Jacqueline Moore) arrived and all of them began to fight while Test tried to pull them apart. With everyone distracted, Hart missile dropkicked Brown allowing Jarrett to roll Brown up and sit on him, securing a pin count.|$|R
40|$|The 27 th Symposium of the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) Study Group on Ethnochoreology {{took place}} at the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick, Ireland, from 22 nd – 29 th July, 2012. The University, {{situated}} on the River Shannon in the mid-west of Ireland, provided a beautiful location for the Symposium. The year, 2012, marked a fiftieth-year celebration of the Study Group that evolved within the earlier International Folk Music Council (IFMC). Hosting this Symposium was, therefore, of special significance to the University of Limerick particularly since the first Master of Arts degree in Ethnochoreology, at any university in Europe, was established at the University of Limerick in 1996. The success of this event was due to the assistance and support of many people and institutions. Micheál Ó Súilleabháin (Director), Sandra Joyce (Acting Director), and faculty and staff of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, facilitated and supported this biennial meeting of the Symposium. The Arts Council of Ireland, the European Cultural Contact Point, Fáilte Ireland, and the University of Limerick Foundation all provided financial assistance. The National Dance Archive of Ireland at the Glucksman Library, Dance Research Forum Ireland, and ICTM Ireland also provided support. The many talented students at the Irish World Academy, including alumni of the postgraduate programmes in Ethnochoreology and Irish Traditional Dance Performance contributed {{to the success of the}} meeting by performing at the Opening Reception and at the 50 th Anniversary Concert. Like all important events, rigorous organisation in programming combined with social interaction and networking was pivotal. The Local Arrangements Committee: Catherine Foley (<b>Chair),</b> Colin Quigley, <b>Mats</b> Melin, and Orfhlaith Ni Bhriain coordinated their efforts to make the Symposium run in a smooth and professional manner. The Programme Committee: Colin Quigley (Chair), Hanafi Bin Hussin, Mehmet Öcal Özbilgin, Daniela Stavelová, and Judy van Zile, skillfuly arranged a programme schedule. The board of the ICTM Study Group on Ethnochoreology, in particular Laszló Felfoldi (Chair) and Anne von Bibra Wharton (Secretary), also provided much support and assistance. Presenters at the Symposium came from far and near including Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. They presented on two themes. Theme 1 : Dance and Place; and Theme 2 : Dance and Festival. Thirty-eight individual presenters and one roundtable presented on Theme 1, while eighteen individual presenters presented on Theme 2. Throughout the week, various Study Group meetings took place. In addition, recent scholarly publications of individuals of the Study Group together with DVD compilations of previous Study Group symposia were made available for purchase. The Organising Committee included a number of social and cultural events throughout the week. On Monday evening, 23 rd July, it hosted a Céilí dance workshop. This was in preparation for the barbecue Céilí on Saturday evening, 28 th July. A film evening was also introduced during the Symposium. On Tuesday evening, 24 th July, the film evening took place in Theatre 1 of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance. The Pearse Moore Oscar Academy Award nominated film, Dance Lexie Dance (1996) was shown as well as the 2 ̆ 7 Master Class 2 ̆ 7 documentary programme from the televised Rising Steps series, produced by Stirling Productions. These were based on Irish dance. Three short UNESCO films followed on Flamenco, Slovatsco, and the Mevlevi Ceremony. On Wednesday afternoon, participants went on an excursion to the village of Killaloe in County Clare. Here they had the opportunity to explore the village and go on a short boat cruise on Lough Derg. On board, members of the Local Arrangements Committee entertained with some Irish traditional music and dance and Symposium participants also shared music, song and dance from their cultures. This was followed by dinner in Flanagan 2 ̆ 7 s Restaurant on the banks of Lough Derg. After the Study Group 2 ̆ 7 s Business Meeting on Thursday afternoon, 26 th July, the participants had the opportunity to visit the National Dance Archive of Ireland at the Glucksman Library, University of Limerick. This was followed by the Pioneers 2 ̆ 7 Dinner and the 50 th Anniversary Concert. Students, alumni, and faculty of the Irish World Academy performed at this concert. It included traditional Irish dance and music performances and new choreographed Irish theatrical solos and ensemble works. On the final day, participants went on an optional excursion to the Burren in County Clare. They also visited the village of Doolin, the Cliffs of Moher, and finished with dinner in Bunratty Castle where they were entertained by local traditional musicians and dancers. All participants of the Symposium contributed to a stimulating, enjoyable, and a culturally enriching experience. This publication is a record of the entire event and the scholarly presentations at the Symposium. Abstracts are included for those scholars who did not submit their papers. A number of the texts are written by scholars whose first language is not English. To unify the style of the volume, the editors, Elsie Ivancich Dunin and Catherine Foley, standardised the language use and the reference style format of all papers. They endeavoured to retain the voices of the authors. Also, when representing the voices of field consultants in papers some scholars chose to use italics while others did not. The editors permitted both. The Dunin and deAlaiza 2 ̆ 7 s DdA reference format for dance as an internationally friendly style format was applied, and British English spelling was used throughout. The publication of papers from the 27 th Symposium of the Study Group on Ethnochoreology would not have been possible without the financial support of the European Cultural Contact Point and institutional support of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, and the University of Limerick...|$|R
