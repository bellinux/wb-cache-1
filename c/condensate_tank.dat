40|$|Abstract. Following {{the nuclear}} power plant {{accident}} in Fukushima Japan, seismic capacity evaluation has become a crucial issue in combination building safety. <b>Condensate</b> storage <b>tanks</b> are designed to supplies water to the condensate transfer pumps, the control rod drive hydraulic system pumps, and the condenser makeup. A separate connection to the <b>condensate</b> storage <b>tank</b> is used to supply water for the high pressure coolant injection system, reactor core isolation cooling system, and core spray system pumps. A <b>condensate</b> storage <b>tank</b> {{is defined as a}} seismic class I structure, playing the important role of providing flow to the operational system and the required static head for the suction of the condensate transfer pumps and the normal supply pump. According to the latest nuclear safety requirements, soil structure interaction must be considered in all seismic analyses. This study aims to rebuild the computer model of <b>condensate</b> storage <b>tanks</b> in Taiwan using the SAP 2000 program in conjunction with the lumped mass stick model and to evaluate the soil structure interaction by employing the SASSI 2000 program. The differences between the results with the soil structure interaction and spring model are compared via natural frequency and response spectrum curves. This computer model enables engineers to rapidly evaluate the safety margin of <b>condensate</b> storage <b>tank</b> following the occurrence of earthquakes or tsunamis...|$|R

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{converts}} {{the high}} level waste slurries stored at the Savannah River Site into borosilicate glass for long-term storage. The vitrification process results in the generation of approximately five gallons of dilute recycle streams for each gallon of waste slurry vitrified. This dilute recycle stream is currently transferred to the H-area Tank Farm and amounts to approximately 1, 400, 000 gallons of effluent per year. Process changes to incorporate salt waste could {{increase the amount of}} effluent to approximately 2, 900, 000 gallons per year. The recycle consists of two major streams and four smaller streams. The first major recycle stream is condensate from the Chemical Process Cell (CPC), and is collected in the Slurry Mix Evaporator <b>Condensate</b> <b>Tank</b> (SMECT). The second major recycle stream is the melter offgas which is collected in the Off Gas <b>Condensate</b> <b>Tank</b> (OGCT). The four smaller streams are the sample flushes, sump flushes, decon solution, and High Efficiency Mist Eliminator (HEME) dissolution solution. These streams are collected in the Decontamination Waste Treatment Tank (DWTT) or the Recycle Collection Tank (RCT). All recycle streams are currently combined in the RCT and treated with sodium nitrite and sodium hydroxide prior to transfer to the tank farm. Tank Farm space limitations and previous outages in the 2 H Evaporator system due to deposition of sodium alumino-silicates have led to evaluation of alternative methods of dealing with the DWPF recycle. One option identified for processing the recycle was a dedicated evaporator to concentrate the recycle stream to allow the solids to be recycled to the DWPF Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and the condensate from this evaporation process to be sent and treated in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). In order to meet process objectives, the recycle stream must be concentrated to 1 / 30 th of the feed volume during the evaporation process. The concentrated stream must be pumpable to the DWPF SRAT vessel and should not precipitate solids to avoid fouling the evaporator vessel and heat transfer coils. The evaporation process must not generate excessive foam and must have a high Decontamination Factor (DF) for many species in the evaporator feed to allow the condensate to be transferred to the ETP. An initial scoping study was completed in 2001 to evaluate the feasibility of the evaporator which concluded that the concentration objectives could be met. This initial study was based on initial estimates of recycle concentration and was based solely on OLI modeling of the evaporation process. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has completed additional studies using simulated recycle streams and OLI{reg_sign} simulations.

The climate change is a theme of fundamental importance for the enterprices and they seek to contribute by reducing its own carbon footprint. Pepsi Company is not far behind and for this reason counts in three phases to achieve the objective: Measure, reduce and compensate. This project seeks to reduce the quantity of búnker fuel mayor consumed by the company. It currently has a shell boiler of 200 BHP which sometimes only works for feeding one equipment. This causes unnecessary fuel consumption and increases emissions of CO 2 from the company. By designing a heat recovery system the most energy of compressed air systems and ammonia cooling system is utilized. In addition the use of solar collectors is for having a cleaned energy proposed. As for the systems that will be intervened is the Alcip sanitation, San Martin washing glass machine and tank boiler condensate.

The VOC compositions in the vicinity of individual gas and oil wells and other point sources such as evaporation ponds, compressor stations and injection wells are compared to the measurements at Horse Pool. High mixing ratios of aromatics, alkanes, cycloalkanes and methanol were observed for extended periods of time and for short-term spikes caused by local point sources.

40|$|Testing was {{performed}} to determine the feasibility and processing characteristics of evaporation of actual Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) recycle material. Samples of the Off Gas <b>Condensate</b> <b>Tank</b> (OGCT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator <b>Condensate</b> <b>Tank</b> (SMECT) were transferred from DWPF to the Savannah River National Lab (SRNL) Shielded Cells and blended with De-Ionized (DI) water and {{a small amount of}} Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) product. A total of 3000 mL of this feed was concentrated to approximately 90 mL during a semi-batch evaporation test of approximately 17 hours. One interruption occurred during the run when the feed tube developed a split and was replaced. Samples of the resulting condensate and concentrate were collected and analyzed. The resulting analysis of the condensate was compared to the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) limits for the F/H Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). Results from the test were compared to previous testing using simulants and OLI modeling. Conclusions from this work included the following: (1) The evaporation of DWPF recycle to achieve a 30 X concentration factor was successfully demonstrated. The feed blend of OGCT and SMECT material was concentrated from 3000 mL to approximately 90 mL during testing, a concentration of approximately 33 X. (2) Foaming was observed during the run. Dow Corning 2210 antifoam was added seven times throughout the run at 100 parts per million (ppm) per addition. The addition of this antifoam was very effective in reducing the foam level, but the impact diminished over time and additional antifoam was required every 2 to 3 hours during the run. (3) No scale or solids formed on the evaporator vessel, but splatter was observed in the headspace of the evaporator vessel. No scaling formed on the stainless steel thermocouple. (4) The majority of the analytes met the F/H ETP WAC. However, the detection limits for selected species (Sr- 90, Pu- 238, Pu- 240, Am- 243, and Cm- 244) exceeded the ETP WAC limits. (5) I- 129 was calculated to have exceeded the ETP WAC limits based on an assumed Decontamination Factor (DF) of 1 during evaporation. (6) The DF for most species was limited by the detection limits of the sample analysis. Based on iron, manganese, total alpha, total beta, and other species, very low entrainment was noted and evaporator DF was > 10, 000 for non-volatile species. (7) Very low DF's were obtained for selected species, especially mercury and formate. These species are present as volatile compounds and will exceed ETP WAC limits if sufficient concentrations are in the evaporator feed. (8) The evaporator DF's for the radioactive test were in good agreement with simulant test results. Differences noted in the DF of selected species, such as Hg, were more likely attributed to analytical issues than differences in the performance of the two evaporators. (9) The simulant appeared to be conservative in terms of foaming and scaling characteristics of the evaporator. The initial spike in foaming that occurred during all simulant runs did not occur during the Shielded Cells run and overall foaminess after the start of the test was controlled by antifoam additions. The splatter that was deposited during the radioactive test was less than the simulant runs and was more easily removed. (10) The OLI model results were overly conservative due to the manner that entrainment of solids was incorporated into the model...|$|E

40|$|Based on lab-scale {{simulations}} of Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) slurry chemistry, {{the addition of}} sodium nitrite and sodium hydroxide to waste slurries at concentrations sufficient to take the aqueous phase into the alkaline region (pH > 7) with approximately 500 mg nitrite ion/kg slurry (assuming < 25 wt% total solids, or equivalently 2, 000 mg nitrite/kg total solids) is sufficient to effectively deactivate the noble metal catalysts at temperatures between room temperature and boiling. This is a potential strategy for eliminating catalytic hydrogen generation {{from the list of}} concerns for sludge carried over into the DWPF Slurry Mix Evaporator <b>Condensate</b> <b>Tank</b> (SMECT) or Recycle Collection Tank (RCT). These conclusions are drawn in large part from the various phases of the DWPF catalytic hydrogen generation program conducted between 2005 and 2009. The findings could apply to various situations, including a solids carry-over from either the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) or Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) into the SMECT with subsequent transfer to the RCT, as well as a spill of formic acid into the sump system and transfer into an RCT that already contains sludge solids. There are other potential mitigating factors for the SMECT and RCT, since these vessels are typically operated at temperatures close to the minimum temperatures that catalytic hydrogen has been observed to occur in either the SRAT or SME (pure slurry case), and these vessels are also likely to be considerably more dilute in both noble metals and formate ion (the two essential components to catalytic hydrogen generation) than the two primary process vessels. Rhodium certainly, and ruthenium likely, are present as metal-ligand complexes that are favored under certain concentrations of the surrounding species. Therefore, in the SMECT or RCT, where a small volume of SRAT or SME material would be significantly diluted, conditions would be less optimal for forming or sustaining the catalytic ligand species. Such conditions are likely to adversely impact the ability of the transferred mass to produce hydrogen at the same rate (per unit mass SRAT or SME slurry) as in the SRAT or SME vessels...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{recently}} received a deposit sample from the Melter Primary Off Gas System (POG) of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). This sample {{was composed of}} material that had been collected while the quencher was in operation January 27, 2011 through March 31, 2011. DWPF requested, through a technical assistance request, characterization of the melter off-gas deposits by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and chemical analysis. The purpose of the Melter Off-Gas System {{is to reduce the}} amount of radioactive particles and mercury in the gases vented to the atmosphere. Gases emitted from the melter pass through the primary film cooler, quencher, Off-Gas <b>Condensate</b> <b>Tank</b> (OGCT), Steam Atomized Scrubbers (SAS), a condenser, a high efficiency mist eliminator, and a high efficiency particulate air filter, before being vented to the Process Vessel Vent System. The film coolers cool the gases leaving the melter vapor space from {approx} 750 C to {approx} 375 C, by introducing air and steam to the flow. In the next step, the quencher cools the gas to about 60 C by bringing the condensate from the OGCT in contact with the effluent (Figure 1). Most of the steam in the effluent is then condensed and the melter vapor space pressure is reduced. The purpose of the OGCT is to collect and store the condensate formed during the melter operation. Condensate from the OGCT is circulated to the SAS and atomized with steam. This atomized condensate is mixed with the off-gas to wet and join the particulate which is then removed in the cyclone. The next stage incorporates a chilled water condenser which separates the vapors and elemental mercury from the off-gas steam. Primary off-gas deposit samples from the DWPF melter have previously been analyzed. In 2003, samples from just past the film cooler, from the inlet of the quencher and inside the quencher were analyzed at SRNL. It was determined that the samples were a mixture of sludge and glass frit. The major component was Si along with Fe, Al, and other elements in the radioactive waste being processed. The deposits analyzed also contained U- 235 fission products and actinide elements. Prior to that, deposits in the off-gas system in the DWPF nonradioactive half scale melter and the one-tenth scale integrated DWPF melter system were analyzed and determined to be mixtures of alkali rich chlorides, sulfates, borates, and fluorides entrained with iron oxides, spinels and frit particles formed by vapor-phase transport and condensation. Additional work was performed in 2007 in which researchers similarly found the deposits to be a combination of sludge and frit particles...|$|E
40|$|Savannah River Remediation&#x 27;s (SRR&#x 27;s) Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) Laboratory {{currently}} {{tests for}} sludge carry-over into the Recycle Collection Tank (RCT) by evaluating the iron {{concentration in the}} Slurry Mix Evaporator <b>Condensate</b> <b>Tank</b> (SMECT) and relating this iron concentration {{to the amount of}} sludge solids present. A new method was proposed for detecting the amount of sludge in the SMECT that involves the use of an Optek turbidity sensor. Waste Services Laboratory (WSL) personnel conducted testing on two of these units following a test plan developed by Waste Solidification Engineering (WSE). Both Optek units (SN 64217 and SN 65164) use sensor model AF 16 -N and signal converter model series C 4000. The sensor body of each unit was modified to hold a standard DWPF 12 cc sample vial, also known as a &#x 27;&#x 27;peanut&#x 27;&#x 27; vial. The purpose of this testing was to evaluate the use of this model of turbidity sensor, or meter, to provide a measurement of the sludge solids present in the SMECT based upon samples from that tank. During discussions of the results from this study by WSE, WSL, and Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) personnel, an upper limit on the acceptable level of solids in SMECT samples was set at 0. 14 wt%. A &#x 27;&#x 27;go/no-go&#x 27;&#x 27; decision criterion was to be developed for the critical turbidity response, which is expressed in concentration units (CUs), for each Optek unit based upon the 0. 14 wt% solids value. An acceptable or a &#x 27;&#x 27;go&#x 27;&#x 27; decision for the SMECT should reflect the situation that there is an identified risk (e. g. 5 %) for a CU response from the Optek unit to be less than the critical CU value when the solids content of the SMECT is actually 0. 14 wt% or greater, while a &#x 27;&#x 27;no-go&#x 27;&#x 27; determination (i. e., an Optek CU response above the critical CU value, a conservative decision relative to risk) would lead to additional evaluations of the SMECT to better quantify the possible solids content of the tank. A sludge simulant was used to develop standards for testing both Optek units and to determine the viability of a &#x 27;&#x 27;go/no-go&#x 27;&#x 27; CU response for each of the units. Statistical methods were used by SRNL to develop the critical CU value for the &#x 27;&#x 27;go/no-go&#x 27;&#x 27; decision for these standards for each Optek unit. Since only one sludge simulant was available for this testing, the sensitivity of these results to other simulants and to actual sludge material is not known. However, limited testing with samples from the actual DWPF process (both SRAT product samples and SMECT samples) demonstrated that the use of the &#x 27;&#x 27;go/no-go&#x 27;&#x 27; criteria developed from the sludge simulant testing was conservative for these samples taken from Sludge Batch 7 b (SB 7 b), the sludge batch currently being processed. While both of the Optek units performed very reliably during this testing, there were statistically significant differences (although small on a practical scale) between the two units. Thus, testing should be conducted on any new unit of this Optek model to qualify it before it is used to support the DWPF operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{inadvertent}} {{opening of}} a pressure relief valve results in a reactor coolant inventory decrease {{and a decrease in}} reactor coolant system pressure. A pressure relief valve, as defined in ANSI B 95. 1 - 1972 (Ref. 1), is a pressure relief device which is designed to reclose and prevent further fluid flow after normal condi-tions have been restored. The effect of the pressure decrease is to decrease the neutron flux (via moderator density feedback). In a pressurized water reactor (PWR), a reactor trip occurs due to low reactor coolant system (RCS) pressure. In a boiling water reactor (BWR), the pressure relief valve discharges into the suppression pool. Normally there is no reactor trip in a BWR. The pressure regulator senses the RCS pressure decrease and partially closes the turbine control valves (TCV) to stabilize the reactor at a lower pressure. The reactor power settles out at nearly the initial power level. The coolant inventory is maintained by the feedwater control system using water from the <b>condensate</b> storage <b>tank</b> via the condenser hotwell. The review of these transients should consider the sequence of events, th...|$|R
5000|$|Dissolved oxygen {{is removed}} by injecting {{auxiliary}} exhaust steam {{into the upper}} portion of the tank (above the feed water level) {{at roughly the same}} location (elevation) that the <b>condensate</b> enters the <b>tank.</b> The two are put in close physical contact over a large surface area to maximize heat transfer. As the condensate is heated, the steam drives off any dissolved gasses. Since the steam is injected above the feed water level a steam blanket forms above the water to keep the non-condensable gasses from re-entering the feed water. There is a connection to the gland exhaust system on the upper portion of the DFT that withdraws the oxygen and other non-condensable gasses as they are driven from the condensate. Removing oxygen minimizes corrosion and improves the vacuum quality.|$|R
40|$|Natural gas {{processing}} {{is a major}} industry in Alberta, Canada, and {{a significant source of}} fugitive emissions of both methane and volatile organic hydrocarbon (VOCs). This project investigated fugitive emissions at natural {{gas processing}} plants in Alberta using two complementary optical measurement methods. At five gas plants, the fugitive emissions of methane and hydrocarbons ethane and larger (C 2 + hydrocarbons) were measured and quantified using Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL). The DIAL was also used to measure emissions from process flares at two of the gas plants. At two of the plants, a gas leak imaging camera was used to locate individual hydrocarbon leaks. For the five gas plants surveyed in Alberta, DIAL measured methane emissions ranged from 100 to 146 kg/hr and C 2 + hydrocarbon emissions ranged from 38 to 342 kg/hr. Compressors and <b>condensate</b> storage <b>tanks</b> were two significant emission sources at all of the gas plants. Process flares operating on pilot were typically responsible for 10 to 15 % of the total methane emissions. At two gas plants the DIAL measured emissions of methane, VOCs and benzene were compared with values calculated using emission factor methods. Measured emissions of methane and VOCs were four to eight times higher than the emission factor estimates. The largest differences between measured values and estimates were for the flares and storage tanks. DIAL measured values gave a more realistic evaluation of revenue lost as fugitives than the industry accepted estimation methods, leading to an increased incentive to improve leak detection and repair...|$|R
