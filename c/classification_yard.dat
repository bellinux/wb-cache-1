5|$|Freight rail {{transportation}} in Moncton {{is provided by}} Canadian National Railway. Although {{the presence of the}} CNR in Moncton has diminished greatly since the 1970s, the railway still maintains a large <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> and intermodal facility in the west end of the city, and the regional headquarters for Atlantic Canada is still located here as well. Passenger {{rail transportation}} is provided by Via Rail Canada, with their train the Ocean serving the Moncton railway station three days per week to Halifax and to Montreal. The downtown Via station has been refurbished and also serves as the terminal for the Maritime Bus intercity bus service.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops once {{daily in}} each {{direction}} at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Station. Ridership on the train is increasing, about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. Increased ridership has prompted southern Minnesota leaders to plan for an expansion of Amtrak's service in the area. Saint Paul {{is the site of}} the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.|$|E
25|$|Antwerp is {{also home}} to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The {{majority}} of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.|$|E

25|$|Cargo {{services}} in Tennessee are primarily served by CSX Transportation, {{which has a}} hump yard in Nashville called Radnor Yard. Norfolk Southern Railway operates lines in East Tennessee, through cities including Knoxville and Chattanooga, and operates a <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> near Knoxville, the John Sevier Yard. BNSF operates a major intermodal facility in Memphis.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} {{competition}} from highways and airline traffic meant widespread restructuring in the railroad industry since the mid-20th century. Passenger service was decreased, as people increasingly {{chose to use}} cars and planes. For freight traffic, Jackson is served by the Canadian National Railway (CN) and Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS). CN has a medium-sized yard downtown which Mill Street parallels, and KCS has a large <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> in Richland.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} opened from Bryn to Alnabru Station in 1904, with {{completion}} to Loenga on 1 May 1907. The line was electrified in 1928. A new <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> opened at Alnabru in 1970. The line {{was the site}} of the Sjursøya Accident in 2010. In order to bypass Brynsbakken, the Norwegian National Rail Administration has proposed building a tunnel from further south on the Østfold Line, named the Bryn Diagonal.|$|E

2500|$|The third Union Station's {{future was}} looking bleak by 1972 when both {{railways}} sought to increase {{return on their}} underutilized waterfront rail <b>classification</b> <b>yards</b> which was being viewed as valuable real estate. Both CN and CP began to abandon their extensive waterfront rail <b>classification</b> <b>yards</b> south of the passenger station {{to make way for}} urban redevelopment. [...] The Gardiner Expressway project was constructed over part of the railway property and CN had proposed constructing a telecommunication tower (what would become the CN Tower later that decade).|$|R

25|$|This {{expansion}} did {{not occur}} {{at the expense of}} other sites. East Salamanca was chosen in 1906 for a new roundhouse, enginehouse, and <b>classification</b> <b>yard,</b> thanks to a location convenient to the Buffalo, Middle, and Rochester Divisions. The introduction of the huge Class XX 2-8-8-2 Mallets in 1918 necessitated construction of appropriate shop facilities at East Salamanca. This included electric jacks that could lift the Mallet off the ground.|$|E
25|$|Lynchburg has {{two major}} freight railroads. It is the {{crossroads}} of two Norfolk Southern lines. One is the former mainline of the Southern Railway, upon which Kemper Street Station is situated. NS has a <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> located next to the shopping mall.

25|$|Though Chattanooga's {{most famous}} {{connection}} to the railroad industry is Chattanooga Choo Choo, a song made famous by Glenn Miller & His Orchestra, the city serves as a major freight hub with Norfolk Southern (NS) and CSX running trains on their own (and each other's) lines. The Norfolk Southern Railway's main <b>classification</b> <b>yard,</b> DeButts Yard, is just east of downtown; Norfolk Southern's Shipp's Yard and CSX's Wauhatchie Yard are southwest of the city. Norfolk Southern maintains a large railroad repair shop in Chattanooga. The two railroad companies are among the largest individual landowners in the city (the Federal Government is another).|$|E
25|$|Norfolk Southern {{acquired}} all of Conrail's {{lines in}} the Harrisburg area and has continued the city's function as a freight rail hub. Norfolk Southern considers Harrisburg one of many primary hubs in its system, and operates 2 intermodal (rail/truck transfer) yards in the immediate Harrisburg area. The Harrisburg Intermodal Yard (formerly called Lucknow Yard) {{is located in the}} north end of Harrisburg, approximately 3miles north of downtown Harrisburg and the Harrisburg Transport Center, while the Rutherford Intermodal Yard is located approximately 6miles east of downtown Harrisburg in Swatara Township, Dauphin County. Norfolk Southern also operates a significant <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> in the Harrisburg area, the Enola Yard, which is located across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg in East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County.|$|E
25|$|The city's central {{location}} and extensive highway and rail infrastructure have positioned Indianapolis {{as an important}} logistics center, home to 1,500 distribution firms employing some 100,000 workers. As home to the second largest FedEx Express hub in the world, Indianapolis International Airport ranks as the sixth busiest U.S. airport in terms of air cargo transport, handling over 1 million tons and employing 6,600 in 2015. Indianapolis is a hub for CSX Transportation, home to its division headquarters, an intermodal terminal, and <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> (in the suburb of Avon). Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops, in the enclave of Beech Grove, serve as its primary heavy maintenance and overhaul facility, while the Indianapolis Distribution Center is the company's largest material and supply terminal. In 2011, the Indianapolis metropolitan area was ranked as the tenth largest inland port in the U.S. in terms of origin-destination freight tonnage.|$|E

25|$|Over {{its history}} Grand Trunk Western has had rail yards and engine {{terminals}} located in Detroit, Battle Creek, Durand, Flat Rock, Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Port Huron, Blue Island, Illinois and Chicago. In {{each of the}} cities GTW had engine terminals and facilities for locomotive maintenance including roundhouses and turntables. Prior to 1910 the railroad constructed its major locomotive repair shops in Battle Creek and rail car repair and maintenance was handled by GTW's Port Huron car shops. Its major freight yards were Durand Yard and Pontiac Yard in the two Michigan cities that were major GTW junction pointes. There is also Nichols Yard in Battle Creek, Tunnel Yard in Port Huron, Torrey Yard near Flint and East Yard near the Milwaukee Junction area in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. City Yard was the railroad's rail yard on the Detroit riverfront adjacent to Brush Street Station and its ferry slip dock. The yard, dock and station were eventually all removed and redeveloped by 1975 for construction of the Renaissance Center. It also obtained the former Penn Central Winona Yard in Bay City when it acquired that trackage from Conrail in 1976. On Chicago's south side GTW's Elsdon Yard served as its primary yard and locomotive facility there since the railroad laid tracks into {{the city in the}} 1880s. GTW also had a smaller transfer yard south of Chicago near rail junctions Blue Island, Illinois. In 1975 GTW opened an intermodal freight terminal yard in Chicago known as Railport. The facility is in Chicago's Back of the Yards neighborhood and was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad's Levitt Street Yard. GTW also increased intermodal operations in Detroit In 1976 when it expanded its Ferndale, Michigan railyard into an intermodal facility it called GT MoTerm. The Elsdon Yard was closed and abandoned by 1990 and has been redeveloped. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton's former hump <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> in Flat Rock, which GTW acquired from its 1983 merger with DT still serves as an important freight hub for Canadian National. Several interlocking and crossing gate towers were also maintained by GTW through its history.|$|E

2500|$|The Loenga–Alnabru Line (...) is a [...] freight-only railway line in Oslo, Norway. It {{runs from}} the <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> at Loenga to Alnabru Freight Terminal, {{typically}} serving twenty trains per day. It allows trains to pass from the Østfold Line to Alnabru without passing via Oslo Central Station. It is also used by freight trains from the Sørlandet Line, which run via the Oslo Tunnel and cross over at Bryn Station. It is notorious for the steep hill Brynsbakken which it has to climb, giving it a gradient of 2.6 percent.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>classification</b> <b>yard</b> (American and Canadian English) or {{marshalling}} yard (British, Hong Kong, Indian, Australian and Canadian English) is a railway yard found at some freight train stations, used to separate railway cars on {{to one of}} several tracks.
