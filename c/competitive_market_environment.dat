50|$|The {{modern history}} of {{carpets and rugs}} began {{in the nineteenth century}} when {{increasing}} demand for handmade carpets arose on the international market. However, the traditional, hand-woven, naturally dyed Turkish carpet is a very labour-intense product, as each step in its manufacture requires considerable time, from the preparation, spinning, dyeing of the wool to setting up the loom, knotting each knot by hand, and finishing the carpet before it goes to market. In an attempt to save on resources and cost, and maximise on profit in a <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>environment,</b> synthetic dyes, non-traditional weaving tools like the power loom, and standardized designs were introduced. This led to a rapid breakdown of the tradition, resulting in the degeneration of an art which had been cultivated for centuries. The process was recognized by art historians as early as in 1902. It is hitherto unknown when exactly this process of degeneration started, but it is observed mainly since the large-scale introduction of synthetic colours took place.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to gain deeper {{insights}} into the development process led by international technology transfer and its implications for employment generation by reviewing case studies. It is argued that conventional rice research has fallen in the region of diminishing returns and, hence, greater research resources should be allocated to nonrice research and research based on new scientific principles. It is also argued that while the improved seed technology is conducive to employment generation, its impact is likely to be rather limited, which means that the development of the nonfarm sector is indispensable to achieve growth with equity. In the case of low-income economies, the paper finds that the choice of labor-using industrial technology is critical for successful development.
