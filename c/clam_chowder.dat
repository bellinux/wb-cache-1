By April 2011, the curators at the MoMA had reordered the varieties, moving <b>Clam</b> <b>Chowder</b> to the upper left and tomato {{to the bottom of}} the four rows.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the first}} European colonists of New England had a {{maritime}} orientation toward whaling (first noted about 1650) and fishing, in addition to farming. New England has developed a distinct cuisine, dialect, architecture, and government. New England cuisine {{has a reputation for}} its emphasis on seafood and dairy; <b>clam</b> <b>chowder,</b> lobster, and other products of the sea are among some of the region's most popular foods.|$|E
25|$|Warehouses {{outside the}} US {{are similar to}} those in the US. Layout, signage, and even parking lot {{markings}} are generally identical to warehouses in the US. Food court menus are tailored to international tastes, with meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, <b>clam</b> <b>chowder</b> in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK. Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local tastes, with a mix of both American and local products available.|$|E

500|$|Warhol sent Blum thirty-two [...] canvases of Campbell's Soup can portraits, each {{representing}} a particular {{variety of the}} Campbell's Soup flavors available at the time. The thirty-two canvases are very similar: each is a realistic depiction of the iconic, mostly red and white Campbell's Soup can silkscreened onto a white background. The canvases have minor variation in the lettering of the variety names. Most of the letterings are painted in red letters. Four varieties have black lettering: <b>Clam</b> <b>Chowder</b> has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (Manhattan Style), {{which means that the}} soup is tomato- and broth-based instead of the cream-based New England style; Beef has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that says (With Vegetables and Barley); Scotch Broth has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (A Hearty Soup); and Minestrone had black parenthetical lettering saying (Italian-Style Vegetable Soup). There are two varieties with red lettered parenthetical labels: Beef Broth (Bouillon) and Consommé (Beef). The font sizes only vary slightly in the variety names. However, there are a few notable stylistic font differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice is the only variety with lower case script. This lower case script appears to be from a slightly different font than the other variety name letters. There are other stylistic differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice has the word Soup depicted lower on the can, in place of a portion of ornamental starlike symbols at the bottom that the other 31 varieties have. Also, Cheddar Cheese has two banner-like addenda. In the middle-left, a small golden banner says New!, and a middle center golden banner says Great As A Sauce Too!.|$|E
2500|$|Rhode Island, {{like the}} rest of New England, has a {{tradition}} of <b>clam</b> <b>chowder.</b> Both the white New England variety and the red Manhattan variety are popular, {{but there is also a}} unique clear-broth chowder known as Rhode Island <b>Clam</b> <b>Chowder</b> available in many restaurants. According to Good Eats, the addition of tomatoes in place of milk was initially the work of Portuguese immigrants in Rhode Island, as tomato-based stews were already a traditional part of Portuguese cuisine, and milk was costlier than tomatoes. Scornful New Englanders called this modified version [...] "Manhattan-style" [...] <b>clam</b> <b>chowder</b> because, in their view, calling someone a New Yorker was an insult.|$|E

50|$|The clams {{used for}} {{steaming}} are usually cooked live. If {{in a hard}} shell, the clam should be closed when purchased and should open after being cooked. Soft shell clams are open slightly (agape) while alive. Larger <b>chowder</b> <b>clams</b> are not typically used for steaming.|$|R
50|$|In fish markets, {{there are}} {{specialist}} names for different sizes {{of this species}} of clam. The smallest legally harvestable clams are called countnecks, next size up are littlenecks, then topnecks. Above that are the cherrystones, and the largest are called quahogs or <b>chowder</b> <b>clams.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Johann Spenger {{emigrated to}} California from Bavaria {{and settled in}} West Berkeley in the 1860s. [...] The {{original}} building housed Spenger's business and family residence. Johann Spenger worked as a hook and line fisherman on Lake Merritt in the early days. [...] The restaurant began as a clam stand in the 1890s. The menu originally included <b>clam</b> <b>chowder,</b> baked beans, fish dinners and ten-cent beer.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is often}} claimed that [...] the Baked Alaska's name was coined at Delmonico's as well, in 1867, by cook Charles Ranhofer.

Manhattan <b>clam</b> <b>chowder</b> also first appeared in New York at Delmonico's. It is also claimed that Lobster Newberg, was invented at the restaurant.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{significant}} commercial establishments are Schooner's Wharf/Bay Village, in Beach Haven, and Viking Village, in Barnegat Light. [...] The latter includes numerous family-owned shops generally {{oriented toward}} the local fishing {{industry and the}} many fishing charter boats that set sail there, though a variety of handmade crafts can also be found. [...] The former is geared more specifically toward the tourism industry, featuring a variety of eateries and more mainstream shops. [...] Across from the , Bay Village began in 1965 when John Maschal purchased a half-block around his shop [...] "Country Kettle Fudge" [...] — which had opened four years earlier — and developed it into the existing shopping area. [...] When Bay Village opened, it adjoined the Lucy Evelyn, a 3 masted schooner {{that had been set}} on land and turned into a gift shop and museum. [...] The Lucy Evelyn, 140' long with a 32' beam and 10' draft, built in 1917 in Harrington, Maine, burned to the ground in January 1972. It was replaced by a building that resembles a schooner. One of the original [...] "Seaman's Shacks" [...] that surrounded the Lucy Evelyn still remains on the north-western outskirts of Bay Village. [...] The annual [...] <b>clam</b> <b>chowder</b> competition is held at Schooner's Wharf/Bay Village in Beach Haven every October, drawing a significant influx of tourists during the off-season. For the past 20 years, island restaurants have competed in Manhattan and New England <b>clam</b> <b>chowder</b> categories. Recent winners include Stefano's Pizza and Pasta, Howard's Restaurant, Country Kettle Chowda, Buckalew's Restaurant and Tavern, and The Black Whale Bar and Fish House.|$|E

50|$|The genus Mercenaria {{includes}} the quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria, the northern quahog or hard clam, and M. campechiensis, the southern quahog. These two species commonly hybridise where their ranges overlap. Mercenaria mercenaria is further subdivided {{in the marketplace}} and thence in the kitchen by size: the largest being the quahog or <b>chowder</b> <b>clam,</b> then smaller cherrystones, and smallest littlenecks; some markets also differentiate top necks which are intermediate in size between cherrystones and littlenecks. The smaller clams are eaten raw throughout New England, New York, and New Jersey; the larger clams are more suited for cooking.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of past experience and attitudes on taste evaluations of squid were investigated in a taste test of <b>clam</b> and squid <b>chowders.</b> Within this test, an experiement was conducted which {{examined the effects}} of salience of squid identification and the physical concentration of squid upon taste evaluations. Hedonic and paired comparison judgments were collected, scaled and analyzed. The research indicates past experience, prior attitudes and expectations of social acceptance affect consumers' taste evaluations and their sensitivity to changes in product formulations. Based on these findings, improved taste testing procedures are recommended and the implications of the results for marketing squid are discussed. - 1...|$|R

40|$|Paramyosin {{extracted}} from the adductor muscle of Mercenaria mercenaria, the <b>chowder</b> <b>clam,</b> was titrated both in 0. 3 M KCl and in 1 mM KCl. Both the presumed native form of the molecule, acid-R-paramyosin, and a slightly degraded form, beta-paramyosin, were studied. Titrations of both types of paramyosin were similar in 1 mM k+, except that the native paramyosin is more highly charged at pH 3. 2 than beta-paramyosin, as postulated previously (DeLaney and Krause, 1976, Macromolecules, 9 : 455), and that more groups titrate on the native molecule than on beta-paramyosin, both between pH 3. 2 and 3. 3 and between pH 3. 2 and 10. Titrations in 0. 30 M KCl, unlike those in 1 mM K, depended on starting pH; long term exposure to alkali solutions during dialysis, previously shown to cause partial dephosphorylation of paramyosin (Cooley et al., 1979, J. Biol. Chem., 254 : 2195), apparently also leads {{to a change in}} intermolecular interactions sufficient to cause changes in the titration curves in 0. 30 M KCl but not in 1 mM K+...|$|R

60|$|To hear {{such a thing}} said by {{the waiter}} was alone an epoch {{in the life of}} an unfortunate writer of fantastic novels.
