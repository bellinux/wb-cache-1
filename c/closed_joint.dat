Jeddah Economic Company is a <b>closed</b> <b>joint</b> stock company (PJSC) formed in 2009 as a financial entity for Jeddah Tower and Jeddah Economic City. It is made up primarily of financiers (stakeholders) Kingdom Holding Company (33.35%), Abrar Holding Company (33.35%), which is owned by Samaual Bakhsh, and businessman Abdulrahman Hassan Sharbately (16.67%), as well as the tower's own contractor, Saudi Binladin Group (16.63%). JEC's assets have a book value of nearly SR9 billion, broken down between a land bank of over [...] (the Jeddah Economic City plot) with a value of SR7.3 billion that will be used as collateral to attain bank loans, and SR1.5 billion in cash. Kingdom Holding is an investment company founded in 1980 and 95% owned by Prince Talal that has assets valued at over $25 billion, with interests in many major companies such as Walt Disney, Pepsico, Kodak, Apple, Hewlett Packard, Motorola, Time Warner, Newscorp, Pinnacle Infotech Solutions and Citigroup, as well as real estate in London through its Songbird Estates division.|$|E

40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} describing the properties of reinforced concrete materials and their interaction. It is therefore necessary to calibrate the mathematical model by accurate testing of laboratory specimens. It can be shown that momentcurvature relationship varies {{along the length of}} a member and at beam-column joints. This behaviour depends critically on the geometry of the joint, reinforcement details and the stress-strain characteristics of concrete and steel. Tests have been carried out on model reinforced concrete portal frames and independent specimens making up the frame to predict their non-linear behaviour. The stiffness of the joint {{plays an important role in}} the response of the complete frame structure. The behaviour of the corner joints is of particular interest because both the strength and ductility differs for opening and <b>closing</b> <b>joints.</b> The loss of stiffness at joints has a significant effect on the inelastic deformations. The non-linear finite element (FE) program developed takes into account the loss of stiffness at joints and the falling branch behaviour of the material stress-strain relationships. Constant, linear, and parabolic variation in flexural rigidity (EI) and axial rigidity (EA) are taken into consideration along the element length. The combined effect of material and geometric non-linearity is considered. The FE program may use either calculated momentcurvature relationship of different elements or the experimental data obtained from tests. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and experimental beam moment-curvature relationships. Horizontally loaded frame analysis, which involves opening and <b>closing</b> <b>joints,</b> shows that ignoring the joint effect over-estimates the strength. In the case of vertically loaded frames, which involves two <b>closing</b> <b>joints,</b> ignoring the joint effects had little or no influence. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and experimental frame force-displacement relationships throughout the loading range providing the change of stiffness at joints is taken into account for horizontally loaded frames...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{variation}} of reinforcement details, confinement and joints angle are considerable factors which affect the ultimate limit moment of joints and joints efficiency. The {{variation of}} joint size is {{another factor that}} significantly affects the ultimate limit moment of joints and frame joints efficiency. These previous factors were not considered in design. Corners may be subjected to closing moments, which subject to tensile stresses in {{the outside of the}} corner, or to opening moments, which cause tensile stresses in the inside of the corner. The last type of moments arise more detailing problems. Opening joints may be found in retaining walls water tanks, open channels, bridge abutments, high rises due to wind effect, frame structures, etc. in the other hand the <b>closing</b> <b>joint</b> may be found in two hinged and fixed frames and underground water tanks. Hence two types of joints should be compared. The presented paper introduces an experimental and analytical study in order to investigate the effect of reinforcement details, confinement, joints size, joints angle on the frame joints efficiency and comparison between <b>closing</b> <b>joints</b> and opening joints. Experimentally, a total of eleven specimens were tested under vertical load. All specimens were tested up to failure and the behaviour was fully monitored. Moreover, a nonlinear 3 D-finite element analysis was established using ABAQUS program and verified with the experimental results in order to give design recommendations for those structural elements...|$|R

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} analysis was carried out to investigate the viscoplastic deformation of solder joints in a ball grid array (BGA) package under temperature cycle. The effects of constraint on print circuit board (PCB) and stiffness of substrate on the deformation behaviour of the solder joints were also studied. A relative damage stress was adopted to analyze the potential failure sites in the solder joints. The results indicated that high inelastic strain and strain energy density were developed in the <b>joints</b> <b>close</b> to the package center.

The <b>joint</b> <b>closest</b> to the edge of the silicon chip was regarded as the most susceptible failure site if cavitation instability is the dominant failure mechanism.
