40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses technological, {{social and}} economIC aspects of gold production and {{use in the}} Late Iron Age of southern Africa. The topic is approached in two ways. The first is to define the fabrication technology employed in producing gold artefacts. The second is to use trace element fingerprinting to try to determine which geological deposits were exploited by gold miners of this period. Three assemblages exist that allow these questions to be addressed; Mapungubwe (1 ath - 13 th century AD), Great Zimbabwe (12 th - 15 th century AD) and Thulamela (l 4 th - 17 th century AD). Previous descriptions of the fabrication technology of southern African gold exist, {{but this is the}} first, systematic study of all three assemblages. The fabrication technology reconstruction used three lines of analysis; visual inspection with the naked eye, microscopy of the surfaces, and microhardness testing and metallography of selected polished samples. Fifty eight specimens were studied from Mapungubwe, two hundred and sixty eight pieces from Great Zimbabwe and fifteen from Thulamela. Trade and socio-economic effects of southern Africa's Later Iron Age are discussed {{in the light of the}} now available trace element analysis and fabrication technology of the gold artefacts studied here. No tools for working gold have been found, and inferences have been made by modelling them on tools for copper and iron working. The basic toolkit consisted of a blade, hammer, chisel, a punch and an anvil. There were four basic artefact types; wire, beads, foil and tacks. There was no significant stylistic change in artefact types and the number of artefact types in the three assemblages. Cold working and annealing were standard practices in fabrication. Ten finished artefacts types have been identified; wrapped, rolled and punched beads, foil, strips cut from foil, tacks, straight and <b>coiled</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>rod</b> sections and links. Other gold artefacts were recovered but were either offeuts or in the process of being made into one of the ten types described above. These are prills, discs and offcuts. Trace element groups were based on grouping the samples by similarities in the signature profiles. Identification was on the basis of the presence and absence of metallic impurities. It was deduced that alluvial gold mining was practised alongside reef gold mining. Mixing of gold ores occurred. Alloying was not intentionally practised. Identification of the gold sources would require further analysis of unworked material from potential geological sources...|$|E
40|$|Man-made objects often {{consist of}} {{detailed}} and interleaving structures, which are created using cane, <b>coils,</b> metal <b>wires,</b> <b>rods,</b> etc. The delicate structures, although manufactured using simple procedures, are challenging to scan and reconstruct. We observe that such structures are inherently 1 D, and hence are naturally represented using {{an arrangement of}} generating curves. We refer to the resultant surfaces as arterial surfaces. In this paper we approach for analyzing, reconstructing, and manipulating such arterial surfaces. The core of the algorithm is a novel deformable model, called arterial snake, that simultaneously captures the topology and geometry of the arterial objects. The recovered snakes produce a natural decomposition of the raw scans, with the decomposed parts often capturing meaningful object sections. We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm {{on a variety of}} arterial objects corrupted with noise, outliers, and with large parts missing. We present a range of applications including reconstruction, topology repairing, and manipulation of arterial surfaces by directly controlling the underlying curve network and the associated sectional profiles, which are otherwise challenging to perform. © 2010 ACM...|$|R
40|$|This study deals {{experimentally}} with aerodynamic sounds {{generated by}} <b>coiled</b> <b>wires</b> {{in a uniform}} air-flow. The <b>coiled</b> <b>wire</b> {{is a model of}} the hair dryer 2 ̆ 7 s heater. In the experiment, the effects of the <b>coil</b> diameter D, <b>wire</b> diameter d and coil spacing s of the <b>coiled</b> <b>wire</b> on the aerodynamic sound have been clarified. The results of frequency analyses of the aerodynamic sounds show that an Aeolian sound is generated by the <b>coiled</b> <b>wire,</b> when s/d is larger than I. Also the peak frequencies of Aeolian sounds generated by the <b>coiled</b> <b>wires</b> are higher than the ones generated by a straight cylinder having the same diameter d. To clarify the characteristics of the aerodynamic sound sources, the directivity of the aerodynamic sound generated by the <b>coiled</b> <b>wire</b> has been examined, and the coherent function between the velocity fluctuation around the <b>coiled</b> <b>wire</b> and the aerodynamic sound has been calculated. Moreover, the band overall value of coherent output power between the sound and the velocity fluctuations has been calculated. This method has clarified the sound source region of the Aeolian sound generated by the <b>coiled</b> <b>wire.</b> These results show that the Aeolian sound is generated by the arc part of the <b>coiled</b> <b>wire,</b> which is located in the upstream side of the air-flow...|$|R

The numerical simulations of nanofluids are performed using two phase mixture model.

40|$|Very often defects {{are present}} in rolled products. For <b>wire</b> <b>rods,</b> defects are very {{deleterious}} since the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> are generally used directly in various applications. For this reason, the market nowadays requires <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> to be completely defect-free. Any wire with defects must be rejected as scrap which is very costly for the production mill. Thus, {{it is very important}} to study the formation and evolution of defects during <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> rolling in order to better understand and minimize the problem, at the same time improving quality of the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> and reducing production costs. The present work is focused on the evolution of artificial defects during rolling. Longitudinal surface defects are studied during shape rolling of an AISI M 2 high speed steel and a longitudinal central inner defect is studied in an AISI 304 L austenitic stainless steel during ultra-high-speed <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> rolling. Experimental studies are carried out by rolling short rods prepared with arteficial defects. The evolution of the defects is characterised and compared to numerical analyses. The comparison shows that surface defects generally reduce quicker in the experiments than predicted by the simulations whereas a good agreement is generally obtained for the central defect.

Dilatometric experiments were done for assumed cooling rates in the range 0. 045 ≤V 8 - 5 ≤ 12 K/s. Comparison of the structures was done basing on the qualitative and quantitative metallography. Chords of the flat sections of ferrite and pearlite grains were determined for different microstructures {{as well as for}} <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> structure. Parametric tests of significance; variance ratio test F Snedecora and for consistency of two averages were used. Additionally hardness measurements were done. Homogenous ferrite – pearlite structure of the <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> and dilatometric samples were achieved for cooling rates 0. 833 ≤V 8 - 5 ≤ 2. 317 K/s, which corresponded to hardness range 143. 3 ≤ HV 10 ≤ 154. 3.
