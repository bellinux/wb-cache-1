25|$|In {{the period}} of the 1930s through early 1960s, the evening glove was adapted for wear with certain high end {{lounging}} and sleeping outfits, or peignoir sets. Such gloves were typically made out of the same lightweight sheer nylon, rayon, or silk as of the lingerie set in a matching or <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> and always of above elbow length. These gloves were introduced to bring the fashion for covered hands into the bedroom, protect skin during sleep and leisure time, and provide modesty for women during times of travel, visitation, or shared accommodation. While never widespread, these sleeping gloves were a desired component of the most expensive bedroom ensembles. Given the prevalence of gloves in mid-20th century women's fashion, a woman who added sleeping gloves to her wardrobe would have been gloved virtually at all times.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{localized}} ("intra-atomic") {{absorption of}} light which causes color for chromium and vanadium impurities, blue color in sapphires comes from intervalence charge transfer, {{which is the}} transfer of an electron from one transition-metal ion to another via the conduction or valence band. The iron can take the form Fe2+ or Fe3+, while titanium generally takes the form Ti4+. If Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions are substituted for Al3+, localized areas of charge imbalance are created. An electron transfer from Fe2+ and Ti4+ can cause {{a change in the}} valence state of both. Because of the valence change there is a specific change in energy for the electron, and electromagnetic energy is absorbed. The wavelength of the energy absorbed corresponds to yellow light. When this light is subtracted from incident white light, the <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> blue results. Sometimes when atomic spacing is different in different directions there is resulting blue-green dichroism.|$|E
50|$|Split-complementary <b>colors</b> {{are like}} <b>complementary</b> <b>colors,</b> except {{one of the}} {{complements}} is split into two nearby analogous colors. This maintains the tension of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> while simultaneously introducing more visual interest with more variety.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gogh used <b>complementary,</b> {{contrasting}} <b>colors</b> {{to bring}} an intensity to his work, which evolved over the periods of his work. Two <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> of {{the same degree of}} vividness and contrast." [...] Van Gogh mentioned the liveliness and interplay of [...] "a wedding of two <b>complementary</b> <b>colors,</b> their mingling and opposition, the mysterious vibrations of two kindred souls." [...] An example of use of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> is The Sower where gold is contrasted to purple and blue with orange to intensify the impact of the work.|$|R
50|$|<b>Complementary</b> <b>colors</b> {{also have}} more {{practical}} uses. Because orange and blue are <b>complementary</b> <b>colors,</b> life rafts and life vests are traditionally orange, {{to provide the}} highest contrast and visibility when seen from ships or aircraft over the ocean.|$|R
500|$|In the {{subtractive}} color system, [...] used {{in painting}} and color printing, green {{is created by}} a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; [...] in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, {{it is one of the}} additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. [...] On the HSV color wheel, also known as the , [...] the complement of green is magenta; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light (one of the purples). On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> to green is considered to be red.|$|E
2500|$|Chevreul also {{realized}} that the [...] "halo" [...] that one sees after looking at a color is the opposing color (also known as <b>complementary</b> <b>color).</b> For example: After looking at a red object, one may see a cyan echo/halo of the original object. This <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> (as an example, cyan for red) is due to retinal persistence. Neoimpressionist painters interested in the interplay of colors made extensive use of complementary colors in their paintings. In his works, Chevreul advised artists to think and paint not just {{the color of the}} central object, but to add colors and make appropriate adjustments to achieve a harmony among colors. It seems that the harmony Chevreul wrote about is what Seurat came to call [...] "emotion".|$|E
2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its <b>complementary</b> <b>color.</b> [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{scientists}} {{looked more}} closely at the use of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors.</b> In 1828, the French chemist Eugene Chevreul, making a study of the manufacture of Gobelin tapestries to make the colors brighter, demonstrated scientifically that [...] "the arrangement of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> is superior to any other harmony of contrasts." [...] His 1839 book on the subject, De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs et de l'assortiment des objets colorés, showing how <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> can be used in everything from textiles to gardens, was widely read in Germany, France and England, and made <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> a popular concept. The use of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> was further publicized by the French art critic Charles Blanc in his book Grammaire des arts et du dessin (1867) and later by the American color theorist Ogden Rood in his book Modern Chromatics (1879). These books were read with great enthusiasm by contemporary painters, particularly Georges Seurat and Vincent van Gogh, who put the theories into practice in their paintings.|$|R

[...] It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. [...] The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars. The red color of blood comes from protein hemoglobin, while ripe strawberries, red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins.|$|E

50|$|Complementary colors {{can create}} some {{striking}} optical effects. The shadow {{of an object}} appears to contain some of the <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> of the object. For example, {{the shadow of a}} red apple will appear to contain a little blue-green. This effect is often copied by painters who want to create more luminous and realistic shadows.

50|$|According to {{traditional}} color theory based on subtractive primary colors and the RYB color model, which {{is derived from}} paint mixtures, yellow mixed with violet, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter's complementary colors.

Thus, a piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange, because orange is the <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> to blue.|$|E
