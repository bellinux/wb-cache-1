60|$|There {{is indeed}} in Piso, a very odd History, which this {{relation}} {{may make the}} more probable; and {{that is in the}} 2. Chapter of the 4. Book of his Natural History of Brasil, where he says, Porro præter tot documenta fertilitatis circa vegetabilia & sensitiva marina telluris æmula, accidit & illud, quod paucis à Paranambucensi milliaribus, piscatoris uncum citra intentionem contingat infigi vadis petrosis, & loco piscis spongia, coralla, aliasque arbusculas marinas capi. Inter hæc inusitatæ formæ prodit spongiosa arbuscula sesquipedis longitudinis, brevioribus radicibus, lapideis nitens vadis, & rupibus infixa, erigiturque in corpus spongiosum molle oblongum rotundum turbinatum: intus miris cancellis & alveis fabricatum, extus autem tenaci glutine instar Apum propolis undique vestitum, ostio satis patulo & profundo in summitate relicto, sicut ex altera iconum probe depicta videre licet (see the third and fourth Figures of the 27. Scheme.) Ita ut Apiarium marinum vere dixeris; primo enim intuitu è Mare ad Terram delatum, vermiculis scatebat cæruleis parvis, qui mox à calore solis in Muscas, vel Apes potius, easq; exiguas & nigras transformebantur, circumvolantesque evanescebant, ita ut de eorum mellificatione nihil <b>certi</b> conspici datum fuerit, cum tamen cærosa materia propolis Apumque cellæ manifeste apparerent, atque ipsa mellis qualiscunque substantia proculdubio urinatoribus patebit, ubi curiosius inquisiverint hæc apiaria, eaque in natali solo & salo diversis temporibus penitius lustrarint.|$|E
60|$|In {{the pursuit}} of these sciences, our success in each, depends on an austere and {{faithful}} adherence to its own principles, with a careful separation and exclusion of those, which appertain to the opposite science. As the natural philosopher, who directs his views to the objective, avoids above all things the intermixture of the subjective in his knowledge, as for instance, arbitrary suppositions or rather suflictions, occult qualities, spiritual agents, and the substitution of final for efficient causes; so on the other hand, the transcendental or intelligential philosopher is equally anxious to preclude all interpellation of the objective into the subjective principles of his science, as for instance the assumption of impresses or configurations in the brain, correspondent to miniature pictures on the retina painted by rays of light from supposed originals, which are not the immediate and real objects of vision, but deductions from it {{for the purposes of}} explanation. This purification of the mind is effected by an absolute and scientific scepticism, to which the mind voluntarily determines itself for the specific purpose of future certainty. Des Cartes who (in his meditations) himself first, at least of the moderns, gave a beautiful example of this voluntary doubt, this self-determined indetermination, happily expresses its utter difference from the scepticism of vanity or irreligion: Nec tamen in Scepticos imitabar, qui dubitant tantum ut dubitent, et praeter incertitudinem ipsam nihil quaerunt. Nam contra totus in eo eram ut aliquid <b>certi</b> reperirem [51]. Nor is it less distinct in its motives and final aim, than in its proper objects, which are not as in ordinary scepticism the prejudices of education and circumstance, but those original and innate prejudices which nature herself has planted in all men, and which to all but the philosopher are the first principles of knowledge, and the final test of truth.|$|E
50|$|The Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography (<b>CERTO)</b> is a {{radio beacon}} which {{measures}} ionospheric parameters {{in coordination with}} ground receivers. <b>CERTO</b> provides global ionospheric maps to aid prediction of radio wave scattering. <b>CERTO</b> {{was developed by the}} Naval Research Lab {{and is one of the}} 4 experiment packages aboard the PicoSAT satellite. <b>CERTO</b> provides near-real-time measurements of the ionosphere. <b>CERTO</b> was used for the Equatorial Vortex Experiment in 2013.|$|R
2500|$|<b>CERTO</b> - Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography Experiment (1996-18/NRL) instrumentation, {{developed}} by NRL's Plasma Physics Division, {{consists of a}} stable radio beacon transmitter on the satellite and a chain of receivers on the ground. Radio transmissions from the <b>CERTO</b> beacon are processed by the ground receivers to produce two-dimensional maps of the electron densities in the ionosphere. The <b>CERTO</b> measurement technique provides images of the ionosphere with 10km vertical and horizontal resolution. In addition, ionospheric irregularities of 1km or less in size can be determined by fluctuations in the <b>CERTO</b> radio waves. [...] <b>CERTO</b> {{can also be used}} to calibrate the ionospheric densities obtained using the EUV instruments such as HIRAAS, GIMI, and EUVIP on ARGOS. The <b>CERTO</b> radio-based technique has the advantage of higher spatial resolution than provided by the EUV-based techniques, but requires ground-based receivers aligned under the satellite orbit. The two techniques together on the same satellite provide substantial improvements over each technique separately. <b>CERTO</b> principal investigator, Dr. Paul Bernhardt notes that the NRL instruments on ARGOS will be the first demonstration combining EUV and radio sensors for enhanced imaging of the ionosphere.|$|R
