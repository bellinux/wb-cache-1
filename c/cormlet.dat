40|$|Long-lived {{understory}} herbs {{experience a}} highly dynamic forest over space and time, yet can persist {{for more than}} a century. To understand how these populations persist, we examined effects of forest age and disturbance on potential sexual reproduction and clonal growth in the sexually labile perennial, Arisaema triphyllum. Poten-tial sexual reproduction female:male ratio was significantly greater in the Young and Old-Gap forest states compared with Old, closed-canopy sites, where it was virtually absent. In contrast, clonal growth estimated by <b>cormlet</b> production did not differ significantly among the three forest states. Of seven environmental variables measured, only light positively and plant density negatively contributed significantly to the variation in po-tential sexual reproduction, while no measured variables contributed significantly to the variation in number of cormlets. The larger sexual reproductive effort flowerstalk biomass/total biomass for males in the undisturbed, 100 yr old forest may explain the absence of females in these sites, while the invariant vegetative reproductive effort <b>cormlet</b> biomass/total biomass may explain the similarity in average number of cormlets per individual per season across forest states. These results suggest that potential sexual reproduction is resource-limited, while clonal growth may be resource-independent. By maintaining ramet production during unfavorable periods, A. triphyllum populations disperse temporally, “waiting ” for conditions under which sexual reproduction may re-sume...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} order to investigate the effects of exogenous polyamines (PAs) {{on the development of}} mycorrhizae in roots, nutrient uptake and vegetative and reproductive growth of Freesia hybrida ‘Golden Wave’. Corms of freesia were inoculated with Rhizophagus intraradices at sowing time and treated once a week by one of three PAs, putrescine (Put), spermidine or spermine, in concentrations of 0. 05 and 0. 1 mM each as foliar application or soil drench. Application of PAs, especially as soil drench, increased mycorrhizal colonization as well as the growth and development of inoculated plants. Among the three PAs, Put in 0. 1 mM concentration was the most effective in increasing colonization, enhancing floral stem length and diameter, floral spike length, floret number on main and lateral spikes and increasing corm and <b>cormlet</b> weight, corm diameter and <b>cormlet</b> number. Sole application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi had no significant effect on the flowering time but soil drench with 0. 1 mM Put accelerated flowering by about 17 days. Application of PAs elevated leaves N, P, K, Mg, Fe and Zn and corms’ P, K, Ca, Fe and Zn concentration of inoculated plants. Our results suggest that soil drench application of PAs, especially Put, positively influenced mycorrhizal inoculation and nutrient uptake, which leads to improving growth, flower and corm production and quality of mycorrhizal plants of freesia...|$|E
40|$|Queensland {{production}} of gladiolus flowers and corms has {{developed into a}} 2. 5 million-per-annum industry during the last decade. Economic considerations require that flower production be regulated to meet market demand, particularly the lucrative southern winter market, whilst disease considerations require that new planting-material be provided regularly. The latter may be achieved by local production or by the usual practice of purchase at high cost (currently 22 000 per ha) from Victorian and South Australian producers. The present experiment provided information on number of days to flower, inflorescence, corm and <b>cormlet</b> yield, flower quality and vase life of 12 cultivars planted at 3 - or 4 -weekly intervals from February to September. Environmental conditions greatly influenced all these variables. Days to flowering varied from 77 to 132 for the various cultivar/planting-date combinations, and averaged over cultivars was greatest for the late-May planting. Degree-day summations to flowering suggested that temperature was the major factor influencing {{the number of days}} to flowering and that these cultivars were essentially day-length-insensitive for the 12. 3 - 15. 8 -hour photoperiods sampled. However, flowering was severely reduced for the 11 February- 18 June plantings of 2 ̆ 7 Bali Hai 2 ̆ 7 and for the 26 March- 18 June plantings of 2 ̆ 7 Auroa 2 ̆ 7. This may possibly indicate the existence of an environmental threshold for these cultivars. Yield and quality of inflorescences from the February to early-May plantings, which flowered in winter, were lower than from later plantings. These plantings tended to favour corm and <b>cormlet</b> production, which appear to compete with inflorescences for the available photosynthates...|$|E

Sections of two different types of explants, corms and pupae (cold storage-produced corms), were placed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media containing different concentrations of plant growth regulators. The results showed that the highest percentage of callus induction (100 %), the highest callus growth (15 mm diameter) and the best type of calli were achieved for pupa explants grown on the medium that contained 4 mg L− 1 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 2 mg L− 1 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) in the dark. Increasing BAP up to 3 to 4. 5 mg L− 1 resulted in the maximum number of regenerated cormlets from 1 cm 2 calli (2 cormlets) under light conditions. Overall, the best rooting of regenerated cormlets was achieved on MS media supplemented with 1 mg L− 1 indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA). In the next stage, high quality calli were subcultured on MS media containing sorbitol, sucrose, maltose and mannitol (0, 5, 10 and 15 g L− 1).

40|$|The {{effects of}} size and {{division}} of the mother corm on yield of gladioli inflorescences, corms and cormlets and on inflorescence quality were studied in two experiments in south-east Queensland. Planting with whole large corms resulted in greater inflorescence yield, higher inflorescence quality and gave more high quality inflorescences than planting with smaller corms. Flowering percentage [(number of inflorescences/number of corms planted) x 100] was increased by cutting the large corms, but was reduced by cutting the smaller corms. Inflorescence quality was reduced by cutting corms. Some multiple shooting (greater than one shoot per corm) occurred with whole large corms and increased the flowering percentage, but inflorescence quality was still higher than for the smaller corms, and was acceptable by market standards. The yield of new corms was increased by cutting corms of large or number 3 size, but was reduced by cutting the smaller initial corms. For the large corms, cutting increased the yield of new corms by 93 %. The method of cutting corms influenced subsequent plant development. Cutting to remove storage tissue and damage to part of the root initials without damaging the buds, stimulated multiple shooting, increased inflorescence yield, decreased inflorescence quality, and substantially increased the number and weight of new corms.

Lateral buds removed from sterilized fresh corms were placed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with various concentrations of N 6 -benzyladenine (BA) for shoot culture establishment. The highest number of shoot per lateral bud explant was on MS medium supplemented with 2 mg L - 1 BA (11. 00 ± 0. 38). To induce somatic embryogenesis, leaves of in vitro shoots obtained from lateral buds were used as explant.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{correlate}} corm size and storage period of corms to allocation of assimilates {{in different parts}} of the plant an experiment was conducted during growth period of 2004 and 2005 in Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Treatments were four groups of corm size (3 - 6, 6 - 9, 9 - 12 and 12 - 15 g) either stored for a period of time before planting or sown directly without storage. Experiment was conducted in a Complete Randomized Block design with three replications. Results indicated that storing corms before planting had a negative effect on number, area, length and width of leaf and also on weight of leaf, weight of main shoot, weight of leaves of lateral shoots and total weight of plant.

40|$|Scope When Freesias {{are planted}} {{throughout}} the year several problems arise. In some months, flowers are produced too rapidly and abundantly, with a corresponding loss in quality; in other months, flower production is limited and too slow. Simultaneously, {{there is a great}} variation in stem length, in number and shape of the flowers and in corm production. This study was undertaken to establish the effect of the two major inveronmental factors, temperature and light, on the characteristics mentioned, from the moment of planting to the harvest of the corms. Conclusions From this study on the effect of temperature and light {{on the development of the}} Freesia plant, the following conclusions could be drawn: Effects of temperature in the range of 9 - 24 °C: 1. Sprouting of the corms was promoted by high temperature (experiments 1, 4, 19). 2. The number of leaves was reduced (i. e., Rower initiation was promoted) by low temperature, and increased by high temperature, especially 21 ° and 24 °C (experiments 1, 3, 4, 5, 19). There was a further reduction by a pretreatment at 5 °C during 4 weeks (experiment 7). There was no specific effect of day or night temperature (experiment 4). 3. The number of days to flowering reached a minimum at 18 ' (experiments 1, 3, 5, 19, 20; in experiment 4 the optimal temperature was 15 °C and in experiment 2 it was 21 °C. The night temperature was especially important (experiments 4, 5). There was a further reduction in the number of days to flowering by a pretreatment at 5 °C for 3 or 4 weeks (experiment 7). 4. The number of flowers in the main inflorescence was increased by high temperature (experiments 1 - 5, 19, 20; in experiment 3 there was a reduction at 24 °C but it was also increased by a pretreatment at 5 °C during 1 or 2 weeks (experiment 7). 5. The number of lateral stems was reduced by high temperature; the greatest number was formed at 12 °C (experiment 3) or 15 °C (experiments 1, 2). A low night temperature was especially important (experiment 5). 6. Stem length reached an optimum at 21 °C (experiments 1 - 5, 19, 20); 24 °C was unfavourable, especially in later stages (experiment 3). The effect of day temperature was much stronger than that of night temperature (experiments 4, 5). Stem length increased after a pretreatment at 5 ' during 1 - 2 weeks, but 4 weeks 5 ° led to stunted growth (experiment 7). 7. Corm dry weight increased with the temperature (experiments 1, 2, 4, 19). The effect of day temperature was stronger than that of the night temperature (experiment 4, 5). Corm weight was reduced after a pretreatment at 5 ° during 3 or 4 weeks (experiment 7). 8. The number of cormlets was decreased by high temperature (experiments 1 - 4, 19). A pretreatment of 1 - 2 weeks at 5 °C increased it, but 4 weeks 5 °C led to a decrease (experiment 7). Effects of the photoperiod in the range of 8 to 16 hrs: 9. Leaf number was reduced (i. e. flower initiation was promoted) by short day (experiments 8, 12, 13, 19). The cultivar 'Sonata' was more responsive than 'Rijnveld's Golden Yellow' (experiment 15). 10. The development of the inflorescence was strongly promoted in the early stages by short day (experiments 12, 13, 19) but later stages were promoted by long day, although not as strongly (experiments 11, 12). 11. The number of flowers in the main inflorescence was reduced by long day (experiments 8, 10, 14), especially in the later stages (experiment 15). Long day also reduced the percentage of open flowers (experiments 9 - 12). 12. The number of lateral stems decreased with the daylength (experiments 8 - 14) which was especially effective in later stages (experiment 15). 13. There were no unequivocal effects of photoperiod on stem length experiments 9, 12, 15). 14. Corm dry weight was proportional to daylength (experiments 8, 10, 12, 14), although it was sometimes lower again in the longest photoperiod (experiments 9, 11). 15. The number of cormlets was greatest in short day (experiments 8 - 13). Effect of light intensity: 16. Light intensity had little effect on the number of leaves (experiments 10, 13, 17), but low light intensity delayed flower initiation (experiments 13, 14), flower development (experiments 10, 13, 14, 17). It also reduced the number of flowers in the main inflorescence (experiments 13, 14, 17) and the precentage of open flowers (experiment 17). High light intensity increased the number of lateral stems (experiment 13). Stem length was usually slightly promoted by low light intensity (experiment 14, 17). Corm dry weight was proportional to light quantity (experiment 13, 14, 16, 17). The number of cormlets was reduced by low light intensity (experiment 10). Comparison of effects on light and temperature: 17. Within the given ranges of these two factors the effect of temperature was usually greater than that of light. Only the number of lateral stems was determined primarily by the light conditions. As a rule, a higher temperature had a similar effect as a longer photoperiod (experiments 19, 20). Effect of planting date (experiment 21) : 18. The greatest number of leaves (and also the longest time to flower initiation) was found after planting in May and June, the smallest number of leaves after planting in February. The minimum number of days to flower initiation occurred after planting between November and January. 19. The minimum number of days between planting and flowering occurred after planting in January and February; plants started in May took the longest time to flower. 20. The number of flowers on the main inflorescence reached a maximum after planting in May and June and a minimum after planting between October and February. 21. The number of lateral stems was high in plants started in June and low after planting in November and April. 22. Stem length and plant height were greatest after planting between June and August and smallest after planting in February and March. 23. Corm and <b>cormlet</b> dry weight were highest after planting in summer and low after planting in winter; the number of days between planting and harvest showed the opposite trend. Effect of planting density (experiment 21) : 24. In comparison to plants at a small distance, those at a wider distance were shorter, had more lateral stems and more flowers, a greater corm dry weight and more cormlets. 25. The number of days to flowering was not affected by the planting density when the plants were started between November and March. Plants started between March and August flowered earlier when at a smaller distance; those started between September and November, however, flowered slightly earlier when at a greater distance...|$|E

The inflorescence is head- or umbel-like, and dense. It usually contains 2 to 15 flowers, which have a blue, blue-purple, pink-purple, or white perianth. The flower tube is 3-12 mm and is narrowly cylindrical to campanulate. Flowers have six fertile stamens, deeply notched, lanceolate, white, angled inward, slightly reflexed at tip, with outer filaments wider at the base. It has a twisted and fleshy peduncle, a set of membranous, petal-like stamen appendages around the anthers, and angular black seeds. It reproduces from seed and vegetative means in the form of <b>cormlets.</b> The <b>cormlets</b> are attached to the parent corm by stolons and are sessile, produced in the axils of the old leaf bases on the mature corm.

The origin and different developmental stages of somatic embryos were ascertained through histological and scanning electron microscopic studies. Stomata were also observed in some of the somatic embryos. An alluring observation was retention of embryogenic potential beyond 3 years of culture.

50|$|In {{temperate}} zones, the corms of {{most species}} and hybrids should be lifted in autumn and stored over winter in a frost-free place, then replanted in spring. Some species from Europe and high altitudes in Africa, {{as well as}} the small 'Nanus' hybrids, are much hardier (to at least -15 °F/-26 °C) and can be left in the ground in regions with sufficiently dry winters. 'Nanus' is hardy to Zones 5-8. The large-flowered types require moisture during the growing season, and must be individually staked as soon as the sword-shaped flower heads appear. The leaves must be allowed to die down naturally before lifting and storing the corms. Plants are propagated either from small <b>cormlets</b> produced as offsets by the parent corms, or from seed. In either case, they take several years to get to flowering size. Clumps should be dug up and divided every few years to keep them vigorous.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) in gladiolus, iris, tulip and Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) in iris was investigated {{by examining the}} plants by the means of serological techniques (ELISA). ELISA was applied to determine the presence of BYMV, CMV, TRV infections in both aerial and underground parts of gladiolus, iris, and tulip, and IYSV on the aerial parts of iris, respectively. 262 gladiolus plants were tested. 63. 7 % was infected by BYMV, 29. 4 [*]% by CMV, and 2. 7 [*]% by TRV. Out of 180 plants of iris, 1. 1 % was infected by BYMV, 6. 7 % by CMV, 2. 8 % by TRV, and 0 % by IYSV. Out of 28 plants of tulip, 28. 6 % was infected by CMV, and 7. 1 % by TRV. ELISA {{proved to be a}} suitable method for detection of viruses in leaves of these ornamental plants, but it often failed to detect viruses in flowers and corms. A high transmission of BYMV by gladiolus <b>cormlets</b> was also found...|$|R
5000|$|Watsonia meriana is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the iris family (Iridaceae) known by the common name bulbil bugle-lily. It {{is one of several}} Watsonia species known as wild watsonia. It is native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa, but it is well known as an ornamental plant grown in gardens for its showy spikes of flowers and an invasive species in areas where it has escaped cultivation. It is a perennial herb growing from a fibrous-coated corm and growing to a maximum height well over one meter when in flower, sometimes reaching two meters. Each corm produces three or four erect, lance-shaped leaves that measure up to 60 centimeters long by 6 wide. They have thickened midribs and margins. The inflorescence is an open spike of 8 to 25 flowers which may be any most any shade of orange to reddish or purplish. The flower is up to 8 centimeters long with a long, tubular throat and spreading tepals. The flowers sometimes yield capsule fruits which contain seed, but the plant often reproduces via bulbils (strictly speaking, <b>cormlets)</b> that form in clusters in the axils of bracts at nodes along the peduncle. The bulbils can sprout if dropped into the soil, sometimes forming dense colonies, as can sections of corm that are chopped and dispersed by plowing or by non-intensive feeding by root-eating animals. The plant is accordingly ecologically valuable as feed to local mole-rats (Cryptomys and Georychus species) and to Cape porcupines (Hystrix africaeaustralis) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{dynamics of}} uptake, partitioning and redistribution of dry matter, N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu by the cormaceous plant Ixia flexuosa were studied in pot culture at Perth, WA. Dry matter and P, N, K, Zn and Cu were redistributed {{from the mother}} corm with about 90 per cent net efficiency: there was no net redistribution of Ca, Na, Fe or Mn. The efficiency of redistribution from the leafy shoot to fruits and the new season's corm was 80 per cent for N and P, 24 - 49 per cent for K, Cu and Zn, and 0 - 15 per cent for Na, Fe, Ca, Mn, Cl, Mg, S and dry matter. Redistribution from the mother corm and vegetative organs could have supplied the replacement corm, <b>cormlets</b> and fruits with 32 - 53 per cent of their S, K, P, N, Cu and Zn, and 11 - 25 per cent of their Ca, Cl, Mn, Mg and dry matter. The mature replacement corm had over 60 per cent of the plant's N and P, 25 - 50 per cent of its dry matter, Zn, Cu, Mg, K and Cl, but less than 20 per cent of its Ca, Na, Fe and Mn. Each plant produced an average of 12 cormlets; these had 35 per cent of the dry matter and 23 - 47 per cent {{of the amount of}} a particular nutrient in the new season's corms. Fruits had less than 16 per cent of the dry matter and each mineral in the mature plant. Rates of mineral intake by Ixia were much lower than reported for crop plants, and {{may be related to the}} long growing season of the species...|$|R
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{dynamics of}} the accumulation, distribution and redistribution of dry matter and 12 mineral nutrients by a weedy species of gladiolus (Gladiolus caryophyllaceus) were studied at Perth, Western Australia, where it has colonized the nutrient-poor sandy soils. Parent corms sprouted in autumn, and the plants had completed their growth cycle by early summer. The mature replacement corm had 3 5 - 25 % of the plant’s P, Ca, Na, Zn and Cu, 5 - 15 % of its K, N, Cl, Mg, S and dry matter, and < 5 % of its Fe and Mn. Seeds had 26 % of the plant’s dry matter, 60 % of its N and P, 21 - 33 % of its S, Mg, Cu and K, 5 - 20 % of its Fe, Mn and Zn, and < 5 % of its Ca and Na. The mature vegetative shoot had 47 % of the plant’s dry matter and over 40 % of each nutrient, except for N, P and Cu. Phosphorus, K and N were redistributed from the parent corm with over 85 % efficiency, S, Mg, Zn and Cu with 60 - 70 % efficiency, but there was < 10 % redistribution of Ca, Na, Cl, Fe and Mn. The efficiency of redistribution from the leafy shoot was over 70 % for N and P, 29 - 52 % for K, Mg and Cu, 16 - 20 % for S, Zn and Cl, but negligible for Ca, Na, Fe and Mn. Redistribution from the shoot could have provided the replacement corm and seeds with 53 - 98 % of their Cu, Mg, N, P and K, and 29 - 38 % of their S, Zn and dry matter. Seeds contained over 60 % of each nutrient in a capsule, except for Ca, Na and Fe. Redistribution from the capsule walls could have provided 13 - 19 % of the P, Cu and Zn, and 3 - 7 % of the N, K, Mg and dry matter accumulated by seeds. Each plant produced an average of 520 seeds. Removal of flowers and buds at first anthesis resulted in a larger replacement corm containing a greater quantity of most nutrients, indicating competition between the replacement corm and seeds for nutrients. Redistribution from parent to replacement <b>cormlets</b> {{in the absence of}} shoot and root development was high, with over 50 % of the dry matter and each nutrient, except for Ca, being transferred. Concentrations of nutrients were low in all organs of G. caryophyllaceus, especially the replacement corm. It was concluded that the effective redistribution of key nutrients, such as N and P, to reproductive structures and tolerance of low internal concentrations of nutrients contribute to the capacity of G. caryophyllaceus to colonize and persist on infertile soils...|$|R
40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} {{investigation of the}} six varieties of Ixia rapunculoides Delile (recognized in the current revisions and flora accounts of this southern African genus of some 65 species) show that a revised taxonomy better reflects the biology of the complex. The complex {{is defined by the}} funnel-shaped perianth tube, filaments fully and anthers partly included in the perianth tube. Our conclusions indicate that  I. rapunculoides (currently var.   rapunculoides) is restricted to the western Karoo and has broad, leathery leaves, a short perianth tube, mostly 5. 5 - 8. 0 mm long, and half nodding blue-mauve flowers. Plants currently referred to I. rapunculoides var.   flaccida G. J. Lewis, include four sets of populations that we regard as two separate species. These are:  I. flaccida with small, short-tubed white- or pale blue-flushed flowers, sofl-textured leaves and corms with basal <b>cormlets</b> from the Olifants River Valley and nearby; and I. sobolifera from the Western and Little Karoo, which has linear leaves, nodding spikes and flowers and corms with stolons. We divide  I. sobolifera into three subspecies: subsp. carnea with pink flowers, is restricted to the Bokkeveld Plateau and nearby; subsp  sobolifera with slate-blue flowers occurs in the Klein Roggeveld and nearby; and subsp  albiflora with strongly scented white flowers occurs in the central Little Karoo. The taxon called  I. rapunculoides var.   namaquana (L. Bolus) G. J. Lewis, defined by a longer perianth tube, mostly 13 - 16 mm long, horizontally oriented, white, pale lilac or pink flowers and few-flowered lateral branchlets. is treated as I. namaquana, first described by H. M. L. Bolus in 1931. Plants referred to this taxon from south of its range at Hex River pass and nearby, however, have fully included anthers, a longer perianth tube. 16 - 20 mm. and ascending purple-pink flowers with a white cup and are referred to the new I. oxalidiflora. Two more varieties, I. rapunculoides var. subpendula G. J. Lewis and var. rigida sensu G. J. Lewis, which have upright flowers and distinctively branched stems are treated here as I. divaricata and I. contorta.   Plants in the past included in var.   rapunculoides from the Klein Roggeveld, south of the range of typical I. rapunculoides, have a longer perianth tube. 10 - 14 mm long, and attenuate, slightly lacerate. 5 -veined. dry. rust-tipped bracts and comprise the new I. lacerata In addition, plants from streambeds in the Roggeveld that have large, white flowers, are not included in current accounts of the genus, and also represent a novel taxon, I. rivulicola. Lastly, I. rapunculoides var. robusta G. J. Lewis, the range of which falls entirely within that of var. rapunculoides and is usually sympatric with it. has pink flowers of similar structure, but four or five leaves and deep-seated corms with a collar of coarse fibres around the stem base. We raise this plant to species rank as I. robusta </p...|$|R
