5|$|The manager's {{house was}} built of brick and stucco around 1920. It is two stories high, four bays wide, two bays deep, and has an {{asymmetrical}} plan. The building has a shallow hip roof with exposed rafter ends. Its windows are primarily one-over-one and double-hung with wood trim, with window-sills made of concrete. There is a three-story rectangular brick tower set into the main (west) facade. The tower is open at the top beneath a wide wood fascia. The building has a brick chimney decorated with corbelling; its chimney <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> caps are made of concrete. The building is now rented to the members.|$|E

40|$|This {{prospective}} study examined how differences in coping style, <b>coping</b> self-efficacy, <b>and</b> metacognitive awareness influence <b>coping</b> behavior <b>and</b> performance during a realistic acute stressful exercise in 2 military samples (n = 122 and n = 132). Results showed that <b>coping</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>coping</b> style affected <b>coping</b> behavior, <b>and</b> that, in turn, coping behavior affected performance. The {{findings of a}} post hoc analysis suggested that metacognitive awareness had an indirect relationship with coping behavior, through task-focused <b>coping</b> style <b>and</b> <b>coping</b> self-efficacy, instead of a predicted direct relationship. Together, {{these results indicate that}} <b>coping</b> style <b>and</b> <b>coping</b> self-efficacy are important predictors of performance under acute stress, and that this effect is mediated by coping behavior. © 2011 American Psychological Association...|$|R

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest associations between emotional approach <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> psychological well-being. In a study of individuals who met DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorder and healthy controls, levels of emotional approach coping were lower in those individuals who met the criteria than in controls. Another study examined veterans and found that higher levels emotional expression (but not emotional processing) were associated with lower depressive symptoms and decreased post-traumatic stress disorder, even when statistically controlling for age, gender, and race.|$|E
25|$|Transgender youth {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E

25|$|Cross-sectional studies {{illustrate}} {{the link between}} emotional approach <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> positive psychological adjustment, under certain conditions in student and community samples. In a cross-sectional study of undergraduate women, women who scored more highly on emotional approach coping reported more positive and less negative valenced repetitive thoughts. In a community sample of African-American adults, emotional approach coping has also {{been found to be}} negatively associated with anger, trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. In addition, women who reported higher dispositional emotional processing also reported fewer depressive and anxious symptoms and greater life satisfaction; while for men, higher dispositional emotional expression was linked to greater life satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|Cross-sectional {{research}} of cancer samples reveals some positive, negative and mixed links with emotional approach coping. Higher emotional processing and emotional expression in female cancer survivors {{was associated with}} higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions. In male cancer survivors, higher emotional processing {{has been linked to}} higher positive emotions and higher emotional expression has been linked with lower negative emotions and fewer intrusive thoughts. However, the links between emotional approach <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> psychological adjustment are not all positive some are negative or mixed. In one study of women who had received an abnormal result on an ovarian cancer screen, higher emotional processing was associated with higher intrusive thoughts and neither emotional processing nor emotional expression were associated with cancer-related post-traumatic growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of personal coping strategies (including self-management or self-help) {{is said to}} be an important element. This can involve making use of medication or psychotherapy if the consumer is fully informed and listened to, including about adverse effects and about which methods fit with the consumer's life and their journey of recovery. Developing <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> problem solving skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which {{may or may not be}} seen as symptoms of mental disorder) may require a person becoming their own expert, in order to identify key stress points and possible crisis points, and to understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping. Developing a sense of meaning and overall purpose {{is said to be}} important for sustaining the recovery process. This may involve recovering or developing a social or work role. It may also involve renewing, finding or developing a guiding philosophy, religion, politics or culture. From a postmodern perspective, this can be seen as developing a narrative.|$|E

25|$|Graceville Railway Station is {{situated}} between Chelmer and Sherwood stations on the Brisbane-Ipswich line, just over {{eight and a}} half kilometres on from Roma Street passenger station. It comprises two island platforms with dimpled concrete <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> six structures: a brick and concrete station building, four steel-framed platform awnings and a subway system accessed via ramps leading off both Honour Avenue and Appel Street. From Richlands Park in the north to Sherwood Road in the south, these two roadways run parallel to the generally north-west to south-east oriented rail corridor, which contains four tracks. The local terrain is flat, with the Brisbane River only about half a kilometre to the west and just over one kilometre distant to the east. The adjacent intersections are with Rakeevan Road and Verney Road West where there is a small shopping precinct, and Connors Street and Verney Road East, which is residential except for a timber shop building.|$|E

While the writers and producers prepared the episode, several district attorneys they consulted said the law was dangerously vague regarding what charges could be filed in the event of such a real-life cyber-kidnapping; Wright said, [...] "They told me that this is a real problem, that there's a lag between what's on the books now and what's happening out there." [...] The script also includes a difficulty on the part of the detectives in <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> dealing this new form of cyber-crime and differentiating the truth from the hoax; Leight said, [...] "Their biggest frustration is trying to understand what's real and what isn't. Does this woman, Willow, really exist, and has something happened to her? Is she playing a character and a game that's gotten out of hand? And how do you locate someone in cyberspace?" ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1850s, Lowell {{dealt with}} many {{personal}} tragedies, including the sudden {{death of his}} mother and his third daughter, Rose. His personal troubles as well as the Compromise of 1850 convinced him to spend a winter in Italy after coaxing from William Wetmore Story. The trip was financed by the sale of land around Elmwood, and Lowell intended to sell off even further. Ultimately, 25 of the original [...] were sold to supplement Lowell's income. His personal troubles continued: his son Walter died while overseas, his wife Maria White Lowell died in October 1853, his father became deaf, and his sister Rebecca was deteriorating mentally such that she often went without speaking for weeks. He had difficulty <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> became a recluse at Elmwood for a time until an invitation to speak at the Lowell Institute resulted in a job offer at Harvard College. He accepted the job, with the request he be allowed to study abroad for a year first.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{compared}} the storyline {{to the five}} stages of grief, a theory introduced by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. Alex Panisch of Out opined that the first five tracks [...] "document the five stages of a relationship turning sour: good times, doubt, breaking up, <b>coping,</b> <b>and</b> still being hung up". Critics also noted that, unlike other artists' break up records, the singer admits in Truth Serum {{that she was the}} person who made a mistake that ended the relationship. Panisch commented that; [...] "When female artists sing about breakups [...] they almost overwhelmingly write themselves in the position of the wronged party and their songs are about recovering and strengthening from the experience. [...] Tove Lo flips the script on this narrative". Shanon Carlin of Radio.com stated that the singer [...] "doesn't try and capitalize off her heartbreak by writing a female empowerment anthem that shames the guy who did her wrong. No, on this album, Lo is not an innocent. It's actually quite the opposite".|$|E
500|$|A {{residence}} building {{under construction}} at the Catholic University of America was dismantled, and the personal home of President Grover Cleveland in Woodley Park lost its roof. Roofs of several government offices were also torn away, and the steeple of New York Avenue Presbyterian Church was [...] "reduced to match wood". The Smithsonian Institution Building sustained notable damage. Fallen trees littered {{the grounds of the}} White House, among them being historic specimens like an elm planted by Abraham Lincoln. Some of the more celebrated trees were picked apart by passersby trying to procure souvenirs. The White House itself suffered some minor damage, mostly limited to dislodged <b>coping</b> <b>and</b> copper roofing, along with a few broken windows. Nearby, five men were entrapped and one killed when the Abert Building—a newly built, five-story brick structure on Pennsylvania Avenue—partially collapsed in the storm, crushing two adjoining buildings. Over the coming months, tenants filed multiple lawsuits against the building's owner after at least one local builder asserted that the wall failure resulted from neglectful construction. The Abert Building was completely repaired by October 14.|$|E
