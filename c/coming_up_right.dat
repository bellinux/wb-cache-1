They are half rhinoceros half plastic: a Rinoplastico. The film takes place 5 million years into the future, so it made sense with these kind of mutations. It took about 2 weeks to film, and several days to edit. To make the figures, props and sets. They used, mostly plastilina (a Mexican type of clay), and all sorts of recycled materials.|$|R
40|$|Lifted {{inference}} rules exploit symmetries {{for fast}} reasoning in statistical rela-tional models. Computational complexity of these rules is {{highly dependent on}} {{the choice of the}} constraint language they operate on and therefore <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with the <b>right</b> kind of representation is {{critical to the success of}} lifted inference. In this paper, we propose a new constraint language, called setineq, which allows subset, equality and inequality constraints, to represent substitutions over the vari-ables in the theory. Our constraint formulation is strictly more expressive than existing representations, yet easy to operate on. We reformulate the three main lifting rules: decomposer, generalized binomial and the recently proposed single occurrence for MAP inference, to work with our constraint representation. Exper-iments on benchmark MLNs for exact and sampling based inference demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several other existing techniques. ...|$|R

50|$|After {{graduating from}} the École {{nationale}} d'administration, which trains France's leaders in {{the public and private}} sectors, Arthur Vlaminck lands a job as speechwriter in the Foreign Ministry. Existing senior advisers do not welcome a talented newcomer who may become a competitor but his abilities are recognised by the Minister and, most important, by Maupas, the career official heading the department. That said, <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with the <b>right</b> words for the constantly changing world situation and the constantly changing reactions of the Minister proves no easy task. He gets hastily written drafts past Maupas, and past other senior advisers who rubbish them, only to find that the Minister's needs have changed. The film ends in February 2003 with a re-enactment of the actual speech by Dominique de Villepin to the UN Security Council, at which he contradicted claims by Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld and argued passionately for disarmament of Iraq but not invasion.|$|R

The Flames defeated the Vancouver Canucks, Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks to set up a Stanley Cup Final rematch of the 1986 Final with the Montreal Canadiens. McDonald was left out of the Flames' lineup for the third, fourth and fifth games, but with Calgary leading the series three wins to two, head coach Terry Crisp felt that if the Flames were to win the championship, McDonald deserved to be in the game. [...] Crisp's decision paid dividends, as midway through the sixth game, McDonald stepped onto the ice after serving a penalty to join Håkan Loob and Joe Nieuwendyk in a three-on-one rush toward the Montreal goal. [...] Loob passed the puck up to Nieuwendyk, who saw a streaking McDonald <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> the <b>right</b> side of the ice.

League president John Ziegler presented the trophy to McDonald, co-captain Jim Peplinski and alternate Tim Hunter.

Unfortunately for Warren, Sheridan asked for Warren at about this time and no one could say where he was. Sheridan then ordered Griffin to take command of the corps. Meanwhile, Warren ordered Crawford to wheel to the left and drive south against Five Forks because Warren perceived that the Confederates still held the crossroads because of artillery fire coming from that direction. Coulter's brigade led the attack on the left of Ford's Road with Kellogg's and Baxter's brigades and four of Bartlett's separated regiments <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> on the <b>right.</b> From woods on the south of the Boisseau farm, the Confederates fired steadily on the Union battle line.
