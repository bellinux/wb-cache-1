5|$|Another {{widespread}} and popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often minced meat and tomatoes, sometimes {{a layer of}} egg <b>custard</b> or béchamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well-known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with <b>custard</b> or béchamel sauce on top, but that version is a relatively recent innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|Curds {{differ from}} pie {{fillings}} or <b>custards</b> {{in that they}} contain {{a higher proportion of}} juice and zest, which gives them a more intense flavor. Also, curds containing butter have a smoother and creamier texture than both pie fillings and <b>custards,</b> which contain little or no butter and use cornstarch or flour for thickening. Additionally, unlike <b>custards,</b> curds are not usually eaten on their own.|$|R
5|$|Bacon {{ice cream}} (or bacon-and-egg ice cream) is {{an ice cream}} {{generally}} created by adding bacon to egg <b>custard</b> and freezing the mixture. The concept of bacon ice cream originated in a 1973 sketch on the British comedy series The Two Ronnies as a joke; however, it was eventually created for April Fools' Day. Heston Blumenthal experimented {{with the creation of}} ice cream, making a <b>custard</b> similar to scrambled eggs then adding bacon to create one of his signature dishes. It now appears on dessert menus in other restaurants.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{ice cream}} is frozen egg <b>custard</b> with {{flavours}} added. Blumenthal whisks egg yolks with sugar until the sugar {{interacts with the}} proteins in the yolk, creating a network of proteins. The entire substance turns white, at which point flavouring can be added and cooked in. While stirring the mixture, Blumenthal cools it {{as fast as possible}} using liquid nitrogen.|$|E

40|$|<b>Custards</b> {{prepared}} with four thickeners (two modified starches: waxy maize and tapioca, and two derives of cellulose: CMC and HPMC) and at {{two levels of}} consistency were enriched with a water-soluble functional ingredient (tyrosol) and its release evaluated after in vitro mouth, stomach and small intestine incubations. Tyrosol release was related to structure breakdown and water release properties of the <b>custards.</b> After mouth incubation, the ¿-amylase sensibility of the starch <b>custards</b> determined their higher release. Although less evident, the difference still remains after the stomach and intestine incubations. The intestine produced a complete release in the starch <b>custards.</b> In comparison to HPMC, CMC showed higher structural resistance, with lower values of release. The increase in consistency decreased the release after mouth and stomach incubations, but {{did not have an}} effect after the intestine incubation. The differences found will allow a control in the release of water-soluble ingredients...|$|R

5|$|After {{talks of}} closure for years, Wayzata Bay Center closed its doors on August 15, 2011.

The restaurant, a tenant of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen <b>Custard,</b> a tenant in the mall since 2009, closed their Wayzata location entirely.

5|$|Coghill met Powderfinger when he {{attended}} {{one of their}} practice sessions and joked with the band, introducing himself as a drummer. Two years later, when Steven Bishop left the band, guitarist Ian Haug recognised Coghill at an audition, and signed him at that point. Previously, Coghill had been rejected in an audition for <b>Custard.</b> Jon spent about six months playing alongside Scott Coleman and Marc Zande in the Brisbane grunge band, Gland, before committing full-time to Powderfinger in early 1992. In December 1997, Coghill took a brief break from Powderfinger and toured with Regurgitator. Drummer Ross McLennan of Far Out Corporation and later from The Predators, took Coghill's place for a Powderfinger performance on 19 December.|$|E

5|$|Powderfinger {{were active}} in {{supporting}} causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances. In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November. They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts <b>Custard</b> and You Am I to also appear {{on the steps of}} the Sydney Opera House. The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World, was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people. In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005. The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area. The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected.|$|E
5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling <b>custard,</b> almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone caused $50million {{in damage}} to the banana crop and $3million to papaws between Ingham to Cairns alone. Agricultural {{impairment}} {{was not limited to}} Babinda; throughout northern Queensland, the storm devastated banana and papaw crops. Avocado farms at Atherton and pineapple farms in Rollingstone and Mutarnee experienced considerable losses; in addition, $35million in sugar cane crops near Innisfail were destroyed, with 60–70percent of the entire year's harvest ruined. Within the vicinity of Tully, the storm ruined 30percent of the crop, causing $10million in losses. In general, the sugar industry, already economically weak, bore the brunt of the system's impact. Overall, Winifred caused $86.4million in agricultural losses; the cyclone ruined 1.5million tones of sugar, costing $40million, 3.7million cases of bananas, costing $34.6million, and 15percent of the maize crop, costing $500,000. Winifred also damaged $4.9million in papaws, and $3.8million in avocados, lychees, <b>custard</b> apples, flowers, and chokos, as well. Effects to dairy and poultry industries were less severe, with losses reported at $2million and $600,000, respectively. Winds uprooted large swaths of forest, with $1million in damage at government-owned forests alone.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of oral processing protocols and food texture on in vivo flavour release was evaluated by nose-space analysis. Nose-space analysis {{was carried out}} by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, and strawberry-flavoured <b>custards</b> were prepared with 0. 1 % (w/w) and 1. 0 % (w/w) carboxymethyl cellulose to modify the texture. Two oral processing protocols were adopted during the study; a free-chewing protocol and an imposed protocol. Twenty-one subjects participated in the study. Significant effects on in-nose flavour release were observed for the type of compound, the <b>custard's</b> texture, the oral processing protocol and the subjects. When people were allowed to eat as they normally do, individuals could be divided into three groups on the basis of swallowing time: first group, swallowing time 6 s; intermediate group, t(swallow) varying (4 - 6 s). Within each group, different effects of the texture of the <b>custards</b> on in-nose flavour concentrations were observed, indicating that individual behaviour plays a considerable role in determining texture effects on flavour perceptio...|$|R
