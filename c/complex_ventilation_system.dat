40|$|Improvements {{in outdoor}} air quality that were {{achieved}} through {{the implementation of}} the Clean Air Act accentuate the quality of the indoor air as an important, if not dominant, factor in the determination of the total population exposure to air contaminants. A number of developments are adding important new determinants of indoor air quality. Energy conservation strategies require reductions in infiltration of outdoor air into buildings. New materials introduced in the construction and in the maintenance of buildings are contributing new air contaminants into the building atmosphere. Larger buildings require more and more <b>complex</b> <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> that are less and less under the individual control of the occupants. All of these factors contribute to the current reality that indoor air contains more pollutants, and often at higher concentrations, than outdoor air.

40|$|Ventilation {{corresponds}} to {{a large part of}} the total energy use of a building and a lot of attention has been paid to how to reduce this energy use. However, much of this work on saving energy has been focused on reduction of the airflows and how this in turn reduces the energy use. In this study it is shown that lowered airflows does not automatically result in reduced fan energy. Instead this dissertation is focused on design of large and <b>complex</b> <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> to obtain good function and low energy use, both the prerequisites for the design and actual solutions. In this work the energy use has been mostly limited to fan energy and how to reduce the pressure levels and flow resistances in the <b>ventilation</b> <b>system.</b> Another aspect that has not been widely studied is the interaction between demands and <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> design. This becomes important when working to optimise <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems,</b> and especially so for demand controlled <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> Demand control <b>ventilation,</b> DCV, is a concept that normally refers to a <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> with variable airflows. In such a system the airflows are reduced when the demands so permits in order to save energy. This study discusses the concept of DCV from a broader perspective and shows how the demands affect the <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> design. In systems with variable airflows pressure levels and pressure losses becomes even more important than in conventional systems with constant airflows. This dissertation is based on measurement studies combined with experiences gathered from building services engineers, manufacturers and so on, literature survey and basic fluid dynamics. Based on these results from the measurements simple models were made and used for simulations. Measurement results and calculations were than analyzed for both the air-conditioning and air distribution systems, using all this information some alternative <b>ventilations</b> <b>system</b> designs are presented and discussed. To show the saving potential for the fan energy with these new designs, calculations were done for an existing <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> in a hospital. Based on measurements and design data a basic model for this system was created. This showed that for this representative existing <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> it would be possible to save 14 % of the presently used fan energy.

50|$|Indoor bioaerosols may {{originate}} from outdoor air and indoor reservoirs. Although outdoor bioaerosols cannot easily migrate into large buildings with <b>complex</b> <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems,</b> certain categories of outdoor bioaerosols (i.e., fungal spores) do serve as major sources for indoor bioaerosols in naturally ventilated buildings at specific {{periods of time}} (i.e., growing seasons for fungi).Major indoor sources for bioaerosols at residential homes include human occupants, pets, house dust, organic waste, {{as well as the}} heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Several studies have identified human activities as an important source for indoor bioaerosols. Human bodies can generate bioaerosols directly through activities like talking, sneezing, and coughing, while other residential activities (i.e., washing, flushing toilet, sweeping floor) can generate bioaerosols indirectly. Since microorganisms can accumulate and grow on dust particles, house dust is a potential source of bioaerosols. In a study by Wouters et al., they investigated the effects of indoor storage of organic household waste on microbial contamination among 99 households in the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and indicated that “increased microbial contaminant levels in homes are associated with indoor storage of separated organic waste”, which might elevate “the risk of bioaerosol-related respiratory symptoms in susceptible people”. However, the analysis by Wouters et al. was based on the collected samples of settled house dust, which might not serve as a strong indicator for bioaerosols suspended in the air. Other materials in residential buildings, such as food stuffs, house plants, textiles, wood material and furniture stuffing can also become bioaerosol sources when water content is appropriate for microorganisms to grow.For non-residential buildings, some specific indoor environments, such as hospitals, wastewater treatment plants, composting facilities, certain biotechnical laboratories, have been revealed to have bioaerosol sources related to their particular environmental characteristics.|$|R

The capabilities of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> in the two road tunnels at Dartford (London, UK) are analysed using a multi-scale modelling approach. Both tunnels have <b>complex</b> semi-transverse <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> with jet fans to control longitudinal flow. The construction and <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> in the tunnels are described and the current emergency ventilation strategies are presented. The analysis includes a coupling of a 1 D network model with 3 D components, representing the operational jet fans, built using computational fluid dynamics. The jet fans were experimentally characterized on-site and the findings were compared to the model predictions. The predicted ventilation flows {{for each of the}} emergency ventilation strategies are presented and discussed. In cold-flow conditions, ventilation velocities significantly above 3 m/s can be generated throughout the tunnels. However, it is observed that 1 / 3 of the flow generated in the East tunnel is diverted from the tunnel up the extract shafts. The model was used to simulate various reduced fan combinations and thus the level of redundancy in each of the systems has been estimated. It is found that an acceptable level of ventilation may be produced in the West tunnel, even if several pairs of jet fans are disabled. In the East tunnel there is less redundancy, but an acceptable level of ventilation control can be maintained with one or two jet fans disabled...|$|R

The aim of this work is the development of a tool for preliminary design and selection of industrial fans. The design code, named AxDGen, is written in Python and is based on an axisymmetric solution of the indirect problem in which the tangential velocity is specified (by assigning the vortex distribution along the blade) and the axial velocity is computed accordingly by the application of radial equilibrium equation. In addition to the traditional free-vortex assumption, the code can use a series of controlled vortex distributions, in which the prescribed circulation, Euler work and the isentropic total pressure rise increase along the blade. These assumptions offer same potential benefit as a better utilization of blade section at higher radii or a reduction of hub losses by unloading the blade root. The rotor blade design is based on several methods, exploiting a combination of empirical rules, geometrical correlations and design constraints in order to complete the system of equations needed to define the blade geometry. In particular, two new design methods are presented here: they are based on the connection between the prescribed flow distribution resulting from the vortex selection, and the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil. The iterative procedure involving the aerodynamic performance of the profile is based on the Kutta-Joukoski theorem that relates the lift generated by an airfoil to the speed of the airfoil through the fluid, the fluid density and the circulation. Successively the code generates the blade, built by a NACA 4 -digit or NACA 65 - series. This profile is generated in order to analyze the aerodynamic performance of new blade and to compute the blade polar curves...|$|R

Consequently, it becomes neces-sary {{to adapt the}} ventilation network of a mine to direct airflow into newly-opened districts. For economic reasons, opening new fields is often achieved via underground workings.

Results of monitoring demonstrate that investments for these <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> were justified and the installed <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> corresponded to our technical and sanitary-hygienic expectations...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the cold}} climate in winter, a new novel <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> was put forward based on the {{analysis}} of the heat distribution at the subway station in Harbin. There was no special heating system in winter for subway station with such a <b>ventilation</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, three dimensional model of the subway station was built, a mathematical model of the novel <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> was developed based on the k-ε standard turbulence model, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for the <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> were performed to clarify the conditions of the temperature fields. A scientific analysis was carried out and the simulated results indicated that the temperature of the subway station was acceptable and the novel <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> suggested in this paper was a promising way to save energy and protect environment...|$|R
