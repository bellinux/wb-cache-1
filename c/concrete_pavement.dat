25|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of concrete pavements is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways.

25|$|The largest use {{of asphalt}} is for making asphalt {{concrete}} for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt {{consumed in the}} United States. Asphalt <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated {{so it can be}} mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility.

There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the US, and a similar number in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> (sidewalks) {{are usually}} made of {{continuous}} slabs with simple control joints at a specified interval. Simple control joints such as breaking score lines or saw cuts are created on the pedestrian <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> mainly to relieve stresses resulting from friction {{and also to}} avoid displacement/unplanned cracking. However, these joints have no load transfer mechanism and therefore the concrete slab panels may have different vertical movements at the joint when the pavements are affected by tree root invasion or by soil movement. Such differential vertical movements at adjoining slabs can create tripping hazards to pedestrians. This paper presents the use of ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) rubber and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) joiners for minimizing such tripping hazards.

25|$|Concrete {{roads are}} more fuel {{efficient}} to drive on, more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, {{yet have a}} much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that pervious concrete can be used, which eliminates the need to place storm drains near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.|$|E

40|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> {{represent}} {{a large portion}} of the transportation infrastructure. While the vast majority of <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> provide excellent long-term performance, a portion of these pavements have recently shown premature joint deterioration. Substantial interest has developed in understanding why premature joint deterioration is being observed in jointed portland cement <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> (PCCP). While some have attributed this damage to insufficient air void systems, poor mixture design, or chemical reaction between the salt and the paste, it is the hypothesis of this work that a component of this damage can be attributed to fluid absorption at the joints. This report begins by discussing the importance of the level of concrete saturation on freeze-thaw damage.

Fourth, the report discusses soy methyl esters polystyrene blends (SME-PS) as a potential method to extend the service life of <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> by limiting the ingress of salt solutions. The report also discusses field application of the SME-PS blends for field investigation. Finally, the report discusses the development of a test to assess chloride solution ingress during temperature cycling. The aim of this work is to provide background on some aspects that can lead to joint deterioration and to provide the pavement community alternatives on how sealers and deicers may be able to be used more efficiently to reduce joint damage...|$|R

2500|$|Asphalt {{overlays}} {{are sometimes}} laid over distressed concrete {{to restore a}} smooth wearing surface. A disadvantage of this method is that movement in the joints between the underlying concrete slabs, whether from thermal expansion and contraction, or from deflection of the concrete slabs from truck axle loads, usually causes [...] reflective cracks in the asphalt. To decrease reflective cracking, <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> is broken apart through a break and seat, crack and seat, or rubblization process. Geosynthetics {{can be used for}} reflective crack control. With break and seat and crack and seat processes, a heavy weight is dropped on the concrete to induce cracking, then a heavy roller is used to seat the resultant pieces into the subbase. The main difference between the two processes is the equipment used to break the <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> {{and the size of the}} resulting pieces. The theory is frequent small cracks will spread thermal stress over a wider area than infrequent large joints, reducing the stress on the overlying asphalt pavement. Rubblization is a more complete fracturing of the old, worn-out concrete, effectively converting the old pavement into an aggregate base for a new asphalt road.|$|E
