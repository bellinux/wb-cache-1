50|$|On October 21, 2014 the Green City, <b>Clean</b> <b>Waters</b> {{program was}} awarded the American Planning Association (APA) Pennsylvania Chapter's Planning {{excellence}} Award in Implementation. The following year on March 31, 2015, Green City, <b>Clean</b> <b>Waters</b> won the APA National Planning Excellence Award for Implementation. The award recognized the positive changes {{that have taken place}} in the city {{as a result of the}} program's planning efforts. Green City, <b>Clean</b> <b>Waters</b> completed 113 projects that implemented green stormwater infrastructure in the time leading up to this award and were in the process of designing 187 more.|$|R
50|$|Green City, <b>Clean</b> <b>Waters</b> is a 25-year plan {{to protect}} and enhance {{watersheds}} through stormwater management and green stormwater infrastructure (GSI). Philadelphia Water developed Green City, <b>Clean</b> <b>Waters</b> to confront environmental, demographic and financial challenges. Green City, <b>Clean</b> <b>Waters</b> confronts a number of challenges Philadelphia faces with aging infrastructure {{and the impact of}} climate change on human health but the program's driving factor is the reduction of combined sewer overflows (CSOs). By capturing and infiltrating stormwater using green stormwater infrastructure such as rain gardens, swales, and stormwater tree trenches the system works to mitigate flooding and erosion in Philadelphia’s rivers and streams.|$|R

5|$|Caddisflies {{are useful}} as bioindicators (of good water quality), {{since they are}} {{sensitive}} to water pollution, and are {{large enough to be}} assessed conveniently in the field. Some species indicate undisturbed habitat, and some indicate degraded habitat. Although caddisflies may be found in waterbodies of varying qualities, species-rich caddisfly assemblages are generally thought to indicate <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and marshes. Together with stoneflies and mayflies, caddisflies feature importantly in bioassessment surveys of streams and other water bodies.|$|E

5|$|However, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board {{withheld}} its {{permit approval}} in December 2000, over {{concerns that the}} Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an approval was necessary under the <b>Clean</b> <b>Water</b> Act {{in order to get}} the necessary approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board to overturn the approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki {{a disaster}} zone. In {{accordance with the}} FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February13. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February15. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The {{lack of access to}} <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600water bottles were sent to the island on February16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages. Through September24, they provided over 100,000litres of <b>clean</b> <b>water.</b> Distribution of 2,050collapsible containers and 200hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to set up}} a water company for the town; pumping {{machinery}} was installed and works constructed in 1880 to provide a <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> supply to the town. In 1948, the council took over the company and in 1962 its operation was handed to the Kesteven Water Board, which was absorbed by the Anglian Water Authority in 1973.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E
5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by <b>clean</b> <b>water.</b> The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that {{while it is true that}} the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E

5|$|The {{extensive}} flooding stranded {{many residents}} who {{were forced to}} stay in place long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some were trapped inside attics and were unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and sledge hammers, which Mayor Nagin had residents urged to store in their attics in case of such events. <b>Clean</b> <b>water</b> was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.|$|E

While water quality may play a potential role in the success or decline of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, this relationship has not been clearly defined to date.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
