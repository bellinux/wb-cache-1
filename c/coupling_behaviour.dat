40|$|New {{families}} of hygro-thermally curvature-stable laminates are presented {{within the framework}} of a unified approach to laminate design incorporating complex mechanical <b>coupling</b> <b>behaviour,</b> which includes all possible interactions between extension, shearing, bending and twisting. Necessary conditions for hygro-thermally curvature-stable laminates are developed, from which new stacking sequence configurations with standard angle-ply and cross-ply sub-sequences are then derived. All stacking sequence configurations are characterised according to their unique mechanical <b>coupling</b> <b>behaviour,</b> with polar plots used to illustrate the changes in off-axis mechanical <b>coupling</b> <b>behaviour</b> for each laminate family; with respect to extensional, coupling and bending stiffness and the associated lamination parameters. The new stacking sequence configurations are applicable to any orthotropic fibre/matrix system with constant ply thickness throughout and although standard angle-ply and cross-ply combinations are the primary focus of the study, a number of important observations are reported concerning double angle-ply laminates and laminates with non-standard angle-ply orientations...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{modified}} mixture theory and volume fraction concept, this work presents {{a theoretical framework}} used to model <b>coupled</b> chemo-mechanical <b>behaviours.</b> The Clausius-Duhem inequality, which governs the dissipation associated with mechanical work, phase transformation, mass transport and thermal transport, is rigorously derived. According to this theoretical framework, the chemo-elastic-plastic model developed by Loret et al. (2002) for saturated homoinonic expansive clay is extended to the general unsaturated case. The model is validated against limited experimental data of oedometer tests concerning mechanical and chemo-mechanical mixed loading under controlled matric suction on reconstituted Boom Clay mixed with NaNo 3 solution. Reasonable and quantitative responses of these complex coupled geochemical loading paths can be obtained, and thus give us a preliminary insight on chemo-hydro-mechanical <b>coupled</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is experimental characterisation and numerical modelling of <b>coupled</b> <b>behaviours</b> between drying shrinkage and plastic damage in concrete. In the first part, we present an original experimental study on an ordinary concrete {{in order to determine}} material damage induced by drying shrinkage. Uniaxial compression tests are performed on samples dried for different periods. It is shown that material damage can be caused by drying process. Mechanical behaviour becomes more brittle with higher damage kinetics when concrete is dried. In the second part, a constitutive model is proposed in order to describe <b>coupled</b> hydro-mechanical <b>behaviour</b> of partially saturated concrete. This model takes into account induced damage, mechanical and capillary plastic deformations. Numerical simulations of experimental tests are presented, and show a qualitatively good agreement with experimental data. The results are relevant with respect to the importance of drying process in the durability study of concrete structures...|$|R

40|$|New design {{concepts}} are demonstrated for twenty-four classes of laminate, {{which have been}} derived {{as part of an}} ongoing study on the development of a unified approach to the characterization of coupled laminates. This article presents a description of each class of coupled laminate; the vast majority possessing <b>coupling</b> <b>behaviour</b> not previously identified in the literature. Coupled laminates have potential applications in the: design of aero-elastic compliant rotor blades or aircraft wing structures, by introducing tailored Extension-Twisting and/or Shearing-Extension coupling at the laminate level or; design of thermally activated morphing structures, by exploiting more complex <b>coupling</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Results are presented which demonstrate various mechanical coupling responses, including thermally induced curvature predictions resulting from a high temperature cure process. However, the main focus of this article concerns the identification of laminates possessing complex mechanical couplings that remain hygro-thermally curvature stable; also referred to as warp-free laminates. The number of solutions for each class of coupled laminate is given together with example stacking sequences.

40|$|The {{definitive}} list of Extension-Shearing coupled composite laminates {{with up to}} 21 plies is derived. The listings {{comprise of}} individual stacking sequences of entirely non-symmetric laminates, are characterized in terms of angle- and cross-ply sub-sequence relationships {{as well as the}} blend-ratio of unbalanced angle-plies. Dimensionless parameters, including lamination parameters, are provided, from which the extensional and bending stiffness terms are readily calculated. Because this new class of coupled non-symmetric laminate possesses in-plane <b>coupling</b> <b>behaviour</b> only it can also be manufactured flat under a standard elevated temperature curing process. Such laminates can be configured to produce bending-twisting coupling in wing-box type structures, which can be exploited to great effect in the design for passive load alleviation in wind-turbine blades, or for aero-elastic compliance in fixed wing aircraft or helicopter rotor-blades. It should be recognised that similar behaviour can also be achieved using less sophisticated designs, such as applying off-axis material alignment to otherwise balanced and symmetric laminates or by using un-balanced and symmetric designs, but additional forms of <b>coupling</b> <b>behaviour</b> arise in these cases, leading to detrimental effects on both stiffness and strength, which are demonstrated though comparisons of the structural response of competing laminate designs...|$|E

40|$|Ice {{sheets are}} among the key {{controls}} on global climate and sea level. A detailed understanding of their dynamics is crucial to make accurate predictions of their future mass balance. Ice streams are the dominant negative component in this balance, accounting for up to 90 % of the Antarctic ice flux into ice shelves and ultimately into the sea. Despite their importance, our understanding of ice-stream dynamics is far from complete. A range of observations associate ice streams with meltwater. Meltwater lubricates the ice at its bed, allowing it to slide with less internal deformation. It is believed that ice streams may appear due to a localisation feedback between ice flow, basal melting and water pressure in the underlying sediments. This thesis aims to address the instability of ice-stream formation by considering potential feedbacks between the basal boundary and ice flow. Chapter 2 considers ice-flow models, formulating a model {{that is capable of}} capturing the leading-order dynamics of both a slow-moving ice sheet and rapidly flowing ice streams. Chapter 3 investigates the consequences of applying different phenomenological sliding laws as the basal boundary condition in this ice-flow model. Chapter 4 presents a model of subglacial water flow below ice sheets, and particularly below ice streams. This provides a more physical representation of processes occurring at the bed. Chapter 5 then investigates the <b>coupled</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the water with the sediment, and Chapter 6 the <b>coupled</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the water with the ice flow.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to {{experimental}} investigations of the hydro-mechanical–chemical <b>coupling</b> <b>behaviour</b> of sandstone {{in the context of}} CO 2 storage in aquifers. We focused on the evolution of creep strain, the transport properties and the elastic modulus of sandstone under the effect of CO 2 –brine or CO 2 alone. A summary of previous laboratory results is first presented, including mechanical, poromechanical and hydro-mechanical–chemical coupling properties. Tests were then performed to investigate the evolution of the creep strain and permeability during the injection of CO 2 –brine or CO 2 alone. After the injection of CO 2 –brine or CO 2 alone, an instantaneous volumetric dilatancy was observed due to the decrease in the effective confining stress. However, CO 2 alone had a significant influence on the creep strain and permeability compared to the small influence of CO 2 –brine. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} acceleration of the CO 2 –brine–rock reaction by the generation of carbonic acid induced by the dissolution of CO 2 into the brine. The original indentation tests on samples after the CO 2 –brine–rock reaction were also performed and indicated that the elastic modulus decreased with an increasing reaction time.
