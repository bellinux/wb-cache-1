40|$|In recent years, the Plasma Assisted Catalysis (PAC) {{approach}} for controlling NOx and/or particulate emissions from mobile diesel engines {{has received a}} significant amount of attention from researchers. Substantial work has been performed by various researchers to develop an understanding of the reaction mechanisms in a plasma reactor in conjunction with conventional lean-NOx <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials.</b> However, less effort has been devoted to systematically investigating new <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials</b> specifically designed for application in the PAC system. Since it is believed that plasma produces a unique environment for a catalyst bed (i. e. oxidation of NO to NO 2 and partial oxidation/reforming of hydrocarbon reductants in the exhaust), new catalytic materials that take advantage of the plasma reactor conditions need to be studied. Optimum <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials</b> will be required in order to develop a PAC system that achieves maximum deNOx performance over the wide range of operating conditions in which the system will be required to operate for application on heavy duty diesel engines. This presentation discusses the issues involved in designing catalytic materials for achieving high NOx conversion in a laboratory test PAC system, and what is required to improve the <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials</b> further for application in an on-engine environment...|$|R

40|$|Transition metal ion-chelating ordered {{mesoporous}} carbon (TM-OMC) {{materials were}} recently {{shown to be}} efficient polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) catalysts. The structure and properties of these catalysts are largely different from conventional <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials,</b> thus rendering membrane electrode assembly (MEA) preparation parameters developed for conventional catalysts not useful for applications of TM-OMC catalysts. This necessitates development of a methodology to incorporate TM-OMC catalysts in the MEA. Here, an efficient method for MEA preparation using TM-OMC <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials</b> for PEMFC is developed including effects of catalyst/ionomer loading and catalyst/ionomer-mixing and application procedures.

Although the formation of small gold nanoparticles was established for all <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials,</b> only a very low activity for the total oxidation of methane was observed, at temperatures[250 C.

40|$|Ideally, for an {{automotive}} developer is {{to evaluate}} <b>catalysts</b> <b>materials</b> life time, with minimum effort and cost.

They do not allow discriminating between different processes contributing to the overall degradation. Furthermore, larger amounts of <b>catalyst</b> <b>material</b> are required and therefore not always suitable when assessing new research catalysts. Liquid electrolyte models ex-situ are the choice techniques to study catalysts durability issues 1.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that non-stoichiometric lithium imide {{is a highly}} active catalyst {{for the production of}} high-purity hydrogen from ammonia, with superior ammonia decomposition activity to a number of other <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials.</b> Neutron powder diffraction measurements reveal that the catalyst deviates from pure imide stoichiometry under ammonia flow, with active catalytic behaviour observed across a range of stoichiometry values near the imide. These measurements also show that hydrogen from the ammonia is exchanged with, and incorporated into, the bulk <b>catalyst</b> <b>material,</b> in a significant departure from existing ammonia decomposition catalysts. The efficacy of the lithium imide-amide system not only represents a more promising catalyst system, but also broadens the range of candidates for amide-based ammonia decomposition to include those that form imides...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{catalyst}} of hollow PdCu alloy nanocubes supported on nitrogen-doped graphene support (H-PdCu/ppy-NG) is successfully synthesized using a simple one-pot template-free method. Two other <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials</b> such as solid PdCu alloy particles supported on this same nitrogen-doped graphene support (PdCu/ppy-NG) and hollow PdCu alloy nanocubes {{supported on the}} reduced graphene oxide support (H-PdCu/RGO) are also prepared using the similar synthesis conditions for comparison. It is found that, among these three <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials,</b> H-PdCu/ppy-NG gives the highest electrochemical active area and both the most uniformity and dispersibility of H-PdCu particles. Electrochemical tests show that the H-PdCu/ppy-NG catalyst can give the best electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the ethanol electrooxidation {{when compared to other}} two catalysts. Therefore, H-PdCu/ppy-NG should be a promising catalyst candidate for anodic ethanol oxidation in direct ethanol fuel cells...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the {{pertinent}} intellectual context for understanding Thomas F. Torrance's reconstruction of natural theology is the synthesis of the rational structure of knowledge and the <b>material</b> <b>content</b> of knowledge. The bridge between the synthesis of (i) rational structure and <b>material</b> <b>content,</b> and (ii) natural theology is the analogous relation Torrance set between the relation of natural theology and revealed theology and the relation of practical geometry and physics, which is constituted by the same formal relation of rational structure and <b>material</b> <b>content.</b> By examining Torrance's work on natural theology in this connection {{it is apparent that}} the germane methodological issue at stake is the manner of the relation between the rational structure of human understanding and the <b>material</b> <b>content</b> of God's self-revelation in theological cognition. Torrance's criticism of natural theology concerns its autonomous formulations in which theistic argumentation is established as an antecedent rational sub-structure, from which revealed theology is interpreted and cognized within an anthropocentric correlate system. Accordingly, Torrance's reconstruction of natural theology is the reconfiguration of the relation of rational structure and <b>material</b> <b>content</b> within theological rationality. Applied to the classical loci of natural theology, this {{takes the form of a}} reconceptualisation of the cosmological argument and ontological argument, such that the rational structure of theistic argumentation is determined through its connection to revelation at key points. The significance of this inversion of the relation of rational structure and <b>material</b> <b>content</b> extends outwards into Torrance's broader dogmatics, where natural theology is identified as the rational intra-structure of theology, which, in conjunction with revealed theology as <b>material</b> <b>content,</b> constitutes theological science. The result is a theological approach that sets itself as a development beyond Karl Barth's rejection of natural theology, which conceives of natural theology as the necessary but insufficient condition of theology, under the determination of God's self-revelation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{may represent}} a potential health risk, because there are possible adsorbtion pathways through skin and lung.

By their high surface as well as their residual concentration at <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials</b> these possible bioactive and biopersistent particles have the potential to harm cells by releasing inflammation reactions, oxidative stress and even necrosis and apoptosis. Aim: For testing the biocompatibility according to DIN ISO 10993 - 5 in BMBF-supported “TRACER” (Toxicology and health risk assessment of carbon nanomaterials), we examine different kinds of dispersive and converted CNT materials for possible cytotoxic characteristics. Methods: Defined CNT-dispersions depending on particle size and <b>catalyst</b> <b>materials</b> were characterized with optical density and particle size distribution.
