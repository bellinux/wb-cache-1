50|$|The most {{familiar}} {{member of the}} genus worldwide is the <b>common</b> <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut,</b> Aesculus hippocastanum. The yellow buckeye, Aesculus flava (syn. A. octandra), is also a valuable ornamental tree with yellow flowers, but is less widely planted. Among the smaller species is the bottlebrush buckeye, Aesculus parviflora, a flowering shrub. Several {{other members of the}} genus are used as ornamentals, and several horticultural hybrids have also been developed, most notably the red horse chestnut Aesculus × carnea, a hybrid between A. hippocastanum and A. pavia.|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of these}} {{investigations}} was {{to conduct a}} detailed survey of dendroflora in a historic landscape park in Sobota, to determine the age and health condition of deciduous trees and to analyse the composition layout of the park. Field studies were conducted in September 2010 and in May 2011. A total of 130 trees and shrubs were inventoried in the park of approximately 1. 5 ha. Angiosperm species predominated, such as European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), <b>common</b> <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> (Aesculus hippocastanum L.), small-leaf linden (Tilia cordata Mill.) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.). The stand was {{in a very good}} health condition. Since 1978 no significant negative changes have been observed in the spatial composition of the planting arrangement. The function and manner of its use have been only slightly modified. The thorough and regular tending operations in the park need to be stressed here...|$|E

50|$|The Forest Recreation Ground {{supports}} {{many important}} habitats and species. Mature trees include turkey oak, English elm, English oak, sessile oak, rowan, silver birch, <b>common</b> lime and <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut.</b> Additionally, {{there have been}} more recent plantings of London plane, beech, various maples and silver lime. Perennials include autumn crocus, spring crocus, bluebell, ramsons, primrose, wild privet, hazel and guelder rose.|$|R
40|$|Leaves of <b>common</b> {{deciduous}} trees: <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> (Aesculus hippocastanum) and linden (Tilia spp.) {{from three}} parks within the urban area of Belgrade were studied as biomonitors of trace element (As, V, and Cd) atmospheric pollution. The May–September trace element accumulation {{in the leaves}}, and their temporal trends, were assayed in a multi-year period (2002 – 2006). Significant accumulation in the leaves was evident for As and V, but not so regularly for Cd. Slightly decreasing temporal trends of V and As ac-cumulated in the leaf tissues were observed over the years. During the time span, the concentrations of Cd remained approximately on the same level, except in May 2002 and September 2005, when a rapid increase was observed. The May–September accumulations of As and V were higher in <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> than in linden, although both {{may be used as}} biomonitors for these elements, and optionally for Cd in conditions of its high atmospheric loadings...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently, the leafminer Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimic {{has caused}} heavy {{damage to the}} white-flowering horse {{chestnut}} in Europe. Amongthe Aesculus genus, A. pavia L. HBT genotype, characterised by red flowers, showed an atypical resistance towards this pest. Its leaves, shaken in water, originated a dense foam, indicating the presence of saponins, unlike the <b>common</b> <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> tree. The aim was to isolate and identify these leaf saponins and test their possible defensive role against C. ohridella. RESULTS: Spectroscopic analyses showed that A. pavia HBT genotype leaves contained a mixture of saponins, four of which {{were based on the}} same structure as commercial escin saponins, the typical saponin mixture produced by A. hippocastanum and accumulated only within bark and fruit tissues. The mixture showed a repellent effect on C. ohridella moth. The number of mines detected on the leaves of A. hippocastanum plants treated with A. pavia HBT saponins through watering and stem brushing was significantly lower than the control, and in many cases nomines were ever observed. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the exogenous saponinswere translocated from roots/stem to the leaf tissues, and their accumulation seemed to ensure an appreciable degree of protection against the leafminer...|$|E

30|$|<b>Horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> (marronnier) {{is a tall}} {{deciduous}} {{tree that}} belongs to genus Aesculus of family Hippocastanaceae [1, 2]. It is a magnificent tree with loosely expanding big branches. Space created by <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees lining a street has beneficial effects such as charm and the feeling of peace. This is why streets are lined with many <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees in Europe. The US <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees bear seed from September to November, and the fallen seed abundantly covers roadsides. The fallen seed is taken away by rodents for caching [3]. Nonetheless, the fallen seeds, which are quite large, remain concentrated under canopies of mother trees {{and need to be}} removed. The <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed is covered with a hard theca. When the theca is cracked, a seed appears that closely resembles a <b>chestnut</b> seed. <b>Horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed contains a high concentration of saponin as well as aesclin and coumarin glycoside, which exert antithrombotic action and can be used as pharmaceutical drugs [4]. On the other hand, because <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed is not edible, it is not much utilized and is treated as waste. Its effective utilization is a big issue at present. To effectively utilize <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed, it is necessary to examine the properties of ground seed.|$|R
40|$|The <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> leafminer is an {{introduced}} invasive pest {{that every}} year causes extensive damage to {{the leaves of the}} white flowering <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> tree. An environmentally friendly method to control insect pests involves the use of sex pheromones for mating disruption. A large quantity of artificial pheromone is released into the insect plant system confusing males to the extend that they are unable to locate receptive females. In order to test the potential efficacy of the mating disruption technique on the <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> leafminer we set up semi-field trials with closed experimental units and varying leafminer densities. We counted the number of leaf mines on pheromone treated <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees and compared them with an untreated control. Mating disruption lead to a significant reduction in damage by more than 90 % in the first and second generation of the leafminer, irrespective of the initial leafminer density. Although these results are very encouraging, high population densities of the <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> leafminer in nature and the patchy distribution of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees in the cities will challenge the efficacy of mating disruption in the field. Further experiments are plannedwith open experimental units and typical <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> trees in various parks and gardens. Gitta Siekmann, Rainer Meyhöfer and Martin Homme...|$|R
50|$|Aescin or escin is {{a mixture}} of {{saponins}} with anti-inflammatory, vasoconstrictor and vasoprotective effects found in Aesculus hippocastanum (the <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut).</b> Aescin is the main active compound in <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut,</b> and is responsible for most of its medicinal properties.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{extract from}} <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seeds (Aesculus hippocastanum L., Sapindaceae), {{standardised}} for {{the content of}} aescin, is used as the treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. It has anti-inflammatory and anti-oedematous properties and indicates {{a positive effect on}} the venous tone, rheological properties, and blood coagulability. The mechanism of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed extract/aescin activity was proposed on the basis of in vitro and in vivo studies, and its effectiveness was documented with numerous randomised clinical trials. The results of the studies have proven that <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed extract not only significantly improves subjective symptoms in patients with chronic venous insufficiency like calf spasm, leg pain, pruritus, fatigue, but it also reduced leg volume, the ankle and calf circumference. The preparations containing <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed extract are very popular and they have similar effectiveness as compression therapy and a preparation with O-(β-hydroxyethyl) -rutosides. Moreover, <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed extract has been proven to be safe and very well tolerated. The study was to present the results of the studies that have been conducted so far and that have confirmed the effectiveness of use of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed extract or aescin as the treatment for chronic venous insufficiency...|$|R

30|$|Compounded {{paper was}} {{prepared}} by the method reported previously [5 – 7]. Briefly, outer theca of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed was ground under wet conditions with a mass colloider (stone mill type crusher) with a clearance of 40  μm, before blending with desired amounts of pulp and latex binder. The pulp used was prepared by refining Canadian-bleached conifer kraft pulp to a standard freeness of 550  mL with a refiner. Aica Aibon RAX 117 (Aica Kogyo, Kiyosu, Aichi, Japan), a latex binder (emulsion) made of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), was used to improve the adhesion between pulp and the ground outer theca of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed. Then, the ground outer theca of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed was blended with a prescribed amount of the bleached conifer kraft pulp and the latex binder. Compounded papers containing the ground outer theca of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed were prepared as described previously. The ground <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed content was adjusted to 20, 40, 60 wt% in the formulation; the latex binder content was 0.3 wt% of the combined amount of the ground outer theca of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed and the pulp in all the formulations. Distilled water {{was added to the}} mixtures of the foregoing ratios, which were then stirred with a mixer for 10  s to obtain slurries of even dispersion. An angular-sheeting machine (PU- 401; Tester Sangyo, Saitama, Japan) was used to adjust the slurries to a paper weight of 100  g/m 2. The sheets were pressed at 410  kPa at room temperature and dried at 120  °C with a rotating drier to prepare compounded papers containing the ground outer theca of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed.|$|R
