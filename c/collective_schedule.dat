Our work targets a heterogeneous collection of storage and compute clusters. The goal is to minimize the overall time to transfer files to their respective destination nodes. Two scheduling schemes are proposed and experimentally evaluated against an existing approach, the Insertion Scheduling. The first is a 0 - 1 Integer Programming based approach {{which is based on}} the idea of time-expanded networks. This scheme achieves the minimum total file transfer time, but has significant scheduling overhead. To address this issue, we propose a maximum weight graph matching based heuristic approach. This scheme is able to perform as well as insertion scheduling and has much lower scheduling overhead. We conclude that the heuristic scheme is a better fit for larger workloads and systems. ...|$|R

In this paper, we explore the use of parallel machines like the Intel Paragon to compress MPEG- 2 video sequences. The motivation is to build a production-based compression facility by exploiting the potential power of the available machine. Given a video sequence or a set of sequences, the aim of the parallel encoder is to achieve the maximum possible encoding rate. A <b>collective</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme for the processors, I/O nodes, and disks is proposed that provides fast I/O, minimizes the idle times of processors, and enables the system to work in a highly balanced fashion. An efficient data layout scheme for storing video frames is also proposed in order for the I/O to sustain the desired data transfer rates. Using a small percentage of processors as the I/O nodes results in an efficient utilization of th [...] ...|$|R

Performance improvements {{for a wide}} variety of parallel applications require domain-decomposition of data arrays from a contiguous arrangement in memory to a tiled layout for on-chip L 1 data caches and scratchpads. However, DRAM performance suffers under the non-streaming access patterns generated by many independent cores. We propose <b>collective</b> memory <b>scheduling</b> (CMS) that actively takes control of collective memory transfers such that requests arrive in a sequential and predictable fashion to the memory controller. CMS uses the hierarchically tiled arrays formalism to compactly express collective operations, which greatly improves programmability over conventional prefetch or list-DMA approaches. CMS reduces application execution time by up to 32 % and DRAM read power by 2. 2 ×, compared to a baseline DMA architecture such as STI Cell. 1...|$|R

This work offers a theoretical overview of systems on a chip, <b>collective</b> communications <b>scheduling</b> and more detailed description of evolutionary algorithms. Further, the work provides a description of the GPU architecture and its memory hierarchy using the OpenCL memory model. Based on the profiling, the work defines a concept for parallel execution of the fitness function. Furthermore, an estimation of the possible level of acceleration is presented. The process of implementation is described with a closer insight into the optimization process. Another important point consists in comparison of the original CPU-based solution and the massively parallel GPU version. As the final point, the thesis proposes distribution of the computation among different devices supported by OpenCL standard.

40|$|The Information Power Grid (IPG) is {{emerging}} as an infrastructure that will enable distributed applications – such as video conferencing and distributed interactive simulation – to seamlessly integrate collections of heterogeneous workstations, multiprocessors, and mobile nodes, over heterogeneous wide-area networks. This paper introduces a framework for developing efficient <b>collective</b> communication <b>schedules</b> in such systems. Our framework consists of analytical models of the heterogeneous system, scheduling algorithms for the collective communication pattern, and performance evaluation mechanisms. We show that previous models, which considered node heterogeneity but ignored network heterogeneity, can lead to solutions which are worse than the optimal by an unbounded factor. We then introduce an enhanced communication model, and develop three heuristic algorithms for the broadcast and multicast patterns. The completion time of the schedule is chosen as the performance metric. The heuristic algorithms are FEF (Fastest Edge First), ECEF (Earliest Completing Edge First), and ECEF with look-ahead. For small system sizes, we find the optimal solution using exhaustive search. Our simulationexperiments indicate that the performance of our heuristic algorithms is close to optimal. For performance evaluation of larger systems, we have also developed a simple lower bound on the completion time. Our heuristic algorithms achieve significant performance improvements over previous approaches. 1...|$|R

To avoid contention for links and associated delays, collective communications proceed in synchronized steps. Minimum {{number of steps}} is sought for the given network topology, wormhole (pipelined) switching, minimum routing and given sets of sender and/or receiver nodes. Used algorithms are able not only re-invent optimum schedules for known symmetric topologies like hyper-cubes, but they can find schedules even for any asymmetric or irregular topologies in case of general many-to-many collective communications. In most cases does the number of steps reach the theoretical lower bound for the given type of collective communication; if it does not, non-minimum routing can provide further improvement. Optimum schedules may serve for writing high-performance communication routines for application-specific networks on chip or for development of communication libraries in case of generalpurpose interconnection networks...|$|R
40|$|Elevator {{systems have}} been quite similar {{for more than a}} hundred years and it has only quite {{recently}} become more feasible to have elevators being able to switch shafts allowing the construction of a system with more than two elevator cars in a single shaft. Such a system is to be constructed and tested during 2016 and functions using magnetic levitation technology. This new system calls for new algorithms to schedule the assignment of the passengers’ calls. Different strategies based on the collective control algorithm were developed to schedule the maglev system. The strategies were tested in a simulation of a twenty-five floor building and compared to a traditional system of one elevator car per shaft using the <b>collective</b> control <b>scheduling</b> strategy. The results show that in two out of the three scenarios simulated the maglev system performs better than the traditional system when average waiting time and average traveling time are compared. The traditional system beats the maglev system by a lot under the interfloor traffic scenario and adding more elevator cars improved the maglev systems performance but not enough to be as good as the tradition system. The conclusions drawn are that it is hard to schedule the maglev system to spread the cars out. It is also clear that the maglev system requires more elevator cars or improved scheduling to perform as well as the traditional system during the interfloor traffic scenario but is performing equally well or better during the up and down-peak scenarios. Further simulations are required to confirm these conclusions as the schedulers used are quite simple...|$|R

According to Asyafah (2014) learning is the basis for knowledge development, and also the foundation of faith and belief. It is an important activity in human life because people are the vicegerents on earth (al-Baqarah [2]: 30). Faith, belief and knowledge are important ingredients of life. A combination of knowledge, faith and belief are the basis for living a better life. A research based approach in the teaching of Islamic education must comprise “materials to be taught, presentation of materials in short steps, opportunity for learner practice, provision of <b>collective</b> feedback and <b>scheduling</b> of review sessions” (Rosenshine and Stevens, 1986; Shuell, 1988, 1990; Schunk, 2012). It is through such an instructional approach that today’s challenges facing the modern world can be avoided and or solved (Nasoetion, 2007). Combining research in the teaching and learning process through a seminar course has all the above mentioned aspects. The approach combines both theory and practice in Islamic education. To implement these two basic tasks, human beings must have a strong foundation of faith and devotion as well as adequate knowledge.|$|R
40|$|Inter-organizational {{scheduling}} is a process, {{where two}} or more organizations coordinate activities for mutual benefits. Decision making {{in such an environment}} is a multi-criteria, multi-party practice, including cooperation between parties. It is characterized by distributed, dynamic, ill-defined and conflicting information. As this information {{is in the form of}} tacit knowledge, its efficient transference between organizations is not possible through databases and computer-supported tools. Therefore human collective work remains a key factor in interorganizational scheduling. This, comprising interaction between human operators, algorithms, software, and autonomous agents implies a need for structural and functional concepts. In this paper, inter-organizational dynamic collective work is studied using a cognitive-based analysis. Our aim is to identify the key factors affecting the process. Through a comparative review of the literature, it is argued that cooperative processes, involving coordination mechanisms, are one component of collaborative states in <b>collective</b> works in <b>scheduling</b> between organizations. In such a way, in collaborative scheduling, group and domain knowledge and tasks, group knowledge, group decision processes, and cooperative activities play a key role. This approach can contribute in system analysis, (re) design, and evaluation as well as designing computer supports in inter-organizational scheduling...|$|R
40|$|Dans cet article, l'auteur analyse les principales {{modifications}} apportées au régime de négociation collective dans les secteurs public et para-public québécois. Après avoir affirmé que le rapport {{de force}} est au coeur même des relations du travail dans les sociétés industrielles et que la forme privilégiée que revêt l’institutionnalisation de ce rapport de force dans les pays occidentaux est la négociation collective, il s'interroge sur les conséquences de la transposition de ce mécanisme dans le secteur public. Il rappelle brièvement l'évolution historique de la négociation collective dans les secteurs public et para-public québécois et analyse la philosophie de base de la Commission créée en juillet 1977 par le gouvernement pour étudier le régime des négociations collectives en vigueur. Constatant que les principales modifications introduites par le législateur en juin 1978 s'inspirent de cette philosophie de base, il les situe par rapport aux positions exprimées par les parties syndicales et patronales devant la Commission et par rapport aux problèmes rencontrés dans les négociations antérieures. The author analyses the major recent amendments to collective bargaining in Québec's public and para-public sectors. In most Western countries, collective bargaining is the accepted form of institutionalized industrial conflict. Originally developed by specialized {{workers in the}} private sector, collective bargaining was extended during the i 960 's to employees in the public and para-public sectors. When we speak of "règles du jeux" in these sectors, we normally mean those governing collective bargaining. The presence of {{a balance of power}} between the parties is certainly {{one of the most important}} features of the collective bargaining process. We thus consider the power relationship, as a dynamic process by which the parties try to impose costs on each other in order to attain specific objectives. While such costs in the private sector, are mainly economic and directly assumed by the parties, in the public sector economic costs are assumed both by unionized employees and the public, but not by the employer (government). The employer's cost is political, the result of public opinion. The evolution of collective bargaining in the public and para-public sectors led the Québec government to create a Commission of enquiry to revise the collective bargaining System. Initially benefitting from the favorable climat of the « Revolution tranquille », unionized employees in these sectors found a sympathetic ear in both public opinion and the provincial government. Profiting also by decentralized bargaining structures, which made conflicts easier to support by the population, they proceeded to improve their conditions of employment, rendering them comparable to those of the private sector. However, around the mid 1960 's the centralisation of bargaining structures, the loss of public sympathy, the rationalisation of governmental expenses, combined with the changing attitude of Québec governments towards unions, made collective bargaining take a new direction which led the government to create the above mentioned Commission. The Martin-Bouchard report's philosophyThere are three major topics around which all the other points revolve: 1. The overall development of the government's role since 1960 : the Commission^ members directly link the new, crucial role played by the State in the social and economic development of Québec from 1960 on, with the restructuring of labour relations in the public and para-public sectors ; 2. The summary of legislative developments emphasizes the broadly-accepted philosophy underlying the labour code as well as the caracteristics of the public sector ; 3. Finally, as the central preoccupation of the report, the Commission's members come to grips with the presence of the state in negotiations. Theyconsider it impossible to distinguish between the government's roles of employer and legislator. They also confirm the political character of negotiations in this sector. The basic philosophy expressed by the Commission's members permits us to point out the limits of their recommendations. Since they set out to maintain both the basic philosophy of the Labour Code and the particular nature of the State as an employer, they are unable to suggest a fundamental revision of the collective bargaining System in the public and para-public sectors. What the government retained from the ReportIt is certain that the government seriously took into account the under-lying philosophy of the Martin-Bouchard report as can been seen in the amendments to the following pieces of legislation— Bill 50 : The Civil Service Act. — Bill 55  : An Act Respecting the Organization of the Management andUnion Parties in View of Collective Bargaining in the Sector of Education, Social Affairs and Government Agencies. — Bill 59 : An Act to Amend the Labour Code. The new legislation thus created, is essentially a strengthening of thestatus quo, as justified by the report itself. Bill 55 refers back to the underlying principles of Bill 95. Bill 50 contains the implementation of one of the main suggestions of the report, that concerning the non-negotiability of certain questions. Bill 59 is derived also from the philosophy of the report, except that it provides for a more flexible framework of collective bargaining and delimitation of essential services than that suggested by the Commission. In conclusion, the author postulates questions concerning three particular aspects of the new criteria:— the long-run consequences of the considerable governmental control over <b>collective</b> bargaining ;— the <b>scheduling</b> of negotiations ;— the maintaining of essential services. The author concludes that the recent legislative changes are designed to bring the parties to function according to basic but minimal guidelines. As a result, it is the attitudes of these parties that will determine the practical functioning of the System...|$|R
40|$|From the four-thousand-year {{obsession}} with timber structures to the radical fascination {{of steel and}} glass in recent decades, in a Westerner's eye, Chinese architecture evolves either too slow or too fast. The current construction boom may seem parallel to Mao's Great Leap Forward in late 1950 s, when the entire nation was taking radical action for socialist industrialization; this time, it is capitalist modernization. A polarized situation surfaces as some architects are willing to align {{with the government and}} drastically transform their architecture {{to keep up with the}} movement, while others are urging for an effort to connect the past and the present, so that traditions can continue to evolve along with technological advancement. Theories of modern Chinese architecture have birthed mainly from this debate. The struggle with modernization began almost a century ago. After the fall of the Imperial Qing in 1911, foreign architects and local designers with Western academic backgrounds introduced formalism, functionalism, modernism, and traditionalism into the siheyuans (traditional courtyard houses) and imperial palaces of the capital city. The quest for a consciously "modern Chinese" architecture began. In the 1950 s, China underwent a huge phase of reshaping along with the ascendancy of communism. The communist government adopted Soviet models to make Beijing a paradigm for social realism. They brought down ancient infrastructures and historical buildings to make way for monuments, worker apartments, and public squares. They advocated the idea of "national form and socialist content" to derive a new architecture. From the 1980 s on, Beijing and the entire nation began to enjoy the first-ever continuous twenty-five years of undisrupted time on urban and social development since the turning of the twentieth century. Under the open-door economic reform, the authorities began to transform Beijing into a cosmopolitan. The capital city was to perform not only as a showcase for political stability, but also to express the national image, values, and beliefs. They attempted to retain the tradition of Chinese order on one hand, and to welcome capitalist commodities and foreign technologies on the other. Citizens remain proud of their four-thousand-year heritage but are also overwhelmed by materialistic luxury from the economic boom. To the authorities, erasure of Beijing's physical past becomes legitimate under the reconstruction of selected heritage buildings and a rapid urban development. Contemporary architecture in Beijing represents the chaotic phenomenon of today?s China. Bounded by its ghosted city wall, the rapidly changing capital epitomizes the conflict between the old and new. Pressures upon the shoulders of the local architects remain strong: political and economic constraints, legacies of the past, ambition to catch up with the world, and the urge of self-rediscovery in the globalized stage. What is the reality behind the ambition to catch up with the developed world? Is the desire to become modern and at the same time maintain their traditions only a curl-de-sac that leads to nowhere? This thesis is a quest to revaluate the evolution of Chinese architecture from the classical Chinese curved-roof buildings to modern designs. In the making of modern Chinese architecture, a number of ideologies arise, along with political makeovers and societal developments, aiming to re-present past glories, to reflect present national achievements, and to reveal the dream of a utopian future. However, real living always comes second to political ideals on how the society should look and what they should head toward. The concern for humanity remains a nominal criterion after politics and economy in most of the construction projects. This thesis focuses on a two-and-a-half-month journey in northern China. The journey is recorded in the form of a travelogue, which provides the narrative core of the thesis. In addition, the thesis includes academic research on Chinese architecture, embodied in four essays, to investigate its evolution, understand its relationship to the past, acknowledge its current dilemma, and search for the components that make up its identity for the twenty-first century. This thesis aims to give a sense of Chinese architectural development, both in theory and in practice, as well as including a collection of critical remarks on how the authorities manipulate architectural expressions and direct its development. The first two essays deal with urban symbolism in Beijing that the authorities have created to redefine the past and to construct an image of a bright future. Architects are only required to carry out duties, like civil servants, to realize governmental plans. The other two aim to make a contribution to the history of cultural fusion between China and the West, and the evolution of architectural theories that led to the current phenomenon, respectively. The former traces the evolutionary path of Chinese architecture and the latter compiles the concepts of Chinese architecture from the study of Chinese architecture to the realization of the buildings. 	 My journey begins with an exploration of ancient architecture in the provinces of Shanxi and Hebei, following the footsteps of architectural scholar Liang Sicheng. Liang and his team documented and studied 2, 783 ancient buildings across the nation and wrote the first complete history on Chinese architecture. He then attempted to derive the principles of modern Chinese architecture from traditional essences. The Shanxi-Hebei experience enriched my knowledge in traditional Chinese architecture and showed me what had tempted the Chinese architects not to give up their traditions, despite a strong desire to move toward modernization. My experience in Beijing, on the other hand, provided me the opportunity to understand the dilemma of Chinese architects of the twentieth century as they faced political pressures, economic restrictions, tense construction <b>schedules,</b> <b>collective</b> ideologies, and historical legacies. Their works play a crucial role of linking the contemporary with the traditional past, and unfolding possibilities to develop modern Chinese architecture. The quest for Chinese identity in architecture in the past few generations has imposed a complex layering of the urban structure of the city, which makes the capital a showcase for architectural ideologies of different eras. In the current rapid "Manhattanization", Beijing has become an experimental ground for foreign futuristic ideas, as well as an open-air museum of imperial and socialist glories. The identity of the city is completely shaped by authorities and developers under a blindfold desire to pursue a global representation of modernization. Local architects receive little chance, time, and freedom to find their own path, make their own architecture, and develop their own profession. Societal criticisms remain scarce and creativity is limited by self-censorship. Yet, like their predecessors in the 1930 s and 1950 s, contemporary architects do not give up. Many of them still search for new design possibilities within the influences of traditions to innovations, and from local philosophies to Western ideologies. Although the pace of construction remains unbelievably fast in China, the development of local architecture struggles to find ways to evolve and express its societal significance. The maturity of the architectural profession remains an aspect that is unachievable through overnight transformations and one-time planning...|$|R
