5|$|Small <b>conical</b> tentaculitids are {{commonly}} found in the Chittenango Member.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or <b>conical</b> fit. In <b>conical</b> fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of <b>conical</b> fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{as part of}} the Tawani Foundation 2008 Antarctic International Expedition (see below), Dale Andersen and Ian Hawes {{discovered}} <b>conical</b> stromatolites {{growing in}} Lake Untersee, the largest living ones known to date. Small microbial pinnacles are also present, and it appears that the large <b>conical</b> stromatolites and the small pinnacles are made by different microbial communities. These communities provide an important analog to some of the oldest fossil stromatolites found to date.|$|E
5|$|Strobilomyces foveatus is {{a little-known}} species of fungus in the Boletaceae family. It was first {{reported}} by mycologist E.J.H. Corner in 1972, from specimens he collected in Malaysia in 1959, {{and has since}} been found in Australia. Fruit bodies are characterized by the small dark brown to black <b>conical</b> scales covering the cap, and the net-like pattern of ridges on the upper stem. The roughly spherical spores measure about eight micrometres, and are densely covered with slender <b>conical</b> spines. The edibility of this species is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The ao dai can be {{worn with}} a nón lá (<b>conical</b> leaf hat), a style {{associated}} with Huế. On weddings and other formal occasions, a circular headgear called a khăn đóng is worn.|$|E
5|$|The variety carpophila is {{characterized}} by its tiny white cap up to 1mm in diameter, and narrowly <b>conical</b> caulocystidia (cystidia found on the stem).|$|E
5|$|Three {{distinct}} {{types of}} archers are shown on Trajan's Column: (a) with scalar cuirass, <b>conical</b> steel helmet and cloak; (b) without armour, with cloth <b>conical</b> cap and long tunic; or (c) equipped {{in the same}} way as general auxiliary foot-soldiers (apart from carrying bows instead of javelins). The first type were probably Syrian or Anatolian units; the third type probably Thracian. The standard bow used by Roman auxilia was the recurved composite bow, a sophisticated, compact and powerful weapon.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} Entoloma murrayi include the bright yellow coloring, the <b>conical</b> cap, cube-shaped spores, and club-shaped cheilocystidia. Entoloma quadratum {{is similar in}} size and morphology, but is colored salmon-orange. E.murrayi has the habit and form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe (such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor), {{but it can be}} readily distinguished from those by its salmon-pink spore print, non-waxy gills, and the angular shape of its spores. Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color, with a less distinctly pointed umbo. The South American species E.dennisii, originally misidentified as E.murrayi, can be distinguished from the latter by its less <b>conical</b> cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5.5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|Finches are {{seed-eating}} passerine {{birds that}} are small to moderately large {{and have a}} strong beak, usually <b>conical</b> and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well.|$|E

5|$|From 600,000 to 400,000years ago, eruptions built a large <b>conical</b> {{stratovolcano}} called Mount Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano) {{in what is}} now {{the southwest}} corner of the park. It was made of roughly alternating layers of andesitic lavas and tephra (volcanic ash, breccia, and pumice) with increasing amounts of tephra with elevation.|$|E
5|$|In 1064, {{following}} the Seljuk conquest of Ani, the cathedral was {{converted into a}} mosque. It later returned to being used as an Armenian church. It eventually suffered damage in a 1319 earthquake when its <b>conical</b> dome collapsed. Subsequently, Ani was gradually abandoned and the church fell into disuse. The north-western corner of the church was heavily damaged by a 1988 earthquake.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Armoured Directorate of the Red Army (ABTU RKKA) {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a new <b>conical</b> turret for the T-26 similar to the BT-7's turret and to arm it with the 76.2mm L-10 tank gun. Engineers of the Factory No. 174 felt it was impossible to implement this project because it would lead to a significant overload of T-26's chassis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) of the Ellwood House, the {{circular}} limestone water tower is about 50 feet (15.2 m) tall {{and has a}} diameter of 18 feet (5.5 m). The tower has windows occurring at different levels, which are arched and include keystones in their design. The water tower was built in 1879, {{the same year as}} Ellwood House, and at that time the structure was topped with a wooden water tank with a <b>conical</b> roof. Between 1897 and 1910 the wooden tank was removed and replaced with an additional 30 courses of stone which matched the original structure. The arched door {{at the base of the}} water tower was replaced with a larger square-shaped double door. The roof remained <b>conical</b> and of wood construction until about 1950 when it was replaced with sheet metal.|$|E
5|$|Seed-eating {{passerine}} {{birds that}} are small to moderately large {{and have a}} strong beak, usually <b>conical</b> and in some species very large. There are about 176 species worldwide, 13 {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Slate Yorkshire Square brewing vessels {{were used}} at the brewery from 1913 until 1975. Stainless steel Yorkshire Squares were in use by at least 1953, but were removed in the 1980s, and the brewery now uses <b>conical</b> tanks. By 1953, the brewery site {{occupied}} 20 acres.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1938: new <b>conical</b> turret, {{small changes}} in hull parts, {{increased}} volume of fuel tanks. Tank gun mod. 1937 and mod. 1938 were equipped with an electric breechblock and a vertically stabilized TOP-1 telescopic sight (or a TOS telescopic sight on the 1938 model).|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1939 (T-26-1): underturret {{box with}} sloped {{armoured}} plates, rear machine gun removed on some tanks, 97hp engine. Tanks built after 1940 were {{equipped with an}} underturret box made from 20mm homogeneous armour, a unified observation device, and a new turret ring. Some tanks were equipped with armoured screens. About 1,975 T-26 tanks with a <b>conical</b> turret (T-26 mod. 1938, T-26 mod. 1939) were produced.|$|E
5|$|The <b>conical</b> hill of {{clay and}} Blue Lias {{rises from the}} Somerset Levels. It was formed when {{surrounding}} softer deposits were eroded, leaving the hard cap of sandstone exposed. The slopes of the hill are terraced, but the method by which they were formed remains unexplained. Artefacts from human visitation have been found, dating from the Iron Age to Roman eras.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} {{feature in}} this area of the Mendip Hills south of Hallatrow consists of Supra-Pennant Measures which includes the upper coal measures and outcrops of sandstone. The relics of the industrial past are very evident within the area, including the distinct <b>conical</b> shape of the Old Mills batch overlooking the town.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} feature {{south of}} Hallatrow consists of Supra-Pennant Measures {{which include the}} upper coal measures and outcrops of sandstone. Relics of its industrial past {{are evident in the}} area, including the highly visible and distinct <b>conical</b> shaped Old Mills Batch with its generally unvegetated surface. The three disused colliery sites have been developed for light industry, a depot and a superstore.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of the {{building}} is a distinctive <b>conical</b> shape with a spiral walkway and large atrium inside, similar to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. Galleries lead off the walkway, mainly consisting of interactive exhibits aimed at science education.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its <b>conical</b> cap has a surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate. Other similar species include P.hadriani, {{which has a}} purple volva, P.macrosporus, which has a reddish volva, and P.formanosus, which has a pale pink stipe and volva.|$|E
5|$|The present château {{with its}} five <b>conical</b> towers and watchtower capped by slate roofs {{began to be}} built in the 15th century, and was altered and {{extended}} several times since then. A park was built in the 19th century through which a wide driveway brought visitors to the main building. This is based on a central square tower with a pyramidal roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{top of the}} egg is {{depressed}} and forms a small central cavity called micropyle through which the egg is fertilised. The micropyle is situated on top in eggs which are globular, <b>conical,</b> or cylindrical; in those eggs which are flattened or lenticular, the micropyle {{is located on the}} outer margin or rim.|$|E
5|$|The weavers {{are small}} {{passerine}} birds {{related to the}} finches. They are seed-eating birds with rounded <b>conical</b> bills. The males of many species are brightly colored, usually in red or yellow and black. Some species show variation in color only in the breeding season. One species has been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|A silver cross {{originally}} {{stood on}} its <b>conical</b> dome and a crystal chandelier, bought by King Smbat II from India, {{hang in the}} cathedral. In the 1010s, {{during the reign of}} Catholicos Sarkis I, a mausoleum dedicated to the Hripsimean virgins was erected next to the cathedral. The mausoleum was built on some of the remnants of the virgins brought from Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). In the 1040s–1050s inscriptions were left on the cathedral's eastern and western walls about urban projects, such as restoration of defensive walls, installation of water pipes and easing of the tax burden on the residents of Ani.|$|E
