40|$|AbstractA {{class of}} {{modified}} extended backward differentiation formulae (MEBDF) {{suitable for the}} approximate numerical integration of first order systems of stiff ordinary differential equations is introduced. The computational aspects of this new class of formulae are examined in detail. In particular, algorithms for varying both order and stepsize are given and {{this leads to a}} variable step/variable order process using highly stable formulae of order 2 – 8. Extensive numerical results for the well known DETEST set are given and on this basis a comparison is made between a code incorporating MEBDF, a code due to Hindmarsh (based on conventional backward differentiation formulae) and a code due to Skeel and Kong (based on blended linear multistep methods). It is shown that on this test set the MEBDF code is very reliable and is competitive with the other two codes on a significant class of problems.

40|$|Recently the {{determination}} of the best technique for numerically solving systems of ordinary differential equations on a digital computer has received much attention. The use of these formulas in conjunction with a stepsize control developed is explained, and one of the formulas is chosen for comparison with other integration techniques. This comparison of one of the best of Fehlberg's formulas with the different numerical techniques described in previous studies on a variety of test problems clearly shows the superiority of Fehlberg's formula. That is, on each of the test problems, the chosen Fehlberg formula is able to achieve a given accuracy in less computer time {{than any of the other}} techniques tested. Also, the computer program for the chosen Fehlberg formula is less complex and easier to use than the computer programs for most of the other techniques.

40|$|A modAl is {{developed}} {{to describe the}} sulfur dioxide and particulate air pollution characteristics of a fossil fueled steam electric power plant. The model contains three stages. The first considers boiler emissions {{and the application of}} one of four parameterized abatement methods: wet limestone scrubbing, catalytic oxidation, magnesium oxide scrubbing, and the use of tall stacks. The second stage tests stack emissions and uses meteorological dispersion models, particularly the double gaussian model, to determine and test three hour, twenty-four hour and annual worst case ground level concentrations. The third stage calculates the performance of the abatement method used in terms of economics and resource costs. The model can be used to determine feasible combinations of plant types, site types and abatement methods as support for a separate generation expansion model. It can also be used independently to study environmental and economic sensitivities to changes in air pollution standards. General descriptions of the operation of the abatement methods and explanations of meteorological modeling are included.

40|$|This book {{is written}} for {{students}} and researchers with {{a keen interest in}} the quantification of the field soil water balance in tropical environments and the effect of conservation farming on crop production. Part 1 deals with the potential production, i. e. crop growth under ample supply of water nutrients in a pest-, disease- and weed-free environment. Part 2 deals with crop production under rainfed or water-limited conditions by including the crop water balance as well as the soil water balance. Both models use maize as an example. The way the MAIZE models are presented differs from the modular structure of present day models, where separate data blocks for soil, crop and climate are added {{at the end of a}} main programme.

Subsequently, the terminology is justified and the input data and the dimensions of variables are explained. Another special feature is the fact that parameter and function values are defined directly after the line in which they are used for the first time. This method highlights the places where the model needs input from the user. In this way it is stressed that the accuracy of the model depends on the availability and quality of the input data, together with the correct understanding and description of the processes involved.

40|$|The world {{shipping}} freight {{market for}} the transportation of bulk cargo - liquid and dry - is characterised by the somewhat erratic and extreme fluctuations exhibited {{by many of the}} measures {{that can be used to}} describe the "state" of the market. Such 'measures' include the spot freight rates - the cost to the shipper of chartering a unit of shipping capacity 'on the spot' (that is, not reserving the vessel in advance), - the proportion of chartered tonnage at any time taken on a period (time) basis as opposed to a voyage (single) basis, and the rate at which orders for new vessels reach the shipyards. These factors are extremely variable, and have exhibited a similar form of behaviour for a large number of years. This present thesis describes an attempt to investigate the behaviour of the freight market (bulk cargo); the aim of the investigation being to identify the structure of the market system and to construct a System Dynamics model which describes the complex relationships in the market and which can be used to explore questions relating to present or future market behaviour. The construction of such a model is described, together with an exhaustive chapter on the analysis of the model, covering loop-analysis, the behaviour of the model under various test inputs, and the senstivity of the model to significant changes in parameter values. The final chapter considers the use of the model, and, in particular, describes its use in an investigation of the feasibility or desirability of introducing tonnagestabilization schemes into the market. Such schemes aim to prevent the freight rates from falling to unacceptably low values, by implementing a scheme whereby tonnage is withdrawn from operation and laid-up: the decrease in the supply of tonnage then has a positive influence on the freight rates. It is concluded that the problems involved in designing such schemes preclude the schemes from implementation. The appendices cover the various data used in the determination of market relationships, as well as the <b>computer</b> <b>listing,</b> in Fortran, of the market model. Also included in an appendix is a description of the application of System Dynamics to a hypothetical company. The tcompany model' allows for the examination of chartering policies and lay-up policies under a variety of conditions of market demand...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} models for ordered {{categorical}} responses {{have appeared in}} the statistical literature over the past few decades. Many of these models are based on a latent variable approach in which the underlying random variable follows a continuous probability distribution. The exact value of the underlying random variable is not observed; rather, it is only known that the response occurred in one of several mutually exclusive categories. Such models are referred to as logit, or logistic regression models when an underlying logistic distribution is used;Statistical analyses with logistic regression models are straightforward when the categorical responses are assumed to be independent. Relaxation of the independence assumption allows for inclusion {{of a wide variety of}} practical applications, but appropriate models have not been thoroughly developed. Most of the research on correlated categorical responses has been confined to the development of conditional and mixed models;An alternative approach taken in this dissertation is a multivariate latent variable approach. In particular, correlated categorical responses will be considered to have arisen from the categorization of an underlying multivariate logistic random variable. This approach is a multivariate extension of the usual univariate logistic regression model; in fact, it provides a logistic regression model for each univariate margin. A major advantage of this approach is that the model parameters can be interpreted with respect to the influence of the regression variables on the univariate marginal distribution of each single response. Conditional and mixed models, on the other hand, permit only conditional interpretations of parameters;Included in the first paper is a specification of a new bivariate logistic distribution. This distribution is applied to the analysis of bivariate ordered categorical responses. A listing of the computer program developed for this analysis is given in Appendix C. In the second paper a bivariate logistic regression model is developed and illustrated and is based on the aforementioned bivariate logistic distribution. A <b>computer</b> <b>listing</b> for this model is found in Appendix D. The third paper includes a generalization of one of Gumbel 2 ̆ 7 s bivariate logistic distributions. A new multivariate uniform distribution is derived in the fourth paper and is used to specify a multivariate logistic distribution. It is shown that the pairwise correlations can range between zero and one and are, in general, not equal. The asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators for product multinomial models is established in Appendix A. Finally, a simple expression for the Fisher information matrix arising from a product multinomial likelihood function is derived in Appendix B...|$|E
