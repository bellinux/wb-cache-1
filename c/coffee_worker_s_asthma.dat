METHODS: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} in a Tanzanian coffee curing factory. <b>Coffee</b> <b>workers</b> (n = 15) were compared with unexposed controls (n = 18); all workers were nonsmokers.

RESULTS: Total dust levels ranged from 0. 2 to 27. 9 mg/m, and endotoxin levels ranged from 42 to 75, 083 endotoxin units/m. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide, analyzed by linear regression and adjusted for age (β = 0. 57; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 08 to 1. 06; P = 0. 02), was higher among <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> than among the control group.

40|$|Abstract Background Coffee {{processing}} causes {{organic dust}} exposure which {{may lead to}} development of respiratory symptoms. Previous studies have mainly focused on workers involved in roasting coffee in importing countries. This study was carried out to determine total dust exposure and respiratory health of workers in Tanzanian primary coffee-processing factories. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among 79 <b>workers</b> in two <b>coffee</b> factories, and among 73 control workers in a beverage factory. Personal samples of total dust (n = 45 from the coffee factories and n = 19 from the control factory) were collected throughout the working shift from the breathing zone of the workers. A questionnaire with modified questions from the American Thoracic Society questionnaire {{was used to assess}} chronic respiratory symptoms. Differences between groups were tested by using independent t-tests and Chi square tests. Poisson Regression Model was used to estimate prevalence ratio, adjusting for age, smoking, presence of previous lung diseases and years worked in dusty factories. Results All participants were male. The <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> had a mean age of 40 years and were older than the controls (31 years). Personal total dust exposure in the coffee factories were significantly higher than in the control factory (geometric mean (GM) 1. 23 mg/m 3, geometric standard deviation (GSD) (0. 8) vs. 0. 21 (2. 4) mg/m 3). <b>Coffee</b> <b>workers</b> had significantly higher prevalence than controls for cough with sputum (23 % vs. 10 %; Prevalence ratio (PR); 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 9) and chest tightness (27 % vs. 13 %; PR; 2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 5. 2). The prevalence of morning cough, cough with and without sputum for 4 days or more in a week was also higher among <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> than among controls. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion <b>Workers</b> exposed to <b>coffee</b> dust reported more respiratory symptoms than did the controls. This might relate to their exposure to coffee dust. Interventions for reduction of dust levels and provision of respiratory protective equipment are recommended. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Exposure {{to organic}} dust may cause {{detrimental}} effects to the respiratory system of exposed workers. Organic dust is commonly contaminated with microbes and their derivatives such as bacteria and endotoxin, fungi, moulds and beta glucan. Few studies on exposure and health effects {{have been performed}} in primary coffee factories. The studies showed that processes in primary coffee factories cause emission of high dust levels. Work in coffee factories {{has been associated with}} respiratory health impairment. Coffee beans are of two main types; Arabica and Robusta. Before coffee is brought to the factory it is processed at the farm. At the farms the harvested Robusta coffee cherries are mostly dried under the sun (called dry pre-processing) while Arabica coffee cherries are depulped using water (called wet pre-process) and then dried as parchment coffee. At the end of harvest season, remaining Arabica coffee cherries are dried without being depulped (dry processed). The processes in primary coffee factories involves the pre-cleaning of coffee beans, the mechanical removal of the mesocarp and endocarp layers to get green coffee beans (GCB), the grading of the GCB, mixing them to produce a homogenous mixture by a process known as bulking and then packing in 60 kg bags. Loading and unloading of unprocessed coffee (parchment or coffee cherries) is done manually. For some processes, the machines are fed manually by production workers. Objective: The aim of this research was to determine dust exposure levels and to assess respiratory health of the production workers in Robusta and Arabica primary coffee factories. Materials and Methods: The research was conducted in Tanzania (in the Kilimanjaro and Kagera regions) in four primary coffee factories (factories; A, B, C and D) in three studies (in 2008 2009, and 2010). In the first study (2008) personal total dust (n= 44) was sampled at a rate of 2 L/min from the breathing zone of the worker using side kick Casella pumps connected to closed-faced 25 mm conductive cassettes fitted with cellulose acetate filters. The samples were analysed gravimetrically. In addition, five samples were taken on glass fibre filters as pilot samples for analysis of endotoxin. We also assessed respiratory symptoms using an American Thoracic Society (ATS) standardized questionnaire among the production workers (n= 79) in comparison with a control group from a beverage factory (n= 71). In the second and third studies personal total dust (n= 149) was sampled by same methods as in 2008, using closed-faced 37 mm plastic cassettes which were fitted with polycarbonate filters. Dust samples were gravimetrically measured and further analysed for endotoxin. Airway inflammation was assessed using NIOX MINO device in both studies. In the third study, lung function and respiratory symptoms were assessed among production workers (n= 138) in four primary coffee factories and two control factories (n= 120). A portable spirometer was used for lung function testing. Results: Personal total dust levels ranged from 0. 25 to 36 mg/m³; geometric mean GM = 2. 50 mg/m³. Seventeen per cent of the samples were above the occupational exposure limit. There was a high correlation between total dust and endotoxin (r = 0. 62). Endotoxin levels were higher when processing dry pre-processed coffee (mainly Robusta GM= 10, 800 EU/m³) than when processing wet pre-processed Arabica (GM= 1, 350 EU/m³). All endotoxin samples exceeded the health-based recommended value of 90 EU/m³. Using a mixed model analysis dry pre-processing was shown to increase the total dust and endotoxin levels by a factor of 2. 5 and 7. 2, respectively. Chronic respiratory symptoms were higher among <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> than controls. Having at least one asthma symptom was higher among the <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> compared to controls with odds ratio (OR) of 4. 3 (95 % CI; 1. 9 – 9. 9). Robusta <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> had higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (38 %) than Arabica <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> (12 %) (OR; 3. 5, 95 % CI; 1. 4 – 9. 0). Lung function parameters were not significantly different between <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> and controls. Nevertheless, in a linear regression model, controlling for age, height and type of coffee, there was a decrease in FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC ratio related to an increase in cumulative total dust and endotoxin. In second study (2009) <b>coffee</b> <b>workers</b> had higher FENO levels than the controls, however, this was not found in the subsequent year 2010. Conclusion: This study revealed that work in coffee factory is associated with high dust and endotoxin exposure which may be associated with impairment of respiratory health. Processing dry pre-processed coffee increases the exposure levels significantly. Reduction of dust exposure is recommended. </p...|$|R

MethodsWe interviewed 75 (88 %) workers, measured lung function, and created exposure {{groups based on}} work history. We calculated standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) for symptoms and spirometric abnormalities. We examined health outcomes by exposure groups. ResultsSMRs were elevated 1. 6 -fold for dyspnea and 2. 7 -fold for obstruction. The exposure group working in both coffee flavoring and grinding/packaging of unflavored coffee areas had significantly lower mean ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity and percent predicted mid-expiratory flow than workers without such exposure.
