25|$|However, in planar graphs, the Maximum-Cut Problem is dual to {{the route}} {{inspection}} problem (the problem {{of finding a}} shortest tour that visits each edge of a graph at least once), {{in the sense that}} the edges that do not belong to a maximum <b>cut-set</b> of a graph G are the duals of the edges that are doubled in an optimal inspection tour of the dual graph of G. The optimal inspection tour forms a self-intersecting curve that separates the plane into two subsets, the subset of points for which the winding number of the curve is even and the subset for which the winding number is odd; these two subsets form a cut that includes all of the edges whose duals appear an odd number of times in the tour. The route inspection problem may be solved in polynomial time, and this duality allows the maximum cut problem to also be solved in polynomial time for planar graphs. The Maximum-Bisection problem is known however to be NP-hard.|$|E

40|$|Let G = (V,E) be a planar n-vertex digraph. Consider {{the problem}} of {{computing}} max st-flow values in G from a fixed source s to all sinks t in V{s. We show how {{to solve this problem}} in near-linear O(n log^ 3 n) time. Previously, no better solution was known than running a single-source single-sink max flow algorithm n- 1 times, giving a total time bound of O(n^ 2 log n) with the algorithm of Borradaile and Klein. An important implication is that all-pairs max st-flow values in G can be computed in near-quadratic time. This is close to optimal as the output size is Theta(n^ 2). We give a quadratic lower bound on the number of distinct max flow values and an Omega(n^ 3) lower bound for the total size of all min <b>cut-sets.</b> This distinguishes the problem from the undirected case where the number of distinct max flow values is O(n). Previous to our result, no algorithm which could solve the all-pairs max flow values problem faster than the time of Theta(n^ 2) max-flow computations for every planar digraph was known. This result is accompanied with a data structure that reports min <b>cut-sets.</b> For fixed s and all t, after O(n^ 3 / 2 log^ 3 / 2 n) preprocessing time, it can report the set of arcs C crossing a min st-cut in time roughly proportional to the size of C.

40|$|Abstract: Classical Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) can {{determine}} the effects of combinations of failure events on a system but cannot capture the potentially critical significance of the temporal ordering of events. In this paper, we propose a temporal extension based on the use of Priority-AND gates to allow relative temporal ordering and temporal analysis in FTA. The classical notion of minimal <b>cut-sets</b> is replaced with the notion of minimal cutsequences and a methodology is proposed for qualitative analysis. The approach is demonstrated on a generic two stage standby recovery system. The paper tentatively concludes that this type of temporal FTA can provide a more precise and ultimately more correct insight into the failure behaviour of a system. Copyright © 2006 IFA...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis book {{presents}} {{some recent}} developments of probabilistic assessment of systems dependability based on stochastic models issued of graph theory, finite state automaton and language theory, applying {{as well for}} static as for dynamic and hybrid context.

An algorithm with lower complexity than classical approach (BDD decomposition for example) is proposed and extended to apply as well to non coherent systems by introducing the concept of terminal tie-set. In the second part, we introduce the model of finite state automaton to more generally represent systems and replace the concepts of <b>cut-sets</b> and tie-sets by the concept of event sequences. The model is enriched progressively to define hybrid stochastic automaton that allows considering all of the problems usually assembled around the concept of dynamic reliability.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} limits of {{communication}} efficiency for function computation in collocated networks {{within the framework of}} multi-terminal block source coding theory. With the goal of computing a desired function of sources at a sink, nodes interact with each other through a sequence of error-free, network-wide broadcasts of finite-rate messages. For any function of independent sources, we derive a computable characterization of the set of all feasible message coding rates- the rate region-in terms of single-letter information measures. We show that when computing symmetric functions of binary sources, the sink will inevitably learn certain additional information which is not demanded in computing the function. This conceptual understanding leads to new improved bounds for the minimum sum-rate. The new bounds are shown to be orderwise better than those based on <b>cut-sets</b> as the network scales. The scaling law of the minimum sum-rate is explored for different classes of symmetric functions and source parameters. I...|$|R

To overcome this issue, we consider the problem of designing the network to meet the reliability requirements while minimizing the network cost. Therefore, we propose two greedy iterative heuristics and a heuristic integer linear programming (H-ILP) model using minimum <b>cut-sets</b> for network reliability optimization. The greedy iterative algorithms outperform the H-ILP approach in terms of cost, but require a larger amount of computing resources. Both proposed models are in fact complementary and thus provide a framework to optimize the reliability of smart grid communications networks...|$|R
