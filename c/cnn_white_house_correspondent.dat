5000|$|Donald Trump {{called the}} dossier [...] "fake news" [...] and criticized the {{intelligence}} and media sources that published it.

Trump refused to answer a question from <b>CNN's</b> senior <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> Jim Acosta on the subject. In response, CNN said that it had published [...] "carefully sourced reporting" [...] on the matter which had been [...] "matched by the other major news organizations", as opposed to BuzzFeed's posting of [...] "unsubstantiated materials". James Clapper described the leaks as damaging to US national security. This also contradicted Trump's previous claim that Clapper said the information was false; Clapper's statement actually said the intelligence community has made no judgement on the truth or falsity of the information.|$|R

They're people who post videos on YouTube," [...] sarcastically adding, [...] "I'm just curious: Was 'Charlie Bit My Finger' or 'David After Dentist' not available?" [...] In response to Acosta, Hank tweeted, [...] "I think sometimes we need to think about how to involve people who are not reached by legacy media in the conversation. That's all." [...] Acosta subsequently replied, [...] "No sense of humor @hankgreen? Totally agree. Good luck." [...] John then defended Hank via a Tumblr post.
