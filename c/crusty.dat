5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with <b>crusty</b> bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|In late 1809, while {{mourning}} {{the death of}} his 17-year-old fiancée Matilda Hoffman, Irving completed work on his first major book, A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809), a satire on self-important local history and contemporary politics. Prior to its publication, Irving started a hoax akin to today's viral marketing campaigns; he placed a series of missing person advertisements in New York newspapers seeking information on Diedrich Knickerbocker, a <b>crusty</b> Dutch historian who had allegedly gone missing from his hotel in New York City. As part of the ruse, Irving placed a notice—allegedly from the hotel's proprietor—informing readers that if Mr. Knickerbocker failed to return to the hotel to pay his bill, he would publish a manuscript Knickerbocker had left behind.|$|E

5|$|Peniophora quercina is {{a species}} of wood-decay fungus in the family Peniophoraceae. The species {{produces}} fruit bodies which vary in appearance depending on whether they are wet or dry. The wet fruit bodies are waxy and lilac, and attached strongly to the wood. When dry, the edges curl up and reveal the dark underside, while the surface becomes <b>crusty</b> and pink. P.quercina is the type species of Peniophora, and {{was moved to the}} genus upon its creation by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species is found primarily in Europe, where it can be encountered all year. Though primarily growing upon dead wood, especially oak, it is also capable of growing upon still-living wood.|$|E
5|$|Homer ignores {{his studies}} and instead focuses on his preconceived notions of college life through {{adolescent}} movies and TV shows, {{such as the}} fictional The School of Hard Knockers, which stereotype college life as pranks, partying and rigid deans. He also insults the college dean, Dean Peterson, believing {{him to be a}} <b>crusty,</b> conservative administrator. In reality, Peterson relates well with the students and is relatively young. Homer acts like a know-it-all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a proton accelerator operates; consequently, he causes a nuclear meltdown in class. Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor. The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course, but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A University. The prank involves kidnapping the other school's mascot, a pig named Sir Oinks-a-lot. However, Homer causes the pig to become very ill after feeding it malt liquor, and Benjamin, Doug, and Gary are blamed for the incident.|$|E
5|$|Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) is the 15-year-old {{daughter}} of Somayya (Ramachandriah Marikanti), a poor, low caste fisherman from rural Andhra Pradesh. Somayya struggles {{to support his}} family due to dwindling catches at sea and mounting debts. One day, Vanaja and her teenage friend Lacchi (Bhavani Renukunta) watch a theatrical performance by a former Kuchipudi (a native classical Indian dance form) great, Rama Devi (Urmila Dammannagari). The sequence of events lead to a soothsayer predicting to Vanaja {{that she will be}} a great dancer. With permission from her father, she goes to work in the house of the local landlady Rama Devi with the hope of learning Kuchipudi. While she is employed as a farmhand, she is entrusted with tending the chickens. When she gets caught playfully chasing them, she lies to conceal her pranks. Her vivaciousness and spunk soon catch the landlady’s eye. To keep her out of trouble, Rama Devi soon promotes her to a kitchen underhand where she meets Rama Devi’s cook, the old, <b>crusty</b> and extremely loyal Radhamma (Krishnamma Gundimalla).|$|E

25|$|The Tupolev Tu-134 (NATO {{reporting}} name: <b>Crusty)</b> is a twin-engined, narrow-body, jet airliner {{built in}} the Soviet Union from 1966 to 1989. The original version featured a glazed-nose design and, like certain other Russian airliners (including its sister model the Tu-154), it can operate from unpaved airfields.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{were noted}} between the {{characters}} {{on the radio}} and TV versions of Gunsmoke. In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholic—at least in the program's early years. On radio's Gunsmoke, Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore. He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still <b>crusty,</b> was in many ways softer and warmer.|$|E

25|$|While {{appearing}} in television films and guest roles on television series {{over the next}} 10 years, Griffith also appeared in two feature films, both of which flopped at the box office. He co-starred with Jeff Bridges as a <b>crusty</b> old 1930s western actor in the comedy Hearts of the West (1975), and he appeared alongside Tom Berenger as a gay villainous colonel and cattle baron in the Western comedy spoof Rustlers' Rhapsody (1985).|$|E
25|$|In {{the feature}} film Waitress (2007), Griffith played a <b>crusty</b> diner owner {{who takes a}} shine to Keri Russell's character. His last {{appearance}} was the {{leading role in the}} romantic comedy, independent film Play the Game (2009) as a lonely, widowed grandfather re-entering the dating world after a 60-year hiatus. The cast of Play the Game also included Rance Howard, Ron Howard's real-life father, who had made appearances in various supporting roles on The Andy Griffith Show, and Clint Howard, Ron's younger brother, who had the recurring role of Leon (the kid offering the ice cream cone or peanut butter sandwich) on The Andy Griffith Show.|$|E
25|$|Larval {{invasion}} of the skin (mostly in the Americas) can produce a skin disease called cutaneous larva migrans also known as creeping eruption. The hosts of these worms are not human and the larvae can only penetrate the upper five layers of the skin, where they give rise to intense, local itching, usually on the foot or lower leg, known as ground itch. This infection is due to larvae from the A. Braziliense hookworm. The larvae migrate in tortuous tunnels between the stratum basale and stratum corneum of the skin, causing serpiginous vesicular lesions. With advancing movement of the larvae, the rear portions of the lesions become dry and <b>crusty.</b> The lesions are typically intensely itchy.|$|E
50|$|Other {{miscellaneous}} personnel {{include the}} Assistant Director, HUB accountant, Prop Crew (who maintains, guards, and transports show props and equipment), MOM, <b>Crusties</b> (band alumni), and foosball league commissioner. Local artist Alice Tondel served as MOM and began her {{association with the}} HUB in 1949 until her death in 1993.|$|R
50|$|Crust punk {{also has}} an {{associated}} DIY-oriented branch of punk garb. Similar to anarcho-punk, most clothing is black in color. Denim jackets and hooded sweatshirts with sewn-on patches, or vests covered in studs, spikes and band patches are characteristic elements of the crust punk style of dress or pants covered in band patches. <b>Crusties</b> sometimes wear dreadlocks.|$|R
50|$|A medianoche {{consists}} of roast pork, ham, mustard, Swiss cheese, and sweet pickles. It {{is a close}} cousin to the Cuban sandwich, the chief difference being that a medianoche is made on soft, sweet egg dough bread similar to Challah rather than on <b>crustier</b> Cuban bread. Like the Cuban sandwich, the medianoche is typically warmed in a press before eating.|$|R
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{attendance}} at football matches {{is associated with}} the consumption of traditional football foods such as meat pies and Bovril. Food and beverage sales in stadiums can raise high incomes for clubs, and some clubs make attempts to improve their service and diversify out of traditional foods. In Brazil, sanduíche de calabresa (pepperoni sandwich) is a popular meal in the surrounding areas of stadiums. In Mineirão stadium, feijão tropeiro, a typical dish from Minas Gerais, is very common. In Germany, many football fans eat bratwurst and drink beers. In Argentina, choripán (a sandwich with grilled chorizo with <b>crusty</b> bread) and grilled hamburgers are commonly served in stadiums. In the past, a variety of pizza without cheese was served, which is now known as pizza de cancha (“pitch pizza”). In Spain it is very common to eat sunflower seeds during the game. Although not in the whole Bosnia and Herzegovina, but especially in Sarajevo ćevapi are commonly seen to be sold around the stadiums before and after the matches and you can often see people selling pepita and juices in front of the entrance of the stadium and on the stands during the match.|$|E
25|$|IRCR {{introduced}} new vocalist Joey Biro in bold fashion. The {{sound was}} generally heavier than The Prize Recruit but showed a maturity in the songwriting and playing. Biro's emotive vocal style lending {{to a more}} epic version of Superheist's bouncing heavy rock riff style. In July 2003 the band went to America {{for a second time}} with the hope of recapturing the interest lost after September 11. The band played solid shows at the Viper Room and the Roxy and several showcases but failed to get that elusive major International record deal they had come so close to only a year earlier. The dejected members returned to Australia. At this point something clearly changed within the band. After a run of not so successful east coast tours and spot shows late in the year, Superheist was dropped by Step2 Artist management and internal chaos was rife amongst the band. After almost 2 years of solid touring, back to back albums and a lead vocalist change the cracks were starting to appear. The band played all major rock festivals late in 2002 and finished the year with a disastrous New Year's Eve show in Hastings, Victoria. Bassist Drew Dedman, feeling disillusioned after a tumultuous few months, quit the band that night and returned home to North coast NSW refusing to speak to the band for {{the first few months of}} 2003. Nevertheless, the band continued to write and record demos for the third album without a bass player, Norton recorded the bass on the demos during this time. In 2003 (add date) Superheist were asked to play the <b>Crusty</b> Demons of Dirt Nine Lives Tour, after some lengthy discussion the band was able to persuade Dedman to return to Melbourne and rejoin the band for the tour and begin writing and rehearsing again. On 8 August 2003, the band recorded a live set a The Corner Hotel in Richmond, Victoria that was set to be released as their first live album. This gig would later be released as disc 2 of New, rare, Live. Superheist were initially billed to appear at Metal for the Brain on 20 December, however, in October they cancelled their appearance. The band's final tour was in North Queensland during December, the demoing of the new album was taking a long time, failure to get new management on board, inconsistent performances and tensions between Norton and Biro flared to breaking point in the final month of touring. Superheist returned to Melbourne, Biro went AWOL and was eventually fired from the band in January. More demoing was done in early 2004 but to no avail. In February 2004 Norton announced that Superheist had disbanded.|$|E

50|$|Jase and {{his fellow}} laggers {{encounter}} a hitchhiker named Ailiss, whom Jase identifies {{as one of a}} group of New Age Settlers (also known as <b>crusties</b> or bandits), people who foresee the imminent end of modern society and who have retreated to a semi-hidden rural commune. However, their presence worries the authorities, who become concerned about the security of their nuclear-power station.|$|R

50|$|The {{precursor}} of pandesal was pan de suelo ("floor bread"), a local Spanish-Filipino {{version of the}} French baguette baked directly {{on the floor of}} a wood-fired oven (a pugon). It was made with wheat flour and was harder and <b>crustier</b> than pandesal. Since wheat is not natively produced in the Philippines, bakers eventually switched to more affordable inferior flour resulting in the softer, doughy texture of pandesal.|$|R

Smith and Lavington, meanwhile, remarked that Lee was [...] "the very incarnation of Fleming's <b>crusty</b> admiral." ...|$|E

Jeff Branson was also hopeful for the pairing, commending them for bringing out a [...] "different side" [...] of Ronan, describing them as [...] "a chance for him to drop the frosty, <b>crusty</b> exterior he puts on because Chloe really gets under his skin, but in a good way." ...|$|E

50|$|Puerto Rican mofongo {{in keeping}} with the creolized cuisine traditions of the Caribbean tends toward a fufú of much higher density and robust seasoning. While keeping a {{conspicuous}} African character, mofongo has borrowed from the island's Iberian culinary tradition, to create a dish comprised almost exclusively of fried green plantains, with neither yucca nor maize. Unlike the mushier Caribbean and West African fufús, mofongo is generally firmer and <b>crustier.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a very ironic paradox, {{black metal}} and crust punk have {{recently}} started to embrace one another. Members of Darkthrone and Satyricon have lately {{claimed that they}} love punk, while among <b>crusties,</b> black metal is the latest fashion. In fact, the latest album by crust punk band Skitsystem sounds very black metal--while the latest black metal opus by Darkthrone sounds very punk! This would have been unimaginable in the early 90s.|$|R
