5|$|Radner died on 24 March 2015 {{along with}} her husband Sascha Schenk, their two-year-old son Felix, and her {{colleague}} Oleg Bryjak, when Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed near Prads-Haute-Bléone, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. The pilot had a history of depression, had barricaded himself into the <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> steered the plane into the mountains. They were en route to Düsseldorf after Radner's and Bryjak's two performances in Wagner's Siegfried at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|A {{fighter pilot}} based at Andrews Air Force Base, Billy Hutchison, claims that {{while in the}} air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his {{training}} rounds into the engine and <b>cockpit,</b> <b>and</b> then ram the airplane with his own jet. His account was published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed. When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this false claim he stormed {{out of the room and}} refused to give an answer.|$|E

5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in the <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E
5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the Abu Nidal organization, a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the <b>cockpit,</b> <b>and</b> the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as the hijackers did not realize that the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E
5|$|Customize mode {{is divided}} between the F-Zero Shop, Garage, and Emblem Editor. The shop is where {{opponent}} machines, custom parts for vehicle creation, and miscellaneous items such as story mode chapters and staff ghost data can be purchased with tickets. Tickets are acquired as the player progresses through the Grand Prix, Time Attack, and Story mode. In the Garage section, players can create a machine with three custom parts or print emblems on any vehicle. The parts are divided into body, <b>cockpit,</b> <b>and</b> booster categories, and affect the vehicle's overall durability, maximum speed, cornering, and acceleration. The Emblem Editor is a tool-set for decal creation.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{minutes into}} the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people (possibly killing one), {{forcibly}} breached the <b>cockpit,</b> <b>and</b> overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew was no longer responding. They realized the flight had been hijacked when Mohamed Atta's announcements for passengers were transmitted to air traffic control. On board, flight attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong contacted American Airlines, and provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{veterans}} groups {{engaged in}} a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The last survivor of its crew, Theodore Van Kirk, died on July 28, 2014, {{at the age of}} 93.|$|E
5|$|On 29 December 2000, British Airways Flight 2069 was {{en route}} from London to Nairobi when a mentally-ill {{passenger}} entered the <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> grabbed the controls. As the pilots struggled to remove the intruder, the Boeing 747-400 stalled twice and banked to 94 degrees. Several people on board were injured by the violent manoeuvres, which briefly caused the aircraft to descend at 30,000ft per minute. The man was finally restrained {{with the help of}} several passengers, and the co-pilot regained control of the aircraft. The flight landed safely in Nairobi.|$|E

5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Minister is {{revealed}} as a subordinate to Ganondorf, Bowser and Wario {{who are under}} orders from Master Hand to draw the world into Subspace. Wario, who had stolen Ness with his dark cannon, is turned into a trophy by a Pokémon Trainer Red and a vengeful Lucas, and is then helplessly sucked in by a Subspace Bomb. Meanwhile, Meta Knight seeing his ship, the Halberd, being used for evil, leaves his group to reclaim it. He meets and allies with Lucario and Solid Snake, where they reach the <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> destroy the Mr. Game and Watch clones that were piloting it.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E

5|$|The {{airframe}} of the Hunter {{consists of}} six interchangeable major sections: the forward fuselage (housing the <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing {{of the type}} could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from aluminium alloy and carbon fibre composites. The car was fitted with controversial hydropneumatic suspension and water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|The trainer {{version of}} the AV-8B is the TAV-8B, seating two pilots in tandem. Among other changes, the forward {{fuselage}} features a 3ft 11in (1.19m) extension to accommodate the second cockpit. To compensate for the slight loss of directional stability, the vertical stabilizer's area was enlarged through increases in chord (length of the stabilizer's root) and height. USMC TAV-8Bs feature the AV-8B's digital <b>cockpit</b> <b>and</b> new systems, but have only two hardpoints and are not combat capable. Initial TAV-8Bs were powered by a 21,450lbf (95.4kN) F402-RR-406A engine, while later examples were fitted with the 23,000lbf (105.8kN) F402-RR-408A. In the early 2000s, 17 TAV-8Bs were upgraded to include a night-attack capability, the F402-RR-408 engine, and software and structural changes.|$|E
