Methods: This is a retrospective case series of patients with cystoid macular edema managed with a topical combination of strong steroid (difluprednate), NSAID, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor drops. The patients were followed with optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography. Results: In our six cases, resolution of the cystic edema with improvement in visual acuity was achieved with the use <b>of</b> a combination <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> drops. Leakage on fluorescein angiography and cystic edema on optical coherence tomography both responded to treatment with the topical <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> drops. Conclusion: A topical <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> strong steroid, NSAID, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor drops are effective for managing cystoid macular edema. Further studies comparing this combination with more invasive treatments should be undertaken to determine the efficacy <b>of</b> this <b>cocktail</b> over other treatment options.

40|$|Abstract：Small {{interference}} RNA mixtures (siRNA <b>Cocktails)</b> <b>of</b> Rabies virus (RV) N gene, P {{gene and}} G gene were prepared by digesting long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with RNase. These siRNA cocktails were transfecteing into BSR or MNA cell monolayers and the direct immunofluores-cence assay (FA) {{was used to}} measure the replication and infection of RV on the cell monolayers. We found that the siRNA <b>Cocktails</b> <b>of</b> N gene can obviously and stably inhibit the replication and infection of RV. A descent of mRNA of N gene was also detected by RT-PCR. Under the same situation, the siRNA <b>Cocktails</b> <b>of</b> P gene or G gene showed no or weak inhibition to the replication and infection of RV. All of these results provide a basis for selecting target gene of RV in RNA itreatment and its further application...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} the presence <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in eight African countries. Design/methodology/approach – This study investigates the presence <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in eight African countries – Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Tunisia and Zambia – for the period 1976 to 2005 using both regional and US dollar as anchor currencies. Findings – The paper finds that currency substitution is prevalent in Ghana and Nigeria when CFA franc is used as an anchor currency. However, when US dollar is used as an anchor currency {{there is no evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in Ghana, but the presence <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in Nigeria is still observed. The paper also finds the presence <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in South Africa, but not in Egypt when the US dollar is the anchor currency. For Kenya, Tunisia and Zambia there is no evidence <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution irrespective <b>of</b> the anchor <b>currencies</b> considered.

40|$|To improve {{surgical}} guidance toward prostate draining lymph nodes, {{we investigate}} {{the potential of}} intraoperative fluorescence imaging and combined pre- and intraoperative multimodality imaging approaches. Transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate mice with spontaneous prostate tumors are injected intratumorally with: 1. a <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> patent blue (Pb) and indocyanine green (ICG); 2. a <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> albumin radiocolloids (99 mTc-NanoColl), Pb, and ICG; or 3. a <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> radiolabeled albumin (99 mTc-Vasculosis), Pb, and ICG. The distribution of these imaging agents over the lymph nodes (LNs) are studied at different time points after injection. We find that at 60 -min postinjection, ICG significantly improves the detection of the LNs compared to Pb, 53 versus 7 %, respectively. Moreover, a <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> ICG and 99 mTc-NanoColl improves the fluorescent detection rate to 86 %, equalling that of the clinically applied 99 mTc-NanoColl. A similar overlap is observed in our initial clinical pilot data. Fluorescent detection of the LNs using a ICG with 99 mTc-Vasculosis gives similar results as "free" ICG (58 %; 60 min). A 99 mTc-NanoColl, Pb, and cocktail ICG enriches the standard 99 mTc-NanoColl approach by adding optical detection of the sentinel lymph nodes. Furthermore, this approach improves fluorescent-based guidance and enables both accurate surgical planning and intraoperative detection, based on a single injectio...|$|R

40|$|UNLABELLED A high {{proportion}} of gut and bronchial neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) overexpresses somatostatin receptors, especially the sst 2 subtype. It has also recently been observed that incretin receptors, namely glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP- 1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptors, can be overexpressed in gut and bronchial NETs. However, because not all tumors can express these receptors in sufficient amounts, in vivo imaging with a single radioligand {{may not always be}} successful. We therefore evaluated with in vitro methods whether a <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> radioligands targeting these 3 receptors would improve tumor labeling. METHODS In vitro receptor autoradiography was performed on 55 NETs, comparing in each successive section of tumor the binding with a single radioligand, either (125) I-Tyr(3) -octreotide, (125) I-GLP- 1 (7 - 36) amide, or (125) I-GIP(1 - 30), with the binding using a <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> all 3 radioligands, given concomitantly under identical experimental conditions. RESULTS Using the <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> radioligands, all tumors without exception showed moderate to very high binding, with a receptor density corresponding to 1, 000 - 10, 000 dpm/mg of tissue; conversely, single-ligand binding, although identifying most tumors as receptor-positive, failed to detect receptors or measured only a low density of receptors below 1, 000 dpm/mg in a significant number of tumors. In addition, the <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> radioligands always provided a homogeneous labeling of the whole tumor, whereas single radioligands occasionally showed heterogeneous labeling. CONCLUSION The study suggests that the use <b>of</b> a <b>cocktail</b> <b>of</b> 3 radioligands binding to somatostatin receptors, GLP- 1 receptors, and GIP receptors would allow detecting virtually all NETs and labeling them homogeneously in vivo, representing a significant improvement for imaging and therapy in NETs...|$|R
