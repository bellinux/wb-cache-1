The cyclic fatigue tests were performed using a dynamic cyclic fatigue testing device, which has an artificial stainless steel canal with a 60 ° angle of curvature and a 5 -mm radius of curvature. The files were divided into 3 groups (group 1, RPC R 25 [RPC]; group 2, WO Primary [WO]; group 3, TF Adaptive ML 1 [TFA]).

This study prepared a natural rubber/polybutadiene (NR/BR: 50 / 50 wt%) blend using precipitated amorphous white silica filler the surface of which had been pre-treated with bis-(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) -tetrasulphane (TESPT). TESPT is a sulphur-bearing bifunctional organosilane, which chemically bonds silica to rubber via the sulphur to form strong rubber-silica interaction. The rubbers were primarily cured by using sulphur in TESPT, and the cure was optimised by adding sulphenamide accelerator, zinc oxide activator and elemental sulphur. The chemical bonding between the sulphur in TESPT and the rubbers was affected mainly by the addition of the chemical curatives. In the absence of full chemical bonding between the sulphur in TESPT and the rubbers, most of the mechanical properties of the blend were inferior. But when chemical bonds or crosslinks fully formed between the sulphur in TESPT and the rubbers, the tensile strength, elongation at break, stored energy density at break, tear energy, <b>cyclic</b> fatigue <b>life</b> and abrasion resistance were enhanced.

This study evaluated the effects of two different heat treatments on the cyclic fatigue resistance and cutting efficiency of ProTaper Universal F 2 files. Materials and methods: The files were divided into three groups: no treatment (control), heat treatment at 400 °C (HT 400) and heat treatment at 600 °C (HT 600). The phase transformation of the files was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. In cyclic fatigue tests, the differences in file performance in four simulated canals among the three groups were assessed. The cutting efficiency was tested at four cutting portions (3  mm, 6  mm, 9  mm, and 12  mm) {{from the tip of}} the file. Results: Differential scanning calorimetry showed a prolonged phase transformation of the files only after 600 °C treatment. At 3  mm cutting portion, 400 °C heat-treated files had significantly better cutting ability than those in the control group. However, the files in the HT 600 group had significantly lower cutting efficiency than those in the other two groups at the four tested positions. In the cyclic fatigue test, fatigue lives of the files after 400 °C and 600 °C treatment were prolonged from 2. 1 to 2. 8 times and from 1. 7 to 5. 5 times, respectively. Conclusion: Although 600 °C treatment increased resistance to cyclic fatigue, it reduced the cutting efficiency of the files.
