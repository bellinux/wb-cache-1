5|$|In some localities {{significant}} bait fisheries {{exist to}} supply sport fishermen. One {{study of a}} bait fishery in Florida that targets Hemiramphus brasiliensis and Hemiramphus balao suggests that despite increases {{in the size of}} the fishery the population is stable and the annual <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> valued at around $500,000.|$|E

25|$|The {{total value}} of the fishery in 2003 was A$19.6 million, {{although}} this figure includes a small prawn fishery operating out of Port Gregory. Most of the <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> frozen and exported to Asia.|$|E
25|$|One-third of Kerala's fish {{production}} (including 60 {{percent of}} its prawn <b>catch)</b> <b>is</b> contributed by Kollam, whose average fish production is estimated at 5,275 tonnes. Nearly 3,000 mechanised boats operate out of its fishing harbour.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study <b>was</b> to analyses <b>catch</b> per unit effort of bottom gill net related to current speed and water depth in southern Bulukumba coast, South Sulawesi. The study was conducted from April 2010 to November 2011. Fish <b>catches</b> <b>were</b> monitored to describe the predominant species caught. The length of gill net was 500 m and depth 5 m. Mesh size was 6 cm and shortening 45 %. Total <b>catch</b> <b>was</b> decrease with increase current speed. The highest <b>catch</b> <b>was</b> occurred in current speed 0. 08 msec- 1. In contras, the lowest <b>catch</b> <b>was</b> occurred in current speed 0. 31 msec- 1. Altogether 13 species were identified from 4 fishing efforts of bottom gill net. The average catch per unit effort per day in fishing ground with less than 20 m in depth was 21. 2 kg. On the other hand, in more than 40 m in depth was 30. 2 kg. Total <b>catch</b> <b>was</b> strongly related to water depth...|$|R
30|$|Only the {{catches of}} the two most {{abundant}} species were sex-biased: C. spatulata <b>catches</b> <b>were</b> female-biased (60.7  % of females; χ 2  =  100.21; p <  0.001) and C. mali <b>catches</b> <b>were</b> male-biased (73.5  % of males; χ 2  =  158.36; p <  0.001).|$|R
5000|$|Freestyle <b>catches</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{split into}} two overlapping categories: blind and restricted. Blind <b>catches</b> <b>are</b> ones where the player cannot see the disc entering the hand and include popular moves such as scarecrow and phlaud. [...] Restricted catches involve positioning the hand around {{some part of the}} body, such as under the leg or behind the back. One of the most famous and iconic freestyle <b>catches</b> <b>is</b> called “gitis” and involves catching a disc with one hand over and around the opposite leg. <b>Catches</b> can also <b>be</b> performed between the legs or by resting on parts of the body such as the back.|$|R
25|$|The <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} shares known in Faroese as a skinn, {{which is an}} age-old {{measurement}} value that derives from agricultural practices. One skinn equals 38kg of whale meat plus 34kg of blubber: in total 72kg.|$|E
25|$|Rock coral on seamounts {{across the}} ocean are under fire from bottom trawling. Reportedly up to 50% of the <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> rock coral, and the {{practice}} transforms coral structures to rubble. With it taking years to regrow, these coral communities are disappearing faster than they can sustain themselves.|$|E
25|$|Alaskan {{king crab}} fishing {{is carried out}} during the fall months in the waters {{off the coast of}} Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The {{commercial}} harvest is performed during a very short season, and the <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> shipped worldwide. Large numbers of king crab are also caught in Russian and international waters.|$|E
40|$|Population {{estimates}} of crabs in commercial fisheries are traditionally {{based on the}} reported catch and effort, with supplementary sampling by researchers. This study investigated the four gear types most commonly used by fishers and researchers to determine whether their <b>catches</b> <b>are</b> representative of the populations. The selectivity of a large mesh trap, a small-mesh trap, a seine net and an otter trawl catching Portunus pelagicus (blue swimmer crab) in Peel-Harvey Estuary, Western Australia, was examined. Both the seine net and otter trawl caught a wide size range of crabs, {{although most of the}} <b>catch</b> <b>was</b> larger than the size at sexual maturity. The sex ratio of crabs caught by these two gear types was close to parity. However, traps caught a narrow size range, almost all of the <b>catch</b> <b>were</b> larger than the size at sexual maturity, and <b>catches</b> <b>were</b> heavily biased towards large males. Therefore, although favored by commercial fishers and for sampling crustacean populations in sensitive and protected areas, trap <b>catches</b> <b>are</b> not representative of the population sampled for blue swimmer crabs. Seine nets or otter trawls should thus be considered in the research assessment of stocks as their <b>catches</b> <b>are</b> more representative of the population. Catchability of all four gear types was found to vary seasonally. The size and sex bias of trap <b>catches</b> appear to <b>be</b> attributable to behavioural differences...|$|R
50|$|The lake {{supports}} a seasonal fishing {{industry and the}} population may increase markedly during the season. In 1989 the average annual <b>catch</b> <b>was</b> estimated at 11,900 tonnes, caught by 10,300 people using 5305 dugout canoes, 114 plank and fibreglass boats, and only 54 outboard motors. In 2000 the <b>catch</b> <b>was</b> 13,500 t.|$|R

25|$|The {{size of the}} {{historical}} <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> not known in detail; one estimate for 1976 was 50t, around 20–60t was caught annually between 1982 and 1990, and production probably peaked in 1991/92, when the catch was around 85t. Since then, the catch has generally shrunk, dropping to 14t in 1996/97, or 35t in 1998/99.|$|E
25|$|Any {{number and}} variety of catch clauses can be used above. If there is no catch {{matching}} a particular throw, control percolates back through subroutine calls and/or nested blocks until a matching <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> found or {{until the end of}} the main program is reached, at which point the program is forcibly stopped with a suitable error message.|$|E

25|$|Deadliest <b>Catch</b> <b>is</b> a {{documentary}} series aired by the Discovery Channel beginning in 2005. The show highlights {{the dangers of}} king crab fishing: freezing temperatures, turbulent seas, the pots that must be dragged up can weigh well over a ton when full, and, since the season is short – both because of regulations and the weather – fishermen often spend {{days at a time}} in very rough seas working long hours with little sleep.|$|E
25|$|According to Turchini and De Silva (2008), another 2.5 {{million tonnes}} {{of the annual}} forage fish <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> {{consumed}} by the global cat food industry. In Australia, pet cats eat 13.7 kilograms of fish a year compared to the 11 kilograms eaten by the average Australian. The pet food industry is increasingly marketing premium and super-premium products, when different raw materials, such as the by-products of the fish filleting industry, could be used instead.|$|E
25|$|One {{quarter of}} the Japanese catch of E. superba {{is used in the}} form of fresh frozen krill as fish bait and half the E. pacifica <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> used as chum for sport fishing. The Japanese {{industry}} produces boiled, frozen krill and peeled tail meat. Other uses include krill pastes or processed krill as food additives, e.g. in the form of krill oil gel capsules.　Small amount of E. superba is processed for human consumption.|$|E
50|$|The total <b>catch</b> in 2000 <b>was</b> 5,676 tons, a {{decrease}} from 11,458 tons in 1997; the <b>catch</b> <b>was</b> mainly marine, with freshwater carp, barbel, etc., crustaceans & molluscs.|$|R

25|$|Since 1832, the Faroe Islands {{have been}} divided into several whaling districts, {{although}} {{there is reason to}} believe that these districts already existed in some form prior to this date. These whaling districts are the basis for the distribution of the meat and blubber of the pilot whales caught. The <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> distributed in such a way that all the residents of the whaling district are given the same amount of the catch, regardless of whether they took part in the hunt or not.|$|E
25|$|The tip-up was {{the first}} {{revolver}} design for use with metallic cartridges in the Smith & Wesson Model 1, on which the barrel pivoted upwards, hinged on the forward end of the topstrap. On the S & W tip-up revolvers, the barrel release <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> located {{on both sides of}} the frame in front of the trigger. Smith & Wesson discontinued it in the third series of the Smith & Wesson Model 1 1/2 but it was fairly widely used in Europe in the 19th century, after a patent by Spirlet in 1870, which also included an ejector.|$|E
25|$|Most krill is {{processed}} to produce fish food {{for use in}} aquariums and aquacultures. The krill is sold freeze-dried, either whole or pulverized. Krill as a food source {{is known to have}} positive effects on some fish, such as stimulating appetite or resulting in an increased disease resistance. Furthermore, krill contains carotenoids and is thus used sometimes as a pigmentizing agent to color the skin and meat of some fish. About 34% of the Japanese catch of E. superba and 50% of E. pacifica are used for fish food; the Canadian <b>catch</b> <b>is</b> used almost exclusively for this purpose.|$|E
