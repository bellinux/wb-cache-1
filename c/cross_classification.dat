In this context, this paper develops a <b>cross</b> <b>classification</b> of material deprivation and lack of digital engagement, at a far more spatially disaggregate level than has previously been attempted. This is achieved my matching the well known 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) with a unique nationwide geodemographic classification of access and use of new information and communications technologies (ICTs), aggregated to the unit postcode scale. This ‘E-Society ’ classification {{makes it possible for}} the first time to identify small areas that are ‘digitally unengaged’, and our <b>cross</b> <b>classification</b> allows us to focus upon the extent to which the 2004 summary measure of material deprivation in England coincides with such lack of engagement. The results of the <b>cross</b> <b>classification</b> suggest that lack of digital engagement and material deprivation are linked, with high levels of material deprivation generally associated with low levels of engagement with ICTs and vice versa. However, some neighbourhoods are ‘digitally unengaged ’ but not materially deprived, and we investigate the extent to which this outcome may be linked to factors such as lack of confidence, skills or motivation. Our analysis suggests that approximately 5. 61 million people in England are both materially deprived and digitally unengaged. As with material deprivation, there are distinctive regional and local geographies to digital unengagement that have implications for digital policy implementation. 1...|$|E

40|$|The maximum {{likelihood}} (ML) estimation procedure of Matthews and Crowther (1995 : A {{maximum likelihood}} estimation procedure when modelling {{in terms of}} constraints. South African Statistical Journal, 29, 29 - 51) is utilized to fit a continuous distribution to a grouped data set. This grouped data set may be a single frequency distribution or various frequency distributions that arise from a <b>cross</b> <b>classification</b> of several factors in a multifactor design. It will also be shown how to fit a bivariate normal distribution to a two-way contingency table where the two underlying continuous variables are jointly normally distributed. This thesis is organized in three different parts, each playing {{a vital role in}} the explanation of analysing grouped data with the ML estimation of Matthews and Crowther. In Part I the ML estimation procedure of Matthews and Crowther is formulated. This procedure plays an integral role and is implemented in all three parts of the thesis. In Part I the exponential distribution is fitted to a grouped data set to explain the technique. Two different formulations of the constraints are employed in the ML estimation procedure and provide identical results. The justification of the method is further motivated by a simulation study. Similar to the exponential distribution, the estimation of the normal distribution is also explained in detail. Part I is summarized in Chapter 5 where a general method is outlined to fit continuous distributions to a grouped data set. Distributions such as the Weibull, the log-logistic and the Pareto distributions can be fitted very effectively by formulating the vector of constraints in terms of a linear model. In Part II it is explained how to model a grouped response variable in a multifactor design. This multifactor design arise from a <b>cross</b> <b>classification</b> of the various factors or independent variables to be analysed. The <b>cross</b> <b>classification</b> of the factors results in a total of T cells, each containing a frequency distribution. Distribution fitting is done simultaneously to each of the T cells of the multifactor design. Distribution fitting is also done under the additional constraints that the parameters of the underlying continuous distributions satisfy a certain structure or design. The effect of the factors on the grouped response variable may be evaluated from this fitted design. Applications of a single-factor and a two-factor model are considered to demonstrate the versatility of the technique. A two-way contingency table where the two variables have an underlying bivariate normal distribution is considered in Part III. The estimation of the bivariate normal distribution reveals the complete underlying continuous structure between the two variables. The ML estimate of the correlation coefficient ρ is used to great effect to describe {{the relationship between the two}} variables. Apart from an application a simulation study is also provided to support the method proposed. Thesis (PhD (Mathematical Statistics)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Statisticsunrestricte...|$|E

Furthermore, the schools attended earlier by students might have long-term effects on their subsequent performance. Using data from Dutch primary and secondary schools, multiple membership models and <b>cross</b> <b>classification</b> multilevel models were estimated to explore the effects of student mobility and long-term primary school effects on the estimated value added of secondary schools.

40|$|Credibility {{theory is}} a set of {{quantitative}} tools which allows insurers to perform prospective experience rating on a risk or group of risks in a heterogeneous portfolio. Credibility theory promotes a mechanism for the implementation of risk management strategies by differentiating between good and poor risks. It is used in the setting of rates for classification systems. Furthermore, application of credibility theory would also help to improve the ability of insurance companies to modify their price structure with the changing economic environment. Dannenburg [7] introduced a <b>crossed</b> <b>classification</b> credibility (CCC) model applicable to contracts that could be affected by many risk factors, that can not be modeled as nested or hierarchical relationships. In practice, the main problem in <b>crossed</b> <b>classification</b> credibility is the estimation of structure parameters. In a two-way CCC model, these parameters are the collective mean m, the time variance s 2, and the variance components b (1), b (2), and b (12). Dannenburg has already proposed estimators of these structure parameters. However, they have no known optimality property except unbiasedness. Goulet [24] proposed minimum variance unbiased (optimal) estimators for the mean and variance components. This thesis focuses on the implementation of the variance components estimators calculation. Analysis of algorithms and numerical evaluation procedures are studied to achieve computing efficiency.
