However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream.

In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E

Several energy companies have regional headquarters in the area, including Royal Dutch Shell, Eni and Chevron.

40|$|There exists three {{practicable}} <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> vacuum <b>distillation</b> {{processes and}} different processes {{have a significant}} impact on material and energy performances, including product yield, economic potential, heat recovery and the efficiencies of recoverable energy and recoverable exergy. Process selection is an important and difficult task for designers with various targets since the material and energy performances of a process do not coordinate with each other. In this work, an approach with simultaneous considerations of material and energy performances is proposed to comparatively analyze and evaluate the three processes, in order to provide insights for designers to screen a suitable process and vacuum furnace outlet temperature. The approach is conducted in three steps. In the first step, a simulation model is rebuilt to obtain basic material and energy data. In the second step, comparative analyses and evaluations are performed to measure the material and energy performances of three process options under the same operating conditions. In the last step, the variations of the material and energy performances are further investigated to determine the vacuum furnace outlet temperature. The results indicate that the cycle process has the highest product yield and best economic potential but the lowest efficiencies of recoverable energy and recoverable exergy, while the drawn process has the highest efficiencies of recoverable energy and recoverable exergy but the worst economic potential. The results also demonstrate that the selection of a vacuum distillation process and the determination of the vacuum furnace outlet temperature play a critical role in designing a <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> vacuum <b>distillation</b> process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{has been}} known for years that {{microbial}} surface active agents have a wide range of applica-tions not only in oil spill environment but also in many industries. Their properties including: (i) changing surface active phenomena, such as lowering of surface and interfacial tensions, (ii) wetting and penetrating actions, (iii) spreading, (iv) hydrophylicity and hydrophobicity actions, (v) microbial growth enhancement, (vi) metal sequestration and (vii) anti-microbial action attract the biotechnologist’s attention to be substituted instead of synthetic ones. There are many advantages of biosurfacants in comparison with chemically synthe-sized counterparts like biodegradability, generally low toxicity, biocompatibility and digestibility, availability of cheap raw materials, acceptable production economics, use in environmental control, specificity and Effective-ness at extreme temperatures, pH and Salinity. Hydrophobic petroleum hydrocarbons require solubilization before degradation by microbial cells. Surfactants can increase the surface area of hydrophobic materials, such as oil spills in soil and water environment, thereby increasing their water solubility. Hence, the presence of surfactants would increase biodegradation of complex hydrocarbons like asphaltenes and resins. Increasing supply of heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oils,</b> bitumens, <b>distillation</b> vacuum residue in most of oil producing countries has increased the interest in transportation and conversion of the high-molecular weight fractions of these materi-als into refined fuels and petrochemicals and also the interest of conversion of heavy fraction of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> like vacuum <b>distillation</b> residue to more valuable components...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe size {{distribution}} of sulfur, vanadium, and nickel was determined for four <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> and their <b>distillation</b> cuts using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) coupled to {{inductively coupled plasma}} high-resolution mass spectrometry (ICP HR MS).

A correlation exists between the sulfur fraction retention times and the temperature cuts of the distillation for a temperature below 560 degrees C and also between the viscosity of the <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> {{and the proportion of}} trapped sulfur compounds in a higher boiling temperature fraction.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a specific application of energy integration improvement achieved by modifying the flowsheet of the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> atmospheric <b>distillation</b> process. It differs from other methods by the application of exergy analysis to visualize and better understand the distribution of energy degradations in the distillation column in order to find a suitable solution to reduce them. A close look at this distribution for a simple model process shows the unnecessary presence of light species throughout the whole column, whereas they could be separated before being fed to the furnace and sent directly to the upper part of the column. Since the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> is continuously vaporized, the installation of flashes in the preheating train ensures this separation, avoids the unnecessary overheating of the vaporized species and offers a considerable potential in reduction of fuel consumption in the furnace. However, this potential reduction is obtained under a simplification that needs to be revisited in the framework of a more realistic and more complex flowsheet.

When subjected to α, β and γ self-irradiation, this organic matrix undergoes radiolysis, generating hydrogen bubbles and modifying the physical and chemical properties of the material. In this paper, the effects of irradiation on bitumen materials, especially in terms of its physical, chemical, structural and rheological properties, were characterized at radiation doses ranging from 1 to 7 MGy. An increase in the shear viscosity and melt yield stress was observed with increasing doses. Similarly, the elastic and viscous moduli (G′ and G″) increase with the dose, with a more pronounced increase for G′ that reflects enhanced elasticity arising from radiation-induced cross-linking. In addition, a low-frequency plateau is observed for G′, reflecting pseudo-solid behavior and leading to an increase of the complex viscosity. This behavior is due to increased interactions between asphaltene particles, and to aromatization of the bitumen by γ-radiations. Cross-linking of bitumen enhances its strength, as confirmed by various techniques (modulated DSC, DTA/TGA, SEC, FTIR and XRD) ...|$|R
