40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} software implementation of an under-water acoustic modem receiver. Communication links in underwater environments face several undesired effects. These include multipath signal reflections, inter-symbol interference, and channel fading. This receiver design uses a combination of time and spatial diversity inputs combined with an adaptive feedback equalizer to counteract those effects. The design is based on three modules. A front-end module demodulates and Doppler-compensates the incoming data. A <b>channel</b> <b>combiner</b> module receives data from one or more front ends for spatial diversity and combines repeated transmissions for time diversity. The data from each input channel is time aligned and stored in a 'job ' structure. The <b>channel</b> <b>combiner</b> also calculates tap sizes and locations for the feedback equalizer. Completed 'job ' structures from the <b>channel</b> <b>combiner</b> are then sent to an equalizer module. The modules are implemented in C language code written and compiled fo...|$|E
40|$|NASA has {{identified}} deep-space optical communications links {{as an integral}} part of a unified space communication network in order to provide data rates in excess of 100 Mb/s. The distances and limited power inherent in a deep-space optical downlink necessitate the use of photon-counting detectors and a power-efficient modulation such as pulse position modulation (PPM). For the output of each photodetector, whether from a separate telescope or a portion of the detection area, a communication receiver estimates a log-likelihood ratio for each PPM slot. To realize the full effective aperture of these receivers, their outputs must be combined prior to information decoding. A <b>channel</b> <b>combiner</b> was developed to synchronize the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) sequences of multiple receivers, and then combines these into a single LLR sequence for information decoding. The <b>channel</b> <b>combiner</b> synchronizes the LLR sequences of up to three receivers and then combines these into a single LLR sequence for output. The <b>channel</b> <b>combiner</b> has three channel inputs, each of which takes as input a sequence of four-bit LLRs for each PPM slot in a codeword via a XAUI 10 Gb/s quad optical fiber interface. The cross-correlation between the channels LLR time series are calculated and used to synchronize the sequences prior to combining. The output of the <b>channel</b> <b>combiner</b> is a sequence of four-bit LLRs for each PPM slot in a codeword via a XAUI 10 Gb/s quad optical fiber interface. The unit is controlled through a 1 Gb/s Ethernet UDP/IP interface. A deep-space optical communication link has not yet been demonstrated. This ground-station <b>channel</b> <b>combiner</b> was developed to demonstrate this capability and is unique in its ability to process such a signal...|$|E

40|$|Passive time {{reversal}} (pTR) {{is a low}} complexity {{receiver scheme}} that uses multichannel probing for time signal refocusing, thus reducing time spreading and improving inter-symbol interference. Recognizing that signals traveling through different paths are subject to arrival-angle-related Doppler displacements, this letter proposes a further improvement to pTR that applies correcting frequency shifts optimized for beams formed along each specific path arrival angle. The proposed channel equalizer is tested with real data, and {{the results show that}} the proposed approach outperforms both pTR and the modified pTR <b>channel</b> <b>combiners</b> providing an MSE gain of 4. 9 and 4. 2 dB, respectively. © 2015 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{well-known}} {{structure of}} an array combiner {{along with a}} maximum likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE) receiver {{is the basis for}} the derivation of a space-time processor presenting good properties in terms of co-channel and intersymbol interference rejection. The use of spatial diversity at the receiver front-end together with a scalar MLSE implies a joint design of the spatial combiner and the impulse response for the sequence detector. This is faced using the MMSE criterion under the constraint that the desired user signal power is not cancelled, yielding an impulse response for the sequence detector that is matched to the <b>channel</b> and <b>combiner</b> response. The procedure maximizes the signal to noise ratio at the input of the detector and exhibits excellent performance in realistic multipath channels...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of spatial}} {{diversity}} at the receiver front-end {{together with a}} sequence detector implies a joint design problem of the spatial combiner and the sequence detector impulse response. This joint design is usually faced under the constraint that the impulse response of the sequence detector is matched to the <b>channel</b> and <b>combiner</b> response. This procedure maximizes the {{signal to noise ratio}} at the input of the detector but, as it is well known, this does not guarantee a minimum probability of error, which is more related to the so-called effective signal to noise ratio. This work presents a procedure that, starting from a simple structure for the space-time receiver aims directly at the maximization of the effective signal to noise ratio, yet preserving all the features of the spatial processor in terms of co-channel and high order intersymbol interference rejection.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} wideband massive MIMO base stations that use one-bit ADCs for quantizing the uplink signal. Ourmain result {{is to show that}} the many taps of the frequency-selective <b>channel</b> make linear <b>combiners</b> asymptotically consistent and the quantization noise additive and Gaussian, which simplifies signal processing and enables the straightforward use of OFDM. We also find that single-carrier systems and OFDM systems are affected in the same way by one-bit quantizers in wideband systems because the distribution of the quantization noise becomes the same in both systems as the number of channel taps grows...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes and {{analyses}} selection combining (SC) at the destination for differential amplify-andforward (D-AF) relaying over slow Rayleigh-fading <b>channels.</b> The selection <b>combiner</b> chooses the {{link with the}} maximum magnitude of the decision variable {{to be used for}} non-coherent detection of the transmitted symbols. Therefore, in contrast to the maximum ratio combining (MRC), no channel information is needed at the destination. The exact average bit-error-rate (BER) of the proposed SC is derived and verified with simulation results. It is also shown that the performance of the SC method is very close to that of the MRC method, albeit with lower complexit...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{because of}} the {{frequency}} selectivity of a wireless <b>channel,</b> an optimum <b>combiner</b> should apply different weights for different frequencies; in practice the smallest frequency unit for which {{a different set of}} weights can be calculated is a physical resource block (RB). In this case too, a frequency selective combiner for an OFDM-based system requires substantial processing in the frequency domain which entails a range of relatively complex operations such as discrete Fourier transforms (DFT–IDFT pair), synchronisation, frequency offset compensation, etc. In particular, if the objective of the combiner is that of minimising the mean squared error of the useful signal estimate in the presence of unknown interference, additional estimates of the auto- and cross-correlation are required and a matrix inversion operation is necessary to compute the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) combiner weights for each active RB. In order to avoid placing such high processing demands on the DAS system, we propose the use of space-only weights at the HU, e.g., one set of adaptive weights which applies to all RBs.|$|R
40|$|In a {{conventional}} secret sharing scheme a dealer uses secure point-to-point channels {{to distribute the}} shares of a secret {{to a number of}} participants. At a later stage an authorised group of participants send their shares through secure point-to-point <b>channels</b> to a <b>combiner</b> who will reconstruct the secret. In this paper, we assume no point-to-point channel exists and communication is only through partial broadcast channels. A partial broadcast channel is a point-to-multipoint channel that enables a sender to send the same message simultaneously and privately to a fixed subset of receivers. We study secret sharing schemes with partial broadcast channels, called partial broadcast secret sharing schemes. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the partial broadcast channel allocation of a (t, n) -threshold partial secret sharing scheme is equivalent to a combinatorial object called a cover-free family. We use this property to construct a (t, n) -threshold partial broadcast secret sharing scheme with O(log n) partial broadcast channels. This is a significant reduction compared to n point-to-point channels required in {{a conventional}} secret sharing scheme. Next, we consider communication rate of a partial broadcast secret sharing scheme defined as the ratio of the secret size to the total size of messages sent by the dealer. We show that the communication rate of a partial broadcast secret sharing scheme can approach 1 /O(log n) which is a significant increase over the corresponding value, 1 /n, in the conventional secret sharing schemes. We derive a lower bound on the communication rate and show that for a (t,n) -threshold partial broadcast secret sharing scheme the rate is at least 1 /t and then we propose constructions with high communication rates. We also present the case of partial broadcast secret sharing schemes for general access structures, discuss possible extensions of this work and propose a number of open problems. 18 page(s...|$|R
