The tension forces were carried by the outer, convex surface of the girder which was made of back plates being chain-riveted together. The inner surface carried a <b>compressive</b> <b>load.</b> To avoid plate crumpling, it was made as a cellular structure: an inner plate and webs formed three rectangular cells, effectively box girders in their own right. The character of a box girder is to resist torsional twisting, so a composite face built up of them is also good at resisting crumpling.|$|E
25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

30|$|The {{amount of}} weight bearing and the force {{transmission}} to the frame have an important influence {{on the results of}} treatment with an Ilizarov external fixator. The frame provides beneficial interfragmentary movements and <b>compressive</b> <b>loads</b> at the fracture site through elastic wires. Mobilisation can be achieved by applying a weight-bearing platform at the distal end of the fixator. The effect on the interfragmentary movements and the <b>compressive</b> <b>loads</b> in indirect and direct loading were analysed in this study using a composite tibia bone model. Displacement transducers were attached to measure the interfragmentary movements and to detect relative movements of the bone fragments and movements between the rings. The <b>compressive</b> <b>loads</b> in the osteotomy were measured with loading cells in the defect zone. The weight-bearing platform had a substantial effect on the biomechanical behaviour of the frame.

It was found that the <b>compressive</b> <b>loading</b> significantly affected the residual stress distribution. A low load relaxed only the stresses near to the bore of the hole, whereas a larger load affected the stress distribution over a greater area. Residual stresses measured at the mandrel entrance face were more affected by the <b>compressive</b> <b>loading</b> than the residual stresses measured at the other segments of thickness. The comparison between the X-ray and neutron diffraction results showed that the techniques complemented each other well, enabling a three-dimensional residual stress distribution to be derived.

5000|$|Since {{structural}} columns {{are commonly}} of intermediate length, the Euler formula has little practical application for ordinary design. Issues that cause {{deviation from the}} pure Euler column behaviour include imperfections in geometry of the column in combination with plasticity/non-linear stress strain behaviour of the column's material. Consequently, a number of empirical column formulae have been developed that agree with test data, all of which embody the slenderness ratio. Due to the uncertainty {{in the behavior of}} columns, for design, appropriate safety factors are introduced into these formulae. One such formula is the Perry Robertson formula which estimates the critical buckling load based on an assumed small initial curvature, hence an eccentricity of the axial load. The Rankine Gordon formula (Named for William John Macquorn Rankine and Perry Hugesworth Gordon (1899 [...] - [...] 1966)) is also based on experimental results and suggests that a column will buckle at a load Fmax given by:where Fe is the Euler maximum load and Fc is the maximum <b>compressive</b> <b>load.</b> This formula typically produces a conservative estimate of Fmax.|$|E
