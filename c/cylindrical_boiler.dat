50|$|In the locomotive-type boiler, fuel is {{burnt in}} a firebox to produce hot {{combustion}} gases. The firebox {{is surrounded by}} a cooling jacket of water connected to the long, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler</b> shell. The hot gases are directed along a series of fire tubes, or flues, that penetrate the boiler and heat the water thereby generating saturated ("wet") steam. The steam rises to the highest point of the boiler, the steam dome, where it is collected. The dome is the site of the regulator that controls the exit of steam from the boiler.|$|E
50|$|A shell or flued boiler is {{an early}} and {{relatively}} simple form of boiler used to make steam, usually {{for the purpose of}} driving a steam engine. The design marked a transitional stage in boiler development, between the early haystack boilers and the later multi-tube fire-tube boilers. A flued boiler is characterized by a large <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler</b> shell forming a tank of water, traversed by one or more large flues containing the furnace. These boilers appeared around the start of the 19th century and some forms remain in service today. Although mostly used for static steam plants, some were used in early steam vehicles, railway locomotives and ships.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} form of fire-tube boiler was Richard Trevithick's [...] "high-pressure" [...] Cornish boiler. This {{is a long}} horizontal cylinder with {{a single}} large flue containing the fire. The fire itself was on an iron grating placed across this flue, with a shallow ashpan beneath to collect the non-combustible residue. Although considered as low-pressure (perhaps [...] ) today, {{the use of a}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler</b> shell permitted a higher pressure than the earlier [...] "haystack" [...] boilers of Newcomen's day. As the furnace relied on natural draught (air flow), a tall chimney was required {{at the far end of}} the flue to encourage a good supply of air (oxygen) to the fire.|$|E

5000|$|... "A <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler</b> {{was tested}} and {{withstood}} a steam pressure of 300 pounds without injury." [...] " [...] When the discharge valve was suddenly opened at a pressure of 235 pounds the boiler gave way, the iron being twisted and torn into fragments and thrown in all directions. The {{reason for this}} was that the sudden rush of steam from the boiler into the discharge pipe reduced the pressure in the boiler very rapidly. This reduction of pressure caused the sudden formation of a great quantity of steam within the water, and the heavy mass of water being thrown with great violence toward the opening whence the steam was being withdrawn, struck the portions of the boiler near that opening and caused the fracture." ...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{recorded}} boiler of comparable form {{was used in}} a railway locomotive, Hackworth's [...] 'Wilberforce' [...] class of 1830. This had a long <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler</b> shell similar to his earlier return-flued [...] 'Royal George' , but with the return flue replaced {{by a number of}} small firetubes, as had been demonstrated so effectively by Stephenson with his [...] 'Rocket' [...] a year earlier. The novel feature of an entirely internal combustion chamber was used. Unlike the later Scotch boiler though, this was self-supported by its own stays, rather than using stays through the walls of the boiler shell. This allowed the entire assembly of outer tubeplate, furnace tube, combustion chamber and firetubes to all be removed from the boiler shell as one unit, simplifying manufacture and maintenance. Although a valuable feature, this became impractical for larger diameter chambers that would require the support of the shell.|$|E
5000|$|In many boiler designs, {{the top of}} {{the boiler}} is {{cylindrical}} above the firebox, matching the contour {{of the rest of the}} boiler and naturally resisting boiler pressure more easily. In the Belpaire design, the outer upper boiler wall sheets are roughly parallel with the flat upper firebox sheets giving it a squarer shape.The advantage was a greater surface area for evaporation and less susceptability to foaming and carry over of water to the cylinders compared with the narrowing upper space of a classic <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler.</b> This allowed Churchward of the Great Western Railway to dispense with a steam dome to collect steam. Churchward also improved the Belpaire design to maximise the flow of boiler water for a given size of boiler by tapering of the firebox and boiler barrel outwards to the area of highest steam production at the front of the firebox.|$|E

5000|$|Early sets such as of Skaneateles, Eichhorn and Brio {{all seem}} to have used rather simple and {{abstract}} designs. The pieces were not painted, so that trains and tracks had the same surface. The normal early trains had engines and wagons each carved from {{a single piece of}} wood and connected by hooks and eyes. Painted sets may have become common in the early 1970s, as did the use of magnets as connectors. Engines carved from a single block were commonly painted black in Europe with bright red funnels and wheels. The early trains made with construction sets and large pull-along trains may have influenced other early train designs that were built of several wood pieces ("cut broomstick design" [...] among others). Normally each wooden piece had its own color, thus an engine, for example, could sport six different colors: one each for the base plate, the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler,</b> the drivers cabin, the cabin roof, the funnels and the wheels. Sets with painted patterns seem to have become more popular in the late 1980s and 1990s. This may have been due {{to the success of the}} [...] "Thomas the Tank Engine" [...] series and the wish for more realistic real world designs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{outcome was}} a {{complete}} redesign, the Model D of 1922. The uniflow engine, perceived as {{the root of the}} troubles with the Doble Detroit, gave place to a two-cylinder compound type, still with Joy's valve gear, but with piston valves. Another crucial development was a coiled monotube once-through vertically-mounted <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler</b> following the thinking behind the later version of the Detroit boiler, the most distinctive feature of which was the placing of the burner {{at the top of the}} boiler. This plus drastic insulation was meant to cause the hot gases to reside within the boiler casing for an optimum length of time giving up the maximum amount of heat to the feedwater. There was a forced draft burner at the top of the boiler and an exhaust flue at the bottom. The venturi was placed horizontally at the top of the vertical boiler barrel and oriented in such a way as to avoid direct contact with the monotube while inducing a swirl motion to the gases. It was thus a counterflow design with water entering the lower end of the coiled monotube and progressing upward toward the burner, which meant that the hottest gases gave superheat to the steam at the top of the coil whilst the cooler gases preheated oncoming the feedwater at the bottom. The distinctive hand operated [...] "miniature steering wheel” rotating a throttle control rod that passed down the middle of the steering column can be observed in D2 which still exists (in the UK) at the present time. Photographic evidence shows that D1 retained the foot throttle pedal, so when the wheel throttle control was first applied is not clear. The latter probably gave more precise adjustment.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{proponent of}} the {{cylindrical}} form was the British engineer John Blakey, who proposed his design in 1774. Another early proponent was the American engineer, Oliver Evans, who rightly recognised that the cylindrical form was the best {{from the point of}} view of mechanical resistance and towards the end of the 18th Century began to incorporate it into his projects. Probably inspired by the writings on Leupold's [...] "high-pressure" [...] engine scheme that appeared in encyclopaedic works from 1725, Evans favoured [...] "strong steam" [...] i.e. non condensing engines in which the steam pressure alone drove the piston and was then exhausted to atmosphere. The advantage of strong steam as he saw it was that more work could be done by smaller volumes of steam; this enabled all the components to be reduced in size and engines could be adapted to transport and small installations. To this end he developed a long cylindrical wrought iron horizontal boiler into which was incorporated a single fire tube, at one end of which was placed the fire grate. The gas flow was then reversed into a passage or flue beneath the boiler barrel, then divided to return through side flues to join again at the chimney (Columbian engine boiler). Evans incorporated his <b>cylindrical</b> <b>boiler</b> into several engines, both stationary and mobile. Due to space and weight considerations the latter were one-pass exhausting directly from fire tube to chimney. Another proponent of [...] "strong steam" [...] at that time was the Cornishman, Richard Trevithick. His boilers worked at [...] and were at first of hemispherical then cylindrical form. From 1804 onwards Trevithick produced a small two-pass or return flue boiler for semi-portable and locomotive engines. The Cornish boiler developed around 1812 by Richard Trevithick was both stronger and more efficient than the simple boilers which preceded it. It consisted of a cylindrical water tank around 27 ft long and 7 ft in diameter, and had a coal fire grate placed at one end of a single cylindrical tube about three feet wide which passed longitudinally inside the tank. The fire was tended from one end and the hot gases from it travelled along the tube and out of the other end, to be circulated back along flues running along the outside then a third time beneath the boiler barrel before being expelled into a chimney. This was later improved upon by another 3-pass boiler, the Lancashire boiler which had a pair of furnaces in separate tubes side-by-side. This was an important improvement since each furnace could be stoked at different times, allowing one to be cleaned while the other was operating.|$|E
