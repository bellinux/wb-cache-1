50|$|Colonial Hindu legal <b>code</b> <b>marks</b> a large span {{of nearly}} two-hundred years, {{beginning}} in 1772 and ending in 1947. This time period can be {{split into two}} main phases. The first phase, starting in 1772 and ending in 1864, is marked with three main proponents that include the translations of the dharmasastras by the British scholar administrators, the use of court pandits to define laws and rules, {{and the rise of}} case law. The second phase, starting in 1864 and ending in 1947, is marked by the dismissal of court pandits, rise of the legislative processes, and a codified law system.|$|E

As such, the <b>Code</b> <b>marks</b> {{the transition from the}} Roman law to Germanic law {{and is one of the}} best surviving examples of leges barbarorum.

The music video for [...] "Go (가)" [...] was U;Nee's first music video, and had a very dark theme with a message of a trapped (or caged) person wanting to be free. Many fans speculated after her death that the video could've been expressing her depression, and her need to be happy and free. This song proved to be one of her most popular, as it was covered by Japanese artist, DJ Ozma.|$|E

40|$|The Uniform Trust Code, {{the first}} national-level {{codification}} of the American law of trusts, was promulgated in 2000. The Code {{was the product}} of a five-year Uniform Law Commission drafting process that entailed extensive consultation with the trust and estates bar and the trust banking industry. The Code is being widely enacted. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have thus far adopted it, and many others are likely to follow. Alabama 2 ̆ 7 s enactment comes into effect in 2007. For the future, trust law in Alabama and the other Code states will be prevailingly statute law, although the principles developed in prior case law will continue to inform the interpretation and application of the Code. In one sense, the <b>Code</b> <b>marks</b> a great departure by codifying a previously uncodified field.

40|$|The {{development}} ufthe {{optical character}} reading (OCR) machine for high-speed code marking and sortation of letter mail {{has led to}} the need for a high-speed method of printing the phosphorescent <b>code</b> <b>marks</b> used by the mechanised letter sorting machines. This paper looks at the requirements,for the printing system, the method adopted and the results achieved. 1 HISTORY Early {{in the development of the}} automatic letter sorting system the British Post Ofice (BPO) adopted a system of code marking letter mail with phosphorescent machine readable codes. Phosphorescent encoding was chosen in preference to fluorescent, magnetic, or passive optical encoding because envelopes have no natural phosphorescence thus simplifying the detection of the coded information. Fluorescent and magnetic encoding systems are more likely to suffer from background inter-ference; background fluorescence occurs from optical brightening agents (OBAs) added to the paper in manu-facture and background magnetism from enclosures within envelopes. A passive optical system, black and white bars, places a constraint on the customer to leave a set area of the envelope blank and is unacceptable. The method of coding currently in use on coding desks is hot melt transfer which, although highly effec-tive on all envelope materials at coding desk rates, is an inherently slow process having a maximum throughput speed of two items per second. Optical character reading (OCR) machines are cost effective only at high throughput rates, of the order of ten items per second, and so a new method of printing was required to match the increased speed. Enclosures within envelopes can be irregular in shape, raising some parts of the envelope surface and leaving cavities elsewhere, thus the envelope can be ren-dered vulnerable to damage by high pressures from an impact type of printer. An ink jet printer imposes almost zero impact pressure on the printed item and also has the capability of high printing speed; it thus became the first choice solution to the printing problem even though no suitable phosphorescent ink was avail-able at the time.
