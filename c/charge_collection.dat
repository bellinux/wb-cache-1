The properties that make CdTe superior for the realization of high performance gamma- and x-ray detectors are high atomic number, large bandgap and high electron mobility ~1100cm2/V·s, which result in high intrinsic μτ (mobility-lifetime) product and therefore high degree of <b>charge</b> <b>collection</b> and excellent spectral resolution. Due to the poor charge transport properties of holes, ~100cm2/V·s, single-carrier-sensing detector geometries are used to produce high resolution spectroscopy; these include coplanar grids, frish-collar detectors and small pixel detectors.|$|E
