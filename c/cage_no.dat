40|$|Infanticide by males was {{examined}} in two strains (C 57 B 1 and DBA) {{of the house}} mouse (Mus musculus). Males that had contact with a female within the previous 2 – 3 weeks rarely committed infanticide when introduced to the home cage of a female and her 1 -day-old neonates, even when the female and neonates were of a different strain and from a different colony. In contrast, 90 % of C 57 B 1 males that had no contact with a female for more than 7 weeks killed pups when placed in the female's home cage, and 60 % killed when a 1 -day-old pup {{was introduced to the}} male's home <b>cage.</b> <b>No</b> difference in levels of infanticide occurred when grouped males were compared to isolated males. These results indicate that infanticide is not dependent upon recognition of the pups or the female, but depends on the male's previous exposure to females. Infanticidal behavior is not directly determined by genetic relationship, but the factors that inhibit this behavior reduce the probability that a male will kill his own offspring...|$|E
40|$|Groups of gravid {{females of}} Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) in a 1 -m 3 cage flew upwind in {{response}} to sheep placed upwind of the <b>cage.</b> <b>No</b> downwind flight or other response was observed to sheep placed downwind of the fly cage. Flystruck sheep stimulated the greatest accumulation of flies on the upwind cage wall (46 % of the caged flies), followed by sound wet sheep (29 %) and sound dry sheep (19 %). All sheep tested caused significantly more flies to accumulate on the upwind wall than did controls consisting of either no bait or a man placed upwind (14 %). Struck sheep elicited significant upwind movement of flies at distances of up to 20 m; sound, dry sheep did so only up to 10 m. It was concluded that L. cuprina is able to orient from a distance {{in response to}} volatile sheep kairomones; kairomones from dry sheep are augmented by wetting or the presence of cutaneous myiasis, as indicated by an enhanced fly response. The experiments performed did not exclude a role for visual or thermal cues in blowfly orientation to sheep...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{nitric oxide}} (NO) in the {{induction}} of longterm depression (LTD) in the cerebellum was explored using a new, organic, membrane-impermeant form of <b>caged</b> <b>NO.</b> NO photolytically released inside Purkinje neurons mimicked parallel fiber (PF) activity in synergizing with brief postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTD. Such LTD required a delay of < 50 ms {{between the end}} of photolysis and the onset of depolarization, was prevented by intracellular Ca 2 + chelation, and was mutually occlusive with LTD conventionally produced by PF activation plus depolarization. Bath application of NO synthase inhibitor or of myoglobin, a NO trap, prevented LTD induction via PF stimulation, but not that from intracellular uncaged NO, whereas intracellular myoglobin blocked both protocols. NO is therefore an anterograde transmitter in LTD induction. A biochemical requirement forsimultaneous NO and elevation of intracellular free Ca 2 + would explain why PF activity must coincide with postsynaptic action potentials...|$|R

The aims {{of the study were}} 1) to assess contraceptive efficacy of 4. 7 mg subcutaneous deslorelin implants in rats, 2) to determine the latency of contraceptive effect, and 3) to determine potential side effects. Three experimental females were implanted and their estrous cycle was studied by vaginal smear. Two weeks after implantation, a male whose fertility was previously assessed with a control female, was introduced into their <b>cage.</b> <b>No</b> female conceived during the 4 mo following implantation. Additionally, 38 pet rats were recruited from clients in practice to test for potential side effects, including 6 males and 32 females {{with a mean age of}} 14 mo. Local reaction and transient weight gain during the first 2 wk, as well as behavioral changes were recorded. According to this pilot study, deslorelin implant could be used as a contraceptive method in female rats. The latency period is about 2 wk. Nevertheless, it might be possible to refine the treatment further using hormonal measurements. The duration of contraceptive effect is to be determined in an upcoming study...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: Historically, {{anterior}} lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) {{was related}} to high rates of intraoperative complications and adverse events related to interbody devices. In recent decades, there have been technical adjustments, and cages that are more suitable have emerged. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the efficacy and complication rate of the use of stand-alone mini-ALIF using a self-locking cage., Methods: Retrospective single center study. Inclusion criteria: retroperitoneal mini-ALIF for single-level fusion (L 5 S 1); self-locking cage; DDD/stenosis and grade I, spondylolisthesis. Exclusion criteria: posterior supplementation, previous fusion/arthroplasty. Endpoints: surgery data, intraoperative and perioperative adverse events related both to surgical access and to the intersomatic device., Results: Eighty-seven cases were enrolled. Median surgical time was 90 min; median blood loss was 100 mL. The median length of stay in the ICU was zero days; median hospital stay was one day. Ten cases had an adverse event (11. 5 %) : four major adverse events (4. 6 %; 3 L bleeding; DVT; retroperitoneal haematoma; incisional hernia), and seven minor events (8 %; peritoneum injury; minor vascular injury; events related to the <b>cage).</b> <b>No</b> cases of retrograde ejaculation were observed. There was improvement in pain, physical restriction, and quality of life (, p< 0. 001).

40|$|ABSTRACT- Differences among results {{gathered}} from insect behavior {{studies conducted in}} laboratory and fi eld situations are due to ambient variables that differ greatly between both environments. In laboratory studies the environmental conditions can be controlled whereas in fi eld temperature, humidity and air velocity vary uncontrollably. The objective {{of this study was}} to calibrate and evaluate an experimental area (fi eld cage) (14 x 7 x 3. 5 m) subdivided into eight test cages (2. 5 x 2. 5 x 2 m) for use in behavioral oviposition tests of Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes for developing a new methodology to assess attractants and oviposition traps. Test cage calibration involved: (1) minimal experiment duration tests; (2) optimal female release number per traps test and (3) trap placement tests. All tests used gravid A. aegypti females; 3 - 4 days post blood meal and the sticky trap MosquiTRAP ® to catch adults. Ninety percent of the females released were recaptured 2 h after the beginning of the experiment, and this allowed up to 32 test repetitions/day to be conducted in the fi eld cage. The minimum number of females necessary to conduct statistical analyses was 20 females/trap/test per <b>cage.</b> <b>No</b> signifi cant difference was found in the behavioral response of gravid females to four different trap positions within test cages. Field trapping results with attractant were similar to those in the fi eld cage.

40|$|The Finnraccoon (Nyctereutes procyonoides ussuriensis) is an {{important}} fur animal in Finland. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine whether the housing conditions affect the fur quality and the selling price of the pelt in juvenile Finnraccoons. A total of 152 Finnraccoons were raised from weaning until pelting in four different housing conditions, differing in the cage size, animal density, group size and furnishing of the cage. The length and quality of the fur were evaluated and the selling price was registered. The data were analysed by using the Pearson Chi- square test and Linear Mixed Model (SPSS). The fur quality differed between groups with the poorest quality in the group of four animals housed in an enriched <b>cage.</b> <b>No</b> general difference between males and females was found. No difference between groups was found in the distribution of the pelts into the size categories. The size category and the quality of the fur were the main factors determining the selling price of the pelt. The selling price was higher in pelts of males than in those of females. This difference between males and females appeared only in the Finnraccoons housed in pairs, and not in those housed in groups. When only the auction where the majority of pelts were sold was considered, the selling price of the pelt was higher in females when housed in larger cages instead of small cages and in enriched cages instead of barren cages. In conclusion, the larger cage size and increased complexity of the cage may increase the selling price of pelts in juvenile Finnraccoons, especially in females. Although, the increased cage complexity impairs the quality of the fur, this does not finally affect the selling price of the pelt...|$|E
