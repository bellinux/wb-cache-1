40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the variation in}} <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> 10 common blood tests across California hospitals in 2011, and to analyse the hospital and market-level factors that may explain any observed variation. Design setting and participants: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis {{of the degree of}} charge variation between hospitals for 10 common blood tests using charge data reported by all non-federal California hospitals to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development in 2011. Outcome measures: <b>Charges</b> <b>for</b> 10 common blood tests at California hospitals during 2011. Results: We found that <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> blood tests varied significantly between California hospitals. <b>For</b> example, <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> a lipid panel ranged from US$ 10 to US$ 10   169, a thousand-fold difference. Although government hospitals and teaching hospitals were found to charge significantly less than their counterparts for many blood tests, few other hospital characteristics and no market-level predictors significantly predicted <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> blood tests. Our models explained, at most, 21 % of the variation between hospitals in <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> the blood test in question. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the seemingly arbitrary nature of the charge setting process, making it difficult for patients to act as true consumers in this era of ‘consumer-directed healthcare. ...|$|R
