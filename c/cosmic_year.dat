He preserves a tutelary function on this universe as the gatekeeper of Heaven. His nature, qualities and role are reflected in the myth of him being the first to reign in Latium, on the banks of the Tiber, and there receiving god Saturn, in the age when the Earth still could bear the gods. The theology of Janus is also presented in the carmen Saliare. According to Johannes Lydus the Etruscans called him Heaven. His epithets are numerous Iunonius is particularly relevant, as the god of the kalendae who cooperates with and is the source of the youthful vigour of Juno in the birth of the new lunar month.

50|$|In anthroposophy, {{based on}} teachings by Rudolf Steiner, a <b>cosmic</b> <b>year</b> {{represents}} the Platonic year, {{a period of}} 25,920 years. This is the time required for the Sun's position at spring equinox to traverse the complete zodiac. So each zodiacal sign covers about 2160 years. The year 747 BCE marked the transition from Taurus to Aries and since 1453, the spring equinoctial sun is in Pisces. This cosmic cycle has a considerable influence on humanity in both physical and spiritual respects. For instance, the Aries period covered the Greek/Roman culture period ranging from the foundation of Rome (753 BCE) to the fall of Byzantium (1453), whereas the Taurus period marked the Egyptian/Chaldaean era. Another example is human breathing rhythm: an average of 18 cycles per minute represents 18 x 60 x 24 = 25,920 cycles per day. The number of daily sleep-wake-cycles of the conscious mind in an average human lifetime of 72 years adds up to the same platonic figure. Shao Yung's <b>cosmic</b> <b>year</b> represents exactly five platonic years (5x25,920=129,600).|$|E

500|$|The quark flavors {{were given}} their names for several reasons. The {{up and down}} quarks are named after {{the up and down}} {{components}} of isospin, which they carry. Strange quarks were given their name because they were discovered to be components of the strange particles discovered in <b>cosmic</b> rays <b>years</b> before the quark model was proposed; these particles were deemed [...] "strange" [...] because they had unusually long lifetimes. Glashow, who coproposed charm quark with Bjorken, is quoted as saying, [...] "We called our construct the 'charmed quark', for we were fascinated and pleased by the symmetry it brought to the subnuclear world." [...] The names [...] "bottom" [...] and [...] "top", coined by Harari, were chosen because they are [...] "logical partners for up and down quarks". In the past, bottom and top quarks were sometimes referred to as [...] "beauty" [...] and [...] "truth" [...] respectively, but these names have somewhat fallen out of use.
