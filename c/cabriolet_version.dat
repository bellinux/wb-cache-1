25|$|A {{derivative}} of the 104 coupé {{with a slightly}} longer rear section, the Talbot Samba was launched in 1981, following Peugeot's acquisition of Chrysler Europe (and its Talbot marque) in 1978. A <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> of the Samba was developed. Production lasted until 1986.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} B5 {{version was}} produced {{only as a}} five-door five-seat [...] "Avant", Audi's name for an estate car/station wagon. [...] The second version, the B7, was released initially as a four-door five-seat saloon/sedan, with the Avant following a short while later. [...] A two-door four-seat <b>Cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> was subsequently added. [...] Furthermore, their unique internal combustion engines are all front-mounted, and are longitudinally oriented. [...] The transmission is mounted immediately {{at the rear of}} the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle, and contains both a center and front differential.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time, {{development}} of the <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> of the 997 led the design and engineering effort at Porsche with the coupé following. Porsche applied the logic that if you started with the more difficult cabriolet challenges (for chassis stiffness) the coupé version would simply be more rigid. Despite additional weight, the cabriolet versions attain nearly the same performance figures as their coupé counterparts. Even the rear tail comes up slightly higher on the cabriolets to compensate for differences in drag over the canvas top vs. the smoother coupé shape. [...] Optional for the 997 Cabriolet models is a hardtop that encapsulated the vehicle {{in place of the}} canvas top. [...] It is interchangeable with that available on the late 996 cabriolet models. [...] The hardtop provides a winter option to cabriolet owners.|$|E

50|$|Turbo Cabriolet and Turbo S <b>Cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> {{were added}} to the range at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.|$|R
25|$|Initially {{available}} models include coupé and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> of Carrera, Carrera 4, Carrera S and Carrera 4S. The car {{was unveiled}} at the Paris Auto Show in September 2008.|$|R
50|$|In October 1952 a <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> {{of the now}} chassisless Simca Sport was exhibited, but the <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> only entered {{production}} {{more than}} two years later in the Spring of 1955, presumably reflecting the challenges involved achieving sufficient structural rigidity in a slim and shapely cabriolet body, without incurring an excessive weight penalty.|$|E

50|$|Initially {{available}} models include coupé and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> of Carrera and Carrera S, with Carrera 4, Carrera 4S, Targa 4 and Targa 4S coming a {{few weeks}} later. In December 2015, Turbo and Turbo S versions were launched.|$|R
5000|$|Production of the F5 saloon {{ended in}} 1936 while {{production}} of the [...] <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> continued for a further year. The car {{was replaced by the}} DKW F7. By the time that happened, approximately 60,000 F5s had been produced, placing this car among Germany’s top sellers.|$|R
50|$|The Grégoire was a modern-looking four-door saloon. Reportedly as a {{response}} to disappointing sales for the saloon, special-bodied coach-built coupé and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> also appeared at the 1952 Paris Motor Show, including a streamlined Grégoire-based coupé with an eye-catching 'panoramic' rear window bodied by the coachbuilder Henri Chapron.|$|R
50|$|Also, a <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> was introduced. It {{was similar}} {{dimensions}} to the 3-door version, with a two-box design.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, Volkswagen {{announced}} that they would build a <b>Cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> of the GTI, powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine.|$|E

5000|$|In January 1952 the Mercedes-Benz 170 Sb {{replaced}} the 170 S model. The car now received a works {{number of its}} own, becoming known internally as the “Mercedes-Benz W 191”. Both <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> had been withdrawn in November 1951, cabriolet buyers now being catered for by the <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> of the 6-cylinder Mercedes-Benz W187 220 model. The 170 Sb was therefore available only with a four-door sedan/saloon body. Other changes included in the 1952 upgrade included {{the replacement of the}} floor-mounted gear lever with a then fashionable column mounted gear lever. There was now a starter button on the dashboard and the heater was improved. Under the bonnet/hood the camshaft was now driven via a chain rather than via gear cogs, a hypoid differential was fitted and the rear track was increased by 15 mm.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{new model}} was the Victoria of 1950, {{which had a}} 1034 cc three-cylinder engine. Still two-stroke, the engine in this {{application}} boasted an output of [...] By 1951, when the firm ceased production, approximately 1500 Eucorts has been produced, including taxi and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions.</b> [...] The business subsequently went into liquidation.|$|R
50|$|The DKW F8 compact {{front-wheel drive}} {{two-stroke}} engined saloon {{was introduced in}} 1939. The F8 was slightly shorter than its predecessor despite having a marginally increased wheelbase. The base model, known as the Reichsklasse, was manufactured only till 1940 but the Meisterklasse sedan continued in production until 1942. In addition to the saloons, <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> were offered.|$|R
50|$|In July 1956 the 2-door <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> was withdrawn. It had {{not sold}} well: the few {{survivors}} are much prized by enthusiasts and collectors {{half a century}} later.|$|E
50|$|SEAT {{has also}} {{produced}} {{on its own}} a <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> of the SEAT Ibiza Mk1, named Ibiza cabrio, a model which is currently found in its Nave A122 site.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, {{the car was}} {{equipped}} with the smallest Fiat engine, air-cooled 479 cc producing [...] In 1959, the engine power was increased to [...] and in 1960, the <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> was launched.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} broadly similar F5 saloons, sold as the Reichsklasse and Meisterklasse. They {{shared the same}} track and wheelbase, but the Meisterklasse was 3.5 cm longer. There were also {{two-seater}} <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> of each, along with a lighter bodied ‘Front Luxus Sport’ sports cabriolet for which a higher top speed of 90 km/h (56 mph) was claimed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> {{were also}} available. Based on the Rekord A coupé, these were {{conversions}} {{from the body}} builders Autenreith until they ceased production in 1964, and thereafter by Karl Deutsch. This approach made them very much more expensive than other cars in the range, and the cabriolet conversion was not offered with the smaller 1,488 cc engine. Very few Rekord A cabriolets were sold.|$|R
50|$|Surviving F9s appear largely {{restricted}} to saloon versions, but various sports and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> were also produced. Steel for consumer industries was {{in short supply}} across many parts of Europe during this period, and the F9’s body construction increasingly involved plastic panels, especially after production was moved to Eisenach in 1953. The car was accordingly usefully lighter than its western built Auto Union equivalent.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 the coachbuilder Esclassan {{exhibited}} a special bodied <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> {{based on the}} Randonnée but inspired by the General Motors “Le Sabre” dream car. Two cars were constructed but have since been destroyed.|$|E
50|$|A {{derivative}} of the 104 coupé {{with a slightly}} longer rear section, the Talbot Samba was launched in 1981, following Peugeot's acquisition of Chrysler Europe (and its Talbot marque) in 1978. A <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> of the Samba was developed. Production lasted until 1986.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} {{two-seater}} coupé versions and a <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> offered, {{but by the}} end of 1938 these “minority“ models had accounted for only 358 cars. In addition to these and the sedans, a six-window Limousine with an available partition was introduced in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|... 997 is the {{internal}} designation for the Porsche 911 model manufactured and sold by German manufacturer Porsche between 2004 (as Model Year 2005) and 2012. Production of the Carrera and Carrera S coupés began in early 2004, all-wheel drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S versions began shipping in November 2005, Turbo and GT3 derivatives {{went on sale}} in late 2006 and the 911 GT2 in 2007. In addition to the coupé and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions,</b> Targa versions of the Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S were also available, which carry on with the [...] "glass canopy" [...] roof design used on all Targa 911s from the Type 993 Generation 911 until the 991, which replaced it in 2012.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 Hotchkiss {{had bought}} {{the rights to the}} Grégoire {{front-wheel-drive}} car and this car entered production in 1951 but was expensive. Sales in general were falling, and on reaching his 65th birthday in 1949 Ainsworth retired, to be succeeded in the top job by Maurice de Gary. The Peugeot family sold their interest in the company. Coupé and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> of the Hotchkiss-Grégoire were announced in 1951, but sales did not improve, and production stopped in 1952 after only 247 were made.|$|R
50|$|The Cabriolet, {{introduced}} in 1994 for the 1995 model year, features a fully electrical and hand-stitched soft-top reinforced with metal sheets and an automatic wind-blocker. On {{the rear of}} the Cabriolet a small spoiler is mounted with the 3rd braking light. The 993 Cabriolet was slightly heavier than the coupé version and has a curb weight of 1420 kg. On average a high percentage of the total Cabriolets produced ended up in the US. Both coupé and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions</b> were available with all-wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|The Golf Mk2 was {{available}} as a 3- and 5-door hatchback. The 2-door and 4-door sedan variants of the Golf Mk2 were marketed under the Volkswagen Jetta name. No <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> was developed from the Mk2; instead, the Mk1-based convertible continued to be produced, with minor changes.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1953, the {{roadster}} {{was joined}} in Panhard's lineup by a <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> {{that came with}} exterior door handles and wind-up glass side windows {{in place of the}} plastic sliders on the roadster. In March the Junior began to use the X87 chassis, and a three-seat bench seat was fitted.|$|E
50|$|Initially the compact-six-engined Wanderer {{was offered}} as a four-door saloon and as a two-door cabriolet. The 1935 name change from W21 to W235 coincided with the {{withdrawal}} of the <b>cabriolet</b> <b>version</b> and the introduction of a four-door ‘tourer’. There were no significant changes to the car accompanying the 1936 name change to Wanderer W35.|$|E
50|$|Long-lived, the Mark 2 was {{available}} in estate, hatchback, saloon and <b>cabriolet</b> <b>versions.</b> The saloon was launched in January 1986 and sold as the Vauxhall Belmont; this trend to brand saloon models independently of hatchbacks was also used by other manufacturers of the period, with examples including the Ford Orion and the Volkswagen Jetta. However, this strategy was mostly unsuccessful, as this was Vauxhall's only attempt at badging its hatchback-based saloon as a separate model, and Ford rebadged its Orion range as Escorts in September 1993.|$|R
50|$|Only <b>cabriolet</b> bodied <b>versions</b> of the 370K were offered. The reduced {{size of the}} car {{permitted}} a maximum speed of 105 km/h (65 mph) to be claimed.|$|R
50|$|Peugeot {{introduced}} a new car for the 2004 season, the 307 WRC, which was based upon the coupé <b>cabriolets</b> <b>version</b> of the 307 road car. Having originally not {{been part of the}} team {{at the start of the}} season, Rovanperä replaced Loix after two rounds in the team’s second car alongside Grönholm, who struggled with the new car initially. He took the team’s only victory of the season in Finland, and he finished fifth in the standings at the end of the season. Peugeot finished fourth in the manufacturers’ standings.|$|R
