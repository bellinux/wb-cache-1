25|$|A {{mistake is}} an {{incorrect}} understanding {{by one or}} more parties to a contract and may be used as grounds to invalidate the agreement. Common law has identified three types of mistake in contract: <b>common</b> <b>mistake,</b> mutual mistake, and unilateral mistake.|$|E
25|$|One such wind {{occurs in}} the Cook Inlet region in Alaska as air moves over the Chugach Mountains between Prince William Sound and Portage Glacier. Anchorage {{residents}} often believe the warm winds which melt snow and leave their streets slushy and muddy are a midwinter gift from Hawaii, following a <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> that the warm winds {{come from the same}} place as the similar winds near the coasts in southern British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.|$|E
25|$|When a {{misrepresentation}} {{has been}} made and an agreement was (or at any rate appeared to be) concluded, the misrepresentee {{does not have to}} bring a halt to the deal. Misrepresentations generally do not render a contract void, as does the contractual doctrine of <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> or frustration; it makes a contract voidable at the option of the misrepresentee. Not all contracts entered into on the strength of misrepresentations will be bad for the misrepresentee, who may choose not to void the contract.|$|E

25|$|When {{purchasing}} bras, larger-breasted women {{usually have}} difficulty selecting a well-fitting bra. Buxom {{women are more}} likely than smaller-breasted women to wear an incorrectly sized bra. They tend to buy bras that are too small, while smaller-breasted women tend to purchase bras that are too large. Studies have revealed that the most <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> made by women when selecting a bra was to choose too large a back band and too small a cup, for example, 38C instead of 34E, or 34B instead of 30D.|$|E
25|$|A <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> {{of early}} FTP administrators was to permit a {{directory}} named /incoming that allows full {{read and write}} access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in {{and go to a}} location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain text file with the message inside.|$|E
25|$|Note that Opel prices {{appear to}} be {{inherently}} higher than Ford ones. A <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> {{in a lot of}} examples trying to prove that VAT rebates form as a trade barrier is, to set retail prices equal for both Ford and Opel. This way, prices are initially equal, but become different after all the additional VAT taxes and rebates described below. Such an approach {{does not take into account}} the simple fact that Opel prices in the table above always include VAT while Ford prices never include it. That's exactly why additional adjustments are made in VAT taxation.|$|E

25|$|Most modern {{writers have}} no {{experience}} using thou in daily speech; they are therefore vulnerable to confusion {{of the traditional}} verb forms. The most <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> in artificially archaic modern writing {{is the use of}} the old third person singular ending -eth with thou, for example thou thinketh. The conversethe use of the second person singular ending -est for the third person—also occurs ("So sayest Thor!"spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern parody and pastiche in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms thou and thee are often transposed.|$|E
25|$|Bishōjo ("beautiful girl") {{is often}} mistakenly {{considered}} a parallel of bishōnen, {{because of the}} similar construction of the terms. There are major {{differences between the two}} aesthetics. The bishōjo aesthetic is aimed at a male audience, and is typically centered on young girls, drawn in a cute, pretty style; and bishōnen is aimed at a female audience, centered on teenage boys, and drawn elegantly. Another <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> is assuming that the female characters in bishōnen manga and anime are bishōjo. In truth, female characters in bishōnen manga are very different from those in bishōjo; bishōjo females are usually more petite and drawn in a style that is cute rather than beautiful, whereas bishōnen females exhibit the long limbs and elegance of the bishōnen.|$|E
25|$|After Kilroy was {{confirmed}} dead, the media framed the drug group and their religious practices as satanist. For the most part, the U.S. media labeled {{the group as}} satanist and gave little mention to the drug-related violence that was widespread in northern Mexico, thus failing to provide a wider picture of what happened at Matamoros. Reports concluded that because human body parts were found inside a large metal pot, the group practiced cannibalism. Some journalists made the error of attributing cannibalism with the <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> of satanist groups sacrificing and eating human remains. Other writers, however, stated that Constanzo believed in Kadiempembe, the devil's version in Palo Mayombe. In addition, some occult writers believed {{that the nature of}} Kilroy's murder, which included mutilation and clandestine burial, were part of occult tradition.|$|E

25|$|Although the Companion cavalry {{is largely}} {{regarded}} as the first real shock cavalry of Antiquity, it seems that Alexander was very wary of using it against well-formed infantry, as attested by Arrian in {{his account of the}} battle against the Malli, an Indian tribe he faced after Hydaspes. There, Alexander did not dare assault the dense infantry formation with his cavalry, but rather waited for his infantry to arrive, while he and his cavalry harassed their flanks. It is a <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> to portray the Companion cavalry as a force able to burst through compact infantry lines. Alexander usually launched the Companions at the enemy after a gap had opened up between their units or disorder had already disrupted their ranks. However, the ancient historian Arrian implies that the Companion cavalry were successful in an assault, along with heavy infantry, on the Greek mercenary hoplites serving Persia in the closing stages of the Battle of Granicus. Their success may have been largely due to the poor morale of the hoplites who had just witnessed the rest of their army broken and put to flight.|$|E
500|$|On January 29, 1951, Lacks went to Johns Hopkins, {{the only}} {{hospital}} {{in the area that}} treated black patients, because she felt a [...] "knot" [...] in her womb. She had previously told her cousins about the [...] "knot" [...] and they assumed correctly that she was pregnant. But after giving birth, Lacks had a severe hemorrhage. Her primary care doctor tested her for syphilis, which came back negative, and referred her back to Johns Hopkins. There, her doctor, Howard W. Jones, took a biopsy of the mass on Lacks's cervix for laboratory testing. Soon after, Lacks was told that she had a malignant epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix. In 1970, physicians discovered that she had been misdiagnosed and actually had an adenocarcinoma. This was a <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> at the time and the treatment would not have differed.|$|E

[...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice."

[...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not a surprise that 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is surprising is just how good it is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly <b>common</b> <b>mistake</b> of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: {{this study}} {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} scenario-based skills training on students' learning skills. Method: the author evaluated the nursing skills laboratory exam papers of 605 sophomores in nursing programs for seven years. The study determined the <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> of students and the laboratory work was designed in a scenario-based format. The effectiveness of this method was evaluated by assessing the number of errors the students committed and their achievement scores in laboratory examinations. This study presents the students' <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> in intramuscular and subcutaneous injection and their development of intravenous access skills, included in the nursing skills laboratory examination. Results: {{an analysis of the}} students' most <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> revealed that the most common was not following the principles of asepsis for all three skills (intramuscular, subcutaneous injection, intravenous access) {{in the first year of}} the scenario-based training. The students' exam achievement scores increased gradually, except in the fall semester of the academic year 2009 - 2010. The study found that the scenario-based skills training reduced students' <b>common</b> <b>mistakes</b> in examinations and enhanced their performance on exams. Conclusion: this method received a positive response from both students and instructors. The scenario-based training is available for use in addition to other skills training methods...|$|R
