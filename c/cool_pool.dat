40|$|Part I of {{this paper}} compares two simulations, one using a bulk {{and the other a}} {{detailed}} bin microphysical scheme, of a long-lasting, continental mesoscale convective system with leading convection and trailing stratiform region. Diagnostic studies and sensitivity tests are carried out in Part II to explain the simulated contrasts in the spatial and temporal variations by the two microphysical schemes and to understand the interactions between cloud microphysics and storm dynamics. It is found that the fixed raindrop size distribution in the bulk scheme artificially enhances rain evaporation rate and produces a stronger near surface <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> compared with the bin simulation. In the bulk simulation, <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> circulation dominates the near-surface environmental wind shear in contrast to the near-balance between <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> and wind shear in the bin simulation. This is the main reason for the contrasting quasi-steady states simulated in Part I. Sensitivity tests also show that large amounts of fast-falling hail produced in the original bulk scheme not only result in a narrow trailing stratiform region but also act to further exacerbate the strong <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> simulated in the bulk parameterization. An empirical formula for a correction factor, r(q(sub r)) = 0. 11 q(sub r) (exp - 1. 27) + 0. 98, is developed to correct the overestimation of rain evaporation in the bulk model, where r is the ratio of the rain evaporation rate between the bulk and bin simulations and q(sub r) (g per kilogram) is the rain mixing ratio.

The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of a 12 -week <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> exercise program on gait outcomes in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis. Spatiotemporal and kinematic gait variables will be compared between one group that participates in an aquatic exercise program in the <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> and one group that participates in a home-based exercise program. The study findings will help to provide more effective and scientific therapeutic exercise programs for gait restoration in individuals with MS. Methods: 22 individuals with MS were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups. The aquatic group (n=l 1) participated in a 50 -minute <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> exercise program (82 - 84 ??? F) 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The home-based exercise group was recommended to exercise at home with specific guidelines. Gait variables included spatiotemporal data, peak joint angles and joint excursions in the lower extremities. All participants walked on a 10 -meter walkway at their maximum speed for 3 trials with 30 -second rest in between. The Vicon Motion Analysis system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) was used to capture and process gait data, applying the Plug-in-Gait model. Results: A multivariate analysis of variance showed greater increases in ankle peak plantarflexion and ankle excursion on the less affected limb in the aquatic group as compared to the home-based group. There were no significant between-group differences found in gait speed, stride length, cadence and hip and knee kinematics. Both groups showed a positive trend of maintaining or improving their gait efficiency in all other dependant variables. Conclusions: The findings suggest that structured <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> exercise can be more effective improving ankle gait kinematics as compared to a comparable home-based program.

40|$|A cloud-resolving {{model is}} used to study sensitivities of two {{different}} microphysical schemes, one is the traditional bulk type, {{and the other is}} an explicit bin scheme, in simulating a mid-latitude squall line case (PRE-STORM, June 10 - 1 1, 1985). Simulations using different microphysical schemes are compared with each other and also with the observations. Both the bulk and bin models reproduce the general features during the developing and mature stage of the system. Furthermore, the observations and the well-proven bulk scheme simulation serve as validations for the newly incorporated bin scheme. However, it is also shown that the bulk and bin simulations have distinct differences, most notably in the stratiform region of the squall line system. Weak convective cells exist in the stratiform region in the bulk simulation, but not in the bin simulation. These weak convective cells in the stratiform region simulated in the bulk scheme model are remnants of the stronger convections previously at {{the leading edge of the}} system, sustained by horizontal vorticity generated by its own <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> near the surface. The bin simulation, on the other hand, has a horizontally homogeneous stratiform cloud structure, which agrees better with the observations. Examinations of the downdraft core strength, the potential temperature perturbation, and the evaporative cooling rate show that the differences between the bulk and bin models are due mainly to the stronger low-level evaporative cooling in the convective zone simulated in the bulk microphysical scheme, which is unrealistic because of the assumptions made in raindrop size distribution. Further sensitivity tests that reduce the evaporation rate in bulk scheme artificially produce more upright convective core and less weak cores in stratiform region. However, they produce weaker upper level outflow and consequently less stratiform rain area. The addition of a more realistic raindrop breakup scheme in the bin scheme results more realistic radar reflectivity and stronger surface rainfall. Despite the increase of the rain evaporation and strengthening of the near surface <b>cool</b> <b>pool,</b> bin scheme with rain breakup shows homogeneous stratiform rain. These sensitivity tests prove the robustness of the bin microphysical scheme and the difficulty of tuning the limited parameters in the bulk microphysical scheme to realistically reproduce detail structures in a mid-latitude squall line case study...|$|E
40|$|Mesoscale model {{simulations}} {{have been}} performed of the second episode of gravity waves observed in great detail in previous studies on 11 – 12 July 1981 during the Cooperative Convective Precipitation Experiment. The dominant wave simulated by the model was mechanically forced by the strong updraft associated with a mountain– plains solenoid (MPS). As this updraft impinged upon a stratified shear layer above the deep, well-mixed boundary layer that developed due to strong sensible heating over the Absaroka Mountains, the gravity wave was created. This wave rapidly weakened as it propagated eastward. However, explosive convection developed directly over the remnant gravity wave as an eastward-propagating density current produced by a rainband generated within the MPS leeside convergence zone merged with a westward-propagating density current in eastern Montana. The greatly strengthened <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> resulting from this new convection then generated a bore wave {{that appeared to be}} continuous with the movement of the incipient gravity wave as it propagated across Montana and the Dakotas. The nonlinear balance equation and Rossby number were computed to explore the role of geostrophic ad-justment in the forecast gravity wave generation, as suggested in previous studies of this wave event. These fields did indicate flow imbalance, but this was merely the manifestation of the MPS-forced gravity wave.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The association of tornadoes and tornadic thunderstorms with surface boundaries has been recognized for several decades. However, little has been done to study this phenomenon in a systematic manner. This study uses a numerical cloud model {{to examine the effects of}} the interaction of simulated supercede thunderstorms with thermal boundaries on storm morphology and low-level rotation. This study differs from previous supercede modeling studies that use homogeneous initial conditions. A non-homogeneous initial condition is used to permit the introduction of a low-level thermal boundary into the model domain. This study focuses solely on the effects from increased baroclinicity associated with the boundary. The results indicate that thermal boundaries have a significant influence on supercede morphology that is somewhat consistent with previous observational studies. The storms interacting with boundaries have 'stronger updrafts, stronger low-level mesocyclones, and storm morons that are altered by the boundary. Surprisingly supercedes interacting with boundaries take longer to develop low-level mesocyclones than the homogeneous simulation. This behavior appears to result from the presence of the mesoscale <b>cool</b> <b>pool</b> retarding rear flank downdrafts reaching the surface as readily as in the homogenous simulation...|$|E

The physical processes involved in the mobilization of dust are described {{with the use of the}} integrated atmospheric-air quality RAMS/ICLAMS model. Dust is effectively produced due to the development of near surface vortices and increased turbulent mixing along the frontal line. Increased dust emissions and recirculation of the elevated particles inside the head of the density current result in the formation of a moving "dust wall". Transport of the dust particles in higher layers – outside of the density current – occurs mainly in three ways: (1) Uplifting of preexisting dust over the frontal line with the aid of the strong updraft (2) Entrainment at the upper part of the density current head due to turbulent mixing (3) Vertical mixing after the dilution of the system. The role of the dust in the associated convective cloud system was found to be limited. Proper representation of convective processes and dust mobilization requires the use of high resolution (cloud resolving) model configuration and online parameterization of dust production. Haboob-type dust storms are effective dust sources and should be treated accordingly in dust modeling applications...|$|E
