40|$|Temporal {{relationships}} are investigated among fabricated <b>cut</b> <b>prices,</b> carcass value, and fed cattle prices. Also, linkages between fed cattle and wholesale beef prices are examined using vector autoregressive (VAR) techniques. Results, using daily prices over the 1980 - 85 period, suggested that fabricated <b>cut</b> <b>prices</b> and cattle prices {{are related to}} the imputed carcass value, carcass quote, and fed cattle prices. In addition, three fabricated cuts dominate as leading indicators of fed cattle prices of most fabricated <b>cut</b> <b>prices.</b> They are strip loin and bottom and top round prices.

5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to <b>cut</b> <b>prices</b> and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will <b>cut</b> <b>prices</b> to a market clearing level.|$|R

50|$|An {{estate car}} by Abbott {{was added to}} the range {{on the eve of the}} Geneva Motor Show in March 1966, and in 1967, the Corsair {{underwent}} the Executive treatment like its smaller Cortina sibling, resulting in the 2000E model with dechromed flanks, which necessitated non-styled-in door handles, special wheel trims, reversing lights, a vinyl roof, and upgraded cabin fittings. The 2000E, priced at £1,008 in 1967, was positioned as a <b>cut</b> <b>price</b> alternative to the Rover 2000, the introduction of which had effectively defined a new market segment for four cylinder executive sedans in the UK three years earlier: the Corsair 2000E comfortably undercut the £1,357 Rover 2000 and the £1,047 Humber Sceptre.|$|E
40|$|The {{strategy}} Philip Morris {{adopted in}} 1993 featured a one-time, permanent, publicly announced <b>price</b> <b>cut,</b> an event {{referred to as}} Marlboro Friday. Little {{is known about the}} impact of permanent and publicly announced <b>price</b> <b>cuts</b> on consumer brand switching behaviors for an addictive product. In the context of Marlboro Friday, we investigate (1) how consumers' brand choices are affected by a permanent <b>price</b> <b>cut,</b> (2) whether differential and dynamic effects of permanent <b>price</b> <b>cuts</b> occur for different types of consumers, and (3) the implications of publicly announced permanent <b>price</b> <b>cuts</b> on consumer brand switching behavior in the long run. We develop a dynamic structural brand choice model that allows for consumer forward-looking behavior, learning, and addiction, and investigate how consumers adjusted their brand choice behaviors before and after this permanent <b>price</b> <b>cut.</b> Using unique consumer panel data pertaining to cigarette purchases before and after the event, we provide behavioral explanations of whether and how the drastic and permanent <b>price</b> <b>cut</b> represented an effective step to encourage brand switching for an addictive product and a necessary step for Philip Morris to combat the growing market share of generic brands.

25|$|Justice Breyer concurred {{with the}} majority's outcome but not its reasoning. He {{distinguished}} this case from Holmes, {{stating that the}} causal links here were more direct.

In Breyer's view, National <b>cut</b> <b>prices</b> by the amount of the sales tax and kept the money; this source of National's savings was irrelevant because the <b>price</b> <b>cut</b> itself was legitimate, and thus, Ideal could not prove a direct causal link.|$|R
5000|$|In late January 2012, Serbian governments Ministry of Education and Science (headed by cabinet {{minister}} Žarko Obradović and vice-minister Zoran Kostić, {{both from the}} Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)) sent out a notice to school boards across Serbia about free screenings of Parada for principals and teachers of elementary and secondary schools, essentially recommending the movie as a work that promotes tolerance. The idea initiated by the movies director Dragojević was to organize free screenings (the expense was covered by the film distributor and movie theater owners) for principals and teachers and then {{leave it up to}} their discretion whether they want to take their pupils to the cinema at a <b>cut</b> <b>price</b> as part of overall education on homosexuality. Dragojević managed to get the theater owners to cover the free screenings for principals and teachers because according to Zoran Cvetanović, the owner of Art vista theaters [...] "the potential of a number of teenagers seeing the film, even at a <b>cut</b> <b>price,</b> meant increased business for us, especially since that demographic was noticeably absent during Paradas commercial theatrical run". Some, such as Miodrag Sokić, the president of Belgrades gymnasia forum, criticized the fact that the Ministry decided to support someones private commercial project: [...] "In the last four years (since this ruling coalition has been in power), no other movie got a recommendation from the Ministry in this manner. Supporting a movie, even as an extracurricular activity, is meddling in the school curriculum and that is serious stuff. I dont blame the movies director Dragojević, but I really {{have a problem with the}} Ministrys recommendation".|$|E

Successful at first, by 1832 this business had also foundered {{as a result of a}} price war with the other Scottish banks and some large bad overseas debts. The Broadford factory and Shirley Manor had to be sold and he was forced into bankruptcy, thereby having to relinquish his parliamentary seat.

40|$|A {{reduction}} {{in the price of}} a product may improve the profit for the stockholders due to more demand for the same product. In this paper, three guidelines are offered to practitioners who are considering a <b>price</b> <b>cut.</b> First, a <b>price</b> reduction is justified only if the price elasticity of demand is less than a benchmark value, which is derived in this article. Second, there exists the optimum level of <b>price</b> <b>cut,</b> which maximizes the stockholders' wealth. Third, a declined profit margin after a <b>price</b> <b>cut</b> does not necessarily impair the stockholders' wealth. INTRODUCTION Companies often times <b>cut</b> the <b>price</b> of goods in the hope that a small {{reduction in}} price may lead to a substantial increase in the quantity demanded, and consequently a sizable gain in profit. Whether or not the price reduction may boost the profit depends upon the price elasticity of demand of the product under consideration.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a framework for}} analyzing the imperfect pricereversibility ("hysteresis") of oil demand. The oil demand reductions following the oil price increases of the 1970 s will not be completely reversed by the <b>price</b> <b>cuts</b> of the 1980 s, nor is it necessarily true that these partial demand reversals themselves will be reversed exactly by future price increases. We decompose price into three monotonic series: price increases to maximum historic levels, <b>price</b> <b>cuts,</b> and <b>price</b> recoveries (increases below historic highs). We would expect that the response to <b>price</b> <b>cuts</b> would be no greater than to price recoveries, which in turn would be no greater than for increases in maximum historic price. For evidence of imperfect price-reversibility, we test econometrically the following U. S. data: vehicle miles per driver, the fuel efficiency of the automobile fleet, and gasoline demand per driver. In each case, our econometric results allow us to reject the hypothesis of perfect price-reversibility. The data show smaller response to <b>price</b> <b>cuts</b> than to <b>price</b> increases. This has dramatic implications for projections of gasoline and oil demand, especially under low-price assumptions. ...|$|R
