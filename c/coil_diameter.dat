40|$|Magnetic Nanoparticles Imaging (MNI) {{is a new}} {{imaging method}} which uses {{magnetic}} nanoparticles as the contrast agent. The superparamagnetism of ferro- and ferrimaterial allowed the particles {{to act as a}} temporary magnet when an external excitation is applied. The imaging is based on the reconstruction of the measured relaxation time (magnetorelaxometry) from the sample by SQUID sensors after the applied field is switched off. To date, the imaging method is still not applicable on human due to many undetermined parameters of the diagnostic configuration. The equation of the reconstruction is generally ill-posed due to the involvement of many parameters in the configuration. Hence, the optimization is required in order to eliminate the unstable parameters of this imaging technique. In this thesis, the study of excitation coils’ configuration has been conducted with manipulation of the number coils, arrangement of <b>coils,</b> <b>diameter</b> of <b>coils</b> and the shape of coils. The results show that by increasing the number of coils will improve the correlation coefficient of the reconstruction. However, due to the limitation of the grid size, the size of the coils is another concerned criterion; hence, the total area of the coils in each grid must be smaller than the area of the grid. The correlation coefficients of the reconstruction with varying the <b>coils</b> <b>diameters</b> show an improvement with smaller <b>coils</b> <b>diameter.</b> This observation obeyed the algorithm of diameter optimization in this thesis. Besides, the examinations of the arrangement and shape of coils show that both these criteria are highly depending on the shape of the sample.

On the other hand, the examination of the possibility of applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) method on the <b>coils</b> <b>diameter</b> has been studied by constructing the algorithm of the magnetic field calculation.

[...] Therefore, by using resonance, the same amount of power can be transferred at greater distances, using the much weaker magnetic fields out in the peripheral regions ("tails") of the near fields (these are sometimes called evanescent fields).

50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing the wire, meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner <b>coil</b> <b>diameter,</b> into a predefined position. The wire places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the coil body and the wire guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since the wire always loses in cross-sectional area due to the wire drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for the max. possible wire diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of the wire and the coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even the wire guiding nozzle itself within the wire feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of the wire during the winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of the wire is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of the wire onto the winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that the wire leaves the wire guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside the wire that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|E
