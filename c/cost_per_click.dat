40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a measure of Facebook {{advertising}} efficiency. In general marketing role of Facebook is considered with special attention to the advertising. Advertising on Facebook is briefly introduced with possibilities of advertising targeting and its performance monitoring metrics. The current methods of efficiency measuring of online advertisement from the area of econometric modeling (specifically data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis) are mentioned and their suitability for use by small and medium enterprises is questioned. The composite efficiency index is proposed to measure online advertising efficiency and to give base for a comparison of online advertising campaigns. It is based on simple measures like click- through rate and <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>click,</b> to assure its simple usage and easy result comparison in conditions of small and medium enterprises. Proposed composite efficiency index is tested on sample data from the Slovak Facebook advertising market acquired by our own survey. The efficiency of Facebook advertising campaigns of Slovak companies, which supported our research and provided their data about particular advertising campaign, is measured by composite efficiency index and then compared with estimated data on other online forms of advertising in conditions of Slovak online advertising market. Results show higher Facebook advertising efficiency than efficiency of banner and contextual advertising in Slovakia. Also preferences and expectations about Facebook advertising are investigated by the survey. The highly positive attitude towards advertising on Facebook of Slovak companies was detected. Possible threats to the future of Facebook advertising and Facebook itself are indicated. In discussion are included topics for further research in this area. The main conclusion is the fact that Facebook can be powerful and effective marketing tool for reaching online population...|$|R

50|$|Keyword {{advertising}} {{is a form}} of online advertising in which an advertiser pays to have an advertisement appear in the results listing when a person uses a particular phrase to search the Web, typically by employing a search engine. The particular phrase is composed of one or more keyterms that is linked to one or more advertisements. The most common form or keyword advertising, focused on payment methods, is pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> (PPC), with other forms being <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> action (CPA) or <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> mille (CPM).|$|R
50|$|Website {{monetization}} is {{the process}} of converting existing traffic being sent to a particular website into revenue. The most popular ways of monetizing a website are by implementing pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> (PPC) and <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> impression (CPI/CPM) advertising. Various ad networks facilitate a webmaster in placing advertisements on pages of the website to benefit from the traffic the site is experiencing.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>click</b> {{advertising}} (e.g. AdWords, Yahoo! Search Marketing) overcomes {{this problem}} by charging advertisers only when the consumer clicks on the advertisement. However, due to increased competition, search keywords have become very expensive. A 2007 Doubleclick Performics Search trends report shows that there were nearly six times as many keywords with a <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>click</b> (CPC) of more than $1 in January 2007 than the prior year. The cost per keyword increased by 33% and the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>click</b> rose {{by as much as}} 55%.|$|E

50|$|The {{final step}} {{that led to}} {{auctioning}} off domain names was Google’s Pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> (PPC) auction model which allowed bidders to buy search terms. This allowed webpage owners to sponsor a keyword so that their ad could appear each time a user searched the term on Google, and thus increased {{the likelihood of the}} ‘clickthroughs’ their sponsor ad obtained. Gradually, as advertisement placement and sponsoring or trademarking search terms on the World Wide Web became a viable source of profit, so did domain names that attracted attention from Internet users and advertisers. Additionally, new business models for monetizing domain names are emerging. In addition to the Pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> (PPC) model, the <b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> action (CPA) or pay-per-action model is being used as a new strategy for online advertising.|$|R
30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of smart phones and mobile Internet, phone games become a huge entertainment market. The commercial objective of game carrier and developers (including individual developers and game companies) is to obtain profits and royalties from this emerging market. There are four major types {{of marketing and}} charging for phone games: the traditional purchase of software package still occupies a certain market, e.g., Infinity Blade; Purchase of game point cards is a new payment method which is often taken by Asian players, and the points consume according {{to the time of}} use; Payment by embedded advertisements is popular in phone games, but sometimes becomes annoying. For this kind of payoff, <b>Cost</b> <b>Per</b> Click/Mille/Action and <b>Click</b> Through Rate are the most important indicators on which researchers focus; In-APP purchase of game props, e.g., Fruit Ninjia, becomes attractive with the maturity of mobile payment platforms (e.g., Alipay and Paypal). In this paper, we focus on investigating the last type of trade mode and aim at increasing the conversion rate of props purchase in phone games.|$|R

The publisher is incentivized to seek out as many advertisers as possible, often on a bid-based system. Furthermore, Share of Voice bypasses the ethical dilemmas that come with PPC and CPI models, which are subject to abuse by click fraud, or Pay to Play tactics (advertorials, product placement, news coverage in exchange for ad purchases, etc) that are not always transparently paid ads.|$|R

25|$|Affiliates {{were among}} the {{earliest}} adopters of pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> advertising when the first pay-per-click search engines emerged during {{the end of the}} 1990s. Later in 2000 Google launched its pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> service, Google AdWords, which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> as an advertising channel. An increasing number of merchants engaged in pay <b>per</b> <b>click</b> advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates bidding on advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on those type of keywords. Some advertisers, however, did and still do embrace this behavior, {{going so far as to}} allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser's trademarks.|$|R
