50|$|Contribution margin-based pricing maximizes {{the profit}} derived from an {{individual}} product, based on {{the difference between the}} product's price and variable costs (the product's <b>contribution</b> margin per <b>unit),</b> and on one's assumptions regarding the relationship between the product's price and the number of units that can be sold at that price.

50|$|Assuming {{an inverse}} {{relationship}} between price and units sold (i.e., sales volume), {{as is the case}} for most products since a lower price will generally induce higher unit sales, the firm would assume likely unit sales levels at various price levels, calculate the <b>contribution</b> margin per <b>unit</b> for the product at each of those price levels, multiply the number of units by the corresponding <b>Contribution</b> Margin Per <b>Unit</b> at that price level and choose the highest result (i.e., the highest Contribution to Profit) to maximize profit.|$|R
5000|$|Contribution margin (CM), or dollar <b>contribution</b> per <b>unit,</b> is {{the selling}} {{price per unit}} minus the {{variable}} cost per unit. [...] "Contribution" [...] represents the portion of sales revenue that is not consumed by variable costs and so contributes to the coverage of fixed costs. This concept {{is one of the}} key building blocks of break-even analysis.|$|R

50|$|<b>Contribution</b> margin per <b>unit</b> is the {{difference}} between the price of a product and the sum of the variable costs of one unit of that product. Variable costs are all costs that will increase with greater unit sales of a product or decrease with fewer unit sales (i.e., leaving out fixed costs, which are costs that will not change with sales level over an assumed possible range of sales levels). Examples of variable costs are raw materials, direct labor (if such costs vary with sales levels), and sales commissions. The <b>contribution</b> margin per <b>unit</b> of each product multiplied by units sold equals the contribution to profit from sales of that product.|$|R

An asymmetric analysis further shows that <b>unit</b> <b>contribution</b> and advertising effectiveness affect positively, and discount rate and decay rate negatively, a competitor's rivals' advertising, but have effects in opposite directions regarding rivals' steady-state sales. The symmetric and asymmetric analyses also show that steady-state sales per competitor decline {{with the number of}} competitors in the oligopoly, while total oligopoly steady-state sales increase.

50|$|Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis (CVP): {{assuming}} the linear CVP model, the computation of Profit and Loss (Net Income) reduces as follows:where TC = TFC + TVC is Total Cost = Total Fixed Cost + Total Variable Cost and X is Number of Units.

5000|$|Following a {{matching}} {{principle of matching}} a portion of sales against variable costs, one can decompose sales as contribution plus variable costs, where contribution is [...] "what's left after deducting variable costs".

40|$|Reflective {{thinking}} {{based on}} experiential {{learning is a}} key skill required for the lifelong learner and the socially mature professional. Following several semesters employing a written reflective journal as an assessable task, a fourth-year engineering management unit adopted an online reflective journal. During the initial semester of use, an evaluation was undertaken to investigate student perceptions of the online journal. A summary of this previous work is presented here. Following three semesters of use of the online journal, {{an analysis of the}} student use of the journal was undertaken to investigate its <b>contribution</b> to <b>unit</b> learning outcomes. Based on the evaluation of student perceptions of the online reflective journal, it was found that a majority of students understood the purpose of the journal, and valued the journal in their learning; a majority of students read the journal entries of other students, and indicated that this assisted their learning; and the two most frequently reported ‘most useful’ aspects of the journal were the ‘enforced’ continuous revision of course material, and the ability to compare their understanding of the course material with that of other students. Based on a regression analysis of the factors related to student usage of the online reflective journal, {{it was found that the}} significant contributors to final unit mark where: prior academic performance; number of journal postings; and mode of study.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{previous}} work, {{we showed that}} the glottal source can be estimated from speech signals by computing the Zeros of the Z-Transform (ZZT). Decomposition was achieved by separating the roots inside (causal contribution) and outside (anticausal <b>contribution)</b> the <b>unit</b> circle. In order to guarantee a correct deconvolution, time alignment on the Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) was shown to be essential. This paper extends the formalism of ZZT by evaluating the Z-transform on a contour possibly different from the unit circle. A method is proposed for determining automatically this contour by inspecting the root distribution. The derived Zeros of the Chirp Z-Transform (ZCZT) -based technique {{turns out to be}} much more robust to GCI location errors. ...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{circuits}} often {{face the}} problem of classifying stimuli into discrete groups and making decisions based on such classifications. Neurons of these circuits can be distinguished according to their correlations with different features of stimulus or response, which allows defining sensory or motor neuronal types. In this study we define the third class of neurons, {{which is responsible for}} making decision. We suggest two descriptions for <b>contribution</b> of <b>units</b> to decision making: first, as a spatial derivative of correlations between neural activity and the decision; second, as an impact of variability in a given neuron on the response. These two definitions are shown to be equivalent, when they can be compared. We also suggest an experimental strategy for determining contributions to decision making, which uses electric stimulation with time- varying random current. Comment: 14 Figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBy {{following}} an empirical approach, this study proves that joint regional {{air pollution control}} (JRAPC) in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region will save the expense on air pollution control compared with a locally-based pollution control strategy. The evidences below were found. (A) Local pollutant concentration {{in some of the}} cities is significantly affected by emissions from their surrounding areas. (B) There is heterogeneity in the marginal pollutant concentration reduction cost among various districts {{as a result of the}} cities' varying <b>contribution</b> of <b>unit</b> emission reduction to the pollutant concentration reduction, and their diverse unit cost of emission reduction brought about by their different industry composition. The results imply that the cost-efficiency of air pollution control will be improved in China if the conventional locally based regime of air pollution control can shift to a regionally based one...|$|R
