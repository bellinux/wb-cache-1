40|$|Automated 3 D breast {{ultrasound}} (ABUS) is a valuable, non-ionising {{adjunct to}} X-ray mammography {{for breast cancer}} screening and diagnosis for women with dense breasts. High image quality is an important prerequisite for diagnosis {{and has to be}} guaranteed at the time of acquisition. The high throughput of images in a screening scenario demands for automated solutions. In this work, an automated image quality assessment system rating ABUS scans at the time of acquisition was designed and implemented. Quality assessment of present diagnostic ultrasound images has rarely been performed demanding thorough analysis of potential image quality aspects in ABUS. Therefore, a reader study was initiated, making two clinicians rate the quality of clinical ABUS images. The frequency of specific quality aspects was evaluated revealing that incorrect positioning and insufficiently applied <b>contact</b> <b>fluid</b> caused the most relevant image quality issues. The relative position of the nipple in the image, the acoustic shadow caused by the nipple as well as the shape of the breast contour reflect patient positioning and ultrasound transducer handling. Morphological and histogram-based features utilized for machine learning to reproduce the manual classification as provided by the clinicians. At 97 % specificity, the automatic classification achieved sensitivities of 59 %, 45 %, and 46 % for the three aforementioned aspects, respectively. The nipple is an important landmark in breast imaging, which is generally [...] -but not always correctly [...] -pinpointed by the technicians. An existing nipple detection algorithm was extended by probabilistic atlases and exploited for automatic detection of incorrectly annotated nipple marks. The nipple detection rate was increased from 82 % to 85 % and the classification achieved 90 % sensitivity at 89 % specificity. A lack of <b>contact</b> <b>fluid</b> between transducer and skin can induce reverberation patterns and acoustic shadows, which can possibly obscure lesions. Parameter maps were computed in order to localize these artefact regions and yielded a detection rate of 83 % at 2. 6 false positives per image. Parts of the presented work were integrated to clinical workflow making up a novel image quality assessment system that supported technicians in their daily routine by detecting images of insufficient quality and indicating potential improvements for a repeated scan while the patient was still in the examination room.

In this thesis, we describe work aimed at producing a series of multi-end functionalized polystyrene and polyisoprene additives {{with a wide range}} of molecular weights, carrying 1 to 3 fluoroalkyl groups that have been prepared by end capping the living chain ends of polymers prepared via anionic polymerization reactions. The resulting polymers have a well-defined structure with interesting surface modifying properties. We have also carried out hydrogenation of end functionalized polyisoprene to form poly(ethylene-alt-propylene) with the same functional group. The resulting polymers have been used as additives in an attempt to render the surface of polymer films hydrophobic/lipophobic and we have characterized these polymer films using static contact angle measurements with water as the main <b>contact</b> <b>fluid.</b> We have systematically studied the effect of additive molecular weight, concentration and annealing conditions on the surface properties. It has been discovered that these additives undergo rapid adsorption to a surface or interface and significantly enhance surface properties. In addition, to support the contact angles results, elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) and Rutherford backscattering analysis (RBS) have been carried out to acquire further quantitative evidence of surface segregation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that ultrasound covers and sonographic gels, used during vaginal ultrasound, are toxic for mouse embryonic development in vitro. A prospective randomized design was used on pronucleate ova of F 1 hybrid CBA x C 57 Bl female mice. The mice were superovulated with pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin and human chorionic gonadotrophin and mated with CBA x C 57 Bl males. The pronucleate ova were randomly divided between culture media with the addition of commercially available ultrasound covers and sonographic gels in different concentrations. As controls and potential alternatives, plastic polyethylene bags and paraffin oil were tested simultaneously. Embryo-toxicity was assessed by documenting cleavage capacity, blastocyst formation and embryo degeneration in vitro. Exposure of culture medium to the ultrasound covers and sonographic gels tested resulted in a severely reduced cleavage capacity, a high incidence of embryo degeneration and absent or impaired blastocyst formation. This toxic effect could be reduced by high dilutions in vitro. In contrast, plastic polyethylene bags and paraffin oil had no influence on in-vitro development of mouse ova. We conclude that commercially available ultrasound latex covers and sonographic gels are toxic for mouse embryos and can potentially influence embryonic development during infertility treatment. It is safer to perform vaginal ultrasonic measurements using non-toxic paraffin oil (as <b>contact</b> <b>fluid)</b> and plastic polyethylene bags (as ultrasonic cover). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} herein {{the synthesis}} {{of a series of}} multi-end functionalized poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) additives bearing two or three C 8 F 17 fluoroalkyl (CF) groups, designed as additives to modify surface properties. The PVP additives were prepared by reversible addition–fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization, with end functionality imparted via the use of CF functionalized chain transfer agents (CTAs). The resulting PVP additives, when used in modest quantities dispersed in thin films of an unmodified PVP matrix significantly reduce the surface energy, rendering their surfaces more hydrophobic and lipophobic. This is achieved by virtue of the low surface energy of the pendant C 8 F 17 end groups which cause the additive to spontaneously surface segregate during the spin coating process. The resulting thin films have been characterized by static contact angle measurements using dodecane as the <b>contact</b> <b>fluid,</b> and the impact of additive molecular weight, matrix molecular weight, the number of CF groups and additive concentration upon surface properties is reported herein. Significant increases in contact angle were observed with increasing additive concentration, up to a critical aggregation concentration (CAC). Increasing the number of CF groups (from 2 to 3); reducing additive molecular weight or increasing the matrix molecular weight, resulted in increased contact angles and hence surface lipophobicity. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) analysis was performed on films containing varying concentrations of additive, in order to quantitatively measure the near-surface fluorine concentration of these films. The results of these experiments were in excellent agreement with those obtained by contact angle analysis, confirming the surface activity and low surface energy of the additives...|$|E

We have examined sandstones from the Miller reservoir and mudrocks, which form the vertical seal, using techniques adapted from investigations of oilfield reservoir quality.

A scoping study of equilibrium geochemical modelling, with enforced reducing chemistry, predicts that CO 2 addition makes little {{change to the}} assemblage of minerals present, but could produce changes of mineral ratios. Carbonate cement is common in the reservoir. Stable isotope analyses provide a fingerprint of C and O origins, and show no difference from standard burial cementation trends.

Prediction of C, O isotope values in calcites formed from current CO 2 is unlike these measured values. We interpret that there is no direct evidence of abundant ancient CO 2 leakage vertically, although reduced reservoir pressures show that leakage has occurred – possibly laterally.

The additives were prepared by endcapping the living chain ends of polymers prepared via living anionic polymerisation. The resulting polymers have been used as additives to render the surface of polymer films hydrophobic/lipophobic and we have characterised these polymer films using static contact angle measurements with water as the <b>contact</b> <b>fluid.</b> We have found that the additive molecular weight, the number of CF groups, additive concentration and annealing conditions have a significant impact upon the resulting surface properties. Increasing the additive concentration and/or number of CF groups resulted in higher contact angles whereas increasing the molecular weight of additive reduced contact angles and surface hydrophobicity. It has been discovered that these additives undergo rapid adsorption to the surface of a thin film in the time taken to produce the film by spin coating and the result is significantly enhanced surface properties. Annealing polystyrene films above the glass transition temperature revealed some interesting behaviour in so much that it demonstrated that on many occasions it is preferable to anneal films containing very small quantities of additive rather than to simply add greater quantities of additive. In addition to contact angles measurements, Rutherford backscattering (RBS) analysis has been carried out on examples of modified poly(isoprene) films to quantitatively analyse the effect of additive molecular weight and number of fluoroalkyl groups on the near surface elemental composition of the modified thin films and confirming the relationship (described above) between these additive molecular parameters and surface adsorption.

40|$|Major tin-tungsten {{deposits}} in Portugal {{are related to}} intrusions of the Younger Series (300 - 280 Ma) of Hercynian granitoids. Mineralized granites are 'specialized' by a specific increase or decrease of major, minor and trace element contents in comparison with non-mineralized occurrences. Component analysis is used to make distinctions between the various geochemical types of barren and mineralized granites (Chapter 2). A one-component model is characterized by positive loadings for Rb, Sn, Cs, Li, Nb, F, Ta, Zn, Wand P 20 S and negative loadings for Zr, Ba, Ti 02 and Sr. In this one-component model the component scores increase from barren to highly specialized granites. In a two-component model component 1 (F, Li, Cs, Rb, Zn, Sn, P 20 S, Nb and W) expresses a hydrothermal influence upon the granites, whereas component 2 (Ti 02, Ba, Zr, Sr, -Ta, -Nb, -Rb and -Sn) possibly represents the magmatic differentiation trend. In this model {{the composition of the}} individual granites concentrate in one of several fields according to their loadings by the element parameters. Muscovite granites, albitized and greisenized granites deviate clearly in composition from the more common granites. The geochemical variability of granites, greisens and schists of the Panasqueira tungsten-tin deposit is investigated in great detail (Chapter 3). The trace element contents of the Panasqueira cupola are compared with those of other granite occurrences in the surroundings. Only ore-bearing granites show a geochemical differentiation concurrent with mineralization. The major elements illustrate the general chemical evolution from muscovite-albite granite to greisenized granite; trace elements, however, show in addition distinct groups of granitoids. The general trend in the granitoids of Panasqueira is an increase in Rb, Li, F, Sn, Cs, W, Fe 203 ' P 20 S, Zn, As, Nb, Ta and Cu contents while Na 20, CaO, MgO, Sr, Zr, Ba and Ti 02 contents decrease. Rare earths are strongly depleted in the greisen. This alteration in composition is the result of metasomatic and hydrothermal processes; closed in an early stage but thereafter opened due to the development of sub-horizontal joints. The schist along the hydrothermal ore veins at Panasqueira is affected as well by the mineralizing fluids in the veins; tourmaline and sericite alteration zones contain elevated amounts of the orerelated elements Rb, Li, Cs, Sn, Wand Na 20 and K 20. Schist samples were also taken at the surface and used for litho-geochemical exploration purposes. The same elements, when plotted in contour maps, outline the outcropping ore zones very well and {{can be used as a}} tool in geochemical exploration (Chapter 4). A major part of this investigation is dedicated to the physical conditions under which the mineralization of Panasqueira was formed (Chapter 5). Homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in the minerals of Panasqueira point to an interval between 325 and 2500 C for the early stages; salinities are between 5 and 10 wt% NaC 1. In the final hydrothermal stage homogenization temperatures dropped to about 100 oC; the salinity is also lower, down to 3 wt% or less. Due to trapping of C 02 -rich fluids against an impermeable granite-schist <b>contact,</b> <b>fluid</b> pressures point to an 'overpressure' of about 1 kbar before opening of the joint system. Opening of this joint system caused vigorous boiling of the fluids in the ore veins at a depth of about 1800 m. Gas chromatographic analyses show next to C 02 the presence of CH 4 and N 2 ' The presence of CH 4 suggests a reducing environment during ore deposition. The origin of the CH 4 and N 2 is possibly found by assimilation of schist containing organic matter. Stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen indicate a homogeneous isotopic source for the early fluids. High overpressures in the earliest stage and about constant oxygen, carbon and nitrogen isotopes strongly favour a 'magmatic' origin for the initial mineralizing fluids. Oxygen and carbon isotopes of the fluids differ strongly in the latest stage and point to a large influx of meteoric water...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The demand for oil {{has been on the}} high in the recent past and will continue as search for sustainable alternative energy sources intensifies. The exploration and exploitation of oil from subsurface reservoirs have posed several environmental challenges which include flaring and improper water disposal to name a few, caused by excessive production of gas and water. Hence it is important to establish a reservoir performance monitoring scheme that will ensure that appropriate fluids are produced from the reservoir within the economic producing life of each well draining a given reservoir by monitoring the <b>fluid</b> <b>contact</b> levels. Furthermore, appropriate reservoir monitoring will help to improve productivity and recovery of old wells, calibrate predictive reservoir models and identify opportunities for optimum reservoir development. A key tool used in reservoir performance monitoring is the post production log, particularly the Pulsed Neutron Capture (PNC) and Pulsed Neutron Spectroscopy (PNS) logs which make use of high energy neutrons to determine the <b>fluid</b> <b>contacts</b> in the reservoir. This campaign however is very expensive; hence an alternative and less expensive method of determining and predicting the present and future <b>fluid</b> <b>contacts</b> will be discussed. This involves using calibrated material balance models to predict the <b>fluid</b> <b>contacts</b> based on the pore volume (voidage) replacement by the displacing fluid. This will help in generating <b>fluid</b> <b>contacts</b> on a more frequent time interval...|$|R
