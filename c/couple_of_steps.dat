30|$|The use of one-pot {{protocols}} {{mediated by}} multiple enzymes without {{any need for}} isolation steps (so-called cascade reactions) and/or continuous flow processes can offer significant benefits with respect to physic-chemical conversion processes. These include decreased unit operations, decreased reactor volume, increased volumetric and space-time yields, and shortened cycle times, as well as inherent advantages of flow reactions such as simpler work-up and more controllable reaction conditions [5]. Multi-enzyme systems are complex in nature, but unique synergistic effects and the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> may even push unfavorable equilibria towards the formation of desired products under cascade-type processes (i.e. continuous flow conditions). However, major problems of cascading enzymatic reactions need to be overcome, including a generally lower stability and recyclability of the enzymes (as different enzymes are used under different reaction conditions). Heterogeneous immobilization techniques can overcome these issues, which will be discussed later.|$|R
40|$|Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are {{essential}} virulence determinants of many pathogenic bacteria. Escherichia coli group 1 CPSs provide paradigms for widespread surface polysaccharide assembly systems in Gram-negative bacteria. In these systems, complex carbohydrate polymers must be exported across the periplasm and outer membrane {{to the cell}} surface. Group 1 CPS export requires oligomers of the outer membrane protein, Wza, for translocation across the outer membrane. Assembly also depends on Wzc, an inner membrane tyrosine autokinase known to regulate export and synthesis of group 1 CPS. Here, we provide a structural view of a complex comprising Wzc and Wza that spans the periplasm, connecting {{the inner and outer}} membranes. Examination of transmembrane sections of the complex suggests that the periplasm is compressed at the site of complex formation. An important feature of CPS production is the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> involved in biosynthesis and export.

2500|$|A bowler reaches his {{delivery}} stride {{by means}} of a [...] "run-up" [...] and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being [...] "in play". Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over [...] and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making use of the seam of the ball so that it [...] "swings" [...] (or [...] "curves") in flight.

40|$|Abstract: Fine {{structural}} and energetic details {{embedded in the}} DNA base sequence, such as intrinsic curvature, {{are important to the}} packaging and processing of the genetic material. Here we investigate the internal dynamics of a 200 bp closed circular molecule with natural curvature using a newly developed normal-mode treatment of DNA in terms of neighboring base-pair “step” parameters. The intrinsic curvature of the DNA is described by a 10 bp repeating pattern of bending distortions at successive base-pair steps. We vary the degree of intrinsic curvature and the superhelical stress on the molecule and consider the normal-mode fluctuations of both the circle and the stable figure- 8 configuration under conditions where the energies of the two states are similar. To extract the properties due solely to curvature, we ignore other important features of the double helix, such as the extensibility of the chain, the anisotropy of local bending, and the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> parameters. We compare the computed normal modes of the curved DNA model with the corresponding dynamical features of a covalently closed duplex of the same chain length constructed from naturally straight DNA and with the theoretically predicted dynamical properties of a naturally circular, inextensible elastic rod, i. e., an O-ring. The cyclic molecules with intrinsic curvature are found to be more deformable under superhelical stres...|$|R

Spatial <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> recruitment processes provides a direct measure of potential vegetation change; tight coupling indicates vegetation is changing little as each recruitment step is spatially similar to the step previous, whereas weak coupling indicates dynamic change as steps are not spatially related.
