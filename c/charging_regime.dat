GNER's case failed principally because the High Court determined that not only did European law permit the Rail Regulator to establish a <b>charging</b> <b>regime</b> for open-access operators which was different from the one which applies to franchised operators (such as GNER), in this case not imposing a fixed charge on open-access operators, but that if he had not done so, he would have been acting illegally because of the very different conditions under which open-access operators and franchised operators get access to the network.

If consumers are poorly informed, banking competition is weakened and prices for banking services are high. We discuss various regulatory interventions to improve market performance.

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a general {{theoretical}} framework for multiple electron transfer to solvated nanoparticles and their characterization via linear sweep voltammetry. A direct connection is {{made between the}} peak potentials observed in voltammograms and the electronic structure of solvated particles. Two major contributions to the voltammogram extracted electronic structure properties are established to be the quantization of electron kinetic levels (epsilon(T)) and the single electron charging cost (U), both of which display a significant variation with nanoparticle dimensionality. The dimensional dependences of these energetics {{is reflected in the}} spacings between voltammetric current peaks. The simultaneous role played by U (typically associated with Coulomb blockade) and epsilon(T) at all dimensions advances our understanding of their relative contributions in the so-called molecular redox <b>charging</b> <b>regime</b> and the nanoparticle <b>charging</b> <b>regime.</b> These general physical properties are investigated in a model solvated "particle-in-a-box" system, consisting of finite length armchair semiconducting carbon nanotubes. While implemented within a model system, the physics underlying these energetics are expected to be general to all solvated species. However, the scan rate dependence of the peak potentials in voltammetry under a considerable reorganization energy (lambda) complicates direct correlations between redox-active energetics and peak spacing features. We argue that this scan rate dependence can be resolved by ultrafast voltammetry. Through combined ultrafast and conventional voltammetry, the solvated electronic structure contributions of reactants (including epsilon(T), U and lambda) should be accessible (as shown in the model system). The proposed solvated electronic structure physics and voltammetric extraction technique is general in scope and should be executable on any solvated nanomaterial system participating in heterogeneous outer-sphere reactions...|$|E
