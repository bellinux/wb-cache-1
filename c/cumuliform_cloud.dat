5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming {{over water}} that is, {{in its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over water that is connected to a <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud.</b> While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over {{a body of}} water. Some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud</b> and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale, tornado-like circulations {{can occur}} near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense {{wildfires}} are called fire whirls. They {{are not considered}} tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud</b> above. Fire whirls usually are {{not as strong as}} tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.|$|E
25|$|These {{are small}} {{detached}} fair-weather <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> that have nearly horizontal bases and flattened tops, {{and do not}} produce rain showers.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> {{generally}} {{appear in}} isolated heaps or tufts. [...] They {{are the product}} of localized but generally free-convective lift where there are no inversion layers in the atmosphere to limit vertical growth. In general, small <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> tend to indicate comparatively weak instability. [...] Larger cumuliform types are a sign of moderate to strong atmospheric instability and convective activity. Depending on their vertical size, clouds of the cumulus genus type may be low-level or multi-level with moderate to towering vertical extent.|$|R
500|$|Some <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> {{have been}} {{discovered}} on most other planets in the solar system. On Mars, the Viking Orbiter detected cirrocumulus and stratocumulus clouds forming via convection primarily near the polar icecaps. The Galileo space probe detected massive cumulonimbus clouds near the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. <b>Cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> have also been detected on Saturn. In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft determined that cumulus clouds near Saturn's south pole {{were part of a}} cyclone over [...] in diameter. The Keck Observatory detected whitish cumulus clouds on Uranus. Like Uranus, Neptune has methane cumulus clouds. Venus, however, {{does not appear to have}} cumulus clouds.|$|R
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
500|$|A tornado is [...] "a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air, {{in contact with}} the ground, either pendant from a <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud</b> or underneath a <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud,</b> and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud". For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. Tornado refers to the vortex of wind, not the condensation cloud.|$|E

40|$|Rainfall intensities {{measured}} {{at a few}} stations in Kerala during 2001 – 2005 using a disdrometer {{were found to be}} in reasonable agreement with the total rainfall measured using a manual rain gauge. The temporal distributions of rainfall intensity at different places and during different months show that rainfall is of low intensity (< 10 mm/hr), 65 % to 90 % of the time. This could be an indication of the relative prevalence of stratiform and <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds.</b> Rainfall was of intensity < 5 mm/hr for more than 95 % of the time in Kochi in July 2002, which was a month seriously deficient in rainfall, indicating that the deficiency was probably due to the relative absence of <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds.</b> Cumulative distribution graphs are also plotted and fitted with the Weibull distribution. The fit parameters do not appear to have any consistent pattern. The higher intensities also contributed significantly to total rainfall most of the time, except in Munnar (a hill station). In this analysis also, the rainfall in Kochi in July 2002 was found to have less presence of high intensities. This supports the hypothesis that the rainfall deficiency was probably caused by the absence of conditions that favoured the formation of <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Roll {{clouds and}} {{associated}} roll convection, are fairly common {{features of the}} atmospheric boundary layer.

5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds,</b> which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{agent is}} the {{convective}} upward motion of air caused by daytime solar heating at surface level. [...] Airmass instability {{allows for the}} formation of <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> that can produce showers if the air is sufficiently moist.

50|$|The {{flanking}} line {{is generated}} by the downburst that builds a cold air wedge beneath the warmer airmass {{in front of the}} thunderstorm. This warm air is forced upward and generates <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> when the air column becomes saturated.These feeder clouds will merge with the main cumulonimbus and will regenerate the storm. These new feeder clouds are located at the west or southwest of the main cloud.|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} increasing {{development of}} whole sky imagers enables {{temporal and spatial}} high-resolution sky observations. One application already performed in most cases is the estimation of fractional sky cover. A distinction between different cloud types, however, is still in progress. Here, an automatic cloud classification algorithm is presented, based {{on a set of}} mainly statistical features describing the color as well as the texture of an image. The k-nearest-neighbour classifier is used due to its high performance in solving complex issues, simplicity of implementation and low computational complexity. Seven different sky conditions are distinguished: high thin clouds (cirrus and cirrostratus), high patched <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> (cirrocumulus and altocumulus), stratocumulus <b>clouds,</b> low <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds,</b> thick clouds (cumulonimbus and nimbostratus), stratiform clouds and clear sky. Based on the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation the algorithm achieves an accuracy of about 97 %, outperforming previous algorithms with accuracies of at most 62 %. An additional test run of random images is presented, still yielding a success rate of about 75 %, or up to 88 % if only "serious" errors with respect to radiation impact are considered. Reasons for the decrement in accuracy are discussed, and ideas to further improve the classification results, especially in problematic cases, are investigated...|$|R
5000|$|Cumulus humilis is a <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud</b> {{with little}} {{vertical}} extent that is {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "fair weather cumulus" [...] and common in the summer.

40|$|Over two {{thousand}} individual cloud droplet size distributions were measured with an optical cloud particle spectrometer flown on the NASA Convair 990 aircraft.

5000|$|Pyrocumulonimbus are <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> {{that can}} form {{over a large}} fire and that are {{particularly}} dry. When the higher levels of the atmosphere are cooler, and the surface is thus warmed to extreme temperatures due to a wildfire, volcano, or other event, convection will occur, and produce clouds and lightning.

This increases the voltage difference between the base {{and the top of}} the cloud, helping to produce lightning.|$|R

50|$|Landspouts share {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} and development process {{to that of}} waterspouts, usually taking {{the form of a}} translucent and highly laminar helical tube.

Landspouts are most common in semi-arid climates characterized by high cloud bases and considerable low-level instability.

40|$|Forecast systems provide {{decision}} support for end-users {{ranging from the}} solar energy industry to municipalities concerned with road safety. Pavement temperature is an important variable when considering vehicle response to various weather conditions. A complex, yet direct relationship exists between tire and pavement temperatures. Literature has shown that as tire temperature increases, friction decreases which affects vehicle performance. Many forecast systems suffer from inaccurate radiation forecasts resulting {{in part from the}} inability to model different types of clouds and their influence on radiation. This research focuses on forecast improvement by determining how cloud type impacts pavement temperature and the amount of shortwave radiation reaching the surface. A preliminary simple radiative transfer model sensitivity study was conducted to determine the relative magnitude of cloud radiative forcing. The study region is the Great Plains where surface radiation data were obtained from the High Plains Regional Climate Center’s Automated Weather Data Network stations. Pavement temperature data were obtained from the Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System. Cloud type identification was possible via the Naval Research Laboratory Cloud Classification algorithm and clouds were subsequently sorted into five distinct groups; clear conditions, low clouds, middle clouds, high <b>clouds</b> and <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds.</b> Distribution and correlation analyses during the daytime in June 2011 revealed that the median pavement temperatures for clear conditions are 40. 9 °C, followed by <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> at 34. 9 °C, low clouds at 31. 5 °C, high clouds at 27. 9 °C and the coolest group is middle clouds at 23. 7 °C. Similarly, distribution analyses identified maximum median observed surface radiation for clear conditions is 919. 0 Wm- 2, followed by <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> at 800. 0 Wm- 2, low clouds at 750. 0 Wm- 2, high clouds at 675. 1 Wm- 2 and the least amount of radiation is associated with middle clouds at 388. 4 Wm- 2. These pavement temperatures and surface radiation observations were strongly correlated with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0. 83. A comparison between cloud‑type group identified and cloud cover observed from satellite images provided a measure of confidence in the results and identified cautions with using satellite-based cloud detection. These relationships will be used to develop future model sensitivity analyses to assimilate cloud information directly into pavement temperature energy balance models. Adviser: Mark R. Anderso...|$|R

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by several examples...|$|E
40|$|An {{archive of}} land-based, surface-observed cloud reports has been updated and now spans 39 years from 1971 through 2009. Cloud-type {{information}} at weather stations {{is available in}} individual reports or in long-term, seasonal, and monthly averages. A shift to a new data source and the automation of cloud reporting in some countries has {{reduced the number of}} available stations; however this dataset still represents most of the global land area. Global average trends of cloud cover suggest a small decline in total cloud cover, on the order of- 0. 4 % per Decade. Declining clouds in middle latitudes at high and middle levels appear responsible for this trend. An analysis of zonal cloud cover changes suggests poleward shifts of the jet streams in both hemispheres. The observed displacement agrees with other studies. Changes seen in cloud types associated with the Indian monsoon are consistent with previous work suggesting that increased pollution (black carbon) may be affecting monsoonal precipitation, causing drought in North India. A similar analysis over northern China does not show an obvious aerosol connection. Past reports claiming a shift from stratiform to <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud</b> types over Russia were apparently partially based on spurious data. A tradeoff of stratiform and <b>cumuliform</b> <b>cloud</b> cover is still observed, but muted, over much of northern Eurasia. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of large-scale (stratus-type) clouds is more physically based, they form when the relative humidity reaches some prescribed value. Still, sub grid scale processes {{need to be}} taken into account. Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the cloud fraction can be related to a critical relative humidity of 70% for stratus-type clouds, and at or above 80% for <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds,</b> reflecting the sub grid scale variation that would occur in the real world. Portions of the precipitation parameterization include the condensation rate, energy exchanges dealing with the change of state from water vapor into liquid drops, and the microphysical component which controls the rate of change from water vapor to water droplets.|$|R
50|$|Cirrostratus clouds {{sometimes}} {{signal the}} approach of a warm front if they form after cirrus and spread from one area across the sky, and thus may be signs that precipitation might follow in the next 12 to 24 hours or as soon as 6-8 hours if the front is fast moving. If the cirrostratus is broken fibratus it can mean that the front is weak and that stratus rather than nimbostratus will be the precipitating cloud (meaning drizzle or snow grains instead of moderate rain or snow). Cumulus humilis or stratocumulus clouds are often found below cirrostratus formations, due to the stable air associated with cirrostratus creating an inversion and restricting convection, causing <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> to become flattened. Contrails also tend to spread out and can be visible for {{up to an hour}} in cirrostratus.|$|R
5000|$|Stratus {{clouds are}} {{low-level}} clouds characterized by horizontal layering with a uniform base, {{as opposed to}} convective or <b>cumuliform</b> <b>clouds</b> that are formed by rising thermals. More specifically, the term stratus is used to describe flat, hazy, featureless clouds of low altitude varying in color from dark gray to nearly white. The word [...] "stratus" [...] comes from the Latin prefix [...] "strato-", meaning [...] "layer". Stratus clouds may produce a light drizzle or {{a small amount of}} snow. These clouds are essentially above-ground fog formed either through the lifting of morning fog or through cold air moving at low altitudes over a region. Some call these clouds [...] "high fog" [...] for the fog-like cloud. While light rain may fall, this cloud does not indicate much meteorological activity.|$|R
