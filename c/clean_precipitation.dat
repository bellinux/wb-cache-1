40|$|Determination {{of water}} {{infiltration}} capacity of ground soils and rocks represents {{important part of}} design and construction procedures of the facilities for the infiltration of <b>clean</b> <b>precipitation</b> water. With their help percolation capacity of ground as well as response of the infiltration facilities to the inflowing precipitation water is estimated. Comparing to other in situ hydrogeological tests they {{can be understood as}} simple. However, in every day’s practiceseveral problems during their on site application and desk interpretation can arise. Paper represents review of existingpractical engineering procedures during the performance of percolation tests. Procedures are described for the borehole and shaft percolation tests execution and calculation theory for stationary and non‑stationary percolation tests are given. Theory is illustrated with practical exercises. Interpretations of typical departures from theoretical presumptions according to Hvorslev test of non-stationary test are illustrated...|$|E
40|$|A simple HPLC/UV {{method was}} {{developed}} for {{the determination of the}} anticancer candidate LaSOM 65 in rat plasma. Samples were <b>cleaned</b> by protein <b>precipitation</b> with acetonitrile (recovery > 95 %), after which they were subjected to chromatography under the isocratic elution of an acetonitrile:water (45 : 55, &# 957;/&# 957;) solution with detection at 303 nm. The method was linear (r² > 0. 98) over the concentration range (0. 05 - 2 µg mL- 1) with intra- and inter-day precision ranging from 9. 6 % to 13. 6 % and 4. 3 % to 5. 4 %, respectively. The accuracy of the method ranged from 85 % to 113. 6 %, and it showed sufficient sensitivity to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of LaSOM 65 after intravenous administration to Wistar rats...|$|R
40|$|Issue: The wet {{grinding}} process uses a slurry of ground tire or industrial rubber mixed in a water slurry. This technology is proprietary and unique to the wet processes used at Rouse Rubber, Inc., Vicksburg, MS and NRB Materials, Chambersburg, PA. The volume of water used is significant and requires a waste water permit for disposal. Best Practice: This best practice covers {{the handling of the}} waste water used in the grinding and shredding of recycled rubber produced by wet or solution grinding (Note that the process is proprietary and manufacturers are reluctant to disclose information due to the competitive nature of the business). The {{wet grinding}} technique involves the addition of a fine-mesh ground tire or industrial products rubber between two grinding rolls. The slurry mixture stays between the grinding rolls until it is reduced in particle size to that desired. The final size is controlled by a screen placed over the exit port of the grinder. The water is exposed to all of the organic chemicals, zinc salts, and fine particles of rubber that are in the rubber compound. Most of these have a low solubility in water, but some do get dissolved and/or suspended. Zinc Stearate has a special affinity for dissolving in water. Implementation: All water used in the grinding portion of the process is contained, <b>cleaned</b> by <b>precipitation</b> of zinc salts, and filtered to remove fine, suspended particles of rubber contaminants in th...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} the noise on {{hydrological}} data is inevitable, which reduces the efficiency of Data-Driven Models (DDMs). Despite of this fact that the DDMs such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are capable of nonlinear functional mapping between a set of input and output variables, but refining of the time series through data pre-processing methods can provide with the possibility to increase the performance of these set of models. The main objective {{of this study is}} to propose a new method called Optimized Threshold-Based Wavelet De-noising technique (OTWD) to de-noise hydrological time series and improve the prediction accuracy while the DDM is being used. For this purpose, in the first step, Wavelet-ANN (WNN) model was developed for identifying suitable wavelet function and maximum decomposition level. Afterward, sub-signals of original precipitation time series which were determined in the first step were de-noised by using of OTWD technique. Therefore, these <b>clean</b> sub-signals of <b>precipitation</b> time series were imposed as input data to the ANN to predict the precipitation one time step ahead. The results showed that OTWD technique could improve the efficiency of WNN model dramatically; this outcome was reported by the different efficiency criterions such as Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE[*]=[*] 0. 92), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE[*]=[*] 0. 0103), coefficient correlation of linear regression (R[*]=[*] 0. 93), Peak Value Criterion (PVC[*]=[*] 0. 021) and Low Value Criterion (LVC[*]=[*] 0. 026). The best fitted WNN model in comparison by proposed model showed weaker performance by the NSE, RMSE, R, PVC and LVC values of 0. 86, 0. 043, 0. 87, 0. 034 and 0. 045, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiative}} {{properties of}} sub-tropical marine stratocumulus, which cover large regions and affect the global climate, {{are influenced by}} the presence of drizzle, aerosols, and cloud-top entrainment, all of which are coupled. VOCALS, the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study, is examining the climate system of the southeast Pacific to reduce uncertainties in current and future climate projections, especially those associated with marine stratocumulus and coupled ocean-atmosphere processes. As part of VOCALS-UK we are investigating the small-scale structure and microphysics of marine stratocumulus, and hence its radiative properties, by using the UK Met Office Large Eddy Model (LEM). The model simulations are validated against measurements from the BAe- 146 research aircraft obtained during the VOCALS field campaign over the southeast Pacific in October and November 2008. We have incorporated the new Morrison microphysics scheme into the LEM and compared simulations with the Morrison scheme to those from the LEM standard bulk microphysics. Simulations with the Morrison scheme tend to produce a deeper marine stratocumulus with increased Liquid Water Path (LWP), but reduced precipitation compared to the standard LEM scheme. The cloud droplet effective radii (Re) is increased as not all the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are activated, so that radiative cooling at the cloud tops, vertical mixing and cloud top entrainment are all reduced. Overall, results from the Morrison scheme are in better agreement with the measurements. We then carried out sensitivity studies to quantify the effects of increased CCN number concentration, entrainment of clean air at cloud top, and precipitation on the simulated clouds and their radiative properties, including the inhomogenity over different domain sizes. Increased CCN results in reduced Re, increased albedo, cloud top cooling, vertical mixing and entrainment, and reduced LWP, inhomogeneity and <b>precipitation.</b> Entrainment of <b>clean</b> air results in slightly increased Re, reduced albedo, cooling, vertical mixing, entrainment and LWP, and increased inhomogeneity and precipitation. Precipitation removes liquid water from the cloud, but evapouration of the raindrops then moistens and cools the air below, reducing LWP, vertical mixing and albedo, and increasing cloud layer inhomogeneity. Furthermore the effects are coupled with increased CCN leading to reduced precipitation, and precipitation removing CCN. The amount of horizontal inhomogeneity in the albedo of the simulated cloud tops over different domain sizes is also examined. Increasing CCN reduces the inhomogeneity across all domain sizes, while both the entrainment of <b>clean</b> air and <b>precipitation</b> increase the inhomogeneity with the greatest increases over the largest domains...|$|R
