5000|$|When you add a <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> to {{a camera}} which is {{focusing}} to infinity, and you don't change the focus adjustment, the focus {{will move to}} a distance which is equal to the focal length of the <b>close-up</b> <b>lens.</b> This is the maximal working distance at which {{you will be able to}} take a picture with the <b>close-up</b> <b>lens.</b> It suffices to divide 1 by D, the diopter value of the <b>close-up</b> <b>lens,</b> to get this maximal working distance in meters: ...|$|E

5000|$|In photography, a {{close-up}} filter, <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> or macro filter {{is a simple}} secondary lens used to enable macro photography without requiring a specialised primary lens. They work identically to reading glasses, allowing any primary lens to focus more closely. It is actually more appropriate to use the <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> terminology {{as it is a}} lens and not a filter, although close-up lenses typically mount on the filter thread of the primary lens, and are manufactured and sold by suppliers of photographic filters. Some manufacturers refer to their close-up lenses as diopters, after the unit of measurement of their optical power.|$|E
50|$|While some single-element <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> produce {{images with}} severe aberrations, {{there are also}} {{high-quality}} <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> composed as achromatic doublets which are capable of producing excellent images, with fairly low loss of sharpness.|$|R
50|$|<b>Close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are usually}} {{specified}} by their optical power, the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Several <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> {{may be used}} in combination; the optical power of the combination is the sum of the optical powers of the component lenses; a set of lenses of +1, +2, and +4 diopters can be combined to provide a range from +1 to +7 in steps of 1.|$|R
50|$|Lens hoods were {{available}} {{for all of the}} lenses, and Pentax sold add-on <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> for macro photography and a range of filters.|$|R
50|$|A whole {{array of}} {{accessories}} could be utilized with SX-70 cameras, {{such as a}} <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> (1:1 @ 5 inches), electrical remote shutter release, tripod mount and an Ever-Ready carrying case that hung from the neck and unfolded {{in concert with the}} camera.|$|E
50|$|The QuickTake 150 kit {{included}} a separate <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> that allowed focusing at approximately 30 cm. Apple offered a factory upgrade to the QuickTake 100 changing {{the name to}} the QuickTake 100 Plus, which {{included a}}ll the functionality of the QuickTake 150.|$|E
5000|$|When you add a <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> to {{a camera}} which is {{focusing}} at the shortest distance {{at which the}} objective lens can focus, and you don't change the focus adjustment, the focus will {{move to a distance}} which is given by following formula: ...|$|E
50|$|Nippon Kogaku {{also made}} scores of minor {{accessories}} for the F2, such as straps, cases, bags, remote firing cords, eyecups, eyepiece correction <b>lenses,</b> supplementary <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses,</b> lens hoods, filters and cases. In 1978 the complete Nikon photographic system of cameras, lenses and accessories totaled nearly 450 items priced {{in excess of}} US$110,000 - the most extensive and expensive in the world.|$|R
5000|$|Rolleinar: A set of <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses,</b> {{in three}} magnifications (Rolleinar 1, Rolleinar 2, and Rolleinar 3). A pair of Rolleinar lenses {{are placed on}} both the viewing and taking lenses.|$|R
5000|$|... 1c 1937-39 SN 55000 - 125000 - In 1937 a {{triangular}} cam-follower replaced the circular Leica-type cam follower {{and the speed}} dial was modified slightly to resemble the Leica II. 28mm and 100mm lenses were made available. A pocket tripod, self-timer, <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses,</b> darkroom equipment and filters appeared in this period.|$|R
50|$|X {{being the}} {{shortest}} distance {{at which the}} objective lens can focus, in m, and D being the Diopter value of the close up filter. This is the minimal working distance at which {{you will be able}} to take a picture with the <b>close-up</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
50|$|A split diopter {{has just}} a semicircular {{half of a}} <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> in a normal filter holder. It {{can be used to}} {{photograph}} a close object and a much more distant background, with everything in sharp focus; with any non-split lens the depth of field would be far too shallow.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} and apparently somewhat older {{meaning of the}} term prime lens is the main lens in a combination lens system. [...] When the camera lens is used with some other optical device, such as a <b>close-up</b> <b>lens,</b> teleconverter, or teleside converter, the camera lens itself is properly called the prime lens. Prime is here used in the sense of primary, chief, original, first in order, etc.|$|E
50|$|It {{was during}} an early project on film {{directors}} that Pyke established his trademark portrait style, chancing {{on the little}} <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses,</b> that when placed on his Rolleiflex camera, allowed him to make incisive, direct images within the square 6x6cm negative. The first picture made in this way, of the film director Sam Fuller in 1983, was taken the same afternoon as Pyke found the Rolleinars in an Edinburgh camera shop.|$|R
50|$|A {{supplementary}} lens is an accessory lens clipped, screwed or bayoneted {{to the front}} of a main lens that alters the lens' effective focal length. If it is a positive (converging) only supplement, it will shorten the focal length and reset the infinity focus of the lens to the focal length of the supplementary <b>lens.</b> These so-called <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> are often uncorrected single element menisci, but are a cheap way to provide close focusing for an otherwise limited focus range lens.|$|R
50|$|Designing <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> is {{not really}} that hard - an image size that is close to object size {{increases}} symmetry. The Goerz Apo-Artar (Germany/USA) photoengraving process lens was apochromatic in 1904, although ultra-tight quality control helped. It is getting a sharp image continuously from infinity to close-up that is hard - before the Makro-Kilar, lenses generally did not continuously focus to closer than 1:10 ratio. Most SLR lens lines continue to include moderate aperture macro lenses optimized for high magnification. However, their focal lengths tend to be longer than the Makro-Kilar to allow more working distance.|$|R
50|$|While {{these are}} not {{technically}} filters but accessory lenses, they are sold by filter manufacturers {{as part of their}} product lines, using the same holders and attachment systems. A <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> is a single or two-element converging lens used for close-up and macro photography, and works {{in the same way as}} spectacles used for reading. The insertion of a converging lens in front of the taking lens reduces the focal length of the combination.|$|E
50|$|The MiNT Lens Set {{was also}} {{released}} in the same year. It {{can be used with}} any Polaroid SX-70 camera. The set includes an ND filter, blue filter, yellow filter, <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> and a fisheye lens to create different effects. Since The Impossible Project film will exhibit red or yellow colour casts under bright sunlight and hot weather, using a blue filter will correct the white balance to a more natural colour. The yellow filter is used with black & white film to increase image contrast.|$|E
5000|$|The Kolibri took sixteen 3x4cm {{exposures}} on 127 film. The camera {{featured a}} collapsible lens tube and was {{arranged in a}} vertical format, with a flip-up viewfinder on the top. On the right-hand side was the winding knob and a tripod bush; there was another tripod bush at the bottom. The lens had small [...] "feet" [...] on either side, so the camera would stand horizontally, and a strut could be fixed below the lens to balance the camera vertically. There were two red windows on the back, for the small image format. A supplementary <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> was available, called Proxar, which allowed focusing down to 30 cm.|$|E
50|$|The 16 was {{the second}} Minolta 16 model, {{introduced}} in 1957. Basically a more streamlined Automat, it was modified to allow for slip-on filters and <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> and had fewer shutter speeds. It was available in six colors {{in addition to the}} standard chrome. This was followed three years later by the 16 II, which appeared identical to the 16 but featured an improved lens and expanded shutter speed and aperture ranges. There was also a version of the 16 II with a built-in transistor radio, which was sold as the Sonocon 16 MB-ZA starting in 1962.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wide range}} of {{accessories}} made this camera a system: panorama head, sun shade, parallax-corrected <b>close-ups</b> <b>lenses,</b> color correction, contrast enhancing, and special effect filters, all mounted with a quick release bayonet, {{as well as a}} quick-change tripod attachment. Some, professional, amateur and fine-art photographers still shoot Rolleiflex TLR film cameras with color transparency, color negative, or black-and-white film. The later f2.8 and f3.5 letter models (Planar or Xenotar lens) are highly sought after in the used market, and command the greatest price. [...] Historically there were five focal length cameras available including 5.5 cm Rollei-Wide, 6.0 cm Baby Rollei, 7.5 cm (f:3.5), 8.0 cm (f2.8), and 13.5 cm (f:4 Zeiss Sonnar) Tele-Rolleiflex. Although all Rolleflex cameras can be fine user cameras, there is also an active market for many Rolleiflex models as collectables, and this adds (greatly in some models) to the end price paid, particularly in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The metal-bodied Iscorama 54 was {{the next}} {{anamorphic}} adapter to be released by ISCO, and was the largest of all Iscoramas. Although it was a totally different physical design to the original Iscorama and the Iscorama 36/Cinegon, the optical and mechanical configuration was very similar, with all three lenses sharing an identical focus and anamorphic alignment mechanism. Because of its large rear anamorphic element, and wide diameter mounting thread (77mm), the 54 can be attached to a much wider range of taking lenses than other Iscoramas without vignetting occurring (although a 35mm focal length {{seems to be the}} limit on APS-C cameras). One of the downsides of the Iscorama 54’s larger dimensions is the 95mm front filter thread, which has negative ramifications for the cost of filters and <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses.</b> Fortunately, it is possible to fix smaller (67mm and larger) filters within the recessed front opening of the lens without causing excessive vignetting.|$|R
5000|$|Placing an {{auxiliary}} <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> (or close-up [...] "filter") {{in front of}} the camera's lens is another option. Inexpensive screw-in or slip-on attachments provide close focusing. The possible quality is less than that of a dedicated macro lens or extension tubes, with some two-element versions being very good while many inexpensive single element lenses exhibit chromatic aberration and reduced sharpness of the resulting image. This method works with cameras that have fixed lenses, and is commonly used with bridge cameras. These lenses add diopters to the optical power of the lens, decreasing the minimum focusing distance, and allowing the camera to get closer to the subject. They are typically designated by their diopter, and can be stacked (with an additional loss of quality) to achieve the desired magnification.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the buckling behavior of thin cylindrical shape-memory shells at room temperature, using a modified split Hopkinson bar and an Instron hydraulic testing machine. The quasi-static buckling response is directly observed using {{a digital camera}} with a <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> and two back mirrors. A high-speed Imacon 200 framing camera is used to record the dynamic buckling modes. The shape-memory shells with an austenite-finish temperature less than the room temperature, buckle gradually and gracefully in quasi-static loading, and fully recover upon unloading, showing a superelastic property, whereas when suitably annealed, the shells do not recover spontaneously upon unloading, but they do so once heated, showing a shape-memory effect. The gradual and graceful buckling of the shape-memory shells {{is associated with the}} stress-induced martensite formation and seems to {{have a profound effect on}} the unstable deformations of thin structures made from shape-memory alloys...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} tolerance {{analysis of}} optical design {{does not consider}} the capability of the manufacturing process and the quality variation of the assembly process caused by the manufacturing errors of optical and mechanical components. This paper presents an equivalent tolerance design method in which an enlarged field angle is used during the optical design process. The method comprises of four steps of: (I) provides an optical system which satisfies its specification; (II) performs the sensitivity analysis; (III) defines an enlarged field angle of the optical system based on the previous step (II); and (IV) redesigns the optical system with an enlarged field angle to meet the specification. An enlarged field angle {{was involved in the}} optical system design process, so as to achieve the effect of tolerance design. A 2. 5 X <b>close-up</b> <b>lens</b> for digital-micro-imaging is applied {{to the study of the}} equivalent tolerance design method. As a result, the performance of this lens can meet the designed specifications...|$|E
5000|$|Panavision is {{the most}} common source of {{anamorphic}} lenses, with lens series ranging from 20mm to a 2,000mm anamorphic telescope. The C-Series, which is the oldest lens series, are small and lightweight, which makes them very popular for steadicams. Some cinematographers prefer them to newer lenses because they are lower in contrast. The E-Series, of Nikon glass, are sharper than the C-Series and are better color-matched. They are also faster, but the minimum focus-distance of the shorter focal lengths is not as close. The E135mm, and especially the E180mm, are great <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses</b> with the closest minimum focus of any long Panavision anamorphic lenses. The Super (High) Speed lenses (1976), also by Nikon, are the fastest anamorphic lenses available, with T-stops between 1.4 and 1.8; there is even one T1.1 50mm, but, like all anamorphic lenses, they need to be stopped-down for good performance because they are quite softly focused when wide open. The Primo and Close-Focus Primo Series (1989) are based on the spherical Primos and are the sharpest Panavision anamorphic lenses available. They are completely color-matched, but also very heavy: about 5-7 kilograms. The G-Series (2007), Panavision's latest anamorphic lens series, performance and size comparable with E-Series, in lightweight and compact similar to C-Series.|$|R
50|$|At long last, Rollei had {{a camera}} that could match the Hasselbad 500C. Indeed, {{had it been}} {{released}} earlier, around 1960 say, {{it could have been}} enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines - not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the SL66 never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the SL66 camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the SL66E, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. Additional lenses were released, such as the Fisheye-Distagon (f/3.5, 30 mm), the Distagon (f/4, 40 mm), and the Sonnar (f/4, 150 mm) with a between-the-lens shutter along with more accessories including <b>close-up</b> <b>lenses,</b> extension bellows, a Polaroid film cassette, a sheet film cassette, an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the SL66-X, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the SL66-SE (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the SE Exclusive Professional incorporating selective gold-plating on the housing marked the end of the SL66 series.|$|R
5000|$|Increasingly, macro {{photography}} is accomplished using compact digital cameras and small-sensor bridge cameras, {{combined with a}} high powered zoom lens and (optionally) a <b>close-up</b> diopter <b>lens</b> added {{to the front of}} the camera lens. The deep depth of field of these cameras is an advantage for macro work. [...] The high pixel density and resolving power of these cameras' sensors enable them to capture very high levels of detail at a lower reproduction ratio than is needed for film or larger DSLR sensors (often at the cost of greater image noise). Despite the fact that many of these cameras come with a [...] "macro mode" [...] which does not qualify as true macro, some photographers are using the advantages of small sensor cameras to create macro images that rival or even surpass those from DSLRs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A modulation-transfer-function (MTF) {{measurement}} method {{that uses a}} bar-pattern image for medical displays such as liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) and cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) has been investigated. A specific bar-pattern image on the display was acquired with a high-resolution single-lens reflex-type digital camera equipped with a <b>close-up</b> <b>lens.</b> The MTF was calculated from the amplitudes of the fundamental-frequency components, which were extracted from the profile data across the bar patterns by using Fourier analysis. Actual comparisons with the conventional line tech-nique were performed for a medical CRT. The adequate accuracy and excellent reproducibility of the method were confirmed. Furthermore, unlike the line method, an advantageous feature which can use an input signal with sufficient amplitude was theoretically proved. Horizontal and vertical MTFs at the central position of the display area were measured up to the Nyquist frequency for several medical displays. From these measurements, this method has the capability to detect slight differences between the displays measured. This proposed method is useful in understanding and quantifying the medical display’s performance due to excellent reproducibility and accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The University of Virginia, by {{providing}} world-class educational opportunities to {{citizens of the}} state, has {{played an important role}} in the lives of Virginians since its founding in 1819. The University enhances economic opportunity and provides a steady stream of citizens prepared to assume positions of leadership in business and in public service. In carrying out its core missions of education, research, and service, U. Va. has a vital impact on its community, on its region, and on the entire state. A complete picture of the economic impact of the University requires both a <b>close-up</b> <b>lens,</b> for the impact on the local community, and a wide-angle lens, for the impact on the state as a whole. Earlier studies of this sort have concentrated mostly on the local effects of university spending. This study extends the earlier work by adding to the traditional local economic impact analysis an overview of how a large public research university can contribute to the economy of an entire state. In making our case we review the literature on the economic rationale for state support of a major research university with a large component of students from other states and from other nations.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} to simulate a rover mission on Mars was performed using the Russian Marsokhod rover deployed on Kilauea Volcano HI in February, 1995. A Russian Marsokhod rover chassis {{was equipped with}} American avionics equipment, stereo cameras on a pan and tilt platform, a digital high resolution body-mounted camera, and a manipulator arm on which was mounted a camera with a <b>close-up</b> <b>lens.</b> The six wheeled rover is 2 meters long and has a mass of 120 kg. The imaging system was designed to simulate that used on the planned "Mars Together" mission. The rover was deployed on Kilauea Volcano HI and operated from NASA Ames {{by a team of}} planetary geologists and exobiologists. Two modes of mission operations were simulated for three days each: (1) long time delay, low data bandwidth (simulating a Mars mission), and (2) live video, wide-bandwidth data (allowing active control simulating a Lunar rover mission or a Mars rover mission controlled from on or near the Martian surface). Simulated descent images (aerial photographs) were used to plan traverses to address a detailed set of science questions. The actual route taken was determined by the science team and the traverse path was frequently changed in response to the data acquired and to unforeseen operational issues. Traverses were thereby optimized to efficiently answer scientific questions. During the Mars simulation, the rover traversed a distance of 800 m. Based on the time delay between Earth and Mars, we estimate that the same operation would have taken 30 days to perform on Mars. This paper will describe the mission simulation and make recommendations about incorporating rovers into the Mars surveyor program...|$|E

The gallery represents the works by Romualdas Požerskis, the representative of the Lithuanian school, which stood out against the Soviet photography for its distinctive national aesthetic and tools - use of wide angle <b>lens,</b> <b>close-ups,</b> and sharp contrasts.|$|R
50|$|Within {{a decade}} of being {{introduced}} in America, 3 general forms of camera were in popular use: the American- or chamfered-box camera, the Robert’s-type camera or “Boston box”, and the Lewis-type camera. The American-box camera had beveled edges at the front and rear, and {{an opening in the}} rear where the formed image could be viewed on ground glass. The top of the camera had hinged doors for placing photographic plates. Inside there was one available slot for distant objects, and another slot in the back for <b>close-ups.</b> The <b>lens</b> was focused either by sliding or with a rack and pinion mechanism. The Robert’s-type cameras were similar to the American-box, except for having a knob-fronted worm gear {{on the front of the}} camera, which moved the back box for focusing. Many Robert’s-type cameras allowed focusing directly on the lens mount. The third popular daguerreotype camera in America was the Lewis-type, introduced in 1851, which utilized a bellows for focusing. The main body of the Lewis-type camera was mounted on the front box, but the rear section was slotted into the bed for easy sliding. Once focused, a set screw was tightened to hold the rear section in place. Having the bellows in the middle of the body facilitated making a second, in-camera copy of the original image.|$|R
40|$|In this presentation, the specifications, {{advantages}} {{and limits of}} both methods will be presented. With the light section method, a very precise determination of position is possible. Arbitrary surfaces can be surveyed with an accuracy of about 0. 1 mm. 2 D photos can be concatenated. The disadvantages are {{the complexity of the}} experimental set-up as well as the data analysis. Latter will be further developed in the presented work. With active thermography, inhomogeneities below the surface can be detected up to a depth of about 10 cm. A maximum spatial resolution of 0. 3 mm is possible, but can be enhanced by using a <b>close-up</b> <b>lens.</b> For recording of congruent mappings of the object under investigation, first the internal aberrations of the IR cameras have been corrected (internal camera calibration) by using a freeware matlab toolbox. This calibration reveals, that uncorrected thermograms show considerable distortions up to 5 % at the boundaries, which cannot be neglected for datafusion. For facilitating the fusion to the 3 D data, parallel to the capturing of thermograms digital photos are taken from the measurement object. For this, IR camera and digital camera were both mounted into a common frame structure enabling a reproducible relative position. Both methods have been applied to several historic buildings, compiling experimental data that will be presented in the following. Investigations of a sculpture (Madonna with child in the dome of Halberstadt) and of a sandstone column (dome of Magdeburg) are presented. With the help of the introduced approach and the developed software the thermograms can be visualized and analyzed three-dimensional for any complex object geometry. The combination of infrared images of unsteady thermal heat transfer processes with geometric 3 D data enables the discrimination between external geometrical effects due to material properties and internal faults. Temporal changes can be observed with the demanded high local accuracy and damage can be recognized on time...|$|E
