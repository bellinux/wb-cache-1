5|$|Hong Kong Airlines {{provides}} different priority <b>check-in</b> {{services for}} its passengers. Business Class checkin zone {{is located at}} the front of the checkin aisle providing a seamless checkin experience without further transportation of luggages. In-town <b>check-in</b> stations of Hong Kong Airlines are located at both Hong Kong and Kowloon Station of the Airport Express Line for passengers to proceed <b>check-in</b> one day before boarding. Moreover, Hong Kong Airlines provides through <b>check-in</b> service. Passengers with flight connections on the following carriers can obtain their boarding passes for their onward flights upon checking in on their departure city.|$|E
5|$|McCarran furthered its {{common use}} {{strategy}} in 2003 with the SpeedCheck system, introducing Common-Use Self-Service (CUSS) kiosks. The kiosks allow passengers to <b>check-in</b> and print boarding passes {{for any one}} of multiple airlines. Previously, airlines had been installing their own <b>check-in</b> kiosks, defeating the use of CUTE and increasing congestion at the ticket counters. SpeedCheck kiosks have been installed at the Las Vegas Convention Center as well.|$|E
5|$|At <b>check-in</b> a {{dedicated}} bellhop staff will retrieve a customer's luggage from their prior hotel, airport, etc. {{so that the}} customer is not left waiting for luggage arrival. A complimentary Japanese tea service greets each guest upon <b>check-in,</b> featuring green tea and special rice crackers. As a security feature, the elevators must be operated from the outside with a room key. There are no buttons inside the elevators themselves. Other services include 24-hour in-room dining {{and access to the}} spa. WiFi access and shoeshine services are available for an additional charge.|$|E

40|$|Location-Based Social Network Systems (LBSNSs) are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. In LBSNSs, users can check in at various places, connect with their friends and share their <b>check-ins</b> (including users' locations and timestamps) with their friends and even the public. However, most LBSNSs pay on more attention to attracting users to join and actively use their systems rather than protecting users' privacy preferences for their <b>check-ins.</b> In this paper, we analyze access control mechanisms for users' <b>check-ins</b> {{in four of the}} most popular existing LBSNSs: Facebook Places, Foursquare, Google Latitude and Yelp. We first generalize a model for users' <b>check-ins</b> based on these LBSNSs. Considering users' <b>check-ins</b> as the protection objects, we then generalize an access control policy model for them. We use these two models as criteria to analyze these access control mechanisms for users' <b>check-ins</b> and compare them in these LBSNSs. Additionally, we identify the common vulnerabilities in these access control mechanisms. Understanding the access control mechanisms for users' <b>check-ins</b> and their limitations can help users who care more about their privacy to choose a LBSNS where their location privacy is better protected. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|In August 2012, GetGlue {{announced}} it has reached three million users, adding one million users since January 2012. GetGlue users had contributed {{a total of}} 500 million <b>check-ins,</b> likes and reviews on the site since its launch in 2008, with 100 million of those <b>check-ins</b> happening in 2011. During the 2013 Super Bowl, GetGlue had more than 200,000 <b>check-ins</b> and 400,000-plus total activities (likes, replies, votes, etc.).

5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online <b>check-in</b> facilities, reducing the need to queue up at <b>check-in</b> counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
5|$|Co-location {{provides}} alliance {{customers with}} smoother transfers between member airlines; and better facilities {{than any of}} the member airlines could justify on their own. The alliance has combined ticket offices, <b>check-in</b> facilities and lounges at some 50 airports worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 the {{non-stop}} Gatwick Express {{service was}} started, {{aiming for a}} 30-minute journey time. This was coupled with the provision of an airport lounge and <b>check-in</b> facilities at first-floor level, with dedicated escalators down to the Gatwick Express platforms. British Airways and other major airlines had their own <b>check-in</b> desks there. British Rail operated an International Travel Centre within the main station, separate from the domestic travel centre. At the time, Victoria was still a major departure point for international travel, with boat trains to Dover and Folkestone for France and Belgium and beyond. This ceased {{with the introduction of}} Eurostar in 1994, which did not serve Victoria, and the International Travel Centre closed.|$|E
40|$|Social {{networks}} are {{getting closer to}} our real physical world. People share the exact location and time of their <b>check-ins</b> and {{are influenced by the}}ir friends. Modeling the spatio-temporal behavior of users in social networks is of great importance for predicting the future behavior of users, controlling the users' movements, and finding the latent influence network. It is observed that users have periodic patterns in their movements. Also, they are influenced by the locations that their close friends recently visited. Leveraging these two observations, we propose a probabilistic model based on a doubly stochastic point process with a periodic decaying kernel for the time of <b>check-ins</b> and a time-varying multinomial distribution for the location of <b>check-ins</b> of users in the location-based social networks. We learn the model parameters using an efficient EM algorithm, which distributes over the users. Experiments on synthetic and real data gathered from Foursquare show that the proposed inference algorithm learns the parameters efficiently and our model outperforms the other alternatives in the prediction of time and location of <b>check-ins...</b>|$|R

5|$|Star Alliance Gold {{status is}} given to {{customers}} who have {{reached a higher level}} of a member airline's frequent-flyer program. Benefits are priority reservations wait-listing, airport stand-by and <b>check-in</b> and baggage handling; an additional checked luggage allowance of 20kg (or one extra piece, where the piece rule applies), and access to designated Star Alliance Gold lounges the day and place of departure with the presentation of a Star Alliance boarding pass. Some airlines also offer preferred seating (an exit seat or a special section of the plane); guaranteed seating on fully booked flights, subject to the booking class code and notice period, and free upgrades {{in the form of a}} voucher, certificate or automatic upgrade at <b>check-in.</b> United restricts US lounge access for their Gold Members to long-haul international passengers; Gold members from other carriers are welcome in US lounges run by United on all itineraries.|$|E

30|$|Cultural differences, {{including}} {{those related to}} gender, may exist among different countries [1 – 3, 42]. Besides that, there is a recent evidence that preferences for venues expressed in <b>check-ins</b> capture cultural differences among users [7]. Thus, differences of gender preferences for venues expressed in <b>check-ins</b> might also reflect different cultural patterns. In this direction, our methodology might be a useful tool to capture this particular aspect of a certain culture, helping to leverage new types of applications, as discussed in the next section.|$|R

30|$|For {{our work}} {{we use a}} {{longitudinal}} dataset describing urban mobility and activity patterns in Greater London that spans three years and millions of <b>check-ins.</b> For each venue, we have the following information: geographic coordinates, specific and general category, creation date, total number of <b>check-ins,</b> and number of unique visitors. The specific and general categories fall within Foursquare’s API of hierarchical categories. A full list of the categories can be found by querying the Foursquare API 2. General categories are overarching groups to one of which each specific category is assigned. Examples of general categories could include Food or Travel & Transport while examples of specific categories could be Chinese Restaurants or Italian Restaurants, which both aptly {{fall under the category}} of Food. In addition to data about venues, the dataset also contains transitions within London. A transition is defined as a pair of <b>check-ins</b> by an anonymous user to two different venues within the span of three hours. A transition is identified by a start time, end time, source venue, and destination venue. Our dataset includes 18, 018 venues and 4, 000, 040 transitions for Greater London. The dataset comprises of <b>check-ins</b> from December 2010 to December 2013. This dataset was obtained through a collaboration with Foursquare.|$|R

30|$|Location-based social {{networks}} (LBSNs), such as Foursquare, 1 are currently very popular, mostly {{due to the}} widespread use of smartphones around the world. In such applications, users implicitly express their preferences for locations by performing <b>check-ins</b> at specific venues. <b>Check-ins</b> can then be seen as a source of social sensing, capturing how people behave in the real world with respect to the places they often visit. As discussed in [7, 8], such signals can be explored to better understand human dynamics in urban areas, and, particularly, culture-related urban patterns.|$|R
