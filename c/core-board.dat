40|$|Passive energy {{dissipation}} control system can effectively control structure response under seismic action. As {{a form of}} passive {{energy dissipation}} control, yielding steel shear panel dampers can dissipate energy of the ground motion very well with the plastic deformation. By monotonic cyclic loading, hysteretic performance of the 15 [*]mm thick <b>core-board</b> nonstiffener shear panel damper is tested, and the test shows that the damper has a superior hysteretic performance. Using finite element analysis software ABAQUS, and taking height to thickness ratio of the <b>core-board</b> as variable, the qualitative analysis on the damper is carried out, and {{results show that the}} critical height to thickness ratio of shear panel damper is between 30 and 35. Three groups of 15 [*]mm thick <b>core-board</b> nonstiffener shear panel dampers are tested by constant amplitude cyclic loading under different amplitudes; the results show that the fatigue performance is fine and the damper is a good energy dissipation device...|$|E

The hardware design includes the ARM 11 <b>core-board</b> and the expansion board, and the software design {{is based on the}} embedded Linux system with QT Embedded and SQLite. In addition to the general function as filling natural gas, the system has the GUI designed for touch input, the embedded database, and equipped with a RJ 45 cable network interface, WiFi wireless network interface and RS 485 interface etc...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe thermal {{degradation}} behaviors and kinetics of five common wooden boards were studied by TG-DTG techniques at different heating rates 10 K/min, 15 K/min, 20 K/min, 25 K/min and 30 K/min in air atmosphere. The kinetic parameters, activation energy, of the degradation {{process for the}} wooden boards were calculated by means of Kissinger and Coats-Redfern methods. The {{results show that the}} whole course of pyrolysis of the five wooden boards can be divided into three phases and the main stage's activation energy of <b>core-boards</b> is the highest. It also shows that the results of Kissinger method are higher than Coats-Redfern's. The causes {{of the differences between the}} two methods and the probable factors causing errors during the experiment are also discussed...|$|R
