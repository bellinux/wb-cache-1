5|$|The Bears {{started the}} regular season by winning their first three games before losing in weeks four and five to the Detroit Lions and New Orleans Saints, respectively. The {{following}} game after winning against the New York Giants, quarterback Jay <b>Cutler</b> suffered a groin injury against the Washington Redskins, as the Bears entered the bye week at 4–3. With <b>Cutler</b> out, Josh McCown stepped in against the Green Bay Packers in week nine, leading the Bears to victory. <b>Cutler</b> returned in the next game against the Lions, but injured his ankle in the loss, and McCown filled in {{for the next four}} games; during the four-game span under McCown, the Bears went 2–2, while McCown excelled, throwing thirteen touchdowns and one interception. As a result, when <b>Cutler</b> returned in week fourteen against the Cleveland Browns, controversy arose over who should be the starter. After winning against Cleveland, the Lions lost the following day, allowing the Bears to clinch the NFC North in week sixteen with Packers and Lions losses grouped with a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. However, the Bears lost 54–11, and in week seventeen against the Packers, the Bears were eliminated from playoff contention with a 33–28 loss.|$|E

5|$|The Bears' opening drive {{ended at}} Cleveland's 14-yard line when <b>Cutler</b> had his pass tipped in the endzone by T. J. Ward and intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. The Browns then scored on Billy Cundiff's 35-yard field goal, which was tied by Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yarder. Eventually, the Bears reached the Browns' 24-yard line on another drive, {{and after a}} penalty on Alshon Jeffery forced the Bears to kick a 46-yard field goal, the score was nullified by Corey Wootton's holding penalty, forcing Chicago to punt. With 8:01 in the first half, <b>Cutler</b> was again intercepted by Gipson, who {{returned}} the pick 44 {{yards for a touchdown}} and the 10–3 lead. With 24 seconds remaining in the half, <b>Cutler</b> connected on a 5-yard touchdown pass with Marshall to close the half at 10–10. <b>Cutler</b> ended the first half with 13 of 19 passes completed for 168 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Early in the third quarter, Jason Campbell's pass for Greg Little was intercepted by Zack Bowman and returned 43 yards for the score. Cleveland's Edwin Baker eventually scored his first career NFL touchdown on a 2-yard run, and the Browns added to the score when Billy Winn punched the ball from Martellus Bennett, and Ward returned the fumble 52 yards for the 24–17 advantage. Eventually, <b>Cutler</b> guided the Bears from their own 5-yard line, culminating in a 45-yard touchdown pass to Jeffery after Gipson made an ill-timed leap and Julian Posey being unable to interrupt the play with 10:59 remaining. With 5:41 left in the game, <b>Cutler</b> threw a 5-yard pass to Earl Bennett to take the 31–24 lead, which was extended by Michael Bush on a 40-yard touchdown run. Cutler's touchdown pass to Bennett was the twenty-ninth passing touchdown of the season, which ties the team record set in 1947 and 1995. With 1:03 to go, Campbell threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Josh Gordon, but the Bears recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the victory, 38–31. The win marked the third time since 1970 that the Bears won all four games against an AFC division, and the first since 1986.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals won the toss {{and decided}} to receive. On the opening kickoff, David Johnson {{returned}} it 108 yards for a touchdown. After both teams exchanged punts, receiver Josh Bellamy caught a 48-yard touchdown pass from <b>Cutler,</b> his first career touchdown reception. On the Cardinals' ensuing drive, the Bears forced fourth down after Palmer's pass to Johnson went out of bounds, but was reversed after it was determined he had a knee and elbow inbounds. Two plays later, Arizona gained 42 yards on Palmer's pass to John Brown, added with a defensive pass interference penalty on corner Kyle Fuller, placing the offense at the Bears' 11-yard line. After two plays, Palmer threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Jaron Brown. On Chicago's next drive, runningback Jeremy Langford scored on a one-yard dive. However, the Cardinals scored two touchdowns in 52 seconds: after Larry Fitzgerald's eight-yard touchdown reception, Tony Jefferson intercepted <b>Cutler,</b> scoring on the 26-yard return. <b>Cutler</b> tried to dive to tackle Jefferson, but landed on his right shoulder and suffered a hamstring injury; Jimmy Clausen replaced <b>Cutler</b> {{for the rest of}} the game. Despite losing <b>Cutler,</b> the Bears were able to score three points with Robbie Gould's 40-yard field goal, and got the ball back on the next drive with linebacker Jared Allen intercepting Palmer's pass intended for J. J. Nelson on the first play; however, the Bears had to settle for Gould's 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Clausen's pass for Marquess Wilson was intercepted by Patrick Peterson, with the Cardinals capitalizing on the turnover with Palmer's 28-yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald. After the Bears punted, Arizona increased the score with Johnson's 13-yard touchdown run. Gould eventually kicked a 51-yard field goal to make the score 42–23, but Fitzgerald caught another touchdown pass, this time of nine yards, to widen the margin by 25 points, though Chandler Catanzaro's extra point was wide left.|$|E
5|$|With 7:51 left in {{the game}} and down 17–6, <b>Cutler</b> {{attempted}} to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game. The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards, concluding with <b>Cutler</b> throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson {{in the corner of the}} left endzone. The Bears attempted to go for two, but Cutler's pass for Mariani was ruled out; after a challenge, the ruling was upheld. The Chiefs eventually punted again, with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33. <b>Cutler</b> led the offense on an eight-play, 67-yard drive, concluding with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap. However, the Bears failed the two-point conversion. The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds {{left in the}} game. Smith reached the Bears' 48 with a pass to Maclin, and on the next play, threw a nine-yard pass to Maclin. However, Maclin juggled the pass while going out of bounds. As a result, with two seconds left, the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66-yard field goal. However, Santos' kick fell short, giving the Bears the 18–17 win.|$|E

5|$|After the {{acquisition}} of Jay <b>Cutler,</b> Hester took on the role as the de facto number one wide receiver. In {{the first game of}} the season, Hester caught seven passes from <b>Cutler</b> for 90 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown reception. In the following weeks Hester began to develop a rapport with <b>Cutler</b> and amassed 634 receiving yards and three touchdowns though the first ten weeks of the season. He played the best game of the season on October 25, 2009 against the Cincinnati Bengals, catching eight passes for 101 yards and a touchdown. In a game against the St. Louis Rams during the thirteenth week of the season, Hester injured his calf and missed three starts. Hester returned to play in the Bears season finale against the Detroit Lions, catching three passes for 75 yards. Despite missing the three starts, Hester led the team with 757 receiving yards, and finished behind Greg Olsen in receptions. Hester built his reputation around his kick returning abilities, but his kickoff-returning duties decreased significantly following the 2007 season finale. He told the Chicago Tribune that he plans on spending the offseason honing his receiving and returning skills by strengthening in his legs, especially to fully recover from the calf injury he sustained earlier.|$|E

5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex <b>Cutler</b> and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further.

They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following <b>Cutler</b> and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of the rewards and dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E

5|$|On {{the right}} of the Union line, three regiments of <b>Cutler's</b> brigade were fired on by Davis's brigade before they could get into {{position}} on the ridge. Davis's line overlapped {{the right of}} <b>Cutler's,</b> making the Union position untenable, and Wadsworth ordered <b>Cutler's</b> regiments back to Seminary Ridge. The commander of the 147th New York, Lt. Col. Francis C. Miller, was shot before he could inform his troops of the withdrawal, and they remained to fight under heavy pressure until a second order came. In under 30 minutes, 45% of Gen. <b>Cutler's</b> 1,007 men became casualties, with the 147th losing 207 of its 380 officers and men.
