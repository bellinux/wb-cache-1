25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E

50|$|The LiLFA {{thruster}} {{uses the}} same general idea as the MPD thruster, with two main differences. First, the LiLFA uses lithium vapor, which can be stored as a solid. The other {{difference is that the}} single cathode is replaced by multiple, smaller cathode rods packed into a hollow <b>cathode</b> <b>tube.</b> MPD cathodes are easily corroded due to constant contact with the plasma. In the LiLFA thruster the lithium vapor is injected into the hollow cathode and is not ionized to its plasma form/corrode the cathode rods until it exits the tube. The plasma is then accelerated using the same Lorentz Force.|$|E

Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Röntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed {{on the basis of the}} electromagnetic theory of light (Wiedmann's Annalen, Vol. XLVIII). However, he did not work with actual X-rays.|$|E

Using nanotube ink, the carbon <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> and manganese oxide electrolyte components of the zinc-carbon battery can be printed as different layers on a surface, over which an anode layer of zinc foil can be printed. This technology replaces charge collectors like metal sheets or films with a random array of carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes add conductance.

5000|$|An {{article of}} 1965 on cold cathode tubes from Mullard Ltd. (a British {{manufacturer}} of these devices, which also produced a prototype calculator using them) gives {{an insight into}} why they were used in these calculators at the time - [...] "... They are an accountant's dream; a typical modern <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> has a life expectancy several thousand times better than the conventional thermionic tube, although they employ voltages of the same order. They are much cheaper than either semiconductor devices or vacuum tubes; they do not require costly materials {{with a high degree}} of purity in their manufacture, nor do they need transformers or cooling systems to operate. The tubes require no warm-up period and they can take severe overload." ...|$|E
50|$|In Bell System {{telephone}} exchanges, {{particularly the}} 5XB switches, {{information from the}} marker told the sender that the call required ANI, and stored the calling equipment number in reed relay packs in the sender. The sender used the transverter connector (TVC) to seize a transverter (TV), which was a bay {{of a few hundred}} flat spring relays that controlled all AMA functions. The TV looked in the AMA translator (AMAT) that took care of these particular few thousand lines. AMAT was a rack of ferrite ring cores with cross-connect wires passing through holes of 3 × 4 inches or about a decimeter square, one wire per line. The wire was terminated on a wire wrap peg representing that particular line, and passed through a ring that represented the NNX digits of the billing number, then the M, C, D and finally Units of that number. When queried, AMAT sent a high-current pulse through the wire for that particular line, inducing pulses in the appropriate rings which were amplified by a cold <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> amplifier and then by a relay, and sent back to the transverter which supplied it to the sender for transmission by ANI to the tandem office.|$|E

5000|$|A {{superior}} solution, and {{one which}} allowed each cathode to [...] "float" [...] at a different voltage, {{was that of the}} indirectly heated cathode: a cylinder of oxide-coated nickel acted as electron-emitting cathode, and was electrically isolated from the filament inside it. Indirectly heated cathodes enable the cathode circuit to be separated from the heater circuit. The filament, no longer electrically connected to the tube's electrodes, became simply known as a [...] "heater", and could as well be powered by AC without any introduction of hum. In the 1930s indirectly heated <b>cathode</b> <b>tubes</b> became widespread in equipment using AC power.

50|$|The {{goal was}} to obtain the {{greatest}} imaging area in the smallest cylindrical volume using a consumer flatbed scanner. Typical flatbed scanners image an area of about 220 x 300 mm (660 cm2), so a system had to be found which could be reconfigured to fit inside a sealed transparent capsule. There are two basic imaging methods in modern flatbed scanners. From the 1980s to the late-1990s the market was dominated by systems that could capture an image from any depth of field. Most such digital imaging devices used a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) array. In a CCD, discrete dots of photosensitive material produce a specific charge based on the intensity of light hitting it. A CCD does not detect colour. In this technology, a scene is illuminated, a narrow band of reflected light from the scene passes through a slit (to eliminate light coming from other directions), is then concentrated by an array of mirrors (typically folded into a box) into a prism typically a few centimetres in length. The prism splits the light into its constituent colours. Small CCD arrays are carefully placed {{at the point where}} the primary colours are sharply focused. The separate colour intensities are combined to composite values and recorded by the computer (or scanner electronic assemblies) as a line of pixels. The moving scan head then advances a short distance to gather the next line of the scene. Thus resolution in one axis is determined by CCD array size and focused optics, while the other axis’ resolution is determined by the smallest reliable step the scan head advancing motor can make. The optical assemblies of this type of scanner are fairly robust to vibration, but the traditional light source (a cold <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> of balanced colour temperature) is not. It was therefore replaced with an array of solid-state white light emitting diodes (LEDs). Another advantage of this replacement is that the sources could be alternated between white light and ultraviolet (UV) of about 370 nm wavelength. This UV light source allowed detection of visibly fluorescing materials (typically tracer minerals or hydrocarbons) by the prototype.A suitable scan head model that could be reconfigured to fit within an 80 mm diameter cylinder was located, and the scanner’s standard stepper motor was modified to fit within the same space. The entire unit was then mounted on a stainless steel pivot and rotated by a spring-loaded friction wheel pressing against the inner wall of the cylinder. Since the perimeter of the cylinder (250 mm) was smaller than the typical scan path (300 mm) the motor gearing was reduced to improve along-path scan resolution, the resulting change in image geometry was relatively easy to correct in the image capture software. The resulting assembly is shown in Figure 8.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{a process}} for cleaning a <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> and other subassemblies in a hollow cathode assembly. In the disclosed process, hand covering elastomer gloves are used for handling all cathode assembly parts. The <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> and other subassemblies are cleaned with a lint-free cloth damped with acetone, then wiped with alcohol, immersed in ethyl alcohol or acetone, and ultrasonic agitation is applied, heating to 60 C. for ethyl alcohol or 56 C. for acetone.

40|$|Hollow cathode arc {{discharges}} are efficient plasma {{sources and}} are applied in substrate pretreatment or plasma-activated deposition processes. In order to generate large volume homogeneous plasmas to guarantee uniformity of plasma activation and coating properties, in the presented configuration a ring-shaped anode is positioned coaxially around the hollow <b>cathode</b> <b>tube.</b> A magnetic field is applied, which is axial within the <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> and spreads {{out in the}} deposition chamber. In order to characterize the hollow cathode plasma, spatially resolved Langmuir probe measurements have been carried out. The charge carrier density maximum on the <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> axis reaches values up to 10 (exp 13) cm- 3. With increasing distance from the plasma source, the plasma density decreases and shows a smoother lateral profile. Maxwellian electron energy distribution functions are observed with spatially homogeneous electron temperatures in the range 1 - 4 eV. Increasing the chamber pressure leads to higher plasma densities and lower electron temperatures. Reduction of the gas flow through the hollow <b>cathode</b> <b>tube</b> results in a strong rise of the plasma density over two orders of magnitude. The magnetic field supports the low gas flow mode and leads to higher plasma densities, too. The results of the Langmuir probe measurements are discussed {{by means of the}} active zone model and are further related to optical emission measurements performed {{in the vicinity of the}} hollow cathode orifice...|$|E
