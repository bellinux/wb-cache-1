50|$|The Opies {{found that}} in England and Wales {{children}} usually held up <b>crossed</b> <b>fingers.</b> Sometimes <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of both hands was required and occasionally the feet as well. The Opies found one area, Headington, where sitting cross-legged was required. At Lydney, children could raise their right hand palm forward, whilst in Bradford-on-Avon the hand was held up with three fingers extended. In some parts of Scotland the custom was to put up one's thumbs, sometimes licking them first. This also occurred in a few places in Lancashire. Anecdotally, the raising of a thumb may also accompany the use of pouce in France.|$|R
50|$|Damage to the flexor tendon pulleys that {{encircle}} {{and support}} <b>the</b> tendons that <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> joints is <b>the</b> most common <b>finger</b> injury within <b>the</b> sport (see climber's finger).The main culprit for pulley related injuries {{is the common}} crimp grip, especially in the closed position. The crimp grip requires a near ninety-degree flexion of <b>the</b> middle <b>finger</b> joint, which produces a tremendous force load on the A2 pulley. Injuries to the A2 pulley can range from microscopic to partial tears and, in the worst case, complete ruptures. Some climbers report hearing a pop, which might {{be a sign of}} a significant tear or complete rupture, during an extremely heavy move (e.g. tiny crimp, one- or two-finger pocket). Small partial tears, or inflammation can occur {{over the course of several}} sessions.|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{relation}} between pain perception and spatial {{representation of the}} body is poorly understood. In the thermal grill illusion (TGI), alternating non-noxious warm and cold temperatures cause a paradoxical, sometimes painful, sensation of burning heat [1]. We combined thermal grill stimulation with <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> to investigate whether nociceptively mediated sensation depends on the somatotopic or spatiotopic configuration of thermal inputs. We stimulated the index, middle, and ring <b>fingers</b> when <b>the</b> middle <b>finger</b> either was or was not <b>crossed</b> over <b>the</b> index to generate “warm-cold-warm” patterns in either somatotopic or spatiotopic coordinates. Participants adjusted a temperature delivered to the other hand until it matched their perception of <b>the</b> cold target <b>finger</b> (index or middle). We found significant temperature overestimation when the target was central within the spatial configuration (warm-cold-warm) compared to when it was peripheral (cold-warm-warm). Crucially, this effect depended on the spatiotopic configuration of thermal inputs, but it was independent of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> posture and present for both index and middle target fingers—the thermal grill effect for <b>the</b> middle <b>finger</b> was abolished when it was <b>crossed</b> over <b>the</b> index to adopt a spatiotopically peripheral position, while the same effect was newly generated for <b>the</b> index <b>finger</b> by <b>the</b> same postural change. Our results suggest that the locations of multiple stimuli are remapped into external space as a group; nociceptively mediated sensations depended not on the body posture, but rather on the external spatial configuration formed by the pattern of thermal stimuli in each posture...|$|R

5000|$|When an Eastern Orthodox or Eastern Catholic bishop or priest blesses {{with the}} sign of <b>the</b> <b>cross,</b> he holds <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> {{of his right hand}} {{in such a way that}} they form the Greek {{abbreviation}} for Jesus Christ [...] "IC XC". <b>The</b> index <b>finger</b> is extended to make the [...] "I"; <b>the</b> middle <b>finger</b> signify letter [...] "C"; the thumb touches <b>the</b> lowered third <b>finger</b> to signify <b>the</b> [...] "X" [...] and <b>the</b> little <b>finger</b> also signifies <b>the</b> letter [...] "C". When a priest blesses in {{the sign of}} <b>the</b> <b>cross,</b> he positions <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of his right hand in the manner described as he raises his right hand, then moves his hand downwards, then to his left, then to his right. A bishop blesses with both hands (unless he is holding some sacred object such as a cross, chalice, Gospel Book, icon, etc.), holding <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of both hands in the same configuration, but when he moves his right hand to the left, he simultaneously moves his left hand to the right, so that <b>the</b> two hands <b>cross,</b> <b>the</b> left in front of the right, and then the right in front of the left. The blessing of both priests and bishops consists of three movements, in honour of the Holy Trinity.|$|R

5000|$|The {{technical}} {{novelty of}} this étude is the chromatic scale {{to be played}} by <b>the</b> three outer <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> right hand together with short semiquaver notes to be played by {{the first and second}} <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> same hand and the difficulty is to do this evenly in piano and legato at the required tempo of MM 144. Other piano composers before Chopin, such as Ignaz Moscheles (1794-1870) in his Études Op. 70, have introduced chromatic scales with accompanying notes to be played by the same hand. But the chromatic scale is never given to the [...] "weak" [...] fingers. Leichtentritt believes that Chopin in his Étude Op. 10 No. 2 revives an old fingering habit not using the thumb from the pre-Bach clavichord time of the 17th century which had already long been regarded as obsolete. The technical significance of this étude for Chopin is proved by the extensiveness of his fingerings, an effort he did not apply to any other piece. An analysis of Chopin’s fingering reveals that, like in the [...] "standard" [...] chromatic scale <b>fingering,</b> <b>the</b> long 3rd <b>finger</b> plays <b>the</b> black keys, <b>the</b> 2nd <b>finger,</b> which [...] "normally" [...] plays C and F, is replaced by the 5th one. <b>The</b> 1st <b>finger,</b> usually playing all other white keys, is replaced by the 4th one. While it is fairly easy to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> long 3rd <b>finger</b> over <b>the</b> short thumb, acrobatic dexterity is required to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> 3rd <b>finger</b> over <b>the</b> 4th one.

40|$|AbstractIn seam bowling, <b>the</b> {{first two}} <b>fingers</b> are {{supposed}} to impart equal amounts of back-spin to the ball. As the rotating arm of the bowler and the backspin of the ball have different senses (clockwise vs. counterclockwise), the spin axis moves rapidly from one hemisphere to <b>the</b> other, thereby <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> seam, when <b>finger</b> torque is imparted onto the ball. It is shown in this study analytically, that the rapidly precessing spin axis approaches the torque vector, but reaches the torque vector only at large times. From the experimental data, the spin and torque vectors are approximately 10 - 15 ° apart when releasing the ball in seam bowling. If the spin axis is not exactly at the pole of the ball, i. e. perpendicular to the seam, then the seam wobbles by twice the angle between spin and torque vectors. It is therefore advisable to have <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> centre of pressure slightly off seam by 10 - 15 °...|$|R
