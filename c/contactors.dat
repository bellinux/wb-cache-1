40|$|<b>Contactor</b> pin is {{commonly}} used as the test tooling to enable million times of repeatability functional testing in manufacturing. Simulation should be performed before <b>contactor</b> sent for prototyping. The objective is to optimize the design according to device performance and avoid design faulty which may lead to higher testing cost. This paper introduces the methodology on <b>contactor</b> pin characterization specifically the pin inductance that are helpful for high speed tooling engineer to access their <b>contactor's</b> performances. The impact of the <b>contactor</b> pin design, topology and <b>contactor</b> housing design will be explained in this paper. Indirectly, this is to {{emphasize the importance of}} assessing the <b>contactor</b> by considering many design factors instead of assessing in ideal way. It is widely applicable to any electronic devices testing that need <b>contactor...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{beginning}} of this study introduces the <b>contactor</b> characterisation methodology for parasitic inductance and capacitance extraction for IC packaging. The second section of this study explains the challenges of designing the fine pitch <b>contactor</b> and test board. The design optimisation for fine pitch <b>contactor</b> will be recommended {{at the end of}} thesis. Test <b>contactor</b> is part of the test tooling used in manufacturing for repeatability electrical testing. The main electrical conduction path is through the test <b>contactor</b> pin. When current flows through these <b>contactor</b> pins, the inductance and capacitance are generated along the electrical path. These parasitic inductance and capacitance contribute the channel losses and change the characteristic impedance of transmission line. As test <b>contactor</b> is part of the test tooling interfacing between package and test board, the signal integrity of the test <b>contactor</b> design must be well taken care. Any changes on the design parameters will affect the performance of test <b>contactor.</b> This work presents the inductance and capacitance characterisation methodology using ANSYS Q 3 D to study the impact of design parameters to the test <b>contactor</b> performance...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes an {{economizer}} circuit is also installed {{to reduce the}} power required to keep a <b>contactor</b> closed; an auxiliary contact reduces coil current after the <b>contactor</b> closes. A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially close a <b>contactor</b> than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save {{a substantial amount of}} power and allow the energized coil to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current <b>contactor</b> coils and on large alternating current <b>contactor</b> coils.|$|R
25|$|Rotating {{biological}} <b>contactors</b> (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film {{secondary treatment}} systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in Germany in 1960 and {{have since been}} developed and refined into a reliable operating unit. The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are sloughed off due to shear forces provided by the rotating discs in the sewage. Effluent from the RBC is then passed through a secondary clarifier where the sloughed biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.|$|E
25|$|The crash {{investigators}} {{found that the}} number two propeller was indeed feathered. The {{cause of the problem}} was improper adjustment during maintenance on 22 July 1950, when all four propellers were changed. A problem was detected with number two during a test flight, and the ground crew was instructed to install new <b>contactors.</b> There was no paperwork indicating that this was done, and the entire maintenance crew was killed in the crash. The number three engine and propeller were not found. The generators were found to be working, so there was sufficient electrical power to retract the landing gear. No crew members recalled hearing the landing gear motors. The switches could not be checked due to the degree of destruction of the aircraft, but the fuse was intact. It was noted that there were only six seat belts for the ten men in the forward compartment.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of solid state electronics, {{camshaft}} controllers were used to control the speed of electric motors. [...] A camshaft, driven by an electric motor or a pneumatic motor, was used to operate <b>contactors</b> in sequence.

[...] This system was mainly used in electric multiple units and electric locomotives.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2, {{the sign of}} ẋ_p(t)-ẋ_c(t) {{switches}} when the velocity of the vibrating <b>contactor</b> exceeds the velocity of the finger. At that instant, the fingertip and <b>contactor</b> stick to each other, and static friction arises. On the other hand, for a stationary <b>contactor,</b> ẋ_p(t) > ẋ_c(t) = 0 is true, and the kinetic friction becomes dominant. Because the static friction {{is larger than the}} kinetic friction, the vibrating <b>contactor</b> would produce the greater perception of friction.|$|R
2500|$|Tesla {{described}} its July 2015 {{introduction of}} the 90kWh battery as a [...] "range upgrade" [...] of the 85kWh battery and explained that the 6% energy increase was due to [...] "improved cell chemistry" [...] {{and the introduction of}} silicon into the cell's graphite anode. Tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5%. Tesla also explained that apart from the P90D the Model S has its main battery conductor protected by a fuse rated for 1,300A and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts. To reduce this uncertainty Tesla has for the P90D introduced Inconel battery <b>contactors</b> and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse, which monitors the current at the millisecond level, cuts the power with [...] "extreme precision and certainty" [...] and has a rating of 1,500A.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, <b>contactors,</b> and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E
50|$|Another {{option is}} to use {{membrane}} <b>contactors.</b> Membrane <b>contactors</b> bring the water into contact with an insert gas stream, such as nitrogen, to strip out dissolved oxygen.

30|$|When a human rubs a <b>contactor</b> that is {{vibrating}} laterally at 3 – 10  Hz with an {{amplitude of}} ~ 1  mm, the friction {{is perceived as}} being greater than that sensed when touching a stationary <b>contactor.</b> This phenomenon could be exploited for a new vibrotactile approach to friction perception; however, the principles behind it {{have yet to be}} explained. In this study, we hypothesized that the perceived friction increases because of the Stribeck characteristic and stick-slip phenomenon of friction, whereby the friction varies depending on the relative velocity between a subject’s fingertip and <b>contactor.</b> The relative velocity instantaneously decreases because of the lateral vibration of the <b>contactor,</b> while the friction rises during the same period. To test this hypothesis, we simulated the friction forces between a fingertip and a vibrating <b>contactor.</b> Furthermore, we performed psychophysical experiments using five participants, in which each explored a vibrating <b>contactor</b> and subjectively compared the perceived friction under several stimulus conditions. The simulated friction forces, the results of the psychophysical experiments, and physical observation suggested that the transient increases in friction caused by lateral vibration of the <b>contactor</b> influenced friction perception for a laterally vibrating <b>contactor.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis of a newly actuator with hardware based electronic control unit (ECU) for the control of energy dissipation in ac permanent magnet (PM) <b>contactor.</b> By using charging and recharging techniques, the making and breaking operations of <b>contactor</b> are controlled by ECU.

40|$|An {{existing}} anisotropic anodic plasma <b>contactor</b> {{model is}} extended to include neutral gas emissions. Within {{the framework of}} the <b>contactor</b> model, the inclusion of external ionization leads to an integrodifferential equation. By choosing the ratio of the <b>contactor</b> radius to the neutral gas-electron ionization mean free path at the <b>contactor</b> exit as a suitable expansion parameter, an analytical expression for the current-voltage characteristic can be found. The performance of this <b>contactor</b> model is examined via a dynamic simulation model developed for electrodynamic tethers. Detailed models of the geomagnetic field and the ionosphere are used to create a realistic environment. The highly nonlinear <b>contactor</b> voltagle-current characteristic is incorporated into a circuit equation, which includes radiation impedance, and is solved along the tether's orbit. Results show that it is more effective to fully ionize the <b>contactor</b> gas internally, than to partially ionize it externally, and that based on the specific power for the tether system, the optimum gas to use is argon. In addition, the effect of the radiation impedance on tether system performance is examined...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{general-purpose}} relays, <b>contactors</b> {{are designed}} to be directly connected to high-current load devices.

5000|$|Most {{motor control}} <b>contactors</b> at low {{voltages}} (600 volts and less) are air break contactors; air at atmospheric pressure surrounds the contacts and extinguishes the arc when interrupting the circuit.
