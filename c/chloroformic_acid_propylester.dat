50|$|<b>Chloroformic</b> <b>acid</b> is an {{unstable}} chemical compound with the formula ClCO2H. It {{is the single}} acyl-halide derivative of carbonic acid (phosgene is the double acyl-halide derivative). <b>Chloroformic</b> <b>acid</b> is also structurally related to formic acid, which has a hydrogen instead of the chlorine. Despite the similar name, it {{is very different from}} chloroform.|$|R
5000|$|Methyl chloroformate is the {{methyl ester}} of <b>chloroformic</b> <b>acid</b> {{and is an}} oily liquid with a color that is {{anywhere}} from yellow to colorless. It is also known for its pungent odor.|$|R

50|$|<b>Chloroformic</b> <b>acid</b> {{itself is}} too {{unstable}} {{to be handled}} for chemical reactions. However, many esters of this carboxylic acid are stable and these chloroformates are important reagents in organic chemistry. They are used to prepare mixed carboxylic acid anhydrides used in peptide synthesis. Like other related halocarbons, it is a potentially dangerous alkylating agent.|$|R

It {{is also known}} for its pungent odor. When heated, benzyl chloroformate decomposes into phosgene and if it comes in contact with water it produces toxic, corrosive fumes.|$|R
40|$|A {{general and}} {{efficient}} method for {{the synthesis of}} drug-like fused bicyclic hydantoins is reported. An Ugi–Joullié reaction/cyclisation sequence was exploited as the key complexity-generating process in which trifluoroacetic acid was employed as synthetic equivalent for <b>chloroformic</b> <b>acid.</b> Exemplar diversification of the bicyclic scaffolds was performed to enable subsequent translation to the synthesis of large small molecule libraries, leading {{to the production of}} > 1000 compounds for addition to the screening collection of the European Lead Factory...|$|R
50|$|Chloroformates are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds which are esters of <b>chloroformic</b> <b>acid.</b> They are widely used as reagents in organic chemistry. For example, benzyl chloroformate is used to introduce the Cbz protecting group and fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride is used to introduce the FMOC protecting group. They are gaining popularity {{in the field of}} chromatography as versatile derivatization agents. They enable relatively simple transformation of large array of metabolites (aminoacids, amines, carboxylic acids, phenols) for analysis by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry.|$|R
40|$|Treatment of (R) -[{a-(dimethylamino) ethyl}-¿ 6 -benzene]Cr(CO) 3 with esters of <b>chloroformic</b> <b>acid</b> {{leads to}} {{stereoselective}} substitution of the dimethylamino group for a chloro substituent. The reaction {{can be extended}} to systems in which the chromium arene complex, after metalation, is diastereoselectively substituted in the ortho position with carbon and silicon electrophiles to generate planar chirality. The chloro group in turn can be replaced stereoselectively for various phosphorus, nitrogen, and oxygen nucleophiles. Both substitution reactions in the benzylic position proceed via retention of configuration. The addition of cyanide is not stereospecific. The phosphine derivatives are efficient catalysts for the enantioselective hydrovinylation of styrene to 3 -phenyl- 1 -butene. X-ray crystal structures establish the absolute configuration of (R) -[(a-chloroethyl) ¿ 6 -benzene]Cr(CO) 3, (R) -[{a-(diphenylphosphanyl) ethyl}-¿ 6 -benzene]Cr(CO) 3, and (pS,S) -[1 -(a-cyanoethyl) - 2 -methyl-¿ 6 -benzene]Cr(CO) 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis work is the {{asymmetric}} synthesis of N,O-protected 1, 3 -aminoalcohols using SAMP/RAMP Hydrazones and their application in asymmetric synthesis. Furthermore, the asymmetric synthesis of 2 -substituted azetidines was developed. - Asymmetric synthesis of 1, 3 -aminoalcoholsA flexible diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of N,O-protected 1, 3 -aminoalcohols was developed. In a three step synthesis, first the N,O-protected 1, 3 -aminoalcohols were synthesized using a nucleophilic 1, 2 -addition to the C=N-double bond of the SAMP/RAMP hydrazones with organolithium- or organocer-reagents. Second, an epimerization-free reductive N,N-bond-claverage with BH 3 -THF-complex was performed. Lastly, N-protection with <b>chloroformic</b> <b>acid</b> benzyl ester or tosylchloride afforded the benzylcarbamates or tosylamides, respectively, in overall yields of 22 to 69 %. Importantly, the products were formed in high enantio- and diastereomeric purities (ee, de >= 89 – 96 %). - Synthesis of 2 -substituted azetidines using activated leaving groups Extending the previous work of J. H. Kirchhoff, 2 -substituted azetidines were synthesized using activated leaving group. The 1, 3 -aminoalcohols, whose amine and alcohol groups were benzylcarbamate and silyl protected, respectively, were first de-silylated. Conversion of the free alcohol to iodide or tosylate afforded the azetidine precursors. Cyclization gave the desired 2 -substituted azetidines in 38 to 50 % yields over three steps in excellent enantiomeric purities (ee >= 96 %). - Synthesis of 2 -substituted azetidines under Mitsunobu conditions The 1, 3 -aminoalcohols, whose amine and alcohol groups were p-tosyl and benzyl protected, respectively, were first de-benzylated with palladium on activated charcoal in methanol. Then, cyclization was effected by treatment with triphenylphosphine and DIAD in THF. The desired 2 -substituted azetidines were obtained in 73 to 93 % yields over two steps and in excellent enantiomeric excesses (ee >= 96 %). Notably, a variety of substituents could be incorporated (n-Bu, t-Bu, n Hexyl, Phenyl, TBSOCH 2 (CH 2) nCH 2, n = 1, 2, 3) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Inhibitors {{are formed}} that reduce the {{fermentation}} performance of fermenting yeast during the pretreatment process of lignocellulosic biomass. An exometabolomics approach {{was applied to}} systematically identify inhibitors in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates. Results: We studied the composition and fermentability of 24 different biomass hydrolysates. To create diversity, the 24 hydrolysates were prepared from six different biomass types, namely sugar cane bagasse, corn stover, wheat straw, barley straw, willow wood chips and oak sawdust, and with four different pretreatment methods, i. e. dilute acid, mild alkaline, alkaline/peracetic acid and concentrated acid. Their composition and that of fermentation samples generated with these hydrolysates were analyzed with two GC-MS methods. Either ethyl acetate extraction or ethyl chloroformate derivatization was used before conducting GC-MS to prevent sugars are overloaded in the chromatograms, which obscure the detection of less abundant compounds. Using multivariate PLS- 2 CV and nPLS- 2 CV data analysis models, potential inhibitors were identified through establishing relationship between fermentability and composition of the hydrolysates. These identified compounds were tested for their effects on {{the growth of the}} model yeast, Saccharomyces. cerevisiae CEN. PK 113 - 7 D, confirming {{that the majority of the}} identified compounds were indeed inhibitors. Conclusion: Inhibitory compounds in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates were successfully identified using a non-targeted systematic approach: metabolomics. The identified inhibitors include both known ones, such as furfural, HMF and vanillin, and novel inhibitors, namely sorbic acid and phenylacetaldehyde. © 2014 Zha et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.
