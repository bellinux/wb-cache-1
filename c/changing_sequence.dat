In contrast to the trend of creating digitally generated video-projections, Perryman has developed a low-tech analogue alternative to produce huge projections of kinetic colours without pixels. As they listen to the music, the audience watches the evolution and dissolution of the semi-abstract visuals as Perryman paints them. The images from five or more projectors are mixed by hand with an analogue dimmer. Perryman calls this art form kinetic painting, because the continuously <b>changing</b> <b>sequence</b> of colours and forms only exists in real time, then disappears forever. His paintbrushes also move to the rhythms of the music and make the liquid watercolour splash, pulsate, flow or spread continuously.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of speech that determine its greater disruption of serial recall relative to non-speech (the irrelevant sound effect) are investigated (c. f. Tremblay et al., 2000). Degraded non-words disrupted serial recall less than clear non-words. Tasks show that both vowels and consonants of degraded non-words were misperceived, with initial consonants misperceived {{to a greater}} degree. Measures that followed showed that clear sequences of non-words, with changing vowels were more disruptive than <b>sequences</b> with <b>changing</b> consonants. Degrading vowel only <b>changing</b> <b>sequences</b> reduced disruption of serial recall to a level observed with clear consonant only <b>changing</b> <b>sequences,</b> whereas degradation {{had no effect on}} disruption by consonant only <b>changing</b> <b>sequences.</b> In further experiments the acoustic complexity of speech was reduced while maintaining its intelligibility by removing fundamental frequency information. Whispered speech disrupted serial recall to the same degree as voiced speech. Alternating voiced and whispered speech sounds within a sequence did not reduce serial recall performance relative to a sequence of voiced-only speech sounds. Results indicate the formant structure of speech sounds and not fundamental frequency information is the important carrier of acoustic change. Reversing the fine structure of whispered speech damaged its intelligibility whilst preserving acoustic complexity and these sounds were as disruptive of serial recall as normal whispered speech. This indicates that vocal tract resonances (formants) of speech and not its intelligibility determine its disruptive power. The relative disruptiveness of speech and non-speech sounds was then examined. Sounds were matched for acoustic complexity, but their 'speech-likeness' was destroyed. Speech disrupted serial recall more than did non-speech. Results indicate that the biological nature of speech renders it more disruptive than non-speech. The findings refute the 'changingstate- hypothesis' which is derived from the object-oriented episodic record model. This hypothesis argues that it is the degree of acoustic variation within an irrelevant stream and not the nature of its component sounds which determines its disruption of serial memory. Biological sounds may disrupt serial memory to a greater degree since they are of behavioural relevance and provide information about the environment that may need to be attended to. The addition of an attentional mechanism to the object-oriented episodic record model that regulates the reallocation of cognitive processing resources is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Adenosine deaminases {{acting on}} RNA (ADARs) {{catalyze}} adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing of RNA that possesses double-stranded (ds) structure. A-to-I RNA editing results in nucleotide substitution, because I {{is recognized as}} G instead of A both by ribosomes and by RNA polymerases. A-to-I substitution can also cause dsRNA destabilization, as I:U mismatch base pairs are less stable than A:U base pairs. Three mammalian ADAR genes are known, of which two encode active deaminases (ADAR 1 and ADAR 2). Alternative promoters together with alternative splicing give rise to two protein size forms of ADAR 1 : an interferon-inducible ADAR 1 -p 150 deaminase that binds dsRNA and Z-DNA, and a constitutively expressed ADAR 1 -p 110 deaminase. ADAR 2, like ADAR 1 -p 110, is constitutively expressed and binds dsRNA. A-to-I editing occurs with both viral and cellular RNAs, and affects {{a broad range of}} biological processes. These include virus growth and persistence, apoptosis and embryogenesis, neurotransmitter receptor and ion channel function, pancreatic cell function, and post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs. Biochemical processes that provide a framework for understanding the physiologic changes following ADAR-catalyzed A-to-I ([*]=[*]G) editing events include mRNA translation by changing codons and hence the amino acid sequence of proteins; pre-mRNA splicing by altering splice site recognition sequences; RNA stability by <b>changing</b> <b>sequences</b> involved in nuclease recognition; genetic stability in the case of RNA virus genomes by <b>changing</b> <b>sequences</b> during viral RNA replication; and RNA-structure-dependent activities such as microRNA production or targeting or protein–RNA interactions...|$|R

This task was susceptible to interference from both a spatial task (rote tapping) and a verbal task (mouthed articulatory suppression) and also from the presence of irrelevant speech. Effects were comparable to those found with a serial verbal task that was generally similar in demand characteristics to the spatial task.

This study investigates the application of Transmit SENSE to one-dimensional RF pulses. For these RF pulses, Transmit SENSE is applicable in case of large B 1 variations across the slice or slab to be excited. Typically, such large B 1 variations are found across the slabs excited in 3 D volume imaging orin the framework of the REgional Saturation Technique (REST). 1 D Transmit SENSE can improve the excitation slab profile, and particularly can result in a significant reduction of RF power and the relatedspecific absorption rate (SAR).

40|$|Quantum {{teleportation}} is a {{key ingredient}} of quantum networks and a building block for quantum computation. Teleportation between distant material objects using light as the quantum information carrier has been a particularly exciting goal. Here we demonstrate a new element of the quantum teleportation landscape, the deterministic continuous variable (cv) teleportation between distant material objects. The objects are macroscopic atomic ensembles at room temperature. Entanglement required for teleportation is distributed by light propagating from one ensemble to the other. Quantum states encoded in a collective spin state of one ensemble are teleported onto another ensemble using this entanglement and homodyne measurements on light. By implementing process tomography, we demonstrate that the experimental fidelity of the quantum teleportation is higher than that achievable by any classical process. Furthermore, we demonstrate the benefits of deterministic teleportation by teleporting a dynamically <b>changing</b> <b>sequence</b> of spin states from one distant object onto another...|$|E

Examples of data streams include computer network traffic, phone conversations, web searches and sensor data etc. The data owners or publishers may {{not be willing to}} exactly reveal the true values of their data due to various reasons, most notably privacy considerations. To preserve data privacy during data mining, the issue of privacy preserving data mining has been widely studied and many techniques have been proposed. However, existing techniques for privacy preserving data mining is designed for traditional static data sets and are not suitable for data streams. So the privacy preservation issue of data streams mining is need for the time.

During aggregation, such peptides can undergo bifurcation leading to fibrils or crystals, however {{the mechanisms of}} fibril-to-crystal conversion are unclear. We navigate herein the energy landscape of amyloidogenic peptides by studying a homologous series of hexapeptides found in animal, human and disease related proteins. We observe fibril-to-crystal conversion occurring within single aggregates via untwisting of twisted ribbon fibrils possessing saddle-like curvature and cross-sectional aspect ratios approaching unity. <b>Changing</b> <b>sequence,</b> pH or concentration shifts the growth towards larger aspect ratio species assembling into stable helical ribbons possessing mean-curvature. By comparing atomistic calculations of desolvation energies for association of peptides we parameterise a kinetic model, providing a physical explanation of fibril-to-crystal interconversion.

Many of the proteins encoded in the P. falciparum genome are unusually enriched in repetitive low complexity sequences containing a limited repertoire of amino acids. These repetitive sequences expand and contract dynamically and {{are among the most}} rapidly <b>changing</b> <b>sequences</b> in the genome. The simplest repetitive sequences consist of single amino acid repeats such as poly-asparagine tracts which are found in approximately 25 % of P. falciparum proteins.

There is no universal explanation for the occurrence of repetitive sequences and it is possible that many confer no function to the encoded protein and no selective advantage or disadvantage to the parasite. However, there are increasing numbers of examples where repetitive sequences are important for parasite protein function.
