5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the <b>cis</b> <b>configuration,</b> although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E

Natural trans fats, which include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid, originate in the rumen of these animals.

25|$|The exact {{biochemical}} {{process by which}} trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research. One {{theory is that the}} human lipase enzyme works only on the <b>cis</b> <b>configuration</b> and cannot metabolize a trans fat although this theory has been overturned by the recognition that trans fat is metabolized but competitively inhibits the metabolism of other fatty acids. Intake of dietary trans fat perturbs the body's ability to metabolize essential fatty acids (EFAs including Omega 3) leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta, the main artery of the heart, thereby increasing risk of coronary artery disease.|$|E
25|$|The same molecule, {{containing}} {{the same number}} of atoms, with a double bond in the same location, can be either a trans or a cis fatty acid depending on the configuration of the double bond. For example, oleic acid and elaidic acid are both unsaturated fatty acids with the chemical formula C9H17C9H17O2. They both have a double bond located midway along the carbon chain. It is the configuration of this bond that sets them apart. The configuration has implications for the physical-chemical properties of the molecule.

25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and {{retinoic acid}} are possible {{as a result}} of either a trans or <b>cis</b> <b>configuration</b> of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule. One of the earliest signs of vitamin A deficiency is night-blindness followed by decreased visual acuity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe histone-like {{nucleoid}} structuring protein (H-NS) is a nucleoid-associated protein, {{which is}} involved in both gene regulation and DNA compaction. H-NS can bind to DNA in two different ways: in trans, by binding to two separate DNA duplexes, or in cis, by binding to different sites on the same duplex. Based on scanning force microscopy imaging and optical trap-driven unzipping assays, it has recently been suggested that DNA compaction may result from the antagonistic effects of H-NS binding to DNA in trans and <b>cis</b> <b>configurations.</b> To get more insight into the compaction mechanism, we constructed a coarse-grained model description of the compaction of bacterial DNA by H-NS. These simulations highlight the fact that DNA compaction indeed results from the subtle equilibrium between several competing factors, which include the deformation dynamics of the plasmid and the several binding modes of protein dimers to DNA, i. e., dangling configurations, cis- and trans-binding. In particular, the degree of compaction is extremely sensitive to the difference in binding energies of the <b>cis</b> and trans <b>configurations.</b> Our simulations {{also point out that}} the conformations of the DNA-protein complexes are significantly different in bulk and in planar conditions, suggesting that conformations observed on mica surfaces may differ significantly from those that prevail in living cells...|$|R

5000|$|... cis : A <b>cis</b> <b>configuration</b> {{means that}} the two {{hydrogen}} atoms adjacent to the double bond stick out {{on the same side}} of the chain. The rigidity of the double bond freezes its conformation and, in the case of the cis isomer, causes the chain to bend and restricts the conformational freedom of the fatty acid. The more double bonds the chain has in the <b>cis</b> <b>configuration,</b> the less flexibility it has. When a chain has many cis bonds, it becomes quite curved in its most accessible conformations.

The effect of this is that, in restricted environments, such as when fatty acids are part of a phospholipid in a lipid bilayer, or triglycerides in lipid droplets, cis bonds limit the ability of fatty acids to be closely packed, and therefore can affect the melting temperature of the membrane or of the fat.|$|E
