40|$|Purpose. In modern {{construction}} the placing {{of concrete}} is often performed using distribution equipment of concrete pumps. Increase of productivity {{and quality of}} this construction work requires improvement of both concrete pumps and their tooling. The concrete pumps tooling consists of standardized concrete conveying pipes and connector bends radius of up to 2 m. A promising direction of tooling improvement is the reduce of resistance to movement of the concrete in the concrete <b>conveying</b> <b>pipe</b> by increasing the radius of the bend. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the feasibility of developing and implementing connector bends with radius greater than 2 m. Methodology. The criterion of efficiency in using bends with radius of more than 2 m in connector concrete pipes is reduction of resistance to movement of the concrete, enhancing the productivity of concrete pumps. Studies of resistance to movement of concrete in the concrete <b>conveying</b> <b>pipe</b> are performed on the mathematical simulations. Findings. On the proposed models are calculated the resistance to movement of concrete in the concrete <b>conveying</b> <b>pipe</b> of the autoconcrete pump with a three-section distribution boom. Reduction of the resistance to concrete movement was obtained for the four major sections of the provisions of the distribution boom in the autoconcrete pump. Originality. Two mathematical simulations were developed to calculate the resistivity to concrete movement in the bends of concrete <b>conveying</b> <b>pipe</b> depending on the radius of the bend. Practical value. The proposed by the author simulations allow us to calculate resistivity to the concrete movement in the concrete <b>conveying</b> <b>pipe</b> and general resistance to the concrete movement in the concrete pipe of the autoconcrete pump with three sections of the distribution boom.

40|$|Abstract—Square-shaped {{pneumatic}} conveying pipes {{are used in}} some industrial processes such as fuel injection systems in coal-fired power plants and circulating fluidized beds. However, {{little research has been}} conducted to characterise the gas–solid two-phase flow in a square-shaped pneumatic <b>conveying</b> <b>pipe.</b> This paper presents mathematical modelling and experimental assessment of novel non-restrictive electrostatic sensor arrays for the measurement of pulverised fuel flow in a square-shaped pipe. The sensor arrays consist of twelve pairs of strip-shaped electrodes, which are uniformly embedded in the four flat pipe walls. An analytical mathematical model of the sensor arrays is established and the induced charge and currents of different electrodes due to a point charge are then derived based on the model. Experimental tests were conducted on a 54 mm square-shaped pipe section of a pneumatic conveyor test rig under a range of flow conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe overall {{purpose of}} this project is to test the impact and {{potential}} benefits of Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies (AR&VR) to improve maintenance operation in industrial equipment. The main function for a Flapper valve of a Fuller-Kinyon type M pump is to prevent that the air generated to convey the bulk material through a <b>conveying</b> <b>pipe</b> flows inside of the material chute through the rotating screw. If this will occur, the material flow will decrease or even stop, causing a reduction of the pump capacity. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} maintain calibrated each flapper valve in the plant. This process of maintenance is done once a month, or when necessary, and it needs the pump to be shut down, taking up to four hours to finish the complete process. For this reason, an augmented reality application is being developed, aiming to reduce the consumed time by the maintenance process. Using this application, it is expected to dedicate less time training the new personnel responsible for the maintaining process, displaying tridimensional models, animations, images and text information that would simplify the instructions shown in a printed manual and adding an interactive environment between the users and the information displayed.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Pneumatic {{conveying}} is {{a popular}} method of transporting materials in the resource and process industries because of its advantages of no dust emission, flexible <b>conveying</b> <b>pipe</b> routes and capability to convey poisonous and hazardous material. There are two primary modes of pneumatic conveying: dilute phase and dense phase. One of the significant advantages of dense-phase conveying over dilute phase {{is the ability to}} convey materials at relatively low conveying velocities, resulting in significantly reduced particle attrition and erosive wear of pipelines. For this reason, there has been a significant move towards dense-phase systems. However, whether a material can be dense-phase conveyed in conventional pipeline is critically governed by its physical properties. Bypass pneumatic conveying systems provide the capacity to transport materials that are not naturally suited to dense-phase conveying, and can significantly reduce the minimum dense-phase conveying velocity for some materials that are dense-phase conveyed in conventional pipelines. In both cases, the conveying velocity is significantly reduced, resulting in less particle degradation, lower pipeline wear and lower power consumption. Pressure drop, specific energy consumption and minimum conveying velocity are three major parameters for assessing system performance in bypass pneumatic conveying systems. An extensive experimental program was conducted as part of this study. The pressure drop was measured when transporting fly ash, alumina, sand and plastic pellets over a range of conveying parameters in a conventional pneumatic conveying system and a series of internal bypass systems of varying configurations. The bypass configuration variations included orifice diameter, internal bypass pipe diameter and flute spacing. In particular, comparisons between the conventional system and the bypass configurations were made with respect to isothermal energy consumption and minimum conveying velocity. To interpret the mechanism of material blockage inhibition associated with bypass systems, the differential pressure between the main pipe and the internal bypass pipe was measured, together with a high-speed video camera visualisation, which provided pressure and visual information on bypass pipeline flow regimes. Based on mass and momentum conservation and the ideal gas equation, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the internal bypass pneumatic conveying process considering the internal bypass pipe configuration. In the development of the model, it was necessary to determine the solids friction factor. Although a few equations have previously been proposed to predict this factor, none was found to provide sufficient accuracy. Therefore, a solids friction factor model was developed based on the partial least squares (PLS) method. Subsequently, the proposed mathematical model, together with this modified solids friction model, was applied to predict the pressure drop within bypass systems for different conveyed materials (i. e., fly ash, alumina and sand) and different bypass configurations of varying internal bypass pipe diameter, orifice diameter and bypass flute spacing. Bypass pipe diameter and bypass flute spacing are two crucial parameters for bypass system design to avoid any possible blockage and ensure reliable conveying. In this study, a design protocol for internal bypass pipe diameter and the frequency of bypass pipeline openings was established based on the physical properties of the materials to be conveyed. This analysis was based in the theories associated with de-aeration analysis, fluidisation analysis, the Darcy Equation and orifice plate theory. This research represents a significant step in improved understanding of blockage inhibition mechanisms within a bypass system, bypass system operational principles, bypass system modelling and design protocol and the influence of material properties and bypass configurations on specific energy consumption...|$|E

The local approach refers to an infinite medium and uses wave propagation analyses without taking boundary conditions into account. The global approach refers to the same medium, but with finite length and associated with a given set of boundary conditions. The finite length system is generally studied by calculating its eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies. Criteria for local instability are derived {{in the first part}} of this paper, and dissipation is found to significantly affect local stability. Moreover, dissipation is found to have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect, depending on the other parameters. Next, numerical computations are presented for finite-length systems and results are analyzed and compared with local stability properties of the corresponding media. When the system is sufficiently long, it is found that critical velocity for global instability tends to a local criterion which can be that of local stability of the damped medium or a local transition criterion of the undamped medium, which is not necessarily the local instability criterion. Finally, a reasoning based on lengthscale ratios is developed. It allows to know which criterion is able to predict the global stability for long systems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
