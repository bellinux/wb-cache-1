40|$|Background: Subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> are frequent, but poorly {{understood}} {{in patients with}} chronic fatigue. We hypothesized that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs at baseline were associated with baseline subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments,</b> that they predict subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> at treatment termination, and that a reduction in maladaptive metacognitive beliefs was associated with less subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> at treatment termination, independent of changes in fatigue, pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Methods: In this non-controlled study, patients (n= 137) on sick leave due to chronic fatigue received a 3. 5 -week inpatient RTW rehabilitation program. Of these patients 69 (50. 4 %) was referred with a ICPC- 2 diagnosis of chronic fatigue. Patients completed questionnaires about metacognitive beliefs, somatic complaints, psychological complaints, and <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> before and after treatment. To test the hypotheses we performed paired t tests of change, as well as seven hierarchical linear regressions. Results: Results showed that baseline maladaptive metacognitive beliefs {{were significantly associated with}} subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> at baseline, controlling for symptoms. Score on baseline metacognitive beliefs did not predict impairments post-treatment. Testing specific maladaptive beliefs, pre-treatment scores on cognitive confidence were associated with subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> both pre and post-treatment, controlling for symptoms. Post-treatment metacognitive beliefs and post-treatment cognitive confidence were associated with post-treatment subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments,</b> controlling for pre-treatment impairments and pre-treatment metacognitive beliefs, as well as pre and post scores on symptom measures. Conclusion: This study reports associations between maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in patients with chronic fatigue. Targeting metacognitive beliefs could prove an effective therapeutic intervention for subjective <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in these patients...|$|R

5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae.

Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E

5|$|Neuropsychological tests {{such as the}} mini–mental state {{examination}} (MMSE) are widely {{used to evaluate the}} cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease.

40|$|Objective. Various studies {{highlight}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> {{in cancer}} patients. This paper proposes {{a review of}} longitudinal controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions aiming to reduce these <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments.</b> Method. Longitudinal controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions aiming to reduce <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in adult cancer patients and published between 1993 and 2013 were identified, {{with the exception of}} studies that implied patients suffering from CNS tumor or metastasis. Results. Pharmacological interventions (n = 11) suggested the positive impact of modafinil on memory and executive functions. Non-pharmacological interventions (n = 10) suggested the positive impact of cognitive revalidation and stimulation programs, psycho-education and meditation on several memory, attentional and executive objective as well as subjective functions. Nonpharmacological interventions show more significant cognitive benefits than pharmacological interventions. Conclusion. Some longitudinal controlled studies support the usefulness of interventions aiming to reduce <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in cancer patients. Further studies should evaluate the effectiveness of programs combining technics aiming to reduce <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> and psychotherapeutic technics aiming to support patients' coping with illness.

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} usually {{diagnosed}} {{based on the}} person's medical history, history from relatives, and behavioural observations. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features {{and the absence of}} alternative conditions is supportive. Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment)</b> to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|Fewer than 3% {{of people}} live more than {{fourteen}} years. Disease features {{significantly associated with}} reduced survival are an increased severity of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as heart problems, diabetes or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival. While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced {{when compared to the}} healthy population among those who are younger. Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine Differential Item Functioning (DIF) by {{disability}} groups on an on-demand performance assessment for students with severe <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments.</b> Researchers examined the presence of DIF for two comparisons. One comparison involved students with severe <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> who served as the reference group and students with autism and severe <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> who served as the focal group. The other comparison compared students with severe <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> (reference group) and students with severe <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> and orthopedic impairments (focal group). Results indicated a moderate amount of DIF for the autism comparison and a negligible amount of DIF for the orthopedic impairment comparison. In addition researchers coded all test items based on characteristics likely to favor one of the three groups. Although several of the hypothesized coding categories resulted in accurate prediction of DIF, the study was limited to items from one testing program for students in one state. More research is needed to see if these hypotheses can be replicated across testing programs and populations. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{long-term}} effects of benzodiazepine use can include <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> as well as affective and behavioural problems. Feelings of turmoil, difficulty in thinking constructively, loss of sex-drive, agoraphobia and social phobia, increasing anxiety and depression, loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests, and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use. Additionally, an altered perception of self, environment and relationships may occur.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> {{have been}} {{extensively}} reported for patients suffering from schizophrenia {{but a lot}} of questions persist about these troubles. Several domains of cognitive functions are impaired which result in daily life difficulties. Many arguments tend to show that children suffering from psychotic spectrum disorders present <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> also but things are not clearly defined. The aim of this review is to compare the <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> of children suffering from psychotic symptoms and adults suffering from schizophrenia in order to improve the understanding of the two clinical affections. A better understanding of the disease is necessary to improve the health care which currently give poor results. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Besides the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM- 5) and the French reference books, the present research has been conducted using PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and ScienceDirect. Literature about <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> of adults with schizophrenia and children with psychotic spectrum disorders is assessed and results are compared. RESULTS: Both children and adults suffer from cognitive impairments: language, memories, executive and motor functions and IQ are impaired. An important heterogeneity in the troubles has been observed and a poor knowledge in terms of onset time, evolution, intensity, impact on everyday life and therapeutic interest has been reported. CONCLUSION: Adults with schizophrenia and children suffering from psychotic spectrum disorders have similar <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in many domains of cognition. The similarities in term of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> highlighted in the present work should support new studies in order to adapt to children the current cognitive therapies which are mostly provided to adults. As the <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> are heterogeneous, each patient should receive a tailored neurocognitive exam which takes into account its abilities and weaknesses...|$|R

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) project {{designed}} {{to facilitate the}} development of new drugs for the treatment of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in people with schizophrenia, identified three drug mechanisms of particular interest: dopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic. Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and a positive allosteric modulator of the α 7 nicotinic receptors. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. There is evidence to suggest that the combination of galantamine and memantine may be effective in the treatment of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in schizophrenia. There is a growing body of evidence that excess kynurenic acid (KYNA) is associated with <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in schizophrenia. The α- 7 nicotinic and the NMDA receptors may counteract the effects of kynurenic acid (KYNA) resulting in cognitive enhancement. Galantamine and memantine through its α- 7 nicotinic and NMDA receptors respectively may counteract the effects of KYNA thereby improving <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments.</b> The Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the Cholinergic Receptor, Nicotinic, Alpha 7 gene (CHRNA 7), Glutamate (NMDA) Receptor, Metabotropic 1 (GRM 1) gene, Dystrobrevin Binding Protein 1 (DTNBP 1) and kynurenine 3 -monooxygenase (KMO) gene may predict treatment response to galantamine and memantine combination for <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in schizophrenia in the kynurenine pathway...|$|R
