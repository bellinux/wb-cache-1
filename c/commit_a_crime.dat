5|$|In early May 2012, five alleged {{members of}} the Abergil {{organization}} who were suspected of conspiring to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem, after police had found a weapons cache inside a storage room in an apartment building in Jerusalem {{where one of the}} suspects' parents live. According to the suspects, they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization. At the suspects’ homes police discovered signs of violence, including ceramic bulletproof vests with bullet holes in them. The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack. According to the suspects, they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident, who owed the organization money.|$|E
5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E

5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

25|$|Police may detain {{suspects}} {{for up to}} 10 {{hours without}} an arrest warrant if the authorities have a well-founded belief that the suspects have committed, or are about to <b>commit,</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> or are unable to determine the suspected person's identity. Human rights groups report that the police often detains suspects longer than 10 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{intoxication}} on criminal responsibility varies by jurisdiction and offense. The criminal code in question may require proof of {{various levels of}} intent. This may range from premeditation, through various degrees of intent or willingness to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> general recklessness, and finally no intent at all in some instances of strict liability. Intoxication {{may serve as a}} defense against proving more specific forms of intent. If so, its potential effectiveness will sometimes hinge on whether the defendant's intoxication was voluntary or involuntary: the defense would be denied defendants who had voluntarily disabled themselves by knowingly consuming an intoxicating substances, but allowed to those who had consumed it unknowingly or against their will.|$|E
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, {{a conspiracy}} is {{an agreement between}} two or more persons to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> {{at some time in}} the future. Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act must also have been undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an offense. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare attempts which require proximity to the full offence). For the purposes of concurrence, the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability – unless, in some cases, it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts – but may reduce their sentence.|$|E

In this version, although they were cloned from identical DNA, they did not look the same. Rico was portrayed as a straightforward psychopath, having {{reached a point where}} he killed the innocent {{on the grounds that the}} division between guilt and innocence was merely a matter of timing and everyone would <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> in time. His deviant behavior was attributed to something going wrong in his creation which made him the perfect criminal. They were both friends in school (Joe was unaware of their true kinship, but it is unclear when Rico learned about their connection), but when he became a murderer, Joe judged him and sentenced him to execution, and his death was faked to reassure the public and prevent the truth of the clone program coming to light.|$|E

500|$|Inchoate means [...] "just begun" [...] or [...] "undeveloped", {{and is used}} in English {{criminal}} law to refer to situations where, although a substantial offence has not been committed, the defendant has taken steps to commit it, or encouraged others to do so. These situations are generally divided into three categories; attempts, where the defendant has taken steps [...] "towards carrying out a complete crime", incitement, where the defendant has encouraged others to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> and conspiracy, where the defendant has agreed with others to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> In each case, the defendant [...] "has not himself performed the actus reus but is sufficiently close to doing so, or persuading others to do so, for the law to find it appropriate to punish him".|$|E

500|$|Crime {{rates have}} shown {{variations}} over time, with a drop {{starting in the}} 1990s and continuing today. In order to fight crime, various approaches have been used over the years, including an [...] "If You See Something, Say Something" [...] campaign and, starting in 2016, banning people who <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> in the subway system from entering the system for a certain length of time.|$|E
500|$|As {{a general}} {{principle}} of the law, criminal liability is normally only imposed upon [...] "a blameworthy actor who causes a prohibited harm", and while those who attempt crimes may be blameworthy, {{it can be argued}} that there is no harm caused; attempted burglary, for example, does not lead to anything being stolen. Many theorists who make the distinction between successful and failed attempts do still consider the defendant partially liable, for example advocating a lesser punishment. However, there have been two distinct counterarguments advanced against making such a distinction. The first is that when a crime is attempted, there is a harm, namely a threat to security. Individuals have the right to security, both of themselves and their property, and an attempt to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> infringes on this right. The second is that, regardless of the harm principle, criminal liability for attempts can be justified in utilitarian terms. A person who tries to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> has shown themselves to be dangerous, and must be restrained and rehabilitated to provide a deterrence for them and for others. Although a differing approach is taken in some United States jurisdictions, intervention can happen very early in a conspiracy and the defendants can still be held liable. The earlier the liability, the more controversial.|$|E

500|$|Further {{supporting}} their argument, the dissent cited Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd. {{to argue that}} a Section 1983 claim falls under tort law, in order to draw a distinction between how attempts are handled under tort and criminal law. Under criminal law, a factually impossible attempt to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> such as trying to steal from an empty pocket or defraud someone with no money, can still be tried as an attempt. No such doctrine exists in tort law. Because Heffernan was not engaged in protected activity, the police department could only have attempted to deprive him of his right, so his suit must fail because [...] "there are no attempted torts." ...|$|E
500|$|Signer Judith Vaughan, a {{resident}} of Los Angeles and a nun with the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, said, [...] "We didn't <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> All we did was say, 'Hey, there's a diversity of opinion among people [...] {{and we need to}} talk about freedom of conscience.' I don't see myself as defiant." [...] In January 1985, Monsignor John P. Languille sent a memo to all Los Angeles social service directors, ordering them to cease referring homeless women to the shelter Vaughan supervised [...] "because of [...] pro-abortion position". Vaughan was reportedly expelled in February 1985 but in April 1986 she spoke to the Los Angeles Times to say that the Church had closed the case without requiring her to retract her statement. With the help of her superior, Sister Miriam Therese Larkin of St. Louis, Missouri, she retained her position in the order, and Languille's memo was overturned.|$|E
500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E
