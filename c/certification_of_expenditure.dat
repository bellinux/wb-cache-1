40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have provided limited oversight of county spending under Title III of the Secure Rural Schools Act. Neither agency has issued regulations, and guidance available from these agencies is limited and sometimes unclear about which types <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> are allowable under the act. In addition, their guidance appears to be inconsistent with certain provisions of the act. For example, the Forest Service website contains a brief overview document of Title III, which generally echoes wording in the act, and a frequently asked questions document. These documents, however, do little to clarify language in the act, neither defining terms from the act, such as emergency services, nor specifying which activities the terms cover. Moreover, the agencies do not review the annual <b>certifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> that counties are required to complete to determine whether counties spent funds appropriately {{and do not have}} assurance that they have an accurate accounting of the amounts of Title III funding spent and unspent by the counties. According to agency officials, the steps they have taken to provide guidance have been limited because they believe they do not have authority under the act to do more to oversee county spending. They also stated that Title IIIs provisions are clear and do not need further clarification through regulations. As a result, they generally have not provided advice to counties on how to interpret the act and have not taken steps to assess whether counties are spending funds appropriately. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{migration}} within the European Union {{has grown in}} member countries to considerable size. Management representatives of EU institutions have decided to address this situation. They established community program Solidarity and management of migration flows. The European Commission has decided that for the financial management of this program will be used the principle of shared management. The principle of shared financial management is the delegation of powers and responsibilities for funding and implementing the program from {{the institutions of the}} European Commission to the Member State. This decision creates an obligation for a Member State to establish a system of financial management programs in accordance with financial rules of the European Union (not by the financial rules of the Member State). So the general program "Solidarity and management of migration flows" became the first community program in the CR, which is being implemented on the principle of shared financial management. Member states are obliged to create their own theoretical and methodological basis of a new financial management. This method of financial management has three pillars - Responsible Authority, Audit Authority and Certification Authority. The recipient of funds may be non-profit organizations or state or public nonprofit organization. The financial management of the Responsible Authority is responsible for program implementation in the Member State through projects of final beneficiaries. The Audit Authority is the control body. The Certification Authority is the authority for confirmation. It is the last link between the European Commission and Member States. The task <b>of</b> the <b>Certification</b> Authority {{and at the same time}} of this dissertation was to develop new theoretical and methodological system <b>of</b> internationally recognized <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> public <b>expenditures</b> for services that are financed from the EU budget. In the past, the issue <b>of</b> <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>expenditures</b> financed by community programs in the CR was not addressed. The goal set in my work was met. New theoretical and methodological certification system was created. Functionality and effectiveness of the system was checked before being put into practice through expert assessment by experts of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Finance. Also theoretical and methodological approach was developed, which was approved by the Minister of the Interior, and which became a mandatory certification standard for all involved organizations in the CR. The system was put into practice and has been used since 2009...|$|R
