5000|$|Vital Ground {{completed}} {{the purchase of}} its fourth property at Bismark Meadows in northern Idaho. The 327-acre acquisition, the second-largest property Vital Ground has purchased to date, is situated between three parcels previously acquired and consolidates the properties into a <b>contiguous</b> <b>holding</b> of over 491 acres.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} domains, Toba Domain {{was not a}} single <b>contiguous</b> <b>holding,</b> but was {{geographically}} scattered over a wide area. During the Bakumatsu era it ruled all of Shima Province (37 villages in Toshi District and 19 villages in Ago District) as well as 8 villages in Iino District, 4 villages in Taki District, and 5 villages in Watari District, all in Ise Province.|$|E
50|$|Delaware Wild Lands' largest <b>contiguous</b> <b>holding</b> is The Great Cypress Swamp. Currently, Delaware Wild Lands {{is engaged}} in active Forest Management {{including}} SFI certified sustainable timber harvest. The goal of much of this harvest is for site preparation {{for the restoration of}} Atlantic White-cedar. Delaware Wild Lands is also responsible for protecting nearly 3,500 acres of coastal marsh near Blackbird Creek from development by shell Oil in the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Lakers are {{generally}} bulk carriers; that is, they carry cargoes of rock, ore, salt or grain in large <b>contiguous</b> <b>holds,</b> not packed in containers. The earlier ships required rail cars unloading on ore docks and unloading machinery at the receiving docks, but modern lakers are self unloaders, {{allowing them to}} unload faster and in more ports.|$|R
30|$|One {{method that}} meets {{all of these}} {{criteria}} is a random forest regression, which combines the strengths of ensembles, bagging, and nonparametric binary trees [27]. A random forest is an ensemble of fully grown decision trees, each fit to different random subsets of the data and with a random subset of features. For each tree, the data are randomly partitioned into a training sample that includes two-thirds of the observations and an out of sample test set that includes the remaining third. Each tree is then constructed iteratively, selecting cut points that partition the training set into increasingly pure subsets {{with respect to the}} outcome variable. Because our data are spatially correlated, we further partition our data with 10 -fold cross validation, each time holding back a spatially contiguous section of one-tenth of the region [28]. For each fold, we fit 100 trees. For variable importance, we report the median and spread across all 10 folds. For predictive accuracy, we report the root mean squared error (RMSE) for predictions made on the spatially <b>contiguous</b> <b>hold</b> out test set for each fold.|$|R
5000|$|Forest patches {{that are}} smaller or more {{isolated}} will lose species faster {{than those that}} are larger or less isolated. A large number of small forest [...] "islands" [...] typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single <b>contiguous</b> forest would <b>hold,</b> even if their combined area {{is much greater than}} the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity.|$|R
