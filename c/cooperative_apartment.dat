2500|$|In {{the heyday}} of the New York Harbor's {{dominance}} of North American shipping during the 19th century, Sunset Park grew rapidly, {{largely as a result of}} Irish, Polish, Finnish, and Norwegian immigrant families moving to the area. Portions of the neighborhood became known as [...] "Finn Town" [...] and [...] "Little Norway". The Finns brought with them the concept of cooperative housing, and the apartment house at 816 43rd Street is said to be the first <b>cooperative</b> <b>apartment</b> building in New York City. The Irish subjected the other groups, especially the non-Catholic Finns and Norwegians to harassment and abuse, which resulted in some of the latter leaving the area.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas built {{variants}} on the Linden Court design {{aimed at}} upper-middle income customers with the Château and Towers projects. Sold as cooperatives, {{both of these}} 34th Avenue developments had large, airy apartments and were served by elevators. The elegant Château <b>cooperative</b> <b>apartment</b> complex was built in French Renaissance style. The twelve buildings surround a large common garden. [...] They have slate mansard roofs pierced by dormer windows, and diaperwork brick walls. The early gardens were designed only to be looked at. As {{the concept of the}} garden apartment evolved, and the garden areas became relatively larger compared to the built areas, the design of the shared gardens began to include paved spaces where people could meet or sit. In 1924 the Queensboro Corporation started the Ivy Court, Cedar Court, and Spanish Gardens projects, all designed by Thomas.|$|E
2500|$|With {{convenient}} {{rail transportation}} now available, the village's cool summer breezes off the Hudson and the rural riparian setting began to attract wealthy residents of New York City [...] businessmen, politicians and professionals [...] {{to the area}} to buy up farms and build large summer residences on their new estates, setting a pattern which would hold until the early 20th century. Still, the village continued to expand, with various commercial enterprises opening along the waterfront. Pateman & Lockwood, a lumber, coal and building supply company, opened in the village in 1853, and Lord & Burnham, which built boilers and greenhouses, in 1856. Both expanded to newly created land across the railroad tracks, in 1889 and 1912 respectively, and the Cypress Lumber Company opened on a nearby site in 1909. [...] Nothwithstanding this commercial activity, for many years, through the 19th and early 20th centuries, Irvington was a relatively small community surrounded by numerous large estates and mansions where millionaires, aristocrats and captains of industry lived [...] the population was reported as 2,299 in 1890 and 2,013 in 1898. After World War I, some of the bigger estates in the area were broken up into smaller lots. Many of the estates and mansions are now gone, having been replaced by suburban sub-divisions, although a small number still exist. After World War II, <b>cooperative</b> <b>apartment</b> complexes {{were built in the}} village, but despite these changes, Irvington still has many large houses, and is still an overwhelmingly well-heeled community.|$|E
