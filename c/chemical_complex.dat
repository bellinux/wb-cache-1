Also in 1969, the Hilton Head Island Community Association {{successfully}} fought off the development of a BASF <b>chemical</b> <b>complex</b> on the shores of Victoria Bluff (now Colleton River Plantation). Soon after, the association and other concerned citizens [...] "south of the Broad" [...] fought the development of off-shore oil platforms by Brown & Root (a division of Halliburton) and ten-story tall liquefied natural gas shipping spheres by Chicago Bridge & Iron. These events helped to polarize the community, and the Chamber of Commerce started drumming up support for the town to incorporate as a municipality. After the Four Seasons Resort (now Hilton Head Resort) was built along William Hilton Parkway, a referendum of incorporation was passed in May 1983. Hilton Head Island had become a town.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nitrogen doped Czochralski (N-CZ) and Float Zone (N-FZ) silicon were {{measured}} by high resolution synchrotron Fourier Transform IR spectroscopy (HR-FTIR). The <b>chemical</b> <b>complexes</b> were analyzed in specific regions with known extended defects, i. e., denuded or precipitated regions of annealed N-CZ Si wafers, in N-FZ Si with ring defects and on “N-Skin ” region. The absorption lines {{were assigned to}} <b>chemical</b> <b>complexes</b> previously studied by first principles calculations. In annealed N-CZ Si wafers, a strong correlation was observed between the absorption line intensity depth variations and the defect distributions revealed by an Oxygen Precipitate Profiler (OPP), and oxygen and nitrogen SIMS profiles. Transformation of <b>chemical</b> <b>complexes</b> from one type to another was observed. A defect band, visible as an OPP peak at the denuded zone-bulk interface {{was found to be}} related to vacancy defect enhancement of oxygen precipitation via production of mobile N 2. For the as grown N-FZ, the radial dependency of IR absorption line intensity is correlated to x-ray topography contrast. I...|$|R
