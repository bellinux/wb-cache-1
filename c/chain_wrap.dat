It {{told the story of}} a group of high school students from Jakarta who were trapped in Lawang Sewu after several had to urinate and featured ghosts of a Dutchwoman, a man with a ball and <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> around his leg, and a kuntilanak.|$|R
50|$|In {{mechanical}} clocks, {{the power}} source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> around a pulley, sprocket or drum; or a spiral spring called a mainspring. Mechanical clocks must be wound periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by {{pulling on the}} free end of the chain, to store energy in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{molecular}} structure of cytochrome c 3 isolated from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans has been solved {{on the basis}} of its crystallographic determination at 2. 5 A resolution and of an essentially complete sequence. The molecule consists of a single polypeptide <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> around a very compact core of four non-parallel haems which present a relatively high degree of exposure to the solvent. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of cytochrome c 3 from several species suggests that the structure reported here is characteristic of the cytochrome c 3 group.

5000|$|Makabe's wrestling {{style and}} {{character}} is {{heavily influenced by}} the late Bruiser Brody. Known as the [...] "Unchained Gorilla", Makabe {{is known for his}} violent, bloody style, often illegally employing steel chairs and chains into his offense, including a lariat with a <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> around his arm (like Brody). He also uses Brody's All Japan Pro Wrestling theme [...] "Immigrant Song" [...] (albeit a cover made by Tomoyasu Hotei) as his own.|$|R
50|$|Chain tongs: wrench with {{a section}} of <b>chain,</b> that <b>wraps</b> around {{whatever}} is being tightened or loosened. Similar to a pipe wrench.|$|R
50|$|One {{common type}} of wrench is shown on the right. The loop of chain is placed around the filter, and the bar is turned {{anticlockwise}} by hand until the <b>chain</b> <b>wraps</b> itself tightly around the filter. A socket wrench or adjustable spanner is then used to turn the hexagonal bar further in the same direction. This increases {{the tension in the}} chain, which bites into the soft metal casing of the oil filter which helps prevent slippage.|$|R
5000|$|Qilinbian (麒麟鞭, {{literally}} meaning [...] "unicorn whip") is a metal whip {{invented in}} China {{in the late}} 1900s. The 15 cm handle is made from a steel <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> with leather. The lash is made of steel rods decreasing in size linked by progressively smaller steel rings. Lash varies between 150 cm and 180 cm and {{is attached to a}} fall and a cracker. Total weight is 1-2 kg. It is used for physical exercise and in performances.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} torsional rigidity of a semiflexible <b>chain</b> on the <b>wrapping</b> transition around a spherical core, {{as a model of}} nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin. Through molecular dynamics simulation, we show that the torsional effect has a crucial effect on the <b>chain</b> <b>wrapping</b> around the core under the topological constraints. In particular, the torsional stress (i) induces the wrapping/unwrapping transition, and (ii) leads to a unique complex structure with an antagonistic wrapping direction which never appears without the topological constraints. We further examine the effect of the stretching stress for the nucleosome model, in relation to the unique characteristic effect of the torsional stress on the manner of wrapping...|$|R

50|$|The fusee was a {{much longer}} lasting innovation. This was a {{cone-shaped}} pulley that was turned by a <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the mainspring barrel. Its curving shape continuously changed the mechanical advantage of the linkage to even out {{the force of the}} mainspring as it ran down. Fusees became the standard method of getting constant torque from a mainspring. They were used in most spring driven clocks and watches from their first appearance until the 19th century when the going barrel took over, and in marine chronometers until the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|Currently, SPCA Selangor {{is working}} to persuade the local {{government}} to increase the fine for animal abusers. This campaign came about when a dog breeder in Cheras {{was found guilty of}} abusing 13 of his dogs and fined RM200. In another case, Tim, a Dachshund, had its <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> so tightly around its neck that the chain had become embedded into the skin, causing it to suffer a bloody six-inch wound around its neck. Its owner got a fine of RM200 and was put in jail for one day.|$|R
500|$|Thousands {{of horses}} were {{employed}} to pull field guns; six to twelve horses were required to pull each gun. [...] During the Battle of Cambrai, horses were used to recover guns captured by the British from no man's land. In one instance, two teams of sixteen horses each had their hooves, tack and pulling <b>chains</b> <b>wrapped</b> to reduce noise. The teams and their handlers then successfully pulled out two guns and returned them to British lines, the horses jumping a trench {{in the process and}} waiting out an artillery barrage by German troops on the road they needed to take.|$|R
50|$|The next contest was an Iron Circle match. It was contested in {{a parking}} garage. The rules of the match were that the first wrestler {{to get out of}} the cars would be {{declared}} the winner. Ken Shamrock competed against Steve Blackman. Shamrock and Blackman entered the circle and started fighting each other. Blackman tried to use a chain and a tire iron, however he missed both. Shamrock used a trashcan and the same steel <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> around his hand as weapons as the car's horns sounded. Shamrock then choked out Blackman with the chain to win.|$|R

50|$|Most tire <b>chains</b> are <b>wrapped</b> {{around the}} {{circumference}} of the tires and held in place with rim chains, which may be chain or cable, elastic or adjustable tensioners. Automatic <b>chains</b> do not <b>wrap</b> around the tire but swing under the tire from devices permanently mounted under the vehicle which deploy via an electronic solenoid activated in the cab. Spikes-Spider (registered trademark) mount onto the tires from one side. FlexTrax (registered trademark) uses a ratcheting system for easier installation.|$|R

25|$|The two given circles α and β {{touch the}} n circles of the Steiner chain, but each circle C'k of a Steiner chain touches only four circles: α, β, and its two neighbors, C'k1 and C'k+1. By default, Steiner chains {{are assumed to}} be closed, i.e., the first and last circles are tangent to one another. By contrast, an open Steiner chain is one in which the first and last circles, C1 and C'n, are not tangent to one another; these circles are tangent only to three circles. Multicyclic Steiner <b>chains</b> <b>wrap</b> around the inner circle several times before closing, i.e., before being tangent to the initial circle.|$|R
50|$|The chain {{travels through}} a steel trough, and is {{normally}} powered {{by one or}} more motors which are positioned under the lift hill. Chain dogs underneath each train are engaged by the chain and the train is pulled up the lift. Anti-rollback dogs engage a rack (ratcheted track) alongside the chain to prevent the train from descending the lift hill. At the crest of the lift, the <b>chain</b> <b>wraps</b> around a gear wheel where it begins its return {{to the bottom of the}} lift; the train is continually pulled along until gravity takes over and it accelerates downhill. The spring-loaded chain and anti-rollback dogs will disengage themselves as this occurs.|$|R

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Exile, {{replacing}} the Blades of Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The weapon {{is a pair of}} blades that are attached to <b>chains</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|R
25|$|The sixth {{match was}} a Dog Collar match between Roddy Piper and Greg Valentine. The match started back and forth, with Valentine {{targeting}} Piper's injured left ear. Piper gained the advantage {{with the use}} of the chain. Valentine fought back and choked Piper with the chain. Valentine targeted Piper's left ear, causing him to have trouble standing. The match went back and forth until Valentine performed an elbow strike from the turnbuckles and an elbow drop. Valentine climbed the turnbuckles again, but Piper pulled him down. After delivering punches with the chain, Piper pinned Valentine with the <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> around his legs. After the match, Valentine attacked Piper and again choked him with the chain.|$|R
25|$|Pre-war {{models were}} fitted with thin dia 1.626mm. (0.064 in.) axles and the post war axles were 2.032mm. (0.08 in.).

Tracks on the tanks and the 162a Light Dragon Artillery Tractor were done with wire-link {{sprocket}} <b>chain</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the hubs. This gave a mechanical, but not very realistic, appearance to the tracks. With the Anti-Aircraft Gun, the side panels folded and not only did the gun swivel 360 degrees, but it could be moved from level to about a 50-degree angle upward. The searchlight was also adjustable in horizontal and vertical directions.|$|R
