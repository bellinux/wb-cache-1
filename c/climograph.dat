5000|$|A <b>climograph</b> is a {{graphical}} representation of basic climatic parameters, that is monthly average temperature and precipitation, {{at a certain}} location. [...] It is used for a quick-view of the climate of a location.|$|E
40|$|<b>Climographs,</b> graphic {{plots of}} monthly {{temperature}} and precipitation, {{allow students to}} see how differences in insolation at various locations affect rates of heating and cooling. In this activity, students use <b>climographs</b> to plot locations using latitude and longitude, calculate annual temperature ranges, and relate unequal rates of heating and cooling to climate variations. They will also construct <b>climographs</b> for two locations in New York, analyze them, and answer questions about their observations. Educational levels: Middle school, High school...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} and {{evaluates the}} dryness and drought in the Caracal Plain, {{a division of}} the Romanian Plain, using some climatic indices (the De Martonne aridity index, the Angot report and the Angot precipitation index) and Péguy and Walter-Lieth <b>climographs,</b> for the 2000 – 2013 period. There have been used climate data from the Caracal Meteorological Station. The quantitative and comparative analysis of the above indices and of the <b>climographs</b> indicates that the intensity and duration of dryness and drought phenomena in the Caracal Plain have the same characteristics with the Oltenia region, meaning a slight increase from west and south-west to the east and north-east, which increases the degree of continentalism, and also from the north to the south...|$|R
40|$|Background : Malaria in Banjarnegara {{district}} is inequitable distribution. The fluctuate of meteorology factors was a dominant factor of the vector densities. This {{is very important}} object especially to evaluate {{the correlation between the}} <b>climograph</b> of meteorology data and malaria incidence. The <b>climograph</b> was the important instrument to predicted the re-emerging of malaria. Methods : Based on the malaria incidence and the meteorological data in ten years, the phenomena of climate change was analyzed. Correlation between malaria incidence and meteorology data analyses by the Pearson Product Moment. <b>Climograph</b> was composed by the average of meteorology data as long as ten years period. Average of yearly meteorology <b>climograph</b> was composed by the yearly meteorology data. The overlay of the two <b>climograph</b> conclude relationship between malaria case incidence and fluctuate of meteorology. Results : The results of the research showed coefficient of correlation rainfall to malaria incidence – 0, 75, correlation of air temperature to malaria incidence – 0, 6875, and correlation of air humidity to malaria incidence – 0, 6407. If the annual <b>climograph</b> as same as range with the average of the ten years <b>climograph,</b> incidence of malaria was low (1995, API 0, 02).

40|$|Azerbaijan {{has three}} major {{greenhouse}} vegetable production areas: {{the western part}} of the country (mainly Ganja and Shamkir regions); the central region (mainly Absheron peninsula); and the southern region Lankaran and Astara area. Of the about 280 hectares of greenhouses in Azerbaijan, about 20 % are antiquated Soviet style greenhouses, many of which are currently being updated and repaired by their owners. New structures of Israeli, Dutch, Turkish and Italian companies have been built or are in the planning stages of construction. Finally, about 30 % are home built polyethylene covered greenhouses with mixed wooden and steel frame materials, while low tunnels also exist. The majority of greenhouse cultivation systems in Azerbaijan, regardless of geographic location, consist of fundamental climate control components, and depending on their design and complexity, they can provide a greater or lesser amount of climate control, and subsequent plant growth and productivity. The <b>climograph</b> of Baku shows that greenhouses in Baku, if year round cultivation is needed, will have to be equipped at least with heating and ventilation systems while cooling systems during summer period would be also preferable. The main constraints for greenhouse cultivations in Azerbaijan are heating and cooling since it is considered that climate conditions inside the rudimentarily equipped greenhouses do not meet crop needs for optimal growing. No absolute solutions are available since variations in design and past maintenance may exist. Energy conservation is also necessary since the above greenhouses are not equipped at all with energy saving systems. In this paper, an effort to suggest the appropriate design of greenhouses and their equipment suitable for the region is made, and guidelines on the step up of the supply chain management for the sustainable development of the greenhouse sector in Azerbaijan are given...|$|E

40|$|Natalie {{will present}} an {{overview}} {{the content of}} two new (2015) curricula designed for youth in grades 3 through 12. Soil and Water Science; Weather and Climate Science. Three booklets are included in each curriculum. Level 1, for youth in grades 3 - 5, introduces basic terms and concepts. Level 2 activities, for youth in grades 6 - 8, help youth put the basic concepts into action to understand more advanced concepts and interactions. Level 3 manuals delve more deeply into important concepts and helps prepare youth to be well informed and for advanced studies at college or university. Level 3 Soil 2 ̆ 6 Water Science: activities are divided into chapters based on how youth might use the information they have learned — as a homeowner, as a resident of a watershed, as a food and fiber producer, as a mayor, as a teacher, and as a legislator. Weather 2 ̆ 6 Climate Science: Level 3 is divided into weather and climate sections. The weather section includes the study of air masses, wind chill and heat indexes, and weather station models. The climate section includes the study of <b>climographs,</b> the energy balance, and investigation of climate change. A facilitator’s guide for the adult working with the learner(s) is available for each youth manual. These guides include a brief background for each activity, suggestions for working with youth, connections to other topics or ideas, science standards, and success indicators. The manuals may be downloaded from Purdue University’s The Education Store (www. edustore. purdue. edu). Level 1 is also available in print...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the genome integrity of indigenous buffalo breeds-Murrah and Nilli-Ravi (same age, sex and environmental conditions) in the northern states Punjab (Patiala) and Haryana (Hisar & Karnal) of India. The <b>climographs</b> based on the monthly mean temperature (30 years) and monthly mean relative humidity of Hisar, Karnal and Patiala regions were prepared for assessment of climatic conditions of particular regions in which animals were reared throughout the year. Seventy five buffaloes of the two breeds were used in this study. All animals were kept in organized herd at three different farm locations. Comparative cytogenetic analysis was made between the two breeds of buffalo. The cytogenetic studies of peripheral lymphocytes included chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). The mean number of gaps in Murrah buffalo of Karnal and Hisar regions were 12. 48 ± 4. 12 and 10. 86 ± 3. 65 respectively. Similarly, the mean number of gaps in Nilli-Ravi breed of buffalo from Patiala was 7. 0 ± 2. 27. The mean frequency of chromosomal breaks in Murrah buffalo from Hisar and Karnal were 5. 96 ± 1. 92 and 5. 44 ± 2. 72 and 3. 1 ± 1. 97 in Nilli-Ravi respectively, the difference was statistically significant. The frequency (mean±SD) of sister chromatid exchanges/per cell in Murrah buffaloes from Hisar and Karnal were 6. 64 ± 2. 21 and 6. 26 ± 1. 92 and for Nilli-Ravi was 3. 52 ± 1. 87. The results of cytogenetic analysis between the two buffalo breeds reared under same climatic conditions at different farm locations (Haryana and Punjab) reveal significant (P< 0. 01) differences in their genome integrity as detected by CAs and SCEs...|$|R
