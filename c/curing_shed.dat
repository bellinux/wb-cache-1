5000|$|The Callawassie Sugar Works' {{construction}} {{appears to}} be based on observations made by Thomas Spalding. [...] It incorporated three principal components: a mill, boiling house, and <b>curing</b> <b>shed.</b> The footprint of the buildings suggests that the boiling house and <b>curing</b> <b>shed</b> were aligned in a [...] "T" [...] configuration (little remains of the <b>curing</b> <b>shed).</b> The remaining structures include exterior walls of the one-story buildings with the brick boiling train still evident in the mill. Primitive mills of this kind usually had a set of four kettles arranged in a line, the tops of the kettles being raised from the floor.|$|E
50|$|The Callawassie Sugar Works is a {{historically}} significant site containing the tabby (cement) ruins of two structures - the sugar mill base or foundation, and the boiling house - and archaeological {{evidence of a}} third structure, most likely the <b>curing</b> <b>shed.</b> The sugar works, constructed circa 1815-1818, was a complex for processing sugar cane into sugar.|$|E
50|$|The Callawassie Sugar Works is a {{historically}} significant industrial site at 29 Sugar Mill Drive in Okatie, South Carolina, on Callawassie Island in Beaufort County. The site contains the tabby ruins of two structures (the sugar mill base or foundation, and the boiling house) and archeological {{evidence of a}} third structure (most likely the <b>curing</b> <b>shed).</b> The sugar works, constructed circa 1815-1818, was a complex for processing sugar cane into sugar.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, {{with local}} consent, Obbe was renamed Leverburgh, and 300 men started {{work on a}} new pier and {{seashore}} infrastructure for processing the catch from 50 berthed trawlers. Shore side construction covered an accommodation block, <b>curing</b> <b>sheds,</b> smoke houses, a refrigeration building, store sheds, houses for the managers and a twenty car garage.|$|R
50|$|Working {{conditions}} {{varied from}} backbreaking work for young local children, ages 13 and up, to backbreaking exploitation of migrants. Each tobacco plant yields only 18 leaves useful as cigar wrappers, and each leaf requires {{a great deal}} of individual manual attention during harvesting. Although the temperature in the <b>curing</b> <b>sheds</b> sometimes exceeds 38 C no work is done inside the sheds while the tobacco is being fired.|$|R
6000|$|Late {{in the day}} {{we passed}} the largest Indian village we had yet seen. It was {{situated}} on Stony Creek, which came from Tatchick Lake and emptied into Tchincut Lake. The shallows flickered {{with the passing of}} trout, and the natives were busy catching and drying them. As we rode amid the <b>curing</b> <b>sheds,</b> the children raised a loud clamor, and the women laughed and called from house to house, [...] "Oh, see the white men!" [...] We were a circus parade to them.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{only the}} {{foundation}} of the mill and parts of the boiling house remain of the three structures of the sugar mill: the mill itself, boiling house, and <b>curing</b> <b>shed.</b> There is no evidence (above or below ground) that the tabby cement mill base was ever enclosed within a permanent structure, even though the base survives in excellent condition. While the boiling pans and masonry that supported them have disappeared, the boiling train bed, constructed of fire brick, is still intact, together with an ash pit and wall vents. The long tabby wall {{on the north side of}} the boiling house collapsed outward and retained enough integrity to enable theoretical reconstruction of the original layout of windows. Excavation of glass at the site suggests that the windows were glazed. Only tabby strip foundations remain of the <b>curing</b> <b>shed,</b> which was most likely timber framed. All machinery and mechanical equipment is gone. Despite the degradation of the sugar mill site over time, the remnants are still illustrative of sugar processing before the introduction of steam machinery in the late 1830s.|$|E
50|$|White House Farm, {{also known}} as White House Tavern and the Dr. John McCormick House, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, is located in Jefferson County, West Virginia, near {{the small town of}} Summit Point, about six miles from Charles Town, West Virginia. The farm {{consists}} of a ca. 1740 farmhouse, a stone barn (the oldest standing in West Virginia), a springhouse of about the same age, a wooden <b>curing</b> <b>shed,</b> and 60+ acres of pasture and woods. The farm {{is one of the oldest}} in the county and has a rich history.|$|E

50|$|In late 1919, Leverhulme {{purchased}} the South Harris estate from the Earl of Dunmore for {{the sum of}} £36,000. Taking in the Western Isles fishing village of Obbe, he planned {{to turn it into}} a consolidated major fishing centre, with product distributed through the Mac Fisheries shops. In 1920, Obbe with local consent was rebranded Leverburgh, and 300 men started work on a new pier and seashore infrastructure for processing the product from 50 berthed trawlers. Shore side construction covered an accommodation block, <b>curing</b> <b>sheds,</b> smoke houses, a refrigeration building, store sheds, houses for the managers and a 20 car garage.|$|R
50|$|Galivants Ferry Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located at Galivants Ferry in Horry County, South Carolina. It encompasses 28 contributing buildings that reflect the agricultural heritage of Galivants Ferry and of the larger Pee Dee region. Included are tenant farmer houses, storage barns, tobacco packhouses, <b>curing</b> barns, and <b>sheds.</b> The include {{the home of the}} Holliday family and a church that sits {{at the edge of a}} long stretch of tobacco fields on Pee Dee Road. Also included is a filling station (ca. 1922) along U.S. Route 501.|$|R
5000|$|Fresh hams are {{trimmed and}} cleaned, then stacked {{and covered with}} salt {{for about two weeks}} in order to draw off excess {{moisture}} and preserve the meat from spoiling. The salt is then washed off and the hams are hung to dry for about six months. Finally, the hams are hung in a cool, dry place for six to eighteen months, depending on the climate, as well as the size and type of ham being <b>cured.</b> The drying <b>sheds</b> (secaderos) are usually built at higher elevations, which is why the ham is called [...] "mountain ham".|$|R
30|$|Fast curing {{stackable}} {{sealing material}} is a polymer composite with multi-component, multi-usage, and solid gel combination, and {{is composed of}} a polymer compound, foaming agents, catalysts, flame retardants and other components. The feeding sequence for making the sealing material is: A material → B material → water-cement-sand mixture → curing agent. At the same time, the sealing material was quickly mixed to a uniform status, then pressurized and sprayed. The volume of the sealing material would instantly expand to (10 – 30) times of its original volume to achieve fast sealing. This material does not contain formaldehyde, is nontoxic, odorless, and non-corrosive. During the reaction expansion process, the sealing material can fill the space and cracks in coal and rock, and has a strong bonding property. It can bond coal (rock) body, concrete, and other materials to form one solid body. It has {{a certain level of}} pressure resistance and shear resistance strength. It has good flexibility, is shockproof and pressure resistant, has strong elastic resilience after compression, with no cracking after <b>curing,</b> and no <b>shedding.</b> It has insulation properties, including heat insulation and flame retardant properties, suitable for filling at different locations in an underground coal mine.|$|R
50|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} the failure of the Townsville tobacco industry. It was {{generally}} considered that the Experimental Farm at Mareeba contributed greatly {{to the success of the}} industry in that area. Although the Townsville and District Development Association agitated for a government Experimental Farm in this area to provide support for local inexperienced growers, this never eventuated. Water was always a problem as tobacco growers relied on the northern wet season. Failure of the season had drastic consequences, as did a heavy season. The tobacco plant was particularly prone to diseases and pests. Inexperienced farmers lacked the expertise to deal with these diseases, as well as cope with the complicated curing process. Government fiscal policy did not always favour the local grower: increased excise on home-grown tobacco and reduced duties on imports were blamed for the unsatisfactory position of the industry in 1934. This variety of causes often meant farmers could not sell a large enough portion of their crop at prices high enough to cover their capital outlay. Capital required to establish a tobacco farm was estimated at around £950, a considerable sum in the 1930s. This included the cultivation of 15 acres, deposit on land, a small hut, clearing, <b>curing</b> barns, bulk <b>shed,</b> horses, farm equipment and some labour costs.|$|R
