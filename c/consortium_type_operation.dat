30|$|In {{relational}} operations (R), {{according to}} Gadrey’s typology, {{the object of}} the service operation is the customer himself, in a direct contact service. In our case of freight transport services, this <b>type</b> of <b>operations</b> is difficult, if not impossible, to identify, especially in large, codified data sets such as the ECHO survey. In our case studies in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region, we could however identify some cases where this <b>type</b> of <b>operation</b> applies. The object of the relational service operation is, in these cases, the relation between the shipper’s and his customer, in which the transport firm plays a particular role. This is mainly the case for transport firms that operate frequent dedicated delivery tour <b>type</b> <b>operations</b> on a regular basis for a given shipper. The transport service provider has the only direct contact to the customer and can give important feedback on quality issues and customer satisfaction.|$|R

Copyright Notice Copyright © Global Grid Forum (2005). All Rights Reserved. Remote data access {{can be viewed as}} simply the “get ” or “put ” of files.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{incidence}} of nuisance bleeding after AMI and its impact on QOL. BackgroundProlonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to reduce ischemic events, but it is associated with increased rates of major and minor bleeding. The incidence of even lesser degrees of post-discharge “nuisance” bleeding with DAPT and its impact on quality of life (QOL) are unknown. MethodsData from the 24 -center TRIUMPH (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) study of 3, 560 patients, who were interviewed at 1, 6, and 12 months after AMI, were used to investigate the incidence of nuisance bleeding (defined as Bleeding Academic Research <b>Consortium</b> <b>type</b> 1). Baseline characteristics associated with “nuisance” bleeding and its association with QOL, as measured by the EuroQol 5 Dimension visual analog scale, and subsequent re-hospitalization were examined. ResultsNuisance (Bleeding Academic Research <b>Consortium</b> <b>type</b> 1) bleeding occurred in 1, 335 patients (37. 5 %) over the 12 months after AMI. After adjusting for baseline bleeding and mortality risk, ongoing DAPT was the strongest predictor of nuisance bleeding (rate ratio [RR]: 1. 44, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 17 to 1. 76 at 1 month; RR: 1. 89, 95 % CI: 1. 35 to 2. 65 at 6 months; and RR: 1. 39, 95 % CI: 1. 08 to 1. 79 at 12 months; p < 0. 01 for all comparisons). Nuisance bleeding at 1 month was independently associated with a decrement in QOL at 1 month (− 2. 81 points on EuroQol 5 Dimension visual analog scale; 95 % CI: 1. 09 to 5. 64) and nonsignificantly toward higher re-hospitalization (hazard ratio: 1. 20; 95 % CI: 0. 95 to 1. 52). ConclusionsNuisance bleeding is common in the year after AMI, associated with ongoing use of DAPT, and independently associated with worse QOL. Improved selection of patients for prolonged DAPT may help minimize the incidence and adverse consequences of nuisance bleeding...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for polymorphic type inference for the dynamically typed language Scheme. The method infers both types and explicit run-time <b>type</b> <b>operations</b> (coercions) {{for a given}} program. It {{can be used to}} statically debug Scheme programs and to give a high-level translation to ML, in essence providing an "embedding" of Scheme into ML. Our method combines the following desirable properties: ffl It is liberal in that no legal Scheme programs are "rejected " outright by the type inferencer. ffl It is modular in that definitions can be analyzed independent of the context of their use. The inferred type scheme for a definition is safe for all contexts. This is accomplished by admitting type coercion parameters, resulting in a form of polymorphic qualified type system. ffl It infers both types and run-time <b>type</b> <b>operations</b> and places the latter opportunistically at any suitable program point, not only at data creation and destruction points. ffl It is very efficient.
