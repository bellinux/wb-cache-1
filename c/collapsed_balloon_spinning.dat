The tests comprised measurements, using the optical method, of spindle-neck coating produced from EN AW- 2024 (AlCu 4 Mg 1) alloy, and sub-jected to, in the first variant, the operation of burnishing, and in the second variant – the burnishing operation followed by hard anodic oxidation and grinding with abrasive paper having a grain size of 600. Moreover, {{to be able to do}} it, the circularity deviation of the cylindrical part of the neck coating at the same distances from the face of the crown were measured with the use of a Taylrond 365 circularity tester. Next, based on the contours of circularity obtained, a contour of cylindrical shape of the spindle-neck coating, both burnished and burnished and anodic oxidized, brand-new and after an operational time was prepared. An assessment of the topography and microphotography of the oxide layer of the spindle-neck coating was performed, both in brand-new condition and after an op-erational time.

40|$|NASA's Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator Project is {{developing}} and testing {{the next generation}} of supersonic aerodynamic decelerators for planetary entry. A key element of that development is the testing of full-scale articles in conditions relevant to their intended use, primarily the tenuous Mars atmosphere. To achieve this testing, the LDSD project developed a test architecture similar to that used by the Viking Project in the early 1970 's for the qualification of their supersonic parachute. A large, helium filled scientific balloon is used to hoist a 4. 7 m blunt body test vehicle to an altitude of approximately 32 kilometers. The test vehicle is released from the <b>balloon,</b> <b>spun</b> up for gyroscopic stability, and accelerated to over four times the speed of sound and an altitude of 50 kilometers using a large solid rocket motor. Once at those conditions, the vehicle is despun and the test period begins. The first flight of this architecture occurred on June 28 th of 2014. Though primarily a shake out flight of the new test system, the flight was also able to achieve an early test of two of the LDSD technologies, a large 6 m diameter Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD) and a large, 30. 5 m nominal diameter supersonic parachute.

"We now {{near the}} {{confines}} of the clouds, and dip swiftly into the thickest of them; we experience a decided chill, and hear the rustling of the <b>collapsing</b> <b>balloon,</b> which is now but one-third full, but cannot see it, so dense is the mass of vapour. One, two, three, or more minutes pass, and we are still in the cloud. How thick it must be, considering the rapidity of the descent! Presently we pass below, and the earth is visible. There is a high road intersecting green pastures; a piece of water looking like polished steel presents itself; a farmhouse, with stacks and cattle, is directly under us. We see the sea-coast, but at a distance. An open country lies before us. A shout comes up, and announces that we are seen, and all goes well, save the rapidity of our descent, which has been caused by that dark frowning cloud which shut us out from the sun's rays, and bedewed us with moisture. Mr Coxwell, however, is counteracting it by means of the ballast, and streams out one bag, which appears to fly up instead of falling down; now another is cast forth, but still it goes up, up. A third reduces the wayward balloon within the bounds of moderation, and Mr Coxwell exultingly exclaims that `he has it now under perfect command, with sand enough, and to spare.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{dangers of}} the sport include {{excessive}} (vertical or horizontal) speed during landing, mid-air collisions that may <b>collapse</b> the <b>balloon,</b> and colliding with high voltage power lines. It {{is the last of}} these, contact with power lines, that poses the greatest danger. One of the most common causes of serious ballooning accidents in the US is power line strikes.One reason for the high frequency of such incidents is the fact that pilots often attempt to land their balloons on or near roads {{in order to reduce the}} amount of off-road driving necessary to recover the balloon. However, in most rural areas where balloons fly, roads usually have power lines running along them.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{effectiveness}} of the Union Army Balloon Corps, the Confederates felt compelled to incorporate balloons as well. Since coke gas was not readily available in Richmond, the first balloons were made of the Montgolfier rigid style: cotton stretched over wood framing and filled with hot smoke from fires made of oil-soaked pine cones. They were piloted by Captain John R. Bryan for use at Yorktown. Bryan's handlers were poorly experienced, and his <b>balloon</b> began <b>spinning</b> in the air. In another incident, one of the handlers became entangled in the ascending tether rope which had to be chopped loose, leaving the captain free-flying over his own Confederate positions whose troops threatened to shoot him down.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} type of top vent is a {{disk-shaped}} flap of fabric called a parachute vent, invented by Tracy Barnes. The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of [...] "vent lines" [...] that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachute—thus the name.) These [...] "vent lines" [...] are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to <b>collapse</b> the <b>balloon</b> after landing.|$|R
50|$|When larvae hatch, they {{disperse}} by <b>ballooning</b> away. Larvae <b>spin</b> silk threads {{and hang}} from them, {{waiting for the}} wind to blow them to a suitable host. In central Asia, hatching larvae balloon off the ridges. In Mongolia, dispersal is done by ballooning from rock faces or pine trees. Distances vary from a hundred meters up to a kilometer or more, assuming the conditions are right. In China and Korea and larvae disperse to suitable tree species to feed, but adults fly back to the large pines for oviposition, a cycle which is repeated yearly.|$|R

40|$|Yarn {{tension is}} a key factor that affects the {{efficiency}} of a ring spinning system. In this paper, a specially constructed rig, which can rotate a yarn at a high speed without inserting any real twist into the yarn, was used to simulate a ring spinning process. Yarn tension was measured at the guide-eye during the simulated spinning of different yarns at various balloon heights and with varying yarn length in the balloon. The effect of balloon shape, yarn hairiness and thickness, and yarn rotating speed, on the measured yarn tension, was examined. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>collapse</b> of <b>balloon</b> shape from single loop to double loop, or from double loop to triple etc, lead to sudden reduction in yarn tension. Under otherwise identical conditions, a longer length of yarn in the balloon gives a lower yarn tension at the guide-eye. In addition, thicker yarns and/or more hairy yarns generate a higher tension in the yarn, due to the increased air drag acting on the thicker or more hairy yarns...|$|R
60|$|A fete {{was held}} {{some years ago}} in the park of Mr North, Basford, near Nottingham. Amongst the amusements, it was {{arranged}} that Mr Coxwell should make a balloon ascent. The balloon was almost new, but not of very large dimensions. After it had been fully inflated, Mr Coxwell tried it, and found there would be some difficulty in ascending in it, owing to its weight. At this juncture, a Mr James Chambers, of Nottingham, who had previously made many ascents, stepped forward and offered to go in his stead, saying that he was lighter than Mr Coxwell, and that he wished to make the ascent. After some conversation, it was agreed that Chambers should go up, but Mr Coxwell told him not to attempt an ascent unless he felt quite confident that he could manage the balloon. Chambers replied that he had no fear about managing it, and accordingly he was allowed to make the ascent. The balloon rose steadily, and was carried somewhat rapidly in a north-easterly direction towards Nottingham. It proceeded as far as Arno Vale, when it was seen suddenly to collapse, while still at a considerable altitude, and then to fall quickly in an unshapely mass. Some young men who were near the spot where the balloon fell, hastened to render assistance. The balloon dropped into the car as it descended, completely covering it, and ultimately both fell in a field near Scout Lane, three miles from Nottingham. The car struck the ground and rebounded several feet, and then fell again, when it was seized and stopped by the young men, who had followed it. At the bottom of the car lay stretched the body of the unfortunate aeronaut. He was lifted out and found to be breathing, but quite insensible. He was conveyed to the nearest dwelling, and means were adopted to restore animation, but without effect. Two medical gentlemen, named Robertson and Maltby, afterwards saw him, and it was discovered that his left thigh was fractured, and some of the ribs on his left side were broken, but they considered it very probable that the unfortunate man had died through suffocation, as a handkerchief, which had been found in his mouth, had probably been placed there by himself when he found that he was in danger of being stifled by the gas from the <b>collapsing</b> <b>balloon.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractRelative {{contraindications}} to {{coronary angioplasty}} have been {{large amounts of}} jeopardized myocardium and poor left ventricular function. To prevent possible hemodynamic <b>collapse</b> after <b>balloon</b> occlusion or acute vessel closure in such high risk patients, a cardiopulumonary bypass system capable of providing up to 6 liters/min output was employed prophylactically. This technique, termed supported angioplasty, results in reductions of preload and afterload and allows prolonged balloon inflations in critical coronary vessels. A National Registry of 14 centers performing elective supplied angioplasty was formed to collate the initial experience with high risk patients. Suggested indications were ejection fraction 75 {{years of age and}} had left main coronary artery stenosis. Patients without these two factors had a hospital mortality rate of 2. 6 %. Symptomatic improvement (lessening of New York Heart Association chest pain classification by at least two classes) occurred in 91 % of the patients surviving hospitalization. During the follow-up period of 1 to 12 months, three patients died of cardiac complications. This multicenter experience suggests that supported angioplasty can be safely performed with the expectation of good symptomatic improvement and short-term survival in high risk patients other than elderly individuals with left main coronary artery stenosis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Long-distance {{dispersal}} {{events have}} the potential to shape species distributions and ecosystem diversity over large spatial scales, and to influence processes such as population persistence and the pace and scale of invasion. How such dispersal strategies have evolved and are maintained within species is, however, often unclear. We have studied long-distance dispersal in a range of pest-controlling terrestrial spiders that are important predators within agricultural ecosystems. These species persist in heterogeneous environments through their ability to re-colonise vacant habitat by repeated long-distance aerial dispersal (???<b>ballooning???)</b> using <b>spun</b> silk lines. Individuals are strictly terrestrial, are not thought to tolerate landing on water, and have no control over where they land once airborne. Their tendency to spread via aerial dispersal has thus been thought to be limited by the costs of encountering water, which is a frequent hazard in the landscape. Results: In our study we find that ballooning in a subset of individuals from two groups of widely-distributed and phylogenetically distinct terrestrial spiders (linyphiids and one tetragnathid) is associated with a hitherto undescribed ability of those same individuals to survive encounters with both fresh and marine water. Individuals that showed a high tendency to adopt ???ballooning??? behaviour adopted elaborate postures to seemingly take advantage of the wind current whilst on the water surface. Conclusions: The ability of individuals capable of long-distance aerial dispersal to survive encounters with water allows them to disperse repeatedly, thereby increasing the pace and spatial scale over which they can spread and subsequently exert an influence on the ecosystems into which they migrate. The potential for genetic connectivity between populations, which can influence the rate of localized adaptation, thus exists over much larger geographic scales than previously thought. Newly available habitat may be particularly influenced given the degree of ecosystem disturbance that is known to follow new predator introductions...|$|R
40|$|Future {{missions}} to Mars will require improved entry, descent, and landing (EDL) technology over the Viking-heritage systems which recently landed the largest payload to date, the 900 kg Mars Science Laboratory. As a result, NASA's Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) project {{is working to}} advance {{the state of the}} art in Mars EDL systems by developing and testing three key technologies which will enable heavier payloads and higher altitude landing sites on the red planet. These technologies consist of a large 33. 5 m diameter Supersonic Disk Sail (SSDS) parachute and two different Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD) devices - a robotic class that inflates to a 6 m diameter torus (SIAD-R), and an exploration class that inflates to an 8 m diameter isotensoid (SIADE). All three technologies will be demonstrated on test vehicles at high earth altitudes in order to simulate the Mars EDL environment. Each vehicle will be carried to altitude by a large helium <b>balloon,</b> released, <b>spun</b> up using spin motors to stabilize the vehicle's trajectory, and accelerated to supersonic speeds using a large solid rocket motor. The vehicle will then be spun down using another set of spin motors, and will deploy either the SIAD-R or SIAD-E, followed by the SSDS parachute until the vehicle lands in the ocean. Component level testing and bounding analysis are used to ensure the survival of system components in extreme thermal environments and predict temperatures throughout the flight. This paper presents a general description of the thermal testing, model correlation, and analysis of the spin motor passive thermal control sub-system to maintain spin motor performance, prescribed vehicle trajectory, and structural integrity of the test vehicle. The spin motor subsystem is predicted to meet its requirements with margin...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Undeflatable Foley {{catheter}} balloons {{adapted for}} use as nasal packing in epistaxis represent a possible complication. Case Reports We report on three cases in which Foley catheter balloons adapted {{for use as}} posterior nasal packing in epistaxis failed to deflate. In one patient, deflation was achieved by simply using the fingertips to massage the segment of the catheter collapsed by the fixation device.

Discussion The probable causes of the undeflatable balloons in these cases were a blockage or lumen <b>collapse</b> of the <b>balloon</b> or a malfunction in the valve system. Although no definitive method has been established for dealing with this complication, the options proposed are the following: manipulation to restore the permeability of the segment of the catheter collapsed by the fixation device, {{if this is the}} case; sectioning the catheter or inserting a stiletto catheter; bursting the balloon; or removing it by the oral route.

5000|$|However, {{balloons}} have {{a certain}} elasticity to them {{that needs to be}} taken into account. The act of stretching a balloon fills it with potential energy. When it is released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and the balloon snaps back into its original position, though perhaps a little stretched out. When a balloon is filled with air, the balloon is being stretched. While the elasticity of the balloon causes tension that would have the <b>balloon</b> <b>collapse,</b> it is also being pushed back out by the constant bouncing of the internal air molecules. The internal air has to exert force not only to counteract the external air to keep the air pressures [...] "even", but it also has to counteract the natural contraction of the balloon. Therefore, it requires more air pressure (or force) than the air outside the balloon wall. Because of this, when helium balloons are left and they float higher, as atmospheric pressure decreases, the air inside it exerts more pressure than outside it so the balloon pops from tension. In some cases, the helium leaks out from pores and the balloon deflates, falling down.|$|R

40|$|Abstract - We discuss specific, recent {{advances}} {{in the analysis of}} an experiment to test the Equivalence Principle (EP) in free fall. A differential accelerometer detector with two proof masses of different materials free falls inside an evacuated capsule previously released from a stratospheric <b>balloon.</b> The detector <b>spins</b> slowly about its horizontal axis during the fall. An EP violation signal (if present) will manifest itself at the rotational frequency of the detector. The detector operates in a quiet environment as it slowly moves with respect to the co-moving capsule. There are, however, gravitational and dynamical noise contributions that need to be evaluated in order to define key requirements for this experiment. Specifically, higher-order mass moments of the capsule contribute errors to the differential acceleration output with components at the spin frequency which need to be minimized. The dynamics of the free falling detector (in its present design) has been simulated in order to estimate the tolerable errors at release which, in turn, define the release mechanism requirements. Moreover, the study of the higher-order mass moments for a worst-case position of the detector package relative to the cryostat has led to the definition of requirements on the shape and size of the proof masses...|$|R

40|$|The flight {{simulation}} of airships and hot air balloons usually considers the envelope geometry as a fixed shape, whose volume is eventually reduced by ballonets. However, the dynamic pressure or helium leaks in airships, {{and the release}} of air to allow descent in hot air balloons can significantly change the shape of the envelope leading to potential dangerous situations. In fact, in case of semi-rigid and non-rigid airships a reduction in envelope internal pressure can reduce the envelope bending stiffness leading to the loss of the typical axial-symmetric shape. For hot air balloons thing goes even worse since the lost of internal pressure can lead to the <b>collapsing</b> of the <b>balloon</b> shape to a sort of vertically stretched geometry (similar to a torch) which is not able to sustain the attached basket and its payload. These effect should be considered in simulations, however to compute in real time the envelope shape with Finite Element Methods is a complex and demanding task due to the high deformations, complex fabric model, and wrinkling effects. A possible solution to overcome this problem is to apply a Cloth Simulation Technique (CST) to the prediction of the envelope behaviour. This paper describes how such a model can be implemented for airship envelops and hot air balloons shape predictions. Appropriate algorithms have been developed in Matlab® and validation test have been conducted. Results show that this model can provide qualitatively good results, in agreement with the experience and the physics of the problem...|$|R
50|$|At 11:00, {{the battle}} for the Navy Yard had shifted from the naval portion, the {{remaining}} British ship HMS Greyhound making sure to stay away from Lowe's balloon, to the land portion as Royal Marines made full contact with the Americans of the Navy Yard. What the British ships did not accomplish on their own the marines finished: the Navy Yard was in many parts ablaze. As the balloon was already losing altitude from bullet holes, Lowe signaled his ground crew to lower him down so they could join the fight against the British marines.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel pressure-compensating flow restrictor for low-cost/low-pressure drip irrigation systems. There are nearly one billion subsistence {{farmers in the}} developing world who lack the resources and opportunities to rise out of poverty. Irrigation is an effective development strategy for this population, enabling farmers to increase crop yields and grow more lucrative plant varieties. Unfortunately, as a large fraction of subsistence farmers live off the electrical grid, the capital cost of solar or diesel powered irrigation systems makes them unobtainable. This cost could be drastically reduced by altering drip irrigation systems to operate at a decreased pressure such that lower pumping power is required. The work presented here aims to accomplish this by designing a drip emitter that operates at 0. 1 bar, 1 / 10 the pressure of current products, while also providing pressure-compensation to uniformly distribute flow over a field. Our proposed pressure compensating solution is inspired by the resonating nozzle of a deflating balloon. First, a reduced order model is developed to understand the physical principles which drive the cyclic <b>collapse</b> of the <b>balloon</b> nozzle. We then apply this understanding to propose a pressure compensating emitter consisting of compliant tube in series with a rigid diffuser. A scaling analysis is performed to determine the ideal geometry of the system and the reduced order model is applied to demonstrate that the proposed design is capable of pressure compensation in the required operation range. Preliminary experiments demonstrating the collapse effect are presented, along with initial work to translate the concept to a robust physical device...|$|R
