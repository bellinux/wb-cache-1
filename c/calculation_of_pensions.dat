40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effects of a {{parametric}} adjustment to an earnings-related PAYG pension system.

Such an ‘intelligent’ pension design would maintain a strong link between own labor income and the future pension, while putting more (less) weight on the labor income earned as an older (young) worker in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pension</b> base. The higher (lower) marginal utility from work when older (young) following this reform makes it interesting to shift work from the first to later periods of active life. Part of the available time that arises during youth is spent on education. Another part can be spent on raising offspring. By contrast, a shift to a fully-funded system might even reduce fertility...|$|R

The purpose of this work is to give an in-depth look at these important policy issues and changes happened in four chapters. Chapter one provides some definitions of the main economic variables both at the micro and macro levels and {{a closer look at}} the current data on savings and on the complex range of public, private and voluntary retirement plans which are now playing a greater role in pension-provision in many OECD countries. Chapter two is devoted to the most significant theories about the origin and the effects <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> systems, in particular, the "Intertemporal choice model" by Irving Fisher, "The life cycle model" by Franco Modigliani and the "Permanent Income Theory" by Milton Friedman. Chapter three presents a consistent framework which describes the social security systems across OECD countries: replacement rates, financial schemes (Pay-As-You-Go and Fully Funded), contribution systems (defined contribution and defined benefit), the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> benefits, the effects of the social security system on individual decisions and the problems related to the transition from a Pay-As-You-Go to a Fully Funded program. Finally, chapter four attempts to develop a model whose purpose is to find the optimal mix between the Pay-As-You-Go and Fully Funded programs, and in the last section it also provides some numerical estimates related to the model.
