5000|$|When {{multiple}} MDTs are configured for a filesystem, {{the client}} determines on which MDT a given filename resides on by looking up the 128-bit Lustre File Identifier (FID, {{composed of the}} Sequence number and Object ID) of the parent directory in the FID Location Database (FLDB), which maps the Sequence to a specific MDT. Once the MDT of the parent directory is determined, further directory operations (for non-striped directories) take place exclusively on that MDT, avoiding contention between MDTs. For striped directories, the per-directory layout stored on the parent directory provides a hash function and list of MDT objects across which the directory is distributed. The filename is hashed and mapped to a specific MDT shard, which will handle further operations on that file in an identical manner to a non-striped directory. For readdir (...) operations, the entries from each directory shard are returned interleaved in hash order so that a single 64-bit cookie {{can be used to}} determine the <b>current</b> <b>offset</b> within the directory.|$|E

40|$|A general AC PM (Permanent Magnet) {{motor control}} system {{consists}} of a motion controller, a current tracking amplifier, a feedback encoder and the motor itself. The motion controller generates two analog commands to the current tracking amplifier and the three phase currents are reproduced at the motor terminals. However, DC offsets are always present at the motor terminals due to the DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) offsets of the motion controller and the <b>current</b> sensor <b>offsets</b> of the <b>current</b> tracking amplifier. These <b>current</b> <b>offsets</b> generate sinusoidal torque disturbance and hence produce velocity ripples. Such a disturbance cannot be rejected by using a simple PI (Proportional plus Integral) control. Furthermore, the <b>current</b> <b>offsets</b> drift with time and temperature so that an off-line compensation does not work satisfactorily. In this paper, a robust 2 DOF (Two Degree of Freedom) regulator containing the internal model of the sinusoidal disturbance is proposed to accomplish disturbance rejection and constant speed tracking...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{ability of}} {{adjustment}} {{of the central}} frequency of a Gm-C resonator in GaAs technology is discussed. First, it is shown that whatever the technology the wanted quality factor can be reached through an appropriate sizing of the transconductance values, with adding an external feedback capacitor in the transconductance amplifiers. Then, it is demonstrated that the adjustment of the central frequency must be made preferentially by a specifical transconductance. Finally, because in GaAs technologies varying the transconductance values leads to <b>current</b> <b>offsets</b> which could damage the performances, the maximal allowed <b>current</b> <b>offsets</b> are determined. To illustrate these considerations, simulation at transistor level of a proposed structure in GaAs P-HEMT 0. 2 µm with integrated feedback capacitors is presented and demonstrates a tunable central frequency from 750 to 810 MHz.

40|$|Torque ripple minimisation is {{achieved}} by an adaptive feedforward control method to reduce cogging torque and current measurement errors. Experiments have been conducted to show that torque ripples are highly sensitive to changes in <b>current</b> <b>offset</b> and cogging torque. An easy way to adapt to cogging torque changes (due to temperature) is proposed and implemented after an initial estimation of the cogging torque is done. This initial estimation is necessary for manufacturing inaccuracies and ongoing adaptation is to cope with operating conditions changes. Higher harmonics of the cogging torque can also be compensated through this way. <b>Current</b> <b>offset</b> which contributes to {{a large proportion of}} the torque ripple is also compensated through an adaptive method.

40|$|Some {{electricity}} supply authorities in Australia allow PV inverters {{of up to}} 10 kW output to be directly connected to their grid network. The benefits of avoiding the use of power transformers in such PV applications are higher conversion efficiency of the PV system and lower costs.

40|$|Infrared {{focal plane}} arrays (IRFPA) imaging systems are {{strongly}} {{affected by the}} spatial non-uniformity of the IRFPA response. The non-uniformity {{is due to the}} pixel-to-pixel responsivity (gain) and dark <b>current</b> (<b>offset)</b> variations of the IRFPA. The nonuniformity results in a fixed spatial noise superimposed on the infrared image, which can completely mask the useful thermal signatures in an infrared scene. What makes this problem even more challenging is that spatial non-uniformity drifts temporally as a result of variations in the IRFPA working conditions. Such drift require a real-time compensation for IRFPA’s response in the course of imaging system operation]. Numerous nonuniformity correction (NUC) techniques have been developed. Traditional Reference-based calibration techniques rely on the known blackbody calibration-source. But they can’t suppress drift of IRFPA’s response effectively.

40|$|Introduction: Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial {{direct current}} stimulation (tDCS) are non-invasive techniques able to induce changes in corticospinal excitability. In this study, we combined rTMS and tDCS to understand possible interactions between the two techniques, and investigate whether they are polarity dependent. Materials and methods: Eleven healthy subjects participated in the study. Each patient underwent both anodal and cathodal conditioning tDCS in two separate sessions; brief 5 Hz-rTMS trains were delivered over the primary motor cortex at an intensity of 120 % the resting motor threshold (RMT) before tDCS (T 0), immediately after (T 1) and 10 min after <b>current</b> <b>offset</b> (T 2). We then analysed changes induced by cathodal and anodal tDCS on TMS variables. Results: Our results showed that in both anodal and cathodal sessions, the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude increased significantly in size before stimulation (T 0). Conversely, after anodal tDCS, the MEP facilitation measured at T 1 and T 2 was absent, whereas after cathodal tDCS it was preserved. Conclusions: Our findings provide new direct neurophysiological evidence that tDCS influences primary motor cortex excitability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
