5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to <b>correct</b> <b>mistakes</b> in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E
25|$|Experiments in knapping have {{demonstrated}} the relative ease with which a hand axe can be made, which could help explain their success. In addition, they demand relatively little maintenance and allow a choice of raw materials–any rock will suffice that supports a conchoidal fracture. It is easy to improvise their manufacture and <b>correct</b> <b>mistakes</b> without requiring detailed planning. No long or demanding apprenticeship is necessary to learn the necessary techniques. These factors combine to allow these objects to remain in use throughout pre-history. Their adaptability makes them effective {{in a variety of}} tasks, from heavy duty such as digging in soil, felling trees or breaking bones to delicate such as cutting ligaments, slicing meat or perforating a variety of materials.|$|E
500|$|After the {{previous}} week's upset loss to Stanford, the Trojans hosted the Arizona Wildcats, led by head coach Mike Stoops, aiming to <b>correct</b> <b>mistakes</b> and {{demonstrate that they}} were still in contention for the Pac-10 title and to remain an outside candidate for the national title game. [...] Matters were complicated when it was announced that starting quarterback John David Booty would not start due to a broken middle finger on his throwing hand, suffered during {{the previous}} week's loss. [...] As a result, redshirt sophomore Mark Sanchez made his first start for the Trojans; previously he had only played during garbage time. [...] The Trojans also remained without offensive linemen Chilo Rachal and Kris O'Dowd, as well as leading rusher Stafon Johnson, who remained idle for a secondweek after bruising his left foot during the game against Washington. [...] The Trojans entered the game a 21-point favorite.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1956, Wolters feared {{the effect that}} {{disclosure}} of the GBI's eviction of Jewish tenants might have on Speer. [...] Wolters wrote to Kempf concerning the denazification proceedings, [...] "I am only anxious about {{the matter of the}} clearance of Jew-flats in Berlin. [...] That could be a bullseye. [...] And this is the point to which the defense should direct itself..." [...] In 1964, Speer mentioned to Wolters in a letter that he would need the Chronik as a reference in revising his memoirs upon his release. [...] Wolter's response was to have Riesser retype the entire Chronik, leaving out any mention of the GBI's involvement in the persecution of the Jews, without telling Speer what he was doing. [...] Wolters later wrote that he did this to <b>correct</b> <b>mistakes,</b> to leave out extraneous matters, and [...] "above all to delete certain parts on the basis of which Speer and one or another of his colleagues could still have been prosecuted. [...] The Ludwigsburg Central office for 'war crimes' was still at work and an end of the persecution of National Socialists was not in sight." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Silent Way is a {{discovery}} learning approach, invented by Caleb Gattegno {{in the late}} 1950s.

40|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, the number of {{electronic}} documents has increased dramatically. With the growing availability of computers, {{more and more people}} are using text editors. However, the development of automated methods for <b>correcting</b> <b>mistakes</b> in text has not progressed as far. Text editors usually employ basic spell checking techniques and address very few mistakes of other types. In this thesis, we propose two methods for correcting errors in grammar and usage. First, we propose a novel approach to the problem of training classifiers to detect and correct errors in text by selectively introducing mistakes into the training data and show that this method is superior to the traditional method of training using clean data. Second, we define high-level features and propose a method of <b>correcting</b> <b>mistakes</b> using these features. We combine the two methods and build a system for <b>correcting</b> <b>mistakes</b> in article usage made by non-native speakers of English. ii Acknowledgments I would like to thank my adviser, Professor Dan Roth, for his invaluable help and support.

2500|$|Wikis are {{generally}} designed with {{the philosophy of}} {{making it easy to}} <b>correct</b> <b>mistakes,</b> rather than making it difficult to make them. Thus, while wikis are very open, they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. The most prominent, on almost every wiki, is the [...] "Recent Changes" [...] page—a specific list numbering recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame. Some wikis can filter the list to remove minor edits and edits made by automatic importing scripts ("bots"). From the change log, other functions are accessible in most wikis: the revision history shows previous page versions and the diff feature highlights the changes between two revisions. Using the revision history, an editor can view and restore a previous version of the article. The diff feature can be used {{to decide whether or not}} this is necessary. A regular wiki user can view the diff of an edit listed on the [...] "Recent Changes" [...] page and, if it is an unacceptable edit, consult the history, restoring a previous revision; this process is more or less streamlined, depending on the wiki software used.|$|E

40|$|Every news medium makes mistakes. No {{matter if}} {{the origin of the}} mistake is the {{information}} source or the journalist, a trustworthy medium always notifies of the <b>mistake</b> and <b>corrects</b> it. This thesis deals with these corrections on the example of the Czech News Agency to represent the news agencies. The theoretical grounds for the thesis are: to define the demands of news coverage, to present the specifics of the news coverage by news agencies, to offer relatively complex analysis of the work with the sources of journalistic information. The application section of the thesis analyses the corrections as published in the Czech News Agency's service during {{the first three months of}} the 2011 calendar year. These corrections are categorized by several keys: by the nature of the <b>corrected</b> <b>mistake,</b> by the affiliation of the <b>corrected</b> <b>mistake</b> to the specific agency service and by the priority of the <b>corrected</b> <b>mistake.</b> The results of the analysis serve a practical purpose to journalists because they show them which type of corrections is the most common for a specific kind of the news coverage. I assume that the majority of <b>mistakes</b> is <b>corrected</b> (or at least that none of the types of mistakes and none of the kinds of the news coverage is neglected more often than the others when <b>correcting</b> the <b>mistakes),</b> and [...] ...|$|R
