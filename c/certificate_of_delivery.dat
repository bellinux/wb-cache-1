40|$|Background: Occurring in {{primitive}} and contemporary societies, the motivations for newborn abandonment shortly after birth are varied and {{dependent upon the}} social norms of a specific geographic region at a given point in time. In Countries with no support systems, such practice lead to children deaths. In response, many states have passed safe-haven legislation to save unwanted newborns. The Italian legislation (l. 127 / 1997) guarantees to women the possibility to give birth in anonymity, without acknowledge their newborns. Mothers younger than 16, that {{are not allowed to}} acknowledge their child but have to wait until their 16 th birthday. Aim: Quantify the burden of child abandonment phenomenon within the hospitals of an Italian Region and to describe their characteristics, mostly for teen mothers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey has been performed on all mothers & newborns of Veneto Region (North-East of Italy: 4. 5 millions of inhs) during 2003 - 2004 period. Data sources were the <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Delivery</b> Care (CEDAP) flow and Hospital Discharge Records (HDR). All non-acknowledged babies and their families were analyzed. 2 logistic regression analysis have been performed to understand the influence of familial socio-demographic characteristics on newborn non-acknowledgement and the association between newborn acknowledgement and mother & child characteristics. Results: Among the 90, 876 deliveries occurred in the considered period, the abandoning mothers were 75, and nearly a 40 % were under the age of 16. The abandoning mother results more frequently younger than 25 or older than 35, Italian or from East Europe countries, having previous deliveries/conceptions. The non-acknowledged newborn is more frequently born at term from spontaneous delivery, healthy, rarely malformed. When the father is not acknowledging the newborn, the mother is more frequently younger than 25, a foreign or a clandestine, unmarried, unemployed and with a low education level. In these cases, newborns are all healthy. In the group of teen mothers, the father acknowledged the child in 79 % of cases. In this subgroup, all the mothers were unmarried, Italian (53 %), and unemployed, and all the fathers were Italian, age range 15 - 50 (52 % over 20). The logistic regression analysis (outcome: abandonment) found the following risk factors are: age at delivery younger than 25, being foreign/clandestine, having previous live-born. The most relevant protective factor is represented by marriage. Conclusions: Continued multidisciplinary policies and lay public awareness are needed to serve as catalysts to build support for unwanted newborns and their safe assimilation into the community. The scenario of teen mothers characteristics raises several burning questions to be answered and explored: how to exclude sexual abuse? How to guarantee child protection for both “child mother & newborn”? how to prevent child trafficking and illegal adoption? Is the law really protective...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Preterm birth, {{defined as}} {{the birth of a}} baby of less than 37 weeks gestational age, has a number of {{consequences}} at social, ethical, economic and health care level. These consequences affect both hospital health care programs, local programs and prevention plans. The rapid and remarkable innovation of assistance methods and of equipment in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has allowed a gradual increase of survival rates of extremely low weight and low gestational age premature infants. Several studies have demonstrated that premature and extremely premature infants show severe short, medium and long-term clinical outcomes, in particular neurological and neurosensorial outcomes. However, long-term follow-ups of infants cohorts selected by area-based surveillance are not available. AIM The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the clinical outcomes of preterm infants in the Veneto Region by means of a follow-up assessment of short, medium and long-term health outcomes according to gestational age, in particular for extremely low weight and extremely low gestational age premature infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study has been divided into different phases. In the first preliminary phase a stratification sampling of population has been carried out on the basis of the gestational age of all infants born in the Veneto Region from 2003 to 2009. For this phase the current flow of the <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Delivery</b> Care (CEDAP) has been used. This flow has been mandatory since 2001 and records all newborns of the Region, it contains information on the infant (gender, weight, length, head circumference, gestational age, major resuscitation care in case of assisted intubation and ventilation and medical cardiac resuscitation, minor resuscitation care in case of aspiration and cardiac massage, infant’s admission in neonatal intensive care unit, possible malformations and possible cause of infant mortality), on the delivery (single or multiple, natural or cesarean, possible type of pain relief and type of anesthetic, maternal complications), on pregnancy (number of tests and ultrasound scans, prenatal diagnosis, course of pregnancy: physiological or pathological, threatened abortion, threatened preterm labour, infectious diseases, infections of the genitourinary tract, diabetes and gestosis) and on the mother and the father (age, education, job, marital status, exposure to risk factors such as smoke). Stratification sampling has been carried out according to the gestational week (GW) from 20 GW to 42 GW. In particular, all newborns ≤ 28 gestational weeks in the above mentioned period have been considered. Patients cohorts have thus been arranged and the cohorts of infants born in 2005 and from 2007 to 2009 have been studied. In the next phase, starting from current statistics, patients’ natural history has been reconstructed, when possible, by means of death certificates (ISTAT) in order to assess survival, hospital discharge records for recoveries, intercurrent acute pathologies and chronic pathologies, information flow on the rehabilitation activity ex art. 26 L 833 / 1978 of the Veneto Region in order to assess the admission to rehabilitative services and the flow Rare Diseases Registry. In particular, the “chronic” patients have been identified, defined as subjects with at least 2 hospitalizations within 12 months, both characterized by the same pathology code of hospital discharge records. Eventually the results have been analysed: mortality, survival rate, patients affected by chronic pathologies, patients affected by rare diseases and patients who have undergone rehabilitation cycles. The patients not included in the categories described above will be sampled and assessed in follow-up after this study according to the following protocol: qualitative assessment of spontaneous motor function, qualitative assessment by means of classification systems (ABC, Gross Motor Function Measure, and, for the most severe cases, Besta scale and QUEST scale), cognitive assessment (Griffiths, WIPPSI, WISC-IV), neurosensorial assessment by means of the analysis of the Multimodal Evoked Potentials (PEV, BAEPs, SEP), assessment of neuroimaging (standard protocol and 3 D brain NMRI with DTI and resting state for tractographic assessment). RESULTS During the analysed period from 2003 to 2009 in the Veneto Region 322. 598 neonates have been recorded, approximately 46. 000 neonates/year. 91, 71...|$|E
