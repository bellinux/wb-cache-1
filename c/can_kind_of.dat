500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you <b>can</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{believed}} that compared to previous albums, Breakout was [...] "grown-up" [...] and [...] "just {{a little more}} creative." [...] Cyrus aimed to incorporate a sound influenced by rock music, saying [...] "the writing is definitely different...the lyrics mean more than my last couple of records". According to Cyrus, the album documented, in depth, the events that occurred in her life in a year span. Most of the songs were written as Cyrus traveled on the Best of Both Worlds Tour from October 2007 to January 2008. Recording commenced immediately after the tour came to an end, and seized in March 2008, for Cyrus was to film [...] (2009) in Tennessee soon after. She expressed that, through each song, a listener could discover something about her and about themselves. Of connecting with her fans through Breakout, she claimed she wanted [...] "girls to feel {{to be able to}} feel empowered and just feel like they <b>can</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> rock out", going on to say that, [...] "listening to this music, I hope they can feel like a reason to dance and just smile and to have fun. This CD is totally age appropriate, specially for me".|$|E

500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl <b>can</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E
500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you <b>can</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny. And when I write Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, and was shot in West Hollywood at [...] "The London". It premiered on MTV on January 28, 2010. French fashion model Noemie Lenoir portrays Usher's love interest. Like the album version of the song, the music video does not feature Plies or his verse. In the video, Usher struggles {{to get home to}} his wife, however due to several obligations and his partying, he cannot make it. Previous shots are given of Usher and Lenoir in a brown backdrop, and assumed previous situations of their love life and Usher coming home. Scenes are seen with Usher in a boardroom setting, and then teaching dance to a group of women in a studio, then in a club. Several instances in the video are unknown as in the scene in which Usher takes a phone call, unknown to the viewer for [...] "business or pleasure," [...] as explained by James Montgomery of MTV News. In describing the video, he went on to say, [...] "...you <b>can</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> see why it'd be about both. Such is the life he's chosen, and now he must deal with the repercussions." [...] In following scenes the threat of infidelity is seen even clearer as Usher gets close to the [...] "over-friendly dancers" [...] and [...] "sipping — and spitting — champagne in a place that looks very much like a strip club." ...|$|E

500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you <b>can</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after signing}} a record deal with Lava Records, {{aspiring}} English singer Jessie J commenced {{to work on}} her debut album. She collaborated with songwriters and producers Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly in her first writing session, where [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] was conceived {{with the intention of}} being performed by Jessie J. However, she decided not to record the song, believing it was not edgy enough for her to perform. She explained, [...] "And I remember thinking this song is amazing, but I don't know if it's me 110 percent, you know. You <b>can</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> feel it." [...] The song reached Cyrus while she was creating an EP with Dr. Luke. The writing team then reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for Cyrus' joint clothing line with Max Azria, exclusively sold in Wal-Mart stores. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly and Jessie J fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. [...] "They feel they're buying into a great experience but also buying into the artist," [...] Kelly said of the song's fans. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he desired to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It's the same song from a different point of view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] To record the song's instrumentation, they decided to mingle computerized sound with [...] "the warmth of live instrumentation", using live electric guitars and drums. Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to a need of tracks for The Time of Our Lives. This is the first of two collaborations between Dr. Luke and Cyrus. Dr. Luke would later co-produce Cyrus' 2013 smash hit single [...] "Wrecking Ball".|$|E
500|$|Samus' reveal in the {{original}} Metroid, which UGO.com called {{the original}} [...] "jaw-dropping moment" [...] in gaming, was named as the greatest twist in video games by Game Informer in 2007 and as the greatest moment in Nintendo's history by GameDaily in 2008. The Irish Times found it refreshing {{to learn that the}} series' protagonist, who is [...] "well disguised under the suit of heavy armour", is female, but Rupert Goodwins of The Independent wrote that the [...] "Transformer-like suit she wears could just as easily contain a large centipede; it's hardly a breakthrough for feminism." [...] According to the 2007 book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century: Literate Connections, Samus was perhaps the most nonsexualized female video game character ever, a belief shared by Steve Rabin in Introduction to Game Development, which also considered Samus as one of Nintendo's most popular video game mascots. In 2002, Justin Hoeger of The Sacramento Bee opined that [...] "unlike most other female video game characters, Samus isn't some husky-voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal. Samus is tough, silent, heavily armed and spends most of her time in a bulky suit of high-tech Power Armor." [...] That same year, however, an article in the Toronto Star retorted that the [...] "sexual politics" [...] surrounding Samus and the Metroid series needed to stop, arguing that the original [...] "big crazy shock to the gaming public" [...] was [...] "some seriously misspent energy" [...] as she [...] "is not a woman {{for the benefit of the}} sweaty/excited crowd, and neither is she a standard-bearer nor a courageous leader in the struggle for video game civil rights. She is a supremely talented action figure, and in the closeups on her helmet you <b>can</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> see that she wears mascara, but that is all." [...] UGO.com included Samus' one-piece bathing swimsuit on the list of the best alternate costumes and IGN chose [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] by Aerosmith as Samus' theme song because she [...] "spends her time running around in a manly battle suit blasting first and taking names later." [...] Featuring her in their 2004 list of [...] "top ten forces of good" [...] (one section on their list of top 50 [...] "retro" [...] game characters), Retro Gamer opined she has remained [...] "a distinct female character, not relying on cheap thrills to capture the attention of gamers, which is more than can be said for some." ...|$|E
