5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication.</b> In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
25|$|Mcm10 is {{essential}} for <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication</b> and interacts with the minichromosome maintenance 2-7 helicase that is loaded in an inactive form at origins of DNA replication. Mcm10 chaperones the catalytic DNA polymerase α and helps stabilize the polymerase.|$|E
25|$|For DNA polymerases to function, the {{double-stranded}} DNA helix {{has to be}} unwound {{to expose}} two single-stranded DNA templates for replication. DNA helicases are responsible for unwinding the double-stranded DNA during <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication.</b> Helicases in eukaryotic cells are remarkably complex. The catalytic core of the helicase is composed of six minichromosome maintenance (Mcm2-7) proteins, forming a hexameric ring. Away from DNA, the Mcm2-7 proteins form a single heterohexamer and are loaded in an inactive form at origins of DNA replication as a head-to-head double hexamers around double-stranded DNA. The Mcm proteins are recruited to replication origins then redistributed throughout the genomic DNA during S phase, indicative of their localization to the replication fork.|$|E
40|$|During latency, the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} genome {{is maintained}} as a circular episome, replicating in synchrony with host <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>Replication</b> requires the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and an origin of latent DNA replication {{located in the}} viral terminal repeats, consisting of two LANA binding sites (LBSs) and a GC-rich sequence. Here, we show that the recruitment of a LANA dimer to high-affinity site LBS- 1 bends DNA by 57 ° and towards the major groove. The cooccupancy of LBS- 1 and lower-affinity LBS- 2 induces a symmetrical bend of 110 °. By changing the origin architecture, LANA may help to assemble a specific nucleoprotein structure important for the initiation of DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequence}} in which various {{regions of the}} chromosomes of human blood cells complete DNA synthesis in vitro has been studied {{through the use of}} H 3 -thymidine labeling and autoradiography. Certain of its aspects have been defined, and these may serve as a basis for comparing the pattern of synthesis in cells of other tissues. In general, the long <b>chromosomes</b> continue <b>replication</b> later than the short ones. Variability of the sequence has been prominent. One pair from Group 13 - 15 and pair No. 17 complete replication early. In certain other <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>replication</b> is very active late in the S period, e. g. one X of the female cell, the Y of the male cell, two of Group 4 - 5, two of Group 13 - 15, the Nos. 16, and the Nos. 18. In the normal human female a striking correlation exists between the late replication of one of the X chromosomes, condensation during the intermitotic period, and presumed genetical inactivation. The pattern of <b>replication</b> characterizes certain <b>chromosomes</b> whose structural features alone are non-distinctive, and it may be useful in studies of cells in which a chromosomal aberration occurs.

2500|$|Logarithmically growing {{bacteria}} {{differ from}} stationary phase bacteria {{with respect to}} the number of genome copies present in the cell, and this has implications for the capability to carry out an important DNA repair process. [...] During logarithmic growth, two or more copies of any particular region of the chromosome may be present in a bacterial cell, as cell division is not precisely matched with <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication.</b> [...] The process of homologous recombinational repair (HRR) is a key DNA repair process that is especially effective for repairing double-strand damages, such as double-strand breaks. [...] This process depends on a second homologous chromosome in addition to the damaged chromosome. [...] During logarithmic growth, a DNA damage in one chromosome may be repaired by HRR using sequence information from the other homologous chromosome. [...] Once cells approach stationary phase, however, they typically have just one copy of the chromosome, and HRR requires input of homologous template from outside the cell by transformation.|$|E
5000|$|An {{essential}} {{feature of}} the Caulobacter cell cycle is that the chromosome is replicated once and only once per cell cycle. This {{is in contrast to}} the E. coli cell cycle where there can be overlapping rounds of <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication</b> simultaneously underway. The opposing roles of the Caulobacter DnaA and CtrA proteins are essential to the tight control of Caulobacter <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication.</b> [...] The DnaA protein acts at the origin of replication to initiate the replication of the chromosome. The CtrA protein, in contrast, acts to block initiation of replication, so it must be removed from the cell before <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication</b> can begin. Multiple additional regulatory pathways integral to cell cycle regulation and involving both phospho signaling pathways and regulated control of protein proteolysis [...] act to assure that DnaA and CtrA are present in the cell just exactly when needed.|$|E

50|$|Although {{methylation}} of lysine residues {{occurs on}} many different histones, the most characteristic of Xi occurs {{on the ninth}} lysine of the third histone (H3K9). While a single methylation of this region allows for the genes bound to remain transcriptionally active, in heterochromatin this lysine residue is often methylated twice or three times, H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 respectively, {{to ensure that the}} DNA bound is inactive. More recent research has shown that H3K27me3 and H4K20me1 are also common in early embryos. Other methylation markings associated with transcriptionally active areas of DNA, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, are missing from the Xi chromosome along with many acetylation markings. Although it was known that certain Xi histone methylation markings stayed relatively constant between species, it has recently been discovered that different organisms and even different cells within a single organism can have different markings for their X inactivation. Through histone methylation, there is genetic imprinting, so that the same X homolog stays inactivated through <b>chromosome</b> <b>replications</b> and cell divisions.|$|R

50|$|Eukaryotes {{initiate}} DNA replication {{at multiple}} {{points in the}} <b>chromosome,</b> so <b>replication</b> forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome; these are not known to be regulated in any particular way. Because eukaryotes have linear <b>chromosomes,</b> DNA <b>replication</b> is unable to reach {{the very end of}} the chromosomes, but ends at the telomere region of repetitive DNA close to the ends. This shortens the telomere of the daughter DNA strand. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in somatic cells. As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. (This is known as the Hayflick limit.) Within the germ cell line, which passes DNA to the next generation, telomerase extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to cancer formation. Increased telomerase activity is one of the hallmarks of cancer.|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes, {{duplication}} of genomic information {{depends on the}} sequential activation of multiple replication origins distributed along the <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>Replication</b> origins differ in initiation time, chromatin structure and three-dimensional position in the nucleus. Recently, we have performed a systematic analysis {{of the role of}} histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the regulation of origin activity in budding yeast. We have found that the epigenetic regulation of repetitive sequences is a key determinant of the DNA replication program. Indeed, our study revealed that two histone deacetylases, Rpd 3 and Sir 2, have opposite effects on the replication timing program. Rpd 3 delays initiation at late origins, whereas Sir 2 promotes efficient activation of early origins. Remarkably, we also found that Rpd 3 and Sir 2 regulate initiation at ~ 200 replication origins located within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array. We propose that this epigenetic regulation of repetitive origins controls the replication timing program by modulating the availability of limiting initiation factors...|$|R

5000|$|Bacterial <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication</b> is best {{understood}} in the well-studied bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>replication</b> proceeds in three major stages: initiation, elongation and termination. The initiation stage starts with the ordered assembly of [...] "initiator" [...] proteins at the origin region of the chromosome, called oriC. These assembly stages are regulated to ensure that <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication</b> occurs only once in each cell cycle. During the elongation phase of replication, the enzymes that were assembled at oriC during initiation proceed along each arm ("replichore") of the chromosome, in opposite directions away from the oriC, replicating the DNA to create two identical copies. This process is known as bidirectional replication. The entire assembly of molecules involved in DNA replication on each arm is called a [...] "replisome." [...] At {{the forefront of the}} replisome is a DNA helicase that unwinds the two strands of DNA, creating a moving [...] "replication fork". The two unwound single strands of DNA serve as templates for DNA polymerase, which moves with the helicase (together with other proteins) to synthesise a complementary copy of each strand. In this way, two identical copies of the original DNA are created. Eventually, the two replication forks moving around the circular chromosome meet in a specific zone of the chromosome, approximately opposite oriC, called the terminus region. The elongation enzymes then disassemble, and the two [...] "daughter" [...] chromosomes are resolved before cell division is completed.|$|E
50|$|B. subtilis {{is a model}} {{organism}} used {{to study}} bacterial <b>chromosome</b> <b>replication.</b> Replication of the single circular chromosome initiates at a single locus, the origin (oriC). Replication proceeds bidirectionally and two replication forks progress in clockwise and counterclockwise directions along the chromosome. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>replication</b> is completed when the forks reach the terminus region, which is positioned opposite to the origin on the chromosome map. The terminus region contains several short DNA sequences (Ter sites) that promote replication arrest. Specific proteins mediate all the steps in DNA replication. Comparison between the proteins involved in chromosomal DNA replication in B. subtilis and in Escherichia coli reveals similarities and differences. Although the basic components promoting initiation, elongation, and termination of replication are well-conserved, some important differences can be found (such as one bacterium missing proteins essential in the other). These differences underline the diversity in the mechanisms and strategies that various bacterial species have adopted {{to carry out the}} duplication of their genomes.|$|E

40|$|Telomeres are {{nucleoprotein}} complexes {{that protect}} {{the ends of}} eukaryotic <b>chromosomes.</b> During DNA <b>replication,</b> <b>chromosomes</b> cannot be completely copied, causing telomeres to shorten over time.

40|$|In E. coli, 10 to 15 % {{of growing}} {{bacteria}} produce dimeric <b>chromosomes</b> during DNA <b>replication.</b> These dimers are resolved by XerC and XerD, two tyrosine recombinases that target the 28 -nucleotide motif (dif) {{associated with the}} <b>chromosome’s</b> <b>replication</b> terminus. In streptococci and lactococci, an alternative system is composed of a unique, Xer-like recombinase (XerS) genetically linked to a dif-like motif (difSL) located at the replication terminus. Preliminary observations {{have suggested that the}} dif/Xer system is commonly found in bacteria with circular chromosomes but that assumption has not been confirmed in an exhaustive analysis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to extensively characterize the dif/Xer system in the proteobacteria, since this taxon accounts for the majority of genomes sequenced to date. To that end, we analyzed 234 chromosomes from 156 proteobacterial species and showed that most species (87. 8 %) harbor XerC and XerD-like recombinases and a dif-related sequence which (i) is located in non-coding sequences, (ii) is close to the replication terminus (as defined by the cumulative GC skew) (iii) has a palindromic structure, (iv) is encoded by a low G+C content and (v) contains a highly conserved XerD binding site. However, not all proteobacteria display this dif/XerCD system. Indeed, a sub-group of pathogenic e-proteobacteria (including Helicobacter sp and Campylobacter sp) harbors a different recombination system, composed of a single recombinase (XerH) which is phylogenetically distinct from the other Xer recombinases and a motif (difH) sharing homologies with difSL. Furthermore, no homologs to dif or Xer recombinases coul...|$|R
