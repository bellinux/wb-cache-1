5000|$|On 7 March 2012, a Fisker Karma {{purchased}} for US$107,850 by Consumer Reports magazine {{was taken out}} for a test drive at the 327 acre CR test track facility in Connecticut. The Karma had fewer than 200 mi on its odometer. While performing a routine speedometer <b>calibration</b> <b>check</b> prior to actual road testing, the car broke down {{and could not be}} restarted. [...] "We buy about 80 cars a year {{and this is the first}} time in memory that we have had a car that is undriveable before it has finished our check-in process."The fault was traced to a defective battery caused by a misaligned welding robot at the A123 factory. The battery was replaced in a week. A123 is replacing affected batteries in the Karma and four other customers to a cost of $55 million. Warranty for the Karma will be extended to 60 months and 60,000 miles in North America.|$|E

30|$|The Biodex system II {{dynamometer}} (Biodex medical, New York, N.Y., USA) {{was used}} to assess quadriceps endurance. A <b>calibration</b> <b>check</b> was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s specification. Participants were positioned with their upper body strapped firmly against the back rest of the chair, with the hips and knees at 90 ° and straps tightened across their chest, hips and thighs. Quadriceps endurance test consisted of 12 maximal isometric knee extensions of the dominant leg. Contractions were held for 3  seconds, with a 5  second rest period between each repetition. A traffic light system on the computer screen and standardised verbal commands from the researcher ensured participants were contracting at the appropriate times. Endurance was assessed using the percentage fatigue index value, calculated by the 1 st peak torque (PT) minus the last (12 th) PT, divided by the 1 st PT multiplied by 100. In addition, the percentage change of torque (mean of last three repetitions/mean of first three repetitions) was computed (Nicolay and Walker 2005).|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} third-generation gravitational-wave {{detectors}} requires dedicated sensors to perform very accurate {{measurements of the}} residual motion of mechanical components cooled down at cryogenic temperatures and accommodated close to the test masses. For this reason, we developed a vertical accelerometer prototype derived by the classical scheme widely used in Virgo seismic suspension control.

40|$|The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) {{conducted}} a reflection seismic/ground-penetrating radar survey for the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) along segments of proposed interstate route Alternate “E”, near Joplin, Missouri across ground previously mined for lead/zinc. A total of 14, 600 lineal meters of shallow reflection seismic data, nine down-hole seismic <b>calibration</b> <b>check</b> shots, and 15, 000 lineal meters of {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR) data were acquired. The seismic data were acquired to map Mississippian bedrock, locate and identify paleosinkholes and abandoned mine features, and determine structural geologic trends in the study area. The GPR data were acquired to identify and locate abandoned mine access and ventilation shafts in areas that were overlain by surficial milled ore rock (chat). Pre-construction knowledge of these anthropogenic and natural features will assist in route selection and geotechnical site mitigation, and minimize both the potential for contractor variable site condition claims {{and the potential for}} long-term subsidence-related problems.

40|$|Abstract—Phosphor persistence, video bandwidth, DC {{restoration}} and high-voltage regulation affect {{the appearance of}} images presented on cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), potentially resulting in differences between nominal and actual stimuli. We illustrate these effects by measuring physical parameters of horizontal and vertical static and counter-phase � ickering gratings, and we illustrate problems for vision research by measuring contrast sensitivity to these gratings. We also measured {{the extent to which}} calibration protocols actually result in the monitor being calibrated over its entire area regardless of image size. The results of our physical measurements indicate substantial differences between gratings that nominally differ only as to orientation. Consistent with these differences, our psychophysical measurements indicate different sensitivities when the bars of the gratings are parallel or orthogonal to raster lines, regardless of the retinal orientation of the gratings. The results of our <b>calibration</b> <b>check</b> show that only a small region around the target area of calibration can be regarded as effectively linearized, and only if the size of the test image used during the check is similar {{to the size of the}} calibration patch. Overall, our results indicate potentially severe problems with the use of CRTs in vision research, and we discuss some published results that are likely to have been affected by these problems. 1...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} calibration {{errors of}} Goldmann applanation tonometers in ophthalmic clinics of Brasília, Brazil, and correlate the findings with {{variables related to}} tonometers model and utilization. METHODS: Tonometers from ophthalmic clinics in Brasília, Brazil, were checked for calibration errors. A standard Goldmann applanation tonometer checking tool was used to asses the calibration error. Only one trained individual made all verifications, with a masked reading of the results. Data on the model, age, daily use, frequency of calibration checking {{and the nature of}} the ophthalmic department - private or public - were collected and correlated with the observed errors. RESULTS: One hundred tonometers were checked for calibration. Forty seven percent (47 / 100) were out of 1 mmHg range at least at one point checking. Tonometers mounted to slit lamp, with less than 5 years, used in less than 20 patients daily, that had a <b>calibration</b> <b>check</b> on a yearly basis, and those from private office exhibit a lower rate of inaccuracy, but only the first variable was statistically significant. Sixty one percent of tonometers on public hospitals were out of calibration.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{computational}} framework (LEO), that {{enables us to}} carry out the very first large-scale, high-resolution computations {{in the context of the}} characteristic approach in numerical relativity. At the analytic level, our approach is based on a new implementation of the ``eth'' formalism, using a non-standard representation of the spin-raising and lowering angular operators in terms of non-conformal coordinates on the sphere; we couple this formalism to a partially first-order reduction (in the angular variables) of the Einstein equations. The numerical implementation of our approach supplies the basic building blocks for a highly parallel, easily extensible numerical code. We demonstrate the adaptability and excellent scaling of our numerical code by solving, within our numerical framework, for a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity (the Einstein-Klein-Gordon problem) in 3 -dimensions. The nonlinear code is globally second-order convergent, and has been extensively tested using as reference a calibrated code with the same boundary-initial data and radial marching algorithm. In this context, we show how accurately we can follow quasi-normal mode ringing. In the linear regime, we show energy conservation for a number of initial data sets with varying angular structure. A striking result that arises in this context is the saturation of the flow of energy through the Schwarzschild radius. As a final <b>calibration</b> <b>check</b> we perform a large simulation with resolution never achieved before. Comment: RevTeX 4, 22 pages, 21 figures, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata on the {{intracellular}} pH value of human gastric cancer SGC 7901 cells. Methods: After coculturing SGC 7901 cells with ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata (1, 0. 5, 0. 25 and 0. 125 mg/mL), cell viability was evaluated by chromatometry with 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining. Intracellular pH value of SGC 7901 cells was measured in the monolayer by using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe 2, 7 -bis-(2 -carboxyethyl) - 5 -carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester. The extracellular pH value of culture medium was measured by a pH 211 <b>Calibration</b> <b>Check</b> Microprocessor pH Meter. Half-inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of ethanol extract culture to SGC 7901 cells was decided by the MTT method and expressions of vacuolar-H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE 1) mRNAs were examined by the method of fluorescence quantitative-polymerase chain reaction after 72 h of drug treatment. Results: Ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata at different concentrations significantly inhibited the proliferation of SGC 7901 cells, lowered the intracellular pH values and heightened the extracellular pH values. The IC 50 of 72 h culture was 0. 5 mg/mL and it inhibited the expressions of V-ATPase and NHE 1 mRNAs.

40|$|Objective and background: Spirometry is {{recommended}} for the diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory diseases in the community. Spirometer accuracy is critical, but few general practitioners meet the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) recommendation for daily calibration. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the accuracy and stability of a portable ultrasonic spirometer (EasyOne) that the manufacturer claims does not require regular calibration. Methods: Six EasyOne spirometers were used in a practice-based spirometry study. Inspiratory and expiratory accuracy was checked periodically using a certified 3 -L syringe. Paired <b>calibration</b> <b>checks</b> were performed using a dedicated mouthpiece assembly (spirette) and randomly selected spirettes. Results: The six spirometers were used for up to 26 weeks (mean 23. 9 weeks) and a total of 1041 spirometry tests and 75 syringe calibrations were performed. All inspiratory and expiratory <b>calibration</b> <b>checks</b> using a dedicated or randomly selected spirette met the ATS/ERS accuracy criterion (3. 00 +/- 0. 105 L). The mean (range) expiratory volume deviation from target volume (3. 00 L) was 0. 011 L (- 0. 06 - 0. 09 L) using a dedicated spirette and 0. 046 L (- 0. 09 - 0. 10 L) using randomly selected spirettes. The deviation from target was not affected by the mean flow generated during the calibration procedure. There was no change in calibration during the study. Conclusions: This study supports the manufacturer's claim that the EasyOne spirometer maintains its calibration during routine clinical use in general practice and does not require daily calibration as specified in international spirometry guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Liquid lead-lithium (Pb- 16 Li) is {{of primary}} {{interest}} {{as one of}} the candidate materials for tritium breeder, neutron multiplier and coolant fluid in liquid metal blanket concepts relevant to fusion power plants. For an effective and reliable operation of such high temperature liquid metal systems, monitoring and control of critical process parameters is essential. However, limited operational experience coupled with high temperature operating conditions and corrosive nature of Pb- 16 Li severely limits application of commercially available diagnostic tools. This paper illustrates indigenous calibration test facility designs and experimental methods used to develop non-contact configuration level diagnostics using pulse radar level sensor, wetted configuration pressure diagnostics using diaphragm seal type pressure sensor and bulk temperature diagnostics with temperature profiling for high temperature, high pressure liquid Pb and Pb- 16 Li applications. <b>Calibration</b> <b>check</b> of these sensors was performed using analytical methods, at temperature between 380 C- 400 C and pressure upto 1 MPa (g).

40|$|Low-cost sensor {{technology}} can potentially revolutionise {{the area of}} air pollution monitoring by providing high-density spatiotemporal pollution data. Such data can be utilised for supplementing traditional pollution monitoring, improving exposure estimates, and raising community awareness about air pollution. However, data quality remains a major concern that hinders the widespread adoption of low-cost {{sensor technology}}. Unreliable data may mislead unsuspecting users and potentially lead to alarming consequences such as reporting acceptable air pollutant levels when they are above the limits deemed safe for human health.
