A Bohlin controlled‐stress rheometer with a rapid heating attachment was used. Because of potential slippage and sensitivity problems with cells and cell‐wall material, different geometries (parallel <b>plate,</b> <b>cone</b> and <b>plate,</b> and concentric cylinder) were assessed. Initial experiments were designed to determine the linear viscoelastic regions for the cell and cell‐wall materials at 25 °C. Samples were subjected to varying shear stresses and oscillatory frequencies. For carrot cells, linearity was observed with <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry and with concentric cylinder geometry over a fairly wide range of stresses and frequencies. Parallel plate geometry did not give linear results. Carrot cell‐wall material behaved in a linear fashion with all three geometries over similar stress and frequency ranges as carrot cells. Using the appropriate conditions of geometry, frequency and stress, the influence of heat treatments on cell and cell‐wall rheology was compared. A comparison of <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> and concentric cylinder geometry was performed using cells and cell‐wall material heated from 25 to 90 °C. <b>Cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry showed greater changes in rheological properties during heating than concentric cylinder geometry and also allowed a greater range of heating rates. <b>Cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry was used in further studies.

The hematocrit-to-blood viscosity ratio (HVR), i. e. an index of red blood cell (RBC) oxygen transport effectiveness, was calculated.

Despite these hemorheological abnormalities, CC never had hospitalized painful vaso-occlusive crisis or acute chest syndrome. In contrast, all of them had splenomegaly. Of note, 2 out of 7 CC developed retinopathy or otologic disorders. Whether the blood hyperviscosity and decreased RBC deformability are responsible for these complications is unknown.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Disturbance {{effect on}} {{time-dependent}} yield stress measurement of bentonite suspension was investigated using vane and <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry. With <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry, the disturbance occurs {{as a result}} of the large strains the suspensions are subjected to when placed on the lower plate and when the cone is lowered to the testing position before the actual shear stress is applied. As an alternative, vane ge-ometry has been used to measure yield stress in bentonite suspension to (1) minimize the placing disturbance, and (2) eliminate the loading disturb-ance. Even though a minimal amount of disturbance was still induced by vane geometry, it was assumed that the amount of disturbance was small enough to be ignored compared to that with <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry. Yield stresses of bentonite suspensions at different weight fractions and vari-ous resting times were determined from stress ramp tests. Linear relationships were developed between yield stresses measured with the different geometries. Disturbance rapidly increased up to approximately 50 % with resting times, then converged at long resting times (60 % at 10 days). This indicates that <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry significantly underestimated the actual yield stress of the tested material because of disturbance. Based on the quantified disturbance, a method to predict the undisturbed yield stress from disturbed one was proposed. The observations were interpreted with structural kinetics...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) enhance vascular density in ischemic tissues, suggesting that they can differentiate into vascular cells or release angiogenic factors that may stimulate neoangiogenesis. Moreover, {{there is evidence that}} shear stress (SS) may activate proliferation and differentiation of embryonic and endothelial precursor stem cells into endothelial cells (ECs). In this work, we investigated the effect of laminar SS in promoting differentiation of hASCs into ECs. SS (10 dyn/cm(2) up to 96 h), produced by a <b>cone</b> <b>plate</b> system, failed to induce EC markers (CD 31, vWF, Flk- 1) on hASC assayed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry.

To characterize the effect of decomposition, {{the second set of}} samples was incubated at 16 C for 2 weeks at – 30 kPa matric potential. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the exudates found that barley had the largest organic acid content and chia the largest content of sugars (polysaccharide-derived or free), and maize was in between barley and chia. Yield stress of amended soil samples was measured by an oscillatory strain sweep test with a <b>cone</b> <b>plate</b> rheometer. When microbial decomposition was suppressed at 4 oC, yield stress increased 20 -fold for chia seed exudate and two-fold for maize root exudate compared to the control, whereas for barley root exudate it decreased to half.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Food Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2004 Probiotic {{foods are}} {{intended}} to supply selected viable microorganisms, for example Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium, to consumers. These organisms, when consumed at the daily intake of 108, provide benefits beyond basic nutrition. Probiotic (AB) foods generally include fermented dairy products such as yoghurts and cheeses, targeted at the upmarket consumer. However, due to technical {{problems associated with the}} foods and the organism, viable Bifidobacterium rarely occur in AB foods. The principle aims of this study were to develop a suitable delivery system for Bifidobacterium to the consumer, and to supply these living organisms in the affordable traditional fermented African beverages, amasi and mahewu. This would provide the benefits of probiotics to the rural African consumer, where malnutrition and gastrointestinal diseases occur. The organism selected for this study was Bifidobacterium lactis DSM 10140, commonly associated with AB starter cultures for yoghurts. The delivery system selected was microencapsulation of B. lactis using a mixture of the generally recognised as safe (GRAS) edible gums, gellan and xanthan. Supply vehicles for the microcapsules to the consumer were amasi and mahewu. Prior to microencapsulation, rheological studies were undertaken to determine whether the gellan-xanthan gum mix would provide a suitable support matrix for microencapsulated B. lactis. This was done using a Paar Physica MGR 300 rotational rheometer with a <b>cone</b> <b>plate</b> 50 - 2 measuring system. Results indicated that the hydrated gellan-xanthan gum mix behaved as a non-Newtonian material, and the flow curve fitted well to the Herschel-Bulkley model. This demonstrated that the gel was a relatively viscous material with solid properties. The average yield stress of the gel was 1. 515 Pa, indicating that the gel was stable, and at lower stresses would behave as a solid. The gel mix would be disrupted by shear stresses associated with mastication and peristalsis. The minimum viscosity of the gel was constant at temperatures between 46 °C - 61 °C. It was concluded from these data that the gel was suitable for microencapsulation and that microcapsules should only be included in soft foods, which do not require chewing. Temperatures associated with microencapsulation, at minimum gel viscosities, were not lethal to B. lactis. Bifidobacterium lactis cells were incubated under anaerobic conditions (4 % H 2, 10 % CO 2, and 86 % N 2) at 37 °C overnight in 250 ml Tryptone-Yeast-Glucose (TYG) broth, and grown to an 00600 0. 9 - 1. 1. Cells were harvested and washed for microencapsulation using centrifugation. Microencapsulation of the organism was done using a mono-axial extrusion technique together with a superposed airflow, by manually extruding the aqueous gum I cell mix through a 27. 5 G bevelled needle, fitted on to a 10 ml syringe. The resultant microdroplets were hardened by free fall into 0. 1 M CaCI 2 solution. Microcapsules were separated from the CaCI 2 solution by filtration through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. All procedures were carried out in a laminar flow hood. Results indicated that the method of microencapsulation used in this study was successful. Using a concentrated inoculum of B. lactis, high numbers (lOglO 11 - 12 etu. g- 1) of bacteria were incorporated into the microcapsules. Therefore the daily intake would be provided by 0. 1 g microcapsules. The diameter and size distribution of microcapsules were determined by laser diffractometry. This showed a maximum microcapsule diameter of 2. 22 mm with 50 % (w/v) of the microcapsules having a diameter of 0. 05) at either temperature after 21 days. Hence this form of storage could be used to deliver viable immobilised B. lactis to the food industry. In order to assess the survival of immobilised B. lactis in the GIT, the microcapsules were incubated at 37 °C over a period of 240 min in simulated gastric juice (SGJ) (pH 1. 5). Viable counts were performed by sampling at regular intervals. A similar study was done in simulated bile and pancreatic juices (BPJ) (pH 6. 5). In SGJ, it was demonstrated that there was a significant reduction (3 log cycles) (p 0. 05) was noted for surviving fractions of both immobilised and free B. lactis. Commercial pasteurised amasi (pH 4. 4) and mahewu (pH 3. 5) were selected as the supply vehicles for the microencapsulated B. lactis. Known numbers of viable microencapsulated and free B. lactis cells were added to both beverages. For most samples, incubation was at either 4 °C or 22 °C for 21 days in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. In addition, free cells were incubated anaerobically at 22 °C. As oxygen is limiting in the microcapsules, these were not incubated under anaerobic conditions. The survival I shelf-life studies of commercial amasi indicated no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in survival rate between immobilised and free B. lactis cells. The reduction noted for viable counts of immobilised or free B. lactis cells was approximately 1. 5 log cycles. Even so, after 21 days viable immobilised B. lactis (1010 0. 1 g'l microcapsules) remained in excess of the daily intake 108, whereas in the free B. lactis cells, the viable count declined to 106 mr 1. Statistical analyses showed that temperature or oxygen presence had little effect on the survival of both immobilised or free B. lactis cells (p>O. 05). In mahewu, decline in viability of cells was observed for most samples. However microencapsulation enhanced cell survival at both 4 °C and 22 °C when compared to free cells. The decrease in viable B. lactis free cells occurred more rapidly (3 log cycles) in mahewu, than in amasi, at both 4 °C and 22 °C. Throughout the shelf-life studies it was apparent that viable B. lactis cell numbers did not increase. This was advantageous as metabolites associated with B. lactis growth would have adversely altered the taste of both amasi and mahewu. Sensory evaluation of the traditional fermented African beverages, enriched with either viable immobilised or free B. lactis, was done in order to determine consumer response to the product. An analytically trained 12 -member taste panel analysed the beverages for colour, texture, and taste. The triangle taste test procedure was used. No differences were detected with regard to texture, and colour of the fermented beverages containing immobilised B. lactis. However, in the fermented beverages containing free cells, a change in viscosity was noted. There was a significant difference (p<O. 05) recorded in flavour for both amasi and mahewu containing free B. lactis cells. In the two fermented beverages enriched with immobilised cells, significant (p<O. 05) flavour differences were detected in mahewu. However, this was not observed in the amasi samples containing immobilised B. lactis. Therefore, in order to retain the sensory properties of amasi, B. lactis should be supplied in microcapsules. In mahewu, although flavour differences noted were not unpleasant to the panellists, results from this study indicate that the use of commercial flavoured mahewu should be considered as a supply vehicle for microencapsulated B. lactis. Overall, this study demonstrated that immobilisation of B. lactis in gellan-xanthan gum is possible. Microcapsules produced contained high numbers of viable B. lactis, and were suitable for incorporation into soft foods. The gel matrix significantly protected viable cells from harsh conditions associated with SGJ. Although the surviving fraction of immobilised cells, when compared to free cells, was not improved in amasi samples, it is recommended that for technological reasons associated with production of amasi, microencapsulation should be used. In mahewu, microencapsulation enhanced B. lactis survival at both 4 °C and 22 °C. Therefore immobilisation of B. lactis in mahewu is necessary {{in order to maintain the}} daily intake. Immobilised B. lactis should be incorporated into both beverages after fermentation, and pasteurisation...|$|E

The combs are polybutadienes (1, 4 -addition) consisting of an H-skeleton with an additional off-center branch on the backbone. We chose to investigate a solution in order to obtain reliable nonlinear shear data in overlapping dynamic regions with the two different techniques. The transient measurements obtained by <b>cone</b> partitioned <b>plate</b> indicated the appearance of overshoots in both the shear stress and the first normal stress difference during start-up shear flow.

Flow-birefringence measurements were performed in a Couette geometry, and the extracted steady-state shear and first normal stress differences were found to agree well with the mechanical data, but were limited to relatively low rates below the inverse stretch time of the backbone.

40|$|A {{large portion}} of Canada's {{reserves}} of crude oil consists of extra heavy crude and natural bitumens. As the reserves of conventional crude oil continue to decline, heavy oil and bitumen are becoming increasingly important sources of hydrocarbon liquids. Oil­-in-water emulsions provide an alternative to heating and dilution methods for transportation of these viscous heavy oils through conventional pipelines. One {{of the most important}} preconditions for implementing this technology is prediction of the flow behavior and stability of the heavy oil-in-water emulsions. Inversion, a process by which one type of emulsion (such as oil-in-water) is converted to another (such as water­-in-oil), is critical because it could cause a region of very high viscosity to form in the pipeline. This research attempts to investigate the causes of inversion, and to develop a simple and effective laboratory method for selecting suitable surfactants and their concentrations at the emulsion pipeline operation conditions. The inversion of heavy crude oil-in-brine emulsions stabilized with non-ionic surfactants has been studied experimentally. Tests were carried out in beakers and in a <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> viscometer. The effects of shear rate, surfactant species and concentration, temperature, and oil fraction on emulsion inversion were studied. Toroid tests were carried out to compare the data generated from the <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> viscometer to that for a pipeline. It was found that inversion of oil-in-brine emulsions was always associated with the disappearance of the non-ionic surfactant from the aqueous phase. The surfactant affinity (i. e., hydrophilic property) for the aqueous phase thus appeared to be critical in the stabilization of these emulsions. Increasing the number of ethylene oxide units increased the hydrophilic property of the non-ionic surfactant and the stability of the emulsion. The emulsion stability also depends on the strength of the interfacial adsorption film. High shear rates not only destroyed the film, but also displaced fragments of the film back to the aqueous phase. The emulsions remained stable only when the surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase was above the C. M. C. level, meaning there was enough surfactant stock to maintain the stability of the interfacial adsorption film. High temperatures reduced the physical strength of the interfacial adsorption film and the repulsive force between oil droplets, encouraging the flocculation and inversion. The toroid tests indicated that the <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> viscometer is probably a good simulation of the emulsion flow behavior in pipelines. A laboratory method to select a suitable surfactant type and concentration has been developed using the <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> viscometer...|$|R

The exothermal vulcanization process was measured with a differential scanning calorimeter. Viscosity was measured with a <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> rheometer. A computer program fit coefficients to the experimental data. Values for activation energy and fitted rate coefficient were found using both nth order polynomial and autocatalytic models.

Using a modified <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> type viscome-ter, we previously demonstrated that, under low shear stress (18 dyn/cm 2), aggregation is mediated by platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ilb-ila and fibrinogen, whereas aggrega-tion induced by high shear stress (108 dyn/cm 2) requires the binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to both GPIb-IX an...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} asymptotic {{solutions for}} {{the shape of a}} small liquid sessile drop in a <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> rheometer. The approximation is based on small Bond number or, equivalently, on a characteristic length scale which is much smaller than the capillary length. The drop has a complicated asymptotic structure, consisting of five separate scalings, which is resolved using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. We find that the presence of a substrate above (and below) the drop gives rise to qualitatively new drop configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of droplet size on exergy destruction rate in flow of highly concentrated oil-in-water emulsions was investigated experimentally in a <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry. The oil concentration was fixed at 74. 5 % by volume. At this dispersed-phase (oil) concentration, two different droplet size emulsions were prepared: fine and coarse emulsions. The fine and coarse emulsions were mixed in different proportions to vary the droplet size distribution. Although the dispersed and matrix {{phases of the}} emulsions were Newtonian in nature, the emulsions exhibited a non-Newtonian (shear-thinning) behavior due to the high droplet concentration. The shear stress—shear rate data of the emulsions could be described adequately by a power law model. At low shear rates, the exergy destruction rate per unit volume of emulsion exhibited a minimum at a fine emulsion proportion of 35 %. The results from the <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> geometry were used to simulate exergy loss in pipeline flow of emulsions. The pumping of emulsions becomes more efficient thermodynamically upon mixing of fine and coarse emulsions provided that the flow regime is maintained to be laminar and that the Reynolds number is kept at a low to moderate value. In the turbulent regime, the exergy loss generally increases upon mixing the fine and coarse emulsions...|$|R
30|$|When {{determining}} viscosities {{of complex}} fluids that contain solids such as heavy oils, emulsions or slurries, the convectional viscometer types, i.e., concentric cylinders, or <b>cone</b> and <b>plate,</b> {{are often not}} suitable. This is because either the narrow gap or geometry would not accommodate the particle size (Roos et al. 2006), inability to maintain the particles suspended or inability to achieve the desired homogeneity. Vane or helical ribbon mixer geometry types have been proposed as potential candidates for slurry characterization (Roos et al. 2006; Metzner and Otto 1957; Patterson et al. 1979; Carreau et al. 1993).|$|R
40|$|Measurement of the Structural Unit (SU – containing both the solid phase and trapped­fluid within their associated structures)  in magnetic dispersions has been carried out using Hindered Settling (HS)  analysis {{that uses}} {{scanning}} column magnetometry and <b>cone</b> & <b>plate</b> rheology techniques.

The shearing-heating treatment was realised on the new designed equipment ¿ Shear Cell ¿ based on the <b>cone</b> and <b>plate</b> rheometer device. The measurement of rheological changes during processing showed that water and glycerol addition lowered the shear stress and the shear rate values. Also the influence on intrinsic viscosity was observed: higher level of water and glycerol added, the lower values of intrinsic viscosity was observed.
