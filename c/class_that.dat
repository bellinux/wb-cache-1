5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished {{more than they}} had in the previous two centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, Latinos, and Europeans from the surrounding provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado <b>class</b> <b>that</b> espoused liberal ideas: the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a seductive detail in a {{training}} context might be a training <b>class</b> <b>that</b> includes cartoons on slides containing tips for effective supervision. Although not necessarily relevant to the topic, the cartoons are designed to make the training material more interesting, but the results of multiple studies suggest that their inclusion will harm recall from the primary training content.|$|E
5|$|An isohedral tiling is {{a special}} {{variation}} of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles {{belong to the same}} transitivity <b>class,</b> <b>that</b> is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the symmetry group of the tiling. If a prototile admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is called anisohedral and forms anisohedral tilings.|$|E

The classes divide into two groups, generic <b>classes</b> <b>that</b> are broadly useful in adaptive algorithms, and application-specific <b>classes</b> <b>that</b> {{are the basis}} for our AMR algorithm. We employ two languages, with C++ responsible for the high-level data structures, and Fortran responsible for low-level numerics. The C++ implementation is {{as fast as the}} original Fortran implementation. Use of inheritance has allowed us to extend the original AMR algorithm to other problems with greatly reduced development time...|$|R

5|$|Any <b>class</b> <b>that</b> {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A {{capable of}} allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E
5|$|Birds are now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate <b>class</b> <b>that</b> had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|China's late-20th-century {{economic}} reforms produced a middle <b>class</b> <b>that</b> {{increased demand for}} traditional luxury items like shark fins. Chinese traditional medicine ascribes various restorative and healing effects to the fins, and the soup is considered a delicacy, costing as much as US$100 per bowl. The Chinese demand for fins led fishing crews to both take them from sharks in their bycatch and start fishing for sharks directly.|$|E

Two decades later, Marshall University retired Gatski's number 72 during a homecoming game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Gatski was the first and remains the only Marshall football player to be so honored.|$|E

5|$|Isabella Augusta, Lady Gregory (née Persse; 15 March 1852 – 22 May 1932) was an Irish dramatist, folklorist and theatre manager. With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, {{and wrote}} {{numerous}} short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced {{a number of}} books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a <b>class</b> <b>that</b> identified closely with British rule, she turned against it. Her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was emblematic of many of the political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Lacking artistic {{stimulation}} in Morgantown, Lazzell {{journeyed to}} Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915. Already an artists' colony, Provincetown was {{a mecca for}} European artists escaping World War I. Stella Johnson and Jessie Fremont Herring, two of Lazzell's companions from her tour in Italy, were already in Provincetown and Lazzell stayed with Johnson's mother. Lazzell took a morning outdoor painting <b>class</b> <b>that</b> summer from Charles Webster Hawthorne at his Cape Cod School of Art where she was exposed to Fauvist color and technique. She returned to Morgantown in the autumn and held an exhibition in her studio that October.|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word <b>class</b> <b>that</b> is called nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or semantic {{role in the}} sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E

The withdrawal programme intensified after boundary changes on the Southern Region placed the lines west of Salisbury under Western Region control in 1963. Class members based at Exmouth Junction shed were withdrawn in 1964, whilst the Southern Region's allocation was gradually replaced by Bulleid's Light Pacifics. The last operational {{members of the class}} were Nos.31405 and31408; both were withdrawn in June 1966.|$|E
5|$|Tegetthoff {{was ordered}} by the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1908.

The keel of Tegetthoff was laid down in Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste on 24 September 1910.

Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E
