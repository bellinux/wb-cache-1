Calculation of the basic design parameters of work based on their functioning features is fairly relevant. In pallet transfer movement over work positioning there is a mismatch between axes of the basic bushing of a pallet and the clamping locks of positioning. The paper identifies the factors influencing it, and defines the conditions to ensure the trouble-free clamping lock. The circular and rhombic clamping of pallet is simultaneous. Further, a clamping load is calculated from the pallet mass (together with the work-piece) and the geometric parameters of the pallet clamping. The paper reveals three movement stages of the clamping lock in a vertical plane when setting the pallet in work positioning: - a clamping lock free play till it encounters with the location bushing; - a clamping lock play length when the lead-in chamfer <b>contacts</b> the <b>bushing</b> chamfer; - a clamping lock play length over the circular surface of bushing. The study of this process has allowed us to calculate the time of pallet clamping and dynamic loads acting on the clamping lock.

The presented calculations allow a reasonable assigning the main design parameters of work positioning for the pallet automatic lines. </p...|$|R
40|$|Copper based hybrid {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} reinforced with graphite and SiC by {{powder metallurgy route}} takes the advantage of both graphite and SiC. Graphite helps in improving the wear resistance as graphite acts as a lubricating film on the contact surface and its having small co-efficient of thermal expansion, but hardness decreases due to softness of graphite. SiC helps in improving the hardness of the composite. Copper based hybrid metal matrix composites are used in many electrical contact applications like <b>contact</b> <b>bushes</b> and bearing materials. Cu based metal matrix composite is also used as heat sink because of its low coefficient of thermal expansion and packaging of microelectronics compact. In our present investigation, {{attempts have been made to}} fabricate Copper–graphite-SiC hybrid metal matrix composites {{by powder metallurgy route}}. The main aim is to improve the mechanical properties and wear resistance of composite with a minor loss of electrical conductivity. Cu-graphite-SiC hybrid metal matrix composites were fabricated using copper powder reinforced with 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 vol. % graphite along with 2, 5, 10 wt. % of SiC. Powders were blended in a turbula shaker mixer for 30 minutes. The composite powders were cold compacted by uni-axial pressing upon applying a pressure of 700 MPa for 5 minutes. The compacted samples were sintered in a tubular furnace at 900 oC for 1 h in argon atmosphere. For comparison, coarse and fine SiC powders were used to study the effect of SiC particle size on the mechanical and electrical conductivity of the fabricated composites. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the phases of the composite. Microstructural analysis was carried under optical microscope, SEM (Scanning electron microscope) and FESEM (Field emission SEM), which shows the uniform distribution and good bonding of graphite and SiC reinforcement with copper matrix. Archimedes’ principle was used to determine the relative density of the composites and it was found that relative density increased from 78. 0 to 86. 5 % with increase in the amount of reinforcement for coarse SiC particle. For fine SiC particle, the value of relative density was found around 88. 5 %. It was observed that hardness of the composites increased with increase in SiC content and it decreased with increase in graphite content. The maximum hardness value was achieved for high content of SiC and low content of graphite as the maximum hardness value of 76. 1 VHN for Cu- 1 vol. % graphite- 10 wt. % SiC whereas for pure Cu hardness value was 32 VHN. It was noticed that hardness of the composites containing fine SiC particle is more as compared to coarse SiC particle. Compressive strength of the composites decreases with increase in the graphite content. iv | P a g e There was an increase in compressive strength with addition of higher amount of SiC for fixed content of graphite. Compressive strength of the composite containing fine SiC particle is more as compared to coarse SiC particle. Non-lubricated sliding wear resistance of the composite increases by addition of graphite and SiC in the hybrid composite as graphite act as lubricating film on contact surface and addition of SiC support the stress on the contact surface which prevent plastic deformation but abrasion takes place on the surface. Electrical conductivity of the composites decreased with the increase in the amount of graphite and SiC. The electrical conductivity value for pure Cu was found to be 4. 39 × 106 Siemens/m and it decreased to 1. 93 × 106 Siemens/m for Cu- 15 vol. % graphite- 10 wt. % SiC.

40|$|BackgroundCushion bush [Leucophyta brownii Cass. =Calocephalus brownii (Cass.) F. Muell. ] is an Australian Compositae shrub {{that has}} been {{introduced}} into Scandinavia as a pot plant. The first case of sensitization occurred in a gardener, and the main allergen was identified as the guaianolide calocephalin. ObjectiveTo present {{the identification of the}} main allergen, and to assess the prevalence of sensitization to calocephalin in Compositae-allergic patients. Materials and methodsCalocephalin was isolated from a dichloromethane extract of aerial parts of cushion bush. Calocephalin 0. 1 % ethanol was included in the plant series in Malmo, Sweden, and Odense, Denmark. ResultsNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of calocephalin resulted in a revision of its chemical structure to 4 -acetoxy- 1, 2 -epoxy- 5, 10 H-guai- 11 (13) -en- 12, 8 -olide. The prevalence of patch test positivity was up to 28 % in aimed patch testing. Despite strongly positive patch test reactions, the relevance was unknown in the majority of cases, and only 1 person was occupationally sensitized. ConclusionCalocephalin is a potent contact allergen, but, as cushion bush is a low-maintenance pot plant, primary sensitization is most likely to occur through occupational exposure. Positive reactions in Compositae-sensitive persons probably occur because of cross-reactivity, and patients should be warned about <b>contact</b> with cushion <b>bush</b> plants...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{assembly}} systems plays {{vital role}} in automating production process. They directly affect production efficiency {{and quality of the}} goods. According to the statistical analysis, 30 - 60 % of the tasks in most of the industries branches are assembly operations. Part assembling time takes 35 - 40 % of all manufacture time. Around 33 % of all assembly operations are peg to bush assembly operations. Because of that, assembly operation has big potential in reducing manufacture time by improving assembly methods and installing automatic part assembly systems and devices. This work investigates a new approach of passive vibratory part alignment method using elastic vibrations. In this method bush placed on the assembly plane and is free to move in a narrow space. Another component (peg) fixed in a gripper, which has piezoelectric vibrator in it. Vibrator presses upper end of the peg. Peg and a bush also pressed to each other with a predetermined force. Piezoelectric vibrator generates high frequency harmonic excitation to the peg and creates elastic vibrations of the peg in longitudinal and lateral directions. The lower end of the peg moves in elliptical shape trajectory. Because of the friction force between the components, bush moves to the part alignment direction. Parts successfully assembled after the alignment occurs. This passive alignment method allows assembling parts with circular and rectangular cross-section with no chamfers and at their axial misalignment of few millimetres, or makes it possible to use low accuracy robots Detailed analysis of scientific papers about widely used part alignment methods in a now days industry was done. Vibrations of the peg’s tip while he is in a <b>contact</b> with <b>bush</b> were investigated. Nature of the peg’s vibrations, their relationship to the excitation signal amplitude and bush-to-peg pressing force were determined.

40|$|During operation, a rotor/magnetic {{bearing system}} {{may be subject to}} various sources of vibration, either {{directly}} applied to the rotor or transmitted through the bearings owing to base motion. This paper considers controller designs that are capable of attenuating vibration arising from either source. It advances the current state of research in the area since other controller designs have considered only the direct forcing case. If base motion is not considered {{in the design of the}} controller then this disturbance may cause the bearing clearance limits to be reached. Controller design is formulated as an H optimization problem, with mixed design objectives. A new controller is derived that can simultaneously reduce vibration and minimize the effect of base motion on relative rotor to bearing displacement. Account is taken of the fact that the bearings can apply only limited control force. The design study was complemented by a programme of experimental work. The base of a rig was subjected to impulse inputs and the results show the effectiveness of the new controller design. It is demonstrated that proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controllers, or controllers designed for unbalance vibration attenuation only, may result in rotor <b>contact</b> with retainer <b>bushes,</b> while the new controller may prevent contact.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{concerns}} {{the development and}} assessment of innovative methodologies for simulating and improving the dynamic behaviour of mechanical components. In particular, two correlated issues are addressed herein: hybrid FE/LP gear pump modelling {{as a tool for}} foreseeing and optimising vibration behaviour in operational conditions; a new methodology for vibration reduction by applying damping patches in appropriate positions. In the field of positive displacement pump modelling, external gear pumps were analysed with the aim of developing ! ! "#! advanced methodologies which accurately predict of the dynamic behaviour of these components. Indeed, {{the first part of this}} thesis (PART A) is about external gear pumps for steering systems; the research activity concerning gear pumps was carried out in collaboration with the Dept. of Engineering at the University of Ferrara in co-operation with TRW Automotive Italia S. p. A – Divisione Automotive Pumps (Ostellato, Ferrara, Italy). This research pertains to the creation of a hybrid model, obtained through the integration of a nonlinear elastodynamic model with lumped parameters in relation to moving bodies, and an FE pump model. The model referred to bodies in motion takes into account the most important phenomena involved in pump operations, such as time-varying oil pressure distribution on gears, timevarying meshing stiffness, tooth profile errors, the possibility of tooth <b>contact,</b> <b>bush</b> displacement and hydrodynamic journal bearing reactions. Coupling the FE with the various parts which make up the pump, as well as coupling the lumped-parameter model and the FE model required the development of specific advanced techniques; thus several problems related to the combination of the different models employed in order to form a single hybrid LP/FE model were studied and resolved. Using particular techniques based on comparisons between simulations and experimental results concerning acceleration, forces and moments, the model was experimentally validated. Although this hybrid model is an excellent tool for improving the dynamic behaviour of gear pumps and for optimising the early stages of prototype design, some problems can still remain related to unwanted vibrations into precise frequency ranges. Thus, once the first part of the research was completed, it was decided to delve into the problem of structural optimisation. In particular, a methodology for surface damping treatment was created and applied. Indeed, the second part of the research activity (PART B) was about the optimisation of mechanical components and systems through the application of high damping material components known as patches; this research activity is being ! ! "! carried out by the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering (laboratoire vibrations acoustique) at the INSA institute (Institute National des Sciences Appliquées) in Lyon (France) where I spent thirteen months between the second and third year of my doctoral studies. Such treatment can be applied to existing structures and provides high damping capability over wide temperature and frequency ranges. In many practical plate and machinery casing structures, it is difficult to treat the whole surface with constrained layer viscoelastic material, due to reduced areas or inaccessible parts. Furthermore, it may indeed be desirable to selectively apply one or more damping patches to control certain resonances. Patch damping design is an efficient and cost effective concept for solving noise and vibration problems. As a result of these considerations, the research was focused on finding a general methodology, based on a purely energetic approach, to reduce the unwanted amplitude vibration level in mechanical components through the application of appropriate elements characterized by high damping properties. The methodology was enforced using IDEAS v 7 ! software which makes it possible to address modelling in terms of energy distribution within a structure. Advanced methodologies were developed to reduce the vibration amplitude in components such as plate and bracket by applying patches. Specifically, potential energy estimations will precisely and accurately define the exact locations on the surface of the components which should be covered by the patches. As a result, these studies enable a reduction in vibration amplitude, in reference both to a single component and/or a complex system. In addition, this methodology makes it possible to improve the vibratory behaviour of a component in certain frequency ranges while reducing, at the same time, the effect of dangerous resonances, acting specifically on the location, extent and quantity of the patches to be applied on the surface of the base component. During this thesis, different fields were contemporarily studied: definition and identification of structural modification ! ! "#! methods, theoretical aspects of material damping characteristics, vibrational propagation methods and applicative aspects relating to the implementation of models for the vibratory optimisation of mechanical components.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{phenomena}} of whip and whirl for a rigid rotor contacting at two bearing locations. The idea originated from an anemometer {{consisting of a}} rotor with an elastically supported stator undergoing the phenomena of dry friction whip and whirl at the two <b>bushing</b> <b>contacts.</b> To analyze the behavior, a mathematical model similar to the anemometer is developed and analyzed assuming two possible solutions, Mode 1 (normal reaction forces in phase at two contacts) and Mode 2 (normal reaction forces out of phase at two contacts). Analytical solutions are only possible for the models with same RCl (Radius to Clearance ratio) at the two rub locations. A simulation model is constructed using the Texas A&M University (TAMU) Turbomachinery Laboratory rotordynamics software suite XLTRC? comprised of Timoshenko beam finite elements to form multiple degrees of freedom rotor and stator models. The nonlinear connections at the rub surface are modeled using Hunt and Crossley?s contact model with coulomb friction. Dry friction simulations are performed for three separate models depending on the rotor?s mass disk location {{with respect to the}} contact locations. The three models used have (1) Disk at center location (2) Disk at 3 / 4 location (3) Disk at overhang location. The adequacy of the analytical solution is investigated using the above simulations. Also, cases are explored where the general assumed solution would not solve the mathematical model, e. g. different RCl ratios at the two contacts. Simulations are performed for increasing as well as decreasing running speeds. There is partial agreement between simulation predictions and the analytical solutions for the cases with the mass center at centered and at 3 / 4 location. First, whirl-to-whip transitions occur at near the combine rotor-stator bounce frequency for both disk at center and disk at 3 / 4 location. The case with overhang mass disk predicts the two contacts to whip and at different frequencies simultaneously. Neither of the analytical solutions predicts a case where precession occurs at two different frequencies at the two contact points. Predictions for models with different RCl on the Backward Precessional (BP) graph imitate whirling. The BP graph predicts increasing BP frequency with increasing rotor speeds which is a characteristic of whirling, whereas investigation of individual contact velocities suggest that they are slipping at all conditions, one of them slipping more than the other netting a whirling like motion. For the overhang model with different RCl, apart from whipping at different frequency the two contacts also whirl at different frequencies corresponding to the RCl at the respective contacts. Simulations for decreasing rotor speed predict jump down from whirl- to-whip different BP frequency as compared to the jump up from whip-to-whirl for the speed up...|$|R
