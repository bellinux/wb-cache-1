25|$|Some {{comments}} by Ottawa speaker Andrew J. Blackbird “…in which he recalls his father Mackadepenessy ‘making his own alphabet {{which he called}} ‘Paw-pa-pe-po’” and teaching it to other Ottawas from the L'Arbre <b>Croche</b> village on the Lower Peninsula of Michigan have been interpreted as suggesting use of a syllabic writing system by Ottawas earlier in the nineteenth century, although Blackbird was not himself a user of the script. Blackbird’s Ottawa writings use a mixture of French and English-based characteristics, but not those of Great Lakes script. There are no known Odawa texts written in the script.|$|E
500|$|The American white ibis {{was one of}} {{the many}} bird species {{originally}} described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Scolopax albus. The species name is the Latin adjective [...] "white". Alternative common names that have been used include Spanish curlew and white curlew. English naturalist Mark Catesby mistook immature birds for a separate species, which he called the brown curlew. Local creole names in Louisiana include bec <b>croche</b> and petit flaman.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Blackbird’s father may have been referring to a separate orthography developed by French Roman Catholic missionaries and spread by [...] missionary August Dejean, who arrived at L'Arbre <b>Croche,</b> Michigan in 1827, and wrote a primer and catechism in an orthography similar to that used by other French missionaries.|$|E
2500|$|All of {{the locks}} along the Lower Fox {{have been placed}} on the National and State Register of Historic Places. [...] Since 1983 efforts were made to save the locks from {{permanent}} closure. In 2001, the Army Corps of Engineers transferred ownership of the 17 locks that make up the Lower Fox River, Corps Office and property in Kaukauna, and the harbors of Stockbridge and Brothertown on Lake Winnebago to the State of Wisconsin. The Fox River Navigational System Authority was formed and a cost-sharing agreement was created. [...] Funds from the Army Corps of Engineers, the State of Wisconsin, and private donations have combined to rehabilitate, reopen, and maintain the locks. By 2017, the entire Lower Fox (with the exception of Rapide <b>Croche),</b> is expected to reopen. [...] As the rehabilitation of the locks is completed, the Rapid <b>Croche</b> Lock will remain permanently sealed as a barrier to aquatic nuisances, but a boat lift and transfer station will be installed at that site, which will again allow navigation through the entire Lower Fox River Navigational System. This transfer station will include measures to cleanse the boats of aquatic invasive species when traveling upstream into the Winnebago Pool.|$|E
2500|$|Even here, however, railroads {{dominated}} transportation. Traffic declined sharply. In 1983, {{the entire}} system was put into [...] "caretaker" [...] status and the Federal government stopped all maintenance. [...] The state of Wisconsin operated the locks through the 1987 navigation season. After the 1987 navigation season, canals were drained and lock gates were permanently sealed. The lock at Rapide <b>Croche</b> was sealed shut to prevent sea lampreys from reaching Lake Winnebago. Recently, the system has been undergoing a refurbishment with plans to make navigation a reality again.|$|E
2500|$|The word crochet {{is derived}} from the Old French crochet, a {{diminutive}} of <b>croche,</b> in turn from the Germanic croc, both meaning [...] "hook". It was used in 17th-century French lace making, crochetage designating a stitch used to join separate pieces of lace, and crochet subsequently designating both a specific type of fabric and the hooked needle used to produce it. Although the fabric is not known to be crochet in the present sense, a genealogical relationship between the techniques sharing that name appears likely.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph's {{third wife}} was Marie LeFevre. [...] She {{was born at}} Riviera des Raisins to LeFevre de Gascon and a French and Indian woman, about 1783. [...] When her father died in 1790, the family was driven away from the Detroit area as half-breeds. [...] They {{returned}} to her mother's Ottawa people at L'abre <b>Croche.</b> [...] Here, {{she was married to}} an Ottawa medicine man named de la Vigne. [...] After having two daughters, she left him because of his spirit worship. [...] Having been raised in the Catholic Church, she sought to rejoin this religion. [...] By 1810, she was at Mackinac, where she met Joseph Bailly. [...] At this time, because of their common religious concerns, they were married in a civil ceremony. [...] Their six children and Alexis would become the living memory of the Bailly family ...|$|E

The Strangite Mormon community move to Beaver Island in 1848 [...] brought additional conflicts as the Mormon leaders sought to enforce laws and restrict use of alcohol on the Beaver Archipelago.|$|E
2500|$|Jesuit Father Marquette set up {{a mission}} in St. Ignace in 1671. While the Beaver Wars raged on, Marquette evangelized the Indians, planted a large cross in Cross Village and {{established}} a mission in L'Arbre <b>Croche</b> ("Crooked Tree," [...] now known as Harbor Springs). From May 17, 1673 until Marquette's death near Ludington May 18, 1675, Father Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored and mapped Lake Michigan and the northern portion of the Mississippi River. In 1679, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Father Louis Hennepin set out on Le Griffon to find the Northwest Passage, making Le Griffon the first known sailing ship to sail in Northern Michigan, They sailed across Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan through uncharted waters that only canoes had previously explored. [...] After Marquette's death, the mission {{was taken over by}} Father Phillip Pierson, and then Father Nouvel. Father Henri Nouvel was [...] "superior of the Ottowa mission", a position he would hold from 1672 to 1680 (with a two-year break in 1678-1679), and again from 1688 to 1695. [...] Under Nouvel, a new chapel was built in approximately 1674, and by 1683 the mission was so successful and prosperous that three priests, Fathers Nicholas Potier, Enjalran, and Pierre Bailloquet, were assigned there. [...] The establishment of a French garrison at St. Ignace in 1679 wound up souring relations between the French and the local population.|$|E
