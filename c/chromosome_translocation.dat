40|$|Background: According to the literature, {{there are}} a number of chronic and acute myeloid leukemias with unique, complex <b>chromosome</b> <b>translocations.</b> This study aims to conduct a brief review of the {{incidence}} of complex <b>chromosome</b> <b>translocations</b> in myeloid leukemia and reports a case of myeloid leukemia with complex <b>chromosome</b> <b>translocations.</b> Methods: We conducted a web-based search for all peer review articles published on the subject of complex chromosome tranlsocations in chronic and acute myeloid leukemia in MEDLINE, PubMed and Mitelman ([URL] databases in addition to other pertinent web references. In addition, we performed conventional cytogenetic studies of 24 - to 72 -h cultures on bonemarrow/peripheral blood cells obtained from the current case.

The analysis of 10 different semen charac-teristics in groups of cockerels bearing the translocations revealed no significant difference from a control group bearing the normal chromosome complement. Estimates of the fertilizing ability of spermatozoa collected from cockerels within each karyotypic group also were not significantly different. These results indicate that 1) neither the fertilizing ability nor the phenotype of sper-matozoa is adversely affected by their chromosome complement and 2) the spermatogenic process in the domestic fowl is not arrested by meiotic barriers which, as reported for mammals, act to prevent the transmission of certain <b>chromosome</b> <b>translocations.</b> Results obtained from the domestic fowl are discussed in terms of proposed genetic mechanisms for spermatogenic dysfunction in mammalian translocation heterozygotes...|$|R

50|$|By 2004, 58 {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were known, {{grouped into}} 20 subfamilies. They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth (by signaling neurotrophins), differentiation, metabolism, adhesion, motility, death.RTKs {{are composed of}} an extracellular domain, which is able to bind a specific ligand, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular catalytic domain, which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates. Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation. In particular, movement of {{some parts of the}} kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the substrate to the active site. This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit ("transduce") the extracellular signal to the nucleus, causing changes in gene expression.Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis, either by gene mutation, or <b>chromosome</b> <b>translocation,</b> or simply by over-expression.

To investigate the relationship between parasitic disease and lymphomagenesis, we used Plasmodium chabaudi (Pc) to produce chronic malaria infection in mice. Pc induces prolonged expansion of germinal centers (GCs), unique compartments in which B cells undergo rapid clonal expansion and express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a DNA mutator.

5000|$|Gene fusions of JAK2 with ETV6 or BCR {{have been}} {{discovered}} in rare instances of eosinophilia-associated hematological diseases. The product of the ETV6 gene {{is a member of}} the ETS transcription factor family; it is required for hematopoiesis and maintenance of the developing vascular network, as determined in mouse Gene knockout. ETV6 is located on human chromosome 12 at position p13.2; <b>chromosome</b> <b>translocation</b> between it and JAK2 located on human chromosome 9 at position p24.1 form the fusion gene t(9;12)(p24;13) which encodes the ETV6-JAK2 fusion protein. Forced expression of this fusion protein in mice causes a fatal mixed myeloid and/or T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. BCR encodes the breakpoint cluster region protein. This protein possess Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase activity and also has GPAase activating effects on RAC1 and CDC42 but its normal function is unclear. BCR is located on human chromosome 22 at position q11.23. Translocations between it and JAK2 create the t(9;22)(p24;q11) fusion gene which codes for the BCR-JAK2 fusion protein. Forced expression of BCR-JAK2 in mice induces a fatal myeloid neoplasm involving splenomegaly, megakaryocyte infiltration, and leukocytosis. It is assumed but not yet fully proven that the Malignant transformation effects of these two fusion proteins are due to the effects of a presumtively continuously active JAK2-associated tyrosine kinase. Rare patients with hypereosinophilia carry a somatic point mutation in the JAK2 gene which encodes for the amino acid phenylalanine (notated as F) instead of valine (notated as V) at position 617 of JAK2 protein. This V617F mutation render's the protein's tyrosine kinase continuously active and results in a myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia.|$|E
50|$|A {{clinical}} diagnosis of SCS can be verified by testing the TWIST1 gene (only gene in which mutations {{are known to}} cause SCS) for mutations using DNA analysis, such as sequence analysis, deletion/duplication analysis, and cytogenetics/ FISH analysis. Sequence analysis of exon 1 (TWIST1 coding region) provides a good method for detecting the frequency of mutations in the TWIST1 gene. These mutations include nonsense, missense, splice site mutation, and intragenic deletions/insertions. Deletion/duplication analysis identifies mutations in the TWIST1 gene that are not readily detected by sequence analysis. Common methods include PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and chromosomal microarray (CMA). Cytogenetic/FISH analysis attaches fluorescently labels DNA markers to a denatured chromosome and is then examined under fluorescent lighting, which reveals mutations caused by translocations or inversions involving 7p21. Occasionally, individuals with SCS have a <b>chromosome</b> <b>translocation,</b> inversion, or ring chromosome 7 involving 7p21 resulting in atypical findings, such as, increased developmental delay. Individuals with SCS, typically have normal brain functioning and rarely have mental impairments. For this reason, if an individual has both SCS and mental retardation, then they should have their TWIST1 gene screened more carefully {{because this is not}} a normal trait of SCS. Cytogenetic testing and direct gene testing {{can also be used to}} study gene/chromosome defects. Cytogenetic testing is the study of chromosomes to detect gains or losses of chromosomes or chromosome segments using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Direct gene testing uses blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid, or other tissues in order to find genetic disorders. Direct gene testing can determine whether an individual has SCS by testing the individual's blood for mutations in the TWIST1 gene.|$|E

While crucial for immunity, AID-catalysed deamination is also the triggering event for the generation of lymphomagenic <b>chromosome</b> <b>translocations.</b> To address whether restricting the levels of AID expression in vivo contributes to the regulation of its function, we analysed mice harbouring a single copy of the AID gene (AID +/ 2).
