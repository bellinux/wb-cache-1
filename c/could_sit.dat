5|$|Rehearsals for Order of the Phoenix {{began on}} 27 January 2006, filming began on 7 February 2006 and {{finished}} {{at the start}} of December 2006. Filming was put on a two-month hiatus starting in May 2006 so Radcliffe <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> his A/S Levels and Watson <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> her GCSE exams. The film's budget was reportedly between GB£75 and 100 million (US$150–200 million). The largest budget of the other films in the series has been the £75 million it cost to make Goblet of Fire.|$|E
5|$|Close to Lakefield and off {{the road}} in their own {{enclosure}} were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, lived {{in one of the}} cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> up with a lump of sugar balanced on her nose.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Library {{became a}} popular {{destination}} for studying and hanging out {{for young people}} from well-known neighbouring schools such as Raffles Institution, Raffles Girls' School, St Joseph's Institution and Tao Nan School that had their early beginnings in this area. The landmark Balustrade or front porch and steps {{leading up to the}} Library became an intimate public space where one <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> and read, wait, chat or simply watch the world go by.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Radcliffe {{confirmed}} {{he would}} return as Harry Potter in May 2005, with Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom), and Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley) confirmed to return in November 2005. In February 2006, Helen McCrorywas cast as Bellatrix Lestrange, but dropped out due to her pregnancy. In May 2006, Helena Bonham Carter was cast in her place. Ralph Fiennes reprises his role as Lord Voldemort. British television director David Yates was chosen to direct the film after Goblet of Fire director Newell, as well as Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Guillermo del Toro, Matthew Vaughn and Mira Nair, turned down offers. Kloves, the screenwriter of the first four Harry Potter films, had other commitments and Michael Goldenberg, who had been considered for screenwriter of the series' first film, filled in to write the script. Principal photography began on 7 February 2006, and concluded {{at the start of}} December 2006. Filming was put on a two-month hiatus starting in May 2006 so Radcliffe <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> his A/S Levels and Watson <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> her GCSE exams.Live-action filming took place in England and Scotland for exterior locations and at Leavesden Film Studios for interior locations. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had itsworldpremiere on 28 June 2007 in Tokyo, Japan, and a UK premiere on 3 July 2007 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 12 July,and the United States on 11 July.|$|E
5|$|The Haunting was {{released}} on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends, expecting a ho-hum film, took out make-up during the film's first few minutes {{with the intention of}} fixing their faces. The film proved so frightening, she said, that the women were jumping out of their seats and losing their items. In Houston, Texas, a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> all the way through a midnight screening; the prize was $100. Despite these stunts, The Haunting was only an average success at the box office.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{principal}} photography {{was expected}} to begin on 26 February 2008, and then on 15 March 2008, but finally began on 19 March 2008 in Rajasthan. Initial shooting occurred for 10 days in Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. Art director Ravinder went to Chennai and gave details of their requirements to a prominent chariot-making specialist. After rejecting the maker's first iron skeletons, Ravinder opted to design them himself, and prepared three models of chariots with different heights to be used, depending on the camera’s location and other technical requirements. He used fibre material for the iron skeleton's exteriors. For {{a scene in which}} neither the hero nor the villain was present on the chariot, Ravinder measured a short person and designed a hidden chamber in which he <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> and secretly control the horses. While the chariot race sequence was shot in Dholavira, the sequence in which the chariot sinks in quicksand was shot at a set comprising three acres in Ramoji Film City.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} years of Garrard's second term were {{relatively}} uneventful, but in the 1802 General Assembly, legislators approved two bills related to the circuit court system that Garrard vetoed. The first bill expanded the number of courts and provided that untrained citizens <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> as judges in the court system. Garrard questioned the cost of the additional courts and the wisdom of allowing untrained judges on the bench; he also objected to the bill's circumvention of the governor's authority to appoint judges. The second bill allowed attorneys and judges in the circuit court system to reside outside the districts they served. The General Assembly overrode Garrard's second veto, marking the first time in Kentucky history that a gubernatorial veto was overridden and the only time during Garrard's eight-year tenure.|$|E
5|$|Tuska {{reformed}} {{services at}} B'nai Israel, removing piyyutim (liturgical poems) in 1861, adding an organ and mixed-gender choir in 1862, and confirmation ceremonies in 1863. He also shortened the prayer book (adopting Wise's Minhag America version), added a late Friday night service, and created patriotically themed services for Thanksgiving and National Fast Day. When more pews {{were required to}} accommodate the worshipers, they were first added to the men's and women's sections, then family pews were added {{where men and women}} <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> together. In , as rabbi of B'nai Israel, he officiated at what may have been the first Jewish wedding in Tennessee; until that year, Tennessee did not authorize rabbis to perform marriages. He was also involved in the broader Memphis community, and participated in interfaith services.|$|E
25|$|A Classical theater, 84meters in {{diameter}} with 35 rows of seats, that <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> 4,000-6,000 people, equipped with three loges for {{the rulers of}} the city. Its size was considerable by Classical standards, larger than the theater at Babylon, but slightly smaller than the theater at Epidaurus.|$|E

25|$|Presbyterians, {{who were}} {{concentrated}} in the northern province of Ulster and mostly descended from Scottish settlers, also suffered from the Penal Laws. They <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> in Parliament but not hold office. Both Catholics and Presbyterians were also barred from certain professions (such as law, the judiciary and the army) and had restrictions on inheriting land. Catholics could not bear arms or exercise their religion publicly.|$|E
25|$|From 1953 until 1975 Tuvaluan {{students}} <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> {{the selection}} tests {{for admission to}} the King George V School for boys (which opened in 1953) and the Elaine Bernacchi Secondary School for girls. These schools were located on Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), which was the administrative centre of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. Tarawa was also the location for training {{institutions such as the}} teachers college and the nursing centre.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Nixon {{created the}} show's most iconic character: Rachel Davis (first played by Robin Strasser {{and later by}} Victoria Wyndham). Rachel was raised by her single mother, Ada (Constance Ford), who {{provided}} a good foil for Rachel. Down-to-earth Ada <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> in her kitchen on Bowman Street and be perfectly content with her life. Rachel, on the other hand, was a schemer who was determined to escape her impoverished background, {{even if it meant}} she had to resort to underhanded means.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} Greece is maritime, {{with both the}} coldness of winter and the heat of summer {{tempered}} by sea breezes. This led to a lifestyle where many activities took place outdoors. Hence temples were placed on hilltops, their exteriors designed as a visual focus of gatherings and processions, while theatres were often an enhancement of a naturally occurring sloping site where people <b>could</b> <b>sit,</b> rather than a containing structure. Colonnades encircling buildings, or surrounding courtyards provided shelter {{from the sun and}} from sudden winter storms.|$|E
25|$|After Henry II {{became the}} Lord of Ireland, {{he and his}} successors began to imitate the English system {{as it was in}} their time. Irish Earls were first created in the thirteenth century, and Irish Parliaments began in the fifteenth century, {{complete}} with seven Barons of Parliament. The Irish peers were in a peculiar political position; because they were subjects of the King of England, but peers in a different kingdom, they <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> in the English House of Commons, and many did. In the eighteenth century, Irish peerages became rewards for English politicians, limited only by the concern that they might go to Dublin and interfere with the Irish Government.|$|E
25|$|King was {{conscious}} {{enough to give}} the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by helicopter to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator. After five operations in ten days and physical therapy, King resumed work on On Writing in July, though his hip was still shattered and he <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable.|$|E

50|$|As {{there still}} {{remained}} a Test Act, non-Anglicans <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> in Parliament (this included all Protestant non-Conformists, Jews, Catholics, and Unitarians). The Test Act remained in force until the nineteenth century.|$|R
25|$|The {{technological}} innovations of the 19th century {{had opened the}} possibility of rapid circumnavigation and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership. In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869–70 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: {{the completion of the}} First Transcontinental Railroad in America (1869), the linking of the Indian railways across the sub-continent (1870), and the opening of the Suez Canal (1869). It was another notable mark in the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the imagination that anyone <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> down, draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 Hobhouse {{accepted}} a peerage as Baron Hobhouse, of Hadspen in the County of Somerset, {{with a view}} to assisting in the judicial work of the House of Lords, but a statutory qualification by which only judges of the high courts of the United Kingdom <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> to hear appeals had been overlooked. In 1887 the disqualification was removed by Act of Parliament in regard to members of the Judicial Committee; but Hobhouse did not take up the work of a judge in the House of Lords. He only sat there to try three cases, in two of which, Russell v. Countess of Russell (1897 Appeal Cases 395) and the Kempton Park case (1899 Appeal Cases 143), he was in a dissenting minority. As a judge Hobhouse, who was always careful and painstaking, invariably stated the various arguments fully and fairly, but he was tenacious of his deliberately formed opinion.|$|E
25|$|Servia had public {{rooms of}} a scale and luxury greater than {{previously}} known. Of the three decks, {{the upper deck}} consisted of deck-houses that included a first-class smoking room, and a luxuriously fitted ladies drawing room and a music room. The entrance and grand staircase was the largest that had ever appeared on a liner, and was panelled in polished maple and ash. It led down to the a landing on the main deck which featured a library. Twenty-four first-class state-rooms were situated aft of this landing, while the first-class dining salon was situated forward. The dining salon <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> 220 of Servia's 480 first-class passengers on five long tables, and was richly decorated with carved panels and carpets. In the centre was an open well that rose 17ft to a skylight. Forward of the dining salon were a further 58 staterooms, followed by crew accommodation areas.|$|E
