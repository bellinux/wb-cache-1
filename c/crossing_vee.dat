40|$|In modern railway {{industry}} the simulation of the behaviour of railway vehicles {{has become an}} important design method during the last years. Modern simulation packages offer modelling elements that are highly adapted for standard and unusual simulation scenarios. A specific application case is the simulation of a railway vehicle travelling through a switch. It makes high demands on the simulation software due to the inconvenient modelling elements needed: the changing rail profiles on the blade rail and in the <b>crossing</b> <b>vee</b> area {{as well as the}} guard rail with its additional contact {{at the back of the}} wheel. The article gives an overview over the state of the art in railway vehicle simulation and presents a simulation of a passenger car running through a switch as an application example...|$|E
