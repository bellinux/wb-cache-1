500|$|Cryptococcus neoformans is an {{encapsulated}} yeast {{that can}} live in both plants and animals. C. neoformans usually infects the lungs, where it is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Some C. neoformans can survive inside macrophages, {{which appears to be}} the basis for latency, disseminated disease, and resistance to antifungal agents. One mechanism by which C. neoformans survives the hostile macrophage environment is by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. Another mechanism involves meiosis. The majority of C. neoformans are mating [...] "type a". Filaments of mating [...] "type a" [...] ordinarily have haploid nuclei, but they can become diploid (perhaps by endoduplication or by stimulated nuclear fusion) to form blastospores. The diploid nuclei of blastospores can undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can be dispersed. This process is referred to as monokaryotic fruiting. this process requires a gene called DMC1, which is a conserved homologue of genes recA in bacteria and RAD51 in eukaryotes, that mediates homologous <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> during meiosis and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Thus, C. neoformans can undergo a meiosis, monokaryotic fruiting, that promotes recombinational repair in the oxidative, DNA damaging environment of the host macrophage, and the repair capability may contribute to its virulence.|$|E

50|$|Chromosomes are linear {{arrangements}} of condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins, which form a complex called chromatin. Homologous chromosomes {{are made up}} of <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairs</b> of approximately the same length, centromere position, and staining pattern, for genes with the same corresponding loci. One homologous chromosome is inherited from the organism's mother; the other is inherited from the organism's father. After mitosis occurs within the daughter cells, they have the correct number of genes which are a mix of the two parents' genes. In diploid (2n) organisms, the genome is composed of one set of each homologous <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair,</b> as compared to tetraploid organisms which may have two sets of each homologous <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair.</b> The alleles on the homologous chromosomes may be different, resulting in different phenotypes of the same genes. This mixing of maternal and paternal traits is enhanced by crossing over during meiosis, wherein lengths of chromosomal arms and the DNA they contain within a homologous <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> are exchanged with one another.|$|R
40|$|The European hake (Merluccius merluccius) is {{a highly}} {{valuable}} and intensely fished species in which a long-term alive stock {{has been established in}} captivity for aquaculture purposes. Due to their huge economic importance, genetic studies on hakes were mostly focused on phylogenetic and phylogeographic aspects; however chromosome numbers are still not described for any of the fifteen species in the genus Merluccius. In this work we report a chromosome number of 2 n = 42 and a karyotype composed of three meta/submetacentric and 18 subtelo/telocentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairs.</b> Telomeric sequences appear exclusively at both ends of every single chromosome. Concerning rRNA genes, this species show a single 45 S rDNA cluster at an intercalary location on the long arm of subtelocentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> 12; the single 5 S rDNA cluster is also intercalary to the long arm of <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> 4.

Fragaria × bringhurstii is pentaploid, having 5 pairs of these chromosomes {{for a total}} of 35 chromosomes, 7 from the F. vesca parent, and 28 from the F. chiloensis parent.

40|$|A central {{event in}} sexual {{reproduction}} is {{the reduction in}} chromosome number that occurs at the meiosis I division. Most eukaryotes rely on crossing over be-tween homologs, and the resulting chiasmata, to di-rect meiosis I chromosome segregation, yet make very few crossovers per <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> [1, 2]. This indi-cates that meiotic recombination must be tightly regu-lated to ensure that each <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> enjoys the crossover necessary to ensure correct segregation. Here, we investigate control of meiotic crossing over in Caenorhabditis e/egans, which averages only one crossover per <b>chromosome</b> <b>pair</b> per meiosis [3, 4], by constructing genetic maps of end-to-end fusions of whole chromosomes.

5000|$|Upon the {{formation}} of new polyploids, large sections of DNA are rapidly lost from one genome (1, 2, 4). The loss of DNA effectively achieves two purposes. First, the eliminated copy restores the normal gene dosage in the diploid organism (1). Second, the changes in chromosomal genetic structure increase the divergence of the homoeologous chromosomes (similar chromosomes from inter-species hybrid) and promotes homologous <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> (2). Both are {{important in terms of}} adjusting to the induced genome shock.|$|E
50|$|Transvection {{appears to}} be {{dependent}} upon <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing.</b> In some cases, if one allele is placed on a different chromosome by a translocation, transvection does not occur. Transvection can sometimes be restored in a translocation homozygote, where both alleles may once again be able to pair. Restoration of phenotype has been observed at bithorax, decapentaplegic, eyes absent, and vestigial, and with transgenes of white. In some cases, transvection between two alleles leads to intragenic complementation while disruption of transvection disrupts the complementation.|$|E

50|$|The {{synaptonemal complex}} (SC) is a protein {{structure}} that forms between homologous chromosomes (two pairs of sister chromatids) during meiosis and {{is thought to}} mediate <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing,</b> synapsis, and recombination. It is now evident that the synaptonemal complex is not required for genetic recombination in some organisms. Research has shown that {{not only does it}} form after genetic recombination but mutant yeast cells unable to assemble a synaptonemal complex can still engage in the exchange of genetic information. However, in other organisms like the C. elegans nematode, formation of chiasmata require the formation of the synaptonemal complex. It is currently thought that the SC functions primarily as a scaffold to allow interacting chromatids to complete their crossover activities. The synaptonemal complex is a tripartite structure consisting of two parallel lateral regions and a central element.|$|E
50|$|Sex-linked {{traits are}} a little bit more complex because these {{recessive}} traits are carried on the genetic information which determines the gender of a bird.

In mammals, it is the male that determines the sex of their offspring, in that mammal males have one X gene and one Y gene on a <b>chromosome</b> <b>pairing</b> (XY) and can pass either to an offspring - while a mammal female can only pass an X, due to their chromosomal pairing of XX. However, in birds and reptiles, this pairing is just the opposite: thus, in Lovebirds, it is the female which has an XY pairing and thus determines the sex of an offspring, depending on whether the mother passes an X gene or a Y gene.|$|E

[...] Since then, transvection {{has been observed}} {{at a number of}} additional loci in Drosophila, including white, decapentaplegic, eyes absent, vestigial, and yellow. As stated by Ed Lewis, [...] "Operationally, transvection is occurring if the phenotype of a given genotype can be altered solely by disruption of somatic (or meiotic) pairing. Such disruption can generally be accomplished by introduction of a heterozygous rearrangement that disrupts pairing in the relevant region but has no position effect of its own on the phenotype" [...] (cited by Ting Wu and Jim Morris 1999). Recently, pairing-mediated phenomena have been observed in species other than Drosophila, including mice, humans, plants, nematodes, insects, and fungi. In light of these findings, transvection may represent a potent and widespread form of gene regulation.|$|E
