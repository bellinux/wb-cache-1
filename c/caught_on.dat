5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, the abdomens {{of three}} {{pregnant}} women were cut {{open and the}} foetus removed and thrown into a fire. In an incident that came to light in 2007, Suresh Dedawala (Richard) alias Langado was <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> camera in a Tehelka sting operation talking to Bajarangi about slitting the belly of pregnant Muslim Kausar Banu, removing her foetus and killing it with a sword.|$|E

He is subsequently invited back to Goldfinger's mansion near Reculver where he narrowly escapes being <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> camera looking over the house. Goldfinger introduces Bond to his factotum, a Korean named Oddjob.|$|E
5|$|For some Native American tribes, dragonflies {{represent}} swiftness and activity; for the Navajo, they symbolize pure water. They are {{a common}} motif in Zuni pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, they appear in Hopi rock art and on Pueblo necklaces. They {{have been used in}} traditional medicine in Japan and China. In Indonesia, adults are <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> poles made sticky with birdlime, then fried in oil as a delicacy.|$|E

During his suspension, he was <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> video playing flag football at a San Diego park, a violation of his contract according to Charger management.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April, after a {{long night}} of battle, French fighter-bombers and {{artillery}} inflicted particularly devastating losses on one Viet Minh regiment, which was <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> open ground. At that point, Giáp decided to change tactics. Although Giáp still had the same objective — to overrun French defenses east of the river — he decided to employ entrenchment and sapping to try to achieve it.|$|E
5|$|One of the boys, Hugh Masekela at St Peter's School, told Father Huddleston of his {{discovery}} of the music of Louis Armstrong. Huddleston found a trumpet for him and as the interest in making music <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> among the other boys, the Huddleston Jazz Band was formed. Hugh Masekela did not stay very long in Sophiatown. He was in the orchestra of King Kong and then made his own international reputation.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{with the}} {{evolution}} of hip-hop music, hip-hop social dancing emerged from breaking and the funk styles into different forms. Dances from the 1990s such as the Running Man, the Worm, and the Cabbage Patch entered the mainstream and became fad dances. After the millennium, newer social dances such as the Cha Cha Slide and the Dougie also <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> and became very popular.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul fishery in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1906, shoe polish was {{not well}} known as a purchasable product, nor was it {{particularly}} sophisticated. While sales were not especially high, a few brands, like Nugget, were available in the U.K. during the 19th century. The practice of shining people’s shoes gradually <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> and soon many shoeshine boys in city streets were offering shoe shines using a basic form of shoe polish along with a polishing cloth.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the starboard wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the starboard wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the starboard wing <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> fire.|$|E
5|$|The jacamars {{are near}} {{passerine}} birds from tropical South America {{with a range}} that extends up to Mexico. They feed on insects <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> the wing, and are glossy, elegant birds with long bills and tails. In appearance and behavior they resemble the Old World bee-eaters, although they are {{more closely related to}} puffbirds.|$|E

5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It {{could only have}} been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had been <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able to}} meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
5|$|After the {{exposition}} {{ended the}} Columbus entered passenger service, {{and an additional}} deck (third superstructure, fifth total) was added during the 18991900 winter season. Despite the Columbus success at the exposition, and McDougall's promotional efforts, the whaleback design never <b>caught</b> <b>on.</b> By 1900, the last whalebacks had been built in Superior: the Alexander McDougall in 1899 (the last powered ship), and the John Smeaton, the last whaleback barge. The American Steel Barge Company was sold to the American Ship Building Company, becoming their Superior Works, and switched to more conventional laker designs.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Aronde, Simca marketed {{different}} trim {{levels of the}} Vedette under different model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the Simca Vedette Trianon, the mid-level was the Simca Vedette Versailles and, {{at the top of}} the range, the Simca Vedette Régence. An option on all versions was a large glass moonroof that slid into the roof, called Vistadome The Vedette range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the Netherlands and Germany, until 1956. As the new model <b>caught</b> <b>on,</b> Simca was able to increase production from the 150daily achieved during Ford's ownership of the factory to 250cars a day.|$|E

5|$|At the Tour de Corse, Audi debuted the Quattro A2, {{which was}} 70kg (155lb) lighter {{and had an}} engine {{producing}} 30 more horsepower. Mouton's rally ended when her engine <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> fire. On the first stage in Greece, she rolled her car on a hairpin turn 18km (11mi) from the start. Rally New Zealand was for Mouton a repetition of the previous year; she took the lead on the seventh stage and held on to it until her A2's engine failed, with only six of the 33 stages to go. The three retirements in a row dropped Mouton to fifth place in the championship. She then finished third behind Mikkola and Blomqvist at the Rally Argentina, but this would remain her last podium finish of the season. At the 1000 Lakes in Finland, Mouton finished the first day in seventh place after setting two top-five stage times. Her car later <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> fire, but {{she was able to}} continue in the event by following Mikkola's advice and driving into a lake. With a string of top-ten times, she eventually finished 16th. In the Rallye Sanremo, the tarmac stages were dominated by the Lancia 037 and Mouton finished seventh after suffering from fuel injection problems. In the season-ending RAC Rally, she started well and held second place after the first twelve stages. An Audi mechanic later accidentally refilled Mouton's fuel tank with pure water which resulted in time-consuming repairs. She eventually retired after crashing out, and placed fifth overall in the drivers' championship. Although Mikkola beat Lancia's Röhrl and Alén to the drivers' title, Audi had lost the manufacturers' title to Lancia after the latter's triple win in Sanremo.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the {{allegations of}} communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> tape {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E
