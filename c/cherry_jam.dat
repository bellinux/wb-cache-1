60|$|The Ambroses had {{not lived}} {{for many years}} in London without knowing {{something}} of a good many people, by name at least, and Helen remembered hearing of the Flushings. Mr. Flushing was a man who kept an old furniture shop; he had always said he would not marry because most women have red cheeks, and would not take a house because most houses have narrow staircases, and would not eat meat because most animals bleed when they are killed; and then he had married an eccentric aristocratic lady, who certainly was not pale, who looked as if she ate meat, who had forced him to do all the things he most disliked--and this then was the lady. Helen looked at her with interest. They had moved out into the garden, where the tea was laid under a tree, and Mrs. Flushing was helping herself to <b>cherry</b> <b>jam.</b> She had a peculiar jerking movement of the body when she spoke, which caused the canary-coloured plume on her hat to jerk too. Her small but finely-cut and vigorous features, together with the deep red of lips and cheeks, pointed to many generations of well-trained and well-nourished ancestors behind her.|$|E

40|$|Cherry from Prunus cerasus {{is widely}} used for its well known properties. The most {{important}} Italian area for cherry prodn. is the country around Vignola (Modena).

40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} method was applied for {{the determination of the}} levels of benzoate and sorbate in 400 food samples, including pickled cucumbers, canned tomato pastes, sour <b>cherry</b> <b>jams,</b> soft drinks, fruit juices and dairy products (UF-Feta cheeses, Lighvan cheeses, lactic cheeses, yogurts and doogh). The results showed that 270 (67. 5 %) of all samples contained benzoate ranging from 11. 9 to 288. 5 mg kg⁻¹ in lactic cheese and fruit juice, respectively. The levels of sorbate in 98 (24. 5 %) of the samples were 20. 1 to 284. 3 mg kg⁻¹ in doogh and fruit juice, respectively. Moreover, benzoate was detected in all dairy products ranging from 11. 9 mg kg⁻¹ in lactic cheese to 91. 2 mg kg⁻¹ in UF-Feta cheese. A low concentration of benzoate could originate naturally, due to specific biochemical mechanisms during cheese, yogurt and doogh maturation. In conclusion, a minimum level for benzoate in dairy products should be defined in the legislation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Sucrose is {{the main}} sugar used in jams preparation; however his {{excessive}} consumption has been related to several diseases; therefore its replacement by alternative sweeteners is an attractive solution. Nonetheless, substitution of sucrose in jam’s preparation can cause changes in texture, structure, and flavor, making them less attractive to the consumers. Thus, {{the aim of this}} work was to develop strawberry, raspberry, and <b>cherry</b> <b>jams</b> with more adequate nutritional profile, maintaining their textural and flavor characteristics in comparison with the traditional formulation. Sucrose was replaced by fructose, sorbitol, or fructooligosaccharides (FOS), given the product different nutritional profiles: potential low glycemic index, reduced calories in the case of sorbitol and FOS, and enrichment with dietary fiber, in the case of FOS. After sensorial and rheological evaluation we found that the sweeteners used interfered, significantly, in the parameters measured. Fructose was the alternative sweetener yielding jams more similar to those of sucrose; however, the use of formulations containing fructose and FOS or sorbitol and FOS resulted in a 51 % to 68 % decrease of the energy value. Nevertheless, consumer sensorial tests are needed to evaluate, in a more consistent way, the use of these alternative sweeteners for jams production at industrial level...|$|R

50|$|Kaiserschmarren is a light, {{caramelized}} pancake {{made from}} a sweet batter using flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and milk, baked in butter. Kaiserschmarren can be prepared in different ways. When making Kaiserschmarren the egg whites are usually separated from the yolk and beaten until stiff; then the flour and the yolks are mixed with sugar, and the other ingredients are added, including: nuts, <b>cherries,</b> plums, apple <b>jam,</b> or small pieces of apple, or caramelized raisins and slivered almonds. The last mentioned ingredients (nuts, <b>cherries,</b> plums, apple <b>jam,</b> or small pieces of apple, or caramelized raisins and chopped almonds) aren't in the original recipe and just additions made by some cooks based on their personal preferences.

40|$|In {{recent years}} a major market trend {{has been the}} design of more natural {{foodstuffs}} with chemical constituents being replaced by natural compounds and ingredients. Sour cherry is a phenolic rich fruit {{that has already been}} incorporated into the food chain, namely through a Portuguese traditional liquor (Ginjinha), however other food matrices may be the carrier for this antioxidant fruit, but formulation and processing conditions may affect functionality and acceptability. With that in mind the goal of this work was to expand the incorporation of sour cherry into the food chain via development of novel sour cherry based recipes or foodstuffs, with the most promising one being sour <b>cherry</b> <b>jams</b> with reduced sugar content. From this work two formulations resulted, one with whole cherries and other with cherry pulp? These products where characterized in terms of antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds and anthocyanin profile and consumer acceptance. The results obtained through chemical and sensorial analysis of the two formulations showed that from a chemical standpoint the jams possessed significant antioxidant capacity with a high content of phenolic compounds, namely caffeic acid. Regretfully when considering the anthocyanin content due to the high temperature used during processing they were highly reduced. When considering the sensorial analysis of the two jams through a focus group, results showed that over 77 % of the panellists liking both products, with their texture and sweet flavour being remarked as the strong points of both products. Furthermore 72 % of the panellists stated their intention to buy the products. In conclusion the results obtained show that the developed products were market ready and that, despite the thermal treatment involved in their processing, both jams validated for consumption still maintained a significant level of biologically active compounds...|$|R

Hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) were found in all the investigated fruits, {{with the exception of a}} derivative of ferulic acid, which was not found in strawberry. Derivatives of caffeic, p-coumaric and chlorogenic acids were found in all the investigated fruits, with chlorogenic acid being the most abundant, especially in sour cherry Marasca. Volatiles were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and expressed as the peak area of the identified compounds. All investigated volatiles of fresh fruit were also determined in the related jams with relatively high retention. Sour cherries Marasca and Oblačinska contained the same volatile compounds, but Marasca had higher level of total volatiles. The main volatile compound in both sour cherry cultivars was benzaldehyde (characteristic cherry aroma compound), which was followed by hexanal, 2 -hexenal, 2 -heptanone, linalool, nerol, and α-terpineol. Our results show that γ-decalactone and linalool were the most abundant volatile compounds in strawberry Maya and raspberry Willamette, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Background & Aims: Date syrup is {{a natural}} {{sweetener}} rich in antioxidants. In addition, fructose is the predominant sugar in date syrup, which elevates blood glucose {{at a slower pace}} than the other types of sugar. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the glycemic response of healthy persons to dietetic sour <b>cherry</b> <b>jam</b> prepared with date syrup. Methods: In this clinical trial, the glycemic response of 9 healthy persons was evaluated after the consumption of two kinds of jams, one prepared with date syrup and one as a control. Both jams had been produced using a specific formulation. White bread was chosen as the reference food. Having determined the glycemic index (GI) of the two jams, glycemic load (GL) was calculated and compared for the two jams by independent t-test. Results: GL was 15. 4 and 18 for the dietetic and control jams respectively, both of which were within the permitted range for diabetic's consumption. No significant difference was observed between the GIs of the two jams. The results showed that, the GL of the dietetic jam was significantly lower than that of the control (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The GL of the dietetic jam prepared with date syrup was less than that of the control sample. In light of the other health benefits of date syrup, once confirmed by further studies, this jam may be suitable to be introduced to the public as a dietetic product.
