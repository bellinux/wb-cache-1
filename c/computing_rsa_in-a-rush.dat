There are cryptosystems where the encipher algorithm can be public. These are public key algorithms. Research on public key algorithms has {{been concerned with}} security aspects.

The most used and checked public key-based cryptosystem was find by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, so called RSA system. This paper shows the RSA algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient asynchronous protocol to <b>compute</b> <b>RSA</b> inverses {{with respect to}} a public RSA modulus N whose factorization is secret and shared among a group of parties. Given two numbers x and e, the protocol computes y such that y e ≡ x (mod N). A synchronous protocol for this task has been presented by Catalano, Gennaro, and Halevi (Eurocrypt 2000), but the standard approach for turning this into an asynchronous protocol would require a Byzantine-agreement subprotocol. Our protocol adopts their approach, but exploits a feature of the problem {{in order to avoid the}} use of a Byzantine agreement primitive. Hence, it leads to efficient asynchronous protocols for threshold signatures and for Byzantine agreement based on the strong RSA assumption, without the use of random oracles. ...|$|R

The instantaneous RSA assessments provide information that complements the standard HRV measures, particularly in the high frequency (HF) range, as well as indices such as the analgesia nociception index (ANI) and the surgical stress index (SSI) [53],[56],[57].

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for distributed computing. The main novelty consists in the exploitation of web browsers as clients, thanks to the availability of Javascript and AJAX. The described solution has two main advantages: it is clientfree, so no additional programs have to be installed to perform the computation, and it requires low CPU usage, so clientside computation is no invasive for users. The solution is developed using AJAX technology embedding a pseudoclient into a web page that hosts che computation. While users browse the hosting web page, computation takes place resolving single subproblems and sending {{the solution to the}} serverside part of the system. The new architecture has been tested through various performance metrics by implementing two examples of distributed <b>computing,</b> the <b>RSA</b> crack and the correlation index between genetic data sets.

40|$|Ballistocardiography is {{recognized}} as a reliable method for non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular functions. In this work, a wavelet approach was used on the y-axis ballistocardiogram (BCG) to evaluate the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) phenomenon using a new parameter: the ballistocardiogram amplitude modulation induced by respiration (BAMR). Eamax, local maximum energy of BCGy, was quantified for each cardiac cycle. Then a time series of Eamax was created and analyzed using continuous wavelet transform to provide BAMR values. The ECG was used to <b>compute</b> the <b>RSA</b> amplitude as reference. Data were collected on four subjects participating to an imposed controlled breathing protocol with four different breathing sequences. RSA amplitudes and BAMR present significant changes (p < 0. 05) for low breathing rate (0. 10 Hz) compared to high breathing rate (0. 25 Hz) and a within-subject correlation was observed. This study suggests that BAMR {{could be used as}} a relevant alternative to RSA amplitude for HRV investigation. SCOPUS: cp. pinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Plant root {{systems are}} key drivers of plant {{function}} and yield. They are also under-explored targets to meet global food and energy demands. Many new technologies {{have been developed}} to characterize crop root system architecture (CRSA). These technologies have the potential to accelerate the progress in understanding the genetic control and environmental response of CRSA. Putting this potential into practice requires new methods and algorithms to analyze CRSA in digital images. Most prior approaches have solely focused on the estimation of root traits from images, yet no integrated platform exists that allows easy and intuitive access to trait extraction and analysis methods from images combined with storage solutions linked to metadata. Automated high-throughput phenotyping methods are increasingly used in laboratory-based efforts to link plant genotype with phenotype, whereas similar field-based studies remain predominantly manual low-throughput. DescriptionHere, we present an open-source phenomics platform “DIRT”, as a means to integrate scalable supercomputing architectures into field experiments and analysis pipelines. DIRT is an online platform that enables researchers to store images of plant roots, measure dicot and monocot root traits under field conditions, and share data and results within collaborative teams and the broader community. The DIRT platform seamlessly connects end-users with large-scale compute “commons” enabling the estimation and analysis of root phenotypes from field experiments of unprecedented size. ConclusionDIRT is an automated high-throughput computing and collaboration platform for field based crop root phenomics. The platform is accessible at [URL] and hosted on the iPlant cyber-infrastructure using high-throughput grid computing resources of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). DIRT is a high volume central depository and high-throughput RSA trait computation platform for plant scientists working on crop roots. It enables scientists to store, manage and share crop root images with metadata and <b>compute</b> <b>RSA</b> traits from thousands of images in parallel. It makes high-throughput RSA trait computation available to the community with just a few button clicks. As such it enables plant scientists to spend more time on science rather than on technology. All stored and computed data is easily accessible to the public and broader scientific community. We hope that easy data accessibility will attract new tool developers and spur creative data usage that may even be applied to other fields of science...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims In {{order to}} analyse root system {{architectures}} (RSAs) from captured images, {{a variety of}} manual (e. g. Data Analysis of Root Tracings, DART), semi-automated and fully automated software packages have been developed. These tools offer complementary approaches to study RSAs {{and the use of}} the Root System Markup Language (RSML) to store RSA data makes the comparison of measurements obtained with different (semi-) automated root imaging platforms easier. The throughput of the data analysis process using exported RSA data, however, should benefit greatly from batch analysis in a generic data analysis environment (R software). Methods We developed an R package (archiDART) with five functions. It <b>computes</b> global <b>RSA</b> traits, root growth rates, root growth directions and trajectories, and lateral root distribution from DART-generated and/or RSML files. It also has specific plotting functions designed to visualise the dynamics of root system growth. Results The results demonstrated the ability of the package’s functions to compute relevant traits for three contrasted RSAs (Brachypodium distachyon [L. ] P. Beauv., Hevea brasiliensis Müll. Arg. and Solanum lycopersicum L.). Conclusions This work extends the DART software package and other image analysis tools supporting the RSML format, enabling users to easily calculate a number of RSA traits in a generic data analysis environment.

40|$|Abstract—The RSA public-key {{cryptosystem}} is an algorithm {{that converts}} input data to an unrecognizable encryption and converts the unrecognizable data {{back into its}} original decryption form. The security of the RSA public-key cryptosystem {{is based on the}} difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. This paper demonstrates to factor the product of two large prime numbers, and is a breakthrough in basic biological operations using a molecular computer. In order to achieve this, we propose three DNA-based algorithms for parallel subtractor, parallel comparator, and parallel modular arithmetic that formally verify our designed molecular solutions for factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Furthermore, this work indicates that the cryptosystems using public-key are perhaps insecure and also presents clear evidence of the ability of molecular computing to perform complicated mathematical operations.

To do so, we compute for each standard the number of integers they define (up to an error of very small order) and discuss different methods of generating integers of a specific form. Second, we show that factoring such integers is hard, provided factoring a product of two primes of similar size is hard...|$|R
40|$|Information {{security}} {{is concerned with}} confidentiality, data integrity, nonrepudiation and authentication. It {{is the process of}} protecting data from unauthorized access, modification, or disruption in computer security and information assurance especially in security system. This thesis proposes a security scheme on a crypto System-on-Chip (SoC), which is composed of hybrid encryption scheme and Rivest- Shamir-Adleman (RSA) based digital signature scheme to provide all the security services. Thus, to perform the proposed security scheme, this work focuses on the development of 128 -bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) subsystem, 2048 -bit RSA crypto subsystem and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA- 1) crypto subsystem. In AES encryption subsystem and RSA crypto subsystem, the strength of these cryptosystems rely on keys. Therefore, a hybrid Random Number Generator (RNG) is designed to equip the proposed crypto SoC with on-chip key generation operation. The crypto subsystems in this work are designed using hardware-software codesign technique. The hardware design focuses on the upgrading of existing 128 -bit AES coprocessor, modification of 2048 -bit RSA coprocessor and development of RNG circuit on Altera Stratix 1 S 40 F 780 C 5 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) development board. These hardware subsystems are integrated with Nios II processor and standard peripherals to form a complete cryptosystem in System of Programmable Chip (SoPC) environment. The software design consists of the development of device drivers for hardware subsystem communication, and implementation of Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP), serves as the Application Programming Interface (API) in host PC. A prototype has been developed to test the functionality of the crypto hardware subsystem as well as the usability of the CSP.
