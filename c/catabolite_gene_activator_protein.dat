Adenylate cyclase mutants were obtained, by random mutagenesis, which had partial adenylate cyclase activity but which did not exhibit increased levels of cAMP in a crp background. For three mutants the mutation was identified as a single point mutation.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the asparagine synthetase A gene of Escherichia coli was studied in vitro with a coupled transcription-translation system. It was shown that the 17 -kilodalton gene, which is transcribed divergently from the adjacent asnA gene, codes for an activator of asnA transcription. The synthesis of the 17 -kilodalton protein, which we now call AsnC, is autogenously regulated. The stimulating effect of AsnC on asnA transcription is abolished by asparagine, while the auto{{regulation of}} asnC is not affected by asparagine. The N-terminal part of the asnC protein, inferred from the DNA sequence, is homologous to the DNA-binding domain of regulatory <b>proteins</b> like <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator,</b> cro, and cI.

40|$|The ets {{family of}} {{eukaryotic}} transcription factors {{is characterized by}} a conserved DNA-binding domain of approximately 85 amino acids for which the three-dimensional structure is not known. By using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the secondary structure of the ets domain of one member of this gene family, human Fli- 1, both in the free form and in a complex with a 16 -bp cognate DNA site. The secondary structure of the Fli- 1 ets domain consists of three alpha-helices and a short four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. This secondary structure arrangement resembles that of the DNA-binding domain of the <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> of Escherichia coli, {{as well as those of}} several eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins including histone H 5, HNF- 3 /fork head, and the heat shock transcription factor. Differences in chemical shifts of backbone resonances and amide exchange rates between the DNA-bound and free forms of the Fli- 1 ets domain suggest that the third helix is the DNA recognition helix, as in the <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> and other structurally related proteins.

The two enzymes have similar molecular sizes and, based on sequence conservation at the protein level, are likely to be organized in two functional domains: the amino-terminal catalytic domain and the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain. It was shown that P. multocida adenylate cyclase synthesizes increased levels of cyclic AMP in E. coli strains deficient in the <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> compared with wild-type strains. This increase does not occur in strains deficient in both the <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> and enzyme HI-glucose, indicating that a protein similar to E. coli enzyme III-glucose is involved in the regulation ofP. multocida adenylate cyclase.

50|$|Proteins {{that bind}} cyclic {{nucleotides}} (cAMP or cGMP) share a structural domain of about 120 residues. The best studied of these proteins is the prokaryotic <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator</b> (also {{known as the}} cAMP receptor protein) (gene crp) where such a domain {{is known to be}} composed of three alpha-helices and a distinctive eight-stranded, antiparallel beta-barrel structure. There are six invariant amino acids in this domain, three of which are glycine residues that are thought to be essential for maintenance of the structural integrity of the beta-barrel. cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cAPK and cGPK) contain two tandem copies of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. The cAPK's are composed of two different subunits, a catalytic chain and a regulatory chain, which contains both copies of the domain. The cGPK's are single chain enzymes that include the two copies of the domain in their N-terminal section. Vertebrate cyclic nucleotide-gated ion-channels also contain this domain.

40|$|Colicinogenic factors ColE 1 and ColE 2 are {{bacterial}} plasmids {{that exist}} in Escherichia coli as supercoiled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and as strand-specific, relaxation complexes of supercoiled DNA and protein. Newly replicated ColE 1 DNA becomes complexed with protein after the replication event. This association of DNA and protein can take place under conditions in which DNA or protein synthesis is arrested. The addition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) to normal cells growing in glucose medium results in a six- to tenfold stimulation {{in the rate of}} synthesis of the protein component(s) of the complex and a three- to fivefold stimulation in the rate of ColE 1 DNA replication. Employing mutants deficient in <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> or adenylate cyclase, it was shown that synthesis of both the plasmid-determined protein colicin E 1 and the protein component(s) of the ColE 1 relaxation complex is mediated through the c-AMP-catabolite gene activator protein system. Addition of c-AMP to ColE 2 -containing cells results in the stimulation of synthesis of ColE 2 DNA and relaxation protein(s) {{as well as in the}} production of a protein component of the ColE 2 relaxation complex that renders it sensitive to induced relaxation by heat treatment.

40|$|AbstractTranscriptional {{silencing}} is {{a phenomenon}} in which the transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase II or III is repressed or not, dependent only on the gene's chromosomal location. Two prevailing models exist for silencing: (1) steric hindrance in silenced chromatin inhibits the binding of upstream <b>activator</b> <b>proteins</b> or polymerase or (2) silencing primarily blocks steps downstream of transcription preinitiation complex formation. Here, we test these models quantitatively for the case of SIR 2 -dependent silencing in budding yeast, using foreign and endogenous reporter proteins, at transgenic and endogenous loci. Our results contradict both models and show instead that transcriptional silencing at several URA 3 transgenes, and at the naturally silenced endogenous HMRa and HMLα mating type genes, acts downstream of <b>gene</b> <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> binding to strongly reduce the occupancy of TFIIB, RNA polymerase II, and TFIIE at the silenced promoters...|$|R

We predict that the loop is underwound in the binary complex with the LR, whereas in the ternary complex with the LR and CAP, the loop is overwound and extended due to an upstream relocation of a DNA binding hand of LR. The computed relocation distance matches the experimental observations and the energy balance of the system explains the cooperativity effect.

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{the cell}} cycle, cells {{progress}} through four distinct phases, G 1, S, G 2 and M; transcriptional controls {{play an important}} role at the transition between these phases. MCB-binding factor (MBF), a transcription factor from budding yeast, binds to the so-called MCB (MluI cell-cycle box) elements found in the promoters of many DNA synthesis genes, and activates the transcription of those at the G 1 [...] >S phase transition. MBF is comprised of two proteins, Mbp 1 and Swi 6. RESULTS: The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of Mbp 1 has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction from crystals of the selenomethionyl variant of the protein. The structure is composed of a six-stranded beta sheet interspersed with two pairs of alpha helices. The most conserved core region among Mbp 1 -related transcription factors folds into a central helix-turn-helix motif with a short N-terminal beta strand and a C-terminal beta hairpin. CONCLUSIONS: Despite little sequence similarity, the structure within the core region of the Mbp 1 N-terminal domain exhibits a similar fold to that of the DNA-binding domains of other proteins, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor- 3 gamma and histone H 5 from eukaryotes, and the prokaryotic <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator.</b> However, the structure outside the core region defines Mbp 1 as a larger entity with substructures that stabilize and display the helix-turn-helix motif...|$|R
40|$|The {{promoter}} region {{preceding the}} hutUH operon in Klebsiella aerogenes contains two oppositely oriented, overlapping promoters. In {{the absence of}} <b>catabolite</b> <b>gene</b> <b>activator</b> protein-cyclic AMP (CAP-cAMP), transcription proceeds primarily from the backward-oriented promoter (Pc), whose function {{has not yet been}} determined, and only very weakly from the forward hutUH promoter, hutUp. In the presence of CAP-cAMP, Pc is repressed and transcription from hutUp is favored. Two protein components required for this in vitro transcription system, RNA polymerase (RNAP) and CAP, were purified from K. aerogenes and were shown to be functionally interchangeable with the corresponding proteins from Escherichia coli, suggesting that E. coli RNAP could be used to study some aspects of hut transcription. We showed that a gradual activation of hutUp (by increasing concentrations of CAP, cAMP, or glycerol) resulted in a parallel repression of Pc, arguing in favor of a direct competition between the two promoters. The presence of a DNA sequence resembling the consensus for CAP-binding sites and centered at nucleotide - 82 (relative to hutUp) initially suggested that a primary role of CAP was to repress Pc, thereby indirectly activating hutUp. However, the relatively slow formation of open complexes at Pc, {{even in the absence of}} CAP-cAMP, showed that Pc is a weak promoter and likely to be a poor competitor for RNAP. The observed dominance of Pc over hutUp suggested that the latter is an even weaker promoter. Thus, repression of Pc would not be sufficient to cause the observed increase in hutUp activity, and the CAP-cAMP complex must play a direct role in the activation of hutUp...|$|R

Expression of malY, a MalT-independent gene, leads to the repression of all MalT-dependent genes. We have purified MalY to homogeneity and found it to be a pyridoxal- 5 -phosphate-containing enzyme with the enzymatic activity of a beta C-S lyase (cystathionase). MalY is a monomeric protein of 42, 000 to 44, 000 Da. Strains expressing MalY constitutively abolish the methionine requirement of metC mutants. The enzymatic activity of MetC, the cleavage of cystathionine to homocysteine, ammonia, and pyruvate, can be catalyzed by MalY. However, the cystathionase activity is not required for the function of MalY in repressing the maltose system. By site-directed mutagenesis, we changed the conserved lysine residue at the pyridoxal phosphate binding site (position 233) of MalY to isoleucine.
