5|$|Blokumannaland is a {{territory}} mentioned in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla ("The <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World") from the 13th century. The book narrates how the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, {{referred to by}} the name Kirjalax, invaded Blokumannaland where he fought against pagan tribes. Since these pagans have not been identified, there is disagreement as to the actual date of the Byzantine invasion. For instance, Spinei identifies the events prescribed in the Heimskringla with the Battle of Levounion of 1091 AD, which ended with the catastrophic defeat of the Pechenegs by the Byzantines. He argues that Blokumannaland refers to {{a territory}} inhabited by Vlachs south of the Lower Danube. On the other hand, Sandaaker proposes that the battle took place in 1040 AD, while the latest date of 1122 AD was proposed by Ellis Davidson and Blöndal. Alexandru Madgearu says that Sturluson anachronistically mentioned the lands south of the Danube as Blokummanaland, because the latter term referred to the Second Bulgarian Empire in Sturluson's time. In the modern Icelandic language, the term Blokumannaland may refer to either Wallachia or Africa.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich {{developed}} close professional relationships {{only within}} the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS security forces. Heinrich Müller was one such example, and Heydrich appears to have trusted him. Adolf Eichmann's straightforward loyalty impressed Heydrich, and was one reason why he appointed him as secretary for the Wannsee Conference. Herbert Kappler, who was appointed as commander of all SS security forces in Rome, {{was said to have}} been a protégé of Heydrich. SS personnel favoured by Heydrich, especially those who attended the Wannsee conference, possessed similar traits of devotion to SS, lack of remorse regarding brutal or genocidal orders, and above all personal loyalty to Heydrich in his capacity as commander of the security forces. On the other hand, Heydrich's dislike and distrust of Arthur Nebe and Walter Schellenberg may have stemmed from their independence and ambition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1370s, Carrouges IV married Jeanne de Tilly, a {{daughter}} of the Lord of Chambois whose dowry included lands and rents vital to Carrouges' ambition of expanding his family estates. Shortly after their wedding Jeanne {{gave birth to a}} son, whose godfather was a neighbour and close friend of de Carrouges, Squire Jacques Le Gris. In 1377, Pierre d'Alençon inherited his brother Robert's county of Perche and with it the castle of Bellême. In addition, he gained the fealty of his brother's vassals, including the Carrouges father and son as well as Jacques Le Gris. The younger Carrouges and Le Gris soon joined the court <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Count, centered around the town of Argentan.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which {{is the problem of}} finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal homothetic centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the prime}} opponents of Wilson and the League was Senate Majority Leader Henry Cabot Lodge. After McNary {{demonstrated}} his skill {{in the debate over}} the League, Lodge took him under his wing, and the two formed a longtime friendship. The friendship helped McNary secure favorable committee assignments and ushered him into the inner power <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate. Early in his career, he served as chairman of the Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands Committee, and {{as a member of the}} Agriculture and Forestry Committee. In 1922, President Warren G. Harding asked McNary to be the Secretary of the Interior to replace Albert B. Fall because of Fall's involvement in the ongoing Teapot Dome scandal. McNary declined, preferring to stay in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Reitz did {{not stay}} a private person for long. A {{conflict}} between the South African Republic legislature and judiciary resulted in the dismissal of the Chief Justice. Reitz then took up an appointment as judge in early 1898 and quickly {{became part of the}} inner <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Transvaal administration. At the time the relationship with the British was already rapidly deteriorating and the government of the South African Republic was taking action to reinforce its national and international position. One of the measures taken was to replace State Secretary W.J. Leyds, who had the Dutch nationality, with a South African. Leyds was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Europe to represent the Republic abroad. Reitz took his place as State Secretary in June 1898, after Abraham Fischer had declined.|$|E
