5|$|The two stands {{which were}} not altered after the fire were both {{improved}} during the 1990s. The Bradford end of the ground was made a double-decker, all-seater stand, with a new scoreboard, in 1991. City's promotion to Division One in 1996 meant that chairman Geoffrey Richmond announced {{the construction of a}} 4,500 seater stand on the Midland Road side. It was first used for a Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United on Boxing Day 1996, before being officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 27 March 1997. Richmond continued his plans to redevelop the ground as City continued to rise through the league. The roof of the Kop, which was the largest safe-standing terrace in the country at the time, was removed and the capacity reduced during City's 1998–99 promotion season, to prepare for a summer £6.5million rebuilding programme. The Kop was converted into a two-tier 7,500-seat capacity stand. An additional 2,300-seat capacity <b>corner</b> <b>section</b> was built, which filled in the corner between the main stand and Kop. When opened in December 2000 it took the capacity of Valley Parade to more than 20,000 {{for the first time since}} 1970. A suite of offices and a shop were added at the same time. Once the work was completed, a second tier was added to the main stand at the cost of £6.5million. It was opened in 2001, increasing the main stand's capacity to 11,000, and the ground's capacity to 25,000.|$|E

25|$|In architecture, the Renaissance Revival {{style was}} used for another {{commercial}} building, 181–183 Main Street, around 1900. In 1905 the parish hall and cloister were added to Trinity, giving its distinctive U-shaped layout. The next year the <b>corner</b> <b>section</b> of the Barlow Block was remodeled by W.H. Rahman for use by a bank in a higher version of the style. It was refaced in stone, with Doric and Ionic pilasters, terra cotta detailing and full entablature leading up to a tile roof, meant to emulate St. Mark's Library in Venice.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the next decade, another longstanding building from the early years of Ossining, the Union Hotel at South Highland and Church Street, was demolished. A Romanesque Revival doctor's office building replaced it. In 1892 the <b>corner</b> <b>section</b> of the Barlow Block was separated internally {{from the rest of the}} building so it could serve as Ossining's post office, the first of two former locations for that facility within the district. The next year the village's electric trolley system was established, with its main line going down Croton Avenue from the then-undeveloped Ossining Heights area in the northeast corner of the village to Main Street, where a spur ran down to Sparta, and then continuing to the train station. Residents could more easily travel downtown, and Ossining Heights soon became the suburban residential area it is today.|$|E
500|$|Karl-Erik Hult {{managed the}} club to a cup title in 1973, before Bob Houghton {{replaced}} him in 1974. Malmö FF chairman Eric Persson was reportedly initially hesitant to employ Houghton, who at 27 was younger than several of the club's players, but was convinced when the Englishman met them and won their respect and confidence. Houghton had never met any of the players, but had researched them thoroughly; he impressed the team by immediately recognising each of them and knowing them by first name. Duly installed as coach, Houghton led Malmö FF to three league titles and four cup wins {{over the course of}} seven seasons, as well as the 1979 European Cup Final (which was lost to Nottingham Forest) and the 1979 Intercontinental Cup (in which Olimpia of Paraguay defeated Malmö FF 3–1 over two legs). Houghton left the club in 1980, but is held in high regard at {{the club to}} the present day; a <b>corner</b> <b>section</b> of the club's present stadium, Swedbank Stadion, is named [...] "Bob's Corner" [...] after him. Fellow Englishman Keith Blunt replaced Houghton, and remained for three seasons before Tord Grip took over. Grip managed Malmö FF to a cup title in 1984 before leaving the same year. Another Englishman, Roy Hodgson, managed the club between 1985 and 1990. Under his leadership, the club won five consecutive Allsvenskan titles, and also won the then-extant league championship play-offs on two occasions, in 1986 and 1988. The side also won cup titles in 1986 and 1989. Hodgson's tenure as Malmö FF manager is the most successful in terms of win percentage and Allsvenskan titles won. Like Houghton, Hodgson also has a section at Swedbank Stadion: [...] "Roy's Corner". [...] "Bob's Corner" [...] and [...] "Roy's Corner" [...] flank the stadium's standing section on each side.|$|E
