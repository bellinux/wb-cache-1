5|$|The Finnish Red Guards {{seized the}} early {{initiative}} in the war, {{taking control of}} Helsinki on 28 January, and with a general attack phase lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at <b>command</b> <b>level</b> and in the field, left them unable to capitalize on their initial momentum, {{and most of the}} offensives came to nothing. The military order chain functioned relatively well at Red company and platoon level, but leadership and authority were weak, as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troopers. The common troopers were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low.|$|E

25|$|The Twentieth Air Force, {{eventually}} operating 20 {{groups and}} 1,000 bombers, also adopted a tail identification system in 1945. The other six numbered air forces {{fighting in the}} Pacific War also used tail markings within the various air forces both as group and squadron identifiers. The patterns or themes varied; some were designated at the Air Force level, some at the <b>Command</b> <b>level</b> and others down at Group or squadron level. As in Europe, geometeric shapes and colors were used as were letters, numbers and variations based on the RCN or serial number {{last three or four}} digits. Some pre-war bands and stripes were reinstated.|$|E
25|$|Albert Rust was {{appointed}} Colonel, and the regiment {{was sent to}} Lynchburg, Virginia, for military training. While in Virginia, <b>command</b> <b>level</b> officers with formal military training {{were assigned to the}} regiment, to include West Point graduate Seth. M. Barton who was assigned as Lieutenant-Colonel, and with Virginia Military Institute graduate Thomas Middleton Semmes assigned as regimental adjutant. The regiment was then attached to General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, and deployed to the area of what would soon after become West Virginia. By mid-1862, the regiment was under the command of Van. Manning following Albert Rust's promotion to Brigadier-General, with William H. Tebbs being promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel.|$|E
25|$|The UAEAF's history {{starts in}} 1968, when the Abu Dhabi Army Air Force was formed under British rule. After {{becoming}} the ALRAMS Air Force in 1972, major investment assured an expansion {{in terms of}} capabilities, {{quality and quantity of}} aircraft. Training and instruction was provided by the Pakistan Air Force. Neighbour Emirate of Dubai maintained its own air component, the Dubai Defence Force Air Wing, until 1999, when the two were effectively merged to become what is now the United Arab Emirates Air Force. Although the integration of the two independent forces has been complete, a small degree of autonomy exists at the operational <b>command</b> <b>level,</b> with the Western Air Command being headquartered in Abu Dhabi and the Central Air Command in Dubai.|$|E

500|$|After {{attaining}} {{the rate}} of Master Chief Petty Officer, a service member may choose to further his or her career by becoming a Command Master Chief Petty Officer (CMDCM). A CMDCM {{is considered to be}} the senior-most enlisted service member within a command, and is the special assistant to the Commanding Officer in all matters pertaining to the health, welfare, job satisfaction, morale, utilization, advancement and training of the command's enlisted personnel. CMCs can be <b>Command</b> <b>level</b> (within a single unit, such as a ship or shore station), Fleet level (squadrons consisting of multiple operational units, headed by a flag officer or commodore), or Force level (consisting of a separate community within the Navy, such as Subsurface, Air, Reserves).|$|E
500|$|Patton {{was passed}} over {{to lead the}} {{invasion}} in northern Europe. In September, Bradley—-Patton's junior in both rank and experience—-was selected to command the First United States Army that was forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. According to Eisenhower, this decision had been made months before the slapping incidents became public knowledge, but Patton felt they were the reason he was denied the command. Eisenhower had already decided on Bradley because he felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a superb corps-level combat commander, Bradley possessed two of the traits that a theater-level strategic command required, and that Patton conspicuously lacked: a calm, reasoned demeanor, and a meticulously consistent nature. The slapping incidents had only further confirmed to Eisenhower that Patton lacked the ability to exercise discipline and self-control at such a <b>command</b> <b>level.</b> Still, Eisenhower re-emphasized his confidence in Patton's skill as a ground combat commander by recommending him for promotion to four-star general in a private letter to Marshall on 8 September, noting his previous combat exploits and admitting {{that he had a}} [...] "driving power" [...] that Bradley lacked.|$|E
500|$|On IJsselmonde the German forces {{prepared}} {{to cross the}} Maas in Rotterdam, which was defended by about eight Dutch battalions. Crossings would be attempted in two sectors. The main attack would {{take place in the}} centre of the city, with the German 9th Panzer Division advancing over the Willemsbrug. Then SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler would cross to operate on its immediate left and east of Rotterdam a battalion of the 16th Infantry Regiment of 22. Luftlandedivision would cross on boats. These auxiliary attacks might prevent a concentration of Dutch forces, blocking the 9th Panzer Division's advance through a densely built up urban area intersected by canals. In view of these conditions and the limited means available, there was a major emphasis on air support. Already on 13 May, von Küchler, fearing that the British might reinforce the Fortress Holland, had instructed Schmidt: [...] "Resistance in Rotterdam should be broken with all means, if necessary threaten with and carry out the annihilation [...] of the city". In this he was to be supported by the highest <b>command</b> <b>level</b> as Hitler would state in Führer-Weisung Nr. 11 (Führer-Directive N°11): [...] "On the northern wing the power of the Army of Holland to resist has proven stronger than had been assumed. Political as well as military grounds demand to quickly break this resistance. (...) Furthermore the speedy conquest of the Fortress Holland is to be facilitated through a deliberate weakening of the [...] power operated by Sixth Army". Kampfgeschwader 54, using Heinkel He 111 bombers, was therefore shifted from Sixth to Eighteenth Army.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, <b>command</b> <b>levels</b> for {{the field}} {{artillery}} batteries were increased by one grade over similar units. Platoons were commanded by a captain, and batteries by a major. Battalions continued to follow a lieutenant colonel while the command itself was led by a brigadier general and later a major general.|$|R
500|$|The {{battle for}} Khâm Đức and Ngok Tavak was {{considered}} a defeat for U.S. forces, described by one historian as [...] "a Khe Sanh in reverse." [...] Unlike the previous fight at Khe Sanh, the application of American airpower [...] "averted a massacre" [...] but could not prevent the North Vietnamese from dominating the high ground surrounding Khâm Đức. General Creighton Abrams described the loss at Khâm Đức as a [...] "minor disaster". U.S. decisions at Khâm Đức may have been influenced at a higher <b>command</b> <b>level</b> {{by the events of}} Battle of Khe Sanh in 1968, which were subjected to intense media comparison with the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, and the clash of operational thinking between General Westmoreland and the senior USMC generals. If there was any lesson to be learned for General Westmoreland and other U.S. commanders, the battle of Khâm Đức showed that [...] "air power was not a cure-all". The command and control system of the United States Air Force during the ordeal was imperfect, as demonstrated by the [...] "blunders involving the combat control teams." [...] A final, notable outcome of Khâm Đức was that it closed the last Special Forces CIDG camp in the I Corps Tactical Zone in close proximity to the border with Laos. This made ground surveillance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail much more difficult, allowing North Vietnam to move supplies and develop new branches of the trail. Despite setbacks, the evacuation of the Khâm Đức Special Forces Camp strongly highlighted the morale, discipline and the motivation of the U.S. Air Force personnel {{who took part in the}} operation. From the very first day of the struggle at Khâm Đức, it was clear that ground units were not prepared for an emergency evacuation, due to the lack of experience in terms of integrating the numbers and types of aircraft in such a small geographical area. U.S. aircrews had to improvise by establishing their own procedures, in order to extract both military and civilian personnel from the besieged Special Forces Camp. Despite having lost two C-130 aircraft, U.S. pilots were undeterred from completing their mission, indeed, their bravery was exemplified by Lieutenant Colonel Joe M. Jackson, who received a Medal of Honor for the rescue of the three-man Combat Control Team.|$|E
