500|$|Although forty-seven {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Gordon clinched his second pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 28.255. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kahne. Kurt Busch qualified third, Stewart took fourth, and Kyle Busch started fifth. Edwards qualified sixth, while Martin set the seventh fastest time. Biffle qualified eighth, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. ninth and Clint Bowyer tenth. The four drivers that failed to qualify were Tony Raines, Dave Blaney, Papis and Mike Bliss. Derrike Cope withdrew from the race prior to qualifying. After the qualifier Gordon said, [...] "Our efforts here have improved because we've really focused on it, They started with qualifying, and luckily last time they showed up in the race. ...

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in Australia on the Seven Network on 6 June 2002. Robin Oliver for The Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "Unlike {{any of the}} other seemingly compulsory Oz adventures to which British TV panders, this one presents a superior storyline while soaking up the views." [...] Oliver complimented the performances of Gary Sweet and Kimberley Joseph, and Ciaran Donnelly's direction. The Ages Debi Enker was critical, decrying the plot as [...] "fairly creaky" [...] and the locations as [...] "a very glossy ad for the sights of Sydney". She also thought Gary Sweet and James Nesbitt looked bored in their roles. In New Zealand, the episode was broadcast on TV ONE on 17 September 2002. The New Zealand Heralds reviewer Michele Hewitson was critical of the clichés in the script, particularly the stereotypical characterisation of Rod Ellison, who she described as [...] "a bit of a bastard". Hewitson was also critical of Karen's reaction to David's attempts to repair their relationship, and concluded by writing, [...] "God only knows why they had to drag the entire cast all the way to Australia. You <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> lot out of Manchester but they'll still be moaning, angst-ridden and selfish." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoxha {{delivered}} {{his speech to}} the Conference on November 16; he [...] "spoke of the tremendous Soviet pressures to which the Albanian party and government had been subjected after the Bucharest meeting... The only crime his régime had committed, the Albanian leader added, was {{that it did not}} agree that the Chinese communist party should be summarily and unjustly condemned. For this it had been treated in a manner that was shabby, anti-Marxist and uncomradely. Hoxha's speech had a shattering effect on the Moscow gathering." [...] Amongst other things Hoxha said that, according to Khrushchev, the Party of Labour and Albania itself [...] "should merely applaud and approve, but express no opinion of its own. But this is neither Marxist nor acceptable. Marxism-Leninism has granted us the right to have our say, and no one <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> from us, either by means of political and economic pressure, or by means of threats and names they might call us." [...] According to Alia, Khrushchev [...] "tried to appear calm" [...] when first replying, reading his written text [...] "almost mechanically" [...] in regards to China but as soon as he began to reply to Hoxha's speech [...] "he lost his head and began to shout, scream and splutter." [...] Khrushchev was said to have angrily remarked, [...] "Comrade Hoxha, you have poured a bucket of filth over me: {{you are going to have}} to wash it off again." [...] Jon Halliday states that, [...] "On this occasion Hoxha truly succeeded in putting himself and Albania on the world map. His denunciation of Khrushchev made headlines round the world and even his harshest critics usually concede that Hoxha turned in an able performance and showed personal courage." [...] In retirement Khrushchev later recalled the Conference and said that Hoxha [...] "bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves. After his speech, comrade Dolores Ibarruri, an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it." ...|$|E

[...] He remained in Steubenville through at least 1926. [...] While working as a minister, Cruikshank continued his interest in football and {{used it as a}} theme in his speeches and sermons. [...] At a 1923 banquet honoring Steubenville's undefeated 1922 football team, Cruikshank spoke of the importance athletics:"I am for athletics in the school. [...] They create a school consciousness, call it spirit if you will. When you leave school after playing on its football team you have something that will always hold your school career near and dear to you. ... Athletics embue the fellow who plays and the fans as well in a spirit that never says die. ... That's the thing that counts in life, the never give up spirit. [...] To my mind if we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> spirit out of high school with us it means more to us than our Latin or Greek.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, {{as far as my}} campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> Alliance to the next step and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E
