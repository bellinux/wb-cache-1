5|$|Marcus Lindblom is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} {{known for his}} English localization of the 1995 video game EarthBound. Lindblom spent his youth in the United States, and {{dropped out of college}} to move to Japan with his wife. After four years, he returned to college in the United States and began to work at Nintendo of America's <b>call</b> <b>center.</b> He eventually worked on Japanese-to-English game localization projects such as Wario's Woods and EarthBound. Lindblom worked with a translator and a writer to accurately translate the game for a Western audience. He sought to stay true to Shigesato Itoi's script, but was given latitude to make the script as weird as he wanted, and so added in American cultural allusions. Lindblom considers the localization his highest achievement.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus in}} this paper is on spatial {{diffusion}} patterns of <b>call</b> <b>centers</b> in The Netherlands. The number of <b>call</b> <b>centers</b> has increased rapidly {{in the last decade}} and it seems that impacts of <b>call</b> <b>centers</b> on the labor market still underestimated. We will pay attention to two spatial levels: first urban versus rural and second local. Given the labor intensity and quality required by <b>call</b> <b>centers</b> and the absence of physical contacts with consumers one might expect that most <b>call</b> <b>centers</b> are located in the more peripheral parts of the country. In those peripheral areas there is less pressure on the labor market and the level of education - in particular the ability to speak English - is almost as good as elsewhere in the country. At the local level we are interested in the precise location of the <b>call</b> <b>centers.</b> We expect that they will prefer back office locations or even locations on cheap industrial sites, again due to the absence of physical contacts with consumers. They only will need enough parking space for their employees, since this is a relatively labor intensive economic activity. In this inventory study we will analyze the spatial diffusion patterns of <b>call</b> <b>centers</b> in The Netherlands and link them to regional labor market developments and other location factors. ...|$|R

50|$|Virtual queuing is {{a concept}} used in inbound <b>call</b> <b>centers.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>centers</b> use an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) to {{distribute}} incoming calls to specific resources (agents) in the center.

From the caller’s perspective, without virtual queuing they have only two choices: wait until an agent resource becomes available, or abandon (hang up) and try again later. From the <b>call</b> <b>center’s</b> perspective, a long queue results in many abandoned calls, repeat attempts, and customer dissatisfaction.|$|R
40|$|The {{globalization}} of IT-enabled service activities has intensified {{in the late}} 1990 s {{as the result of}} advanced information technologies and falling costs of telecommunication. The number of <b>call</b> <b>centers</b> and employment rate have grown exponentially on a global level, both in Western and developing countries. Due to lower production costs in emerging economies, <b>call</b> <b>centers</b> are increasingly off-shored. Off-shoring implies distributed work across teams and intercultural communication between agents and customers who do not share the same cultural, temporal and spatial references.
