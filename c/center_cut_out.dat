50|$|A popular {{choice for}} a CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) {{software}} suite is MasterCAM. It is also used by Taylor Guitars. The CAM software takes the 3D model created in the CAD system and uses a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine (typically a vertical machining <b>center)</b> to <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> the 2D pieces from, in the example above, a sheet of aluminum. This process can eliminate waste as well as decrease machining time and machine down time. The pieces cut from the sheets of aluminum then are assembled by a worker using a TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welder.|$|R
50|$|For {{extraordinary}} achievement while piloting {{air mail}} plane No. 408H on April 21, 1933, during a night flight from Washington, D.C. to Detroit, Mich. At {{an altitude of}} 3200 feet and about half way to Pittsburgh, PA., with no warning whatsoever the left outboard engine of the tri-motored plane crashed from the ship. Pilot Carmichael adjusted the controls to return the plane to a level position {{and turned back to}} Washington. In breaking from the ship the left engine had pulled the outboard heater control open and effected the center engine altitude adjustment. The <b>center</b> engine <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> until the altitude control was discovered and readjusted. Realizing that he had about 100 miles to fly in returning to Washington, the pilot climbed to an altitude of 4500 feet in order not to overheat the remaining two engines on the plane. A survey of the damage was made from the cockpit window {{with the aid of a}} flashlight, from which it was determined that the landing gear had been damaged. The pilot, therefore, decided that a landing should be made at Bolling Field, which is larger than the Washington Airport, and would be more advantageous for the one-wheel type of landing which would have to be made with damaged landing gear. He also desired to avail himself of the trained Army personnel and their emergency equipment, including ambulances and fire trucks. The pilot made all arrangements for landing by radio communication and received the fullest cooperation from the Bolling Field authorities. A one-wheel landing was made with little additional damage to the ship and no injury to passengers and mail.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the rate of screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> in elderly patients treated with the dynamic hip screw and the relationship to the Tip Apex Distance (TAD).

The incidence of screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> was assessed and correlation of risk of <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> with the TAD was assessed. The rate of screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> was 9. 0 % and the average length of time to screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> was 3. 8 months (range, 1 to 6 months) post-operatively.

25|$|The {{origin of}} the use of these <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post Conquest invention, after the Spanish {{destroyed}} all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of <b>cut</b> <b>outs.</b> Today, some <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. <b>Cut</b> <b>outs</b> made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual.

2500|$|While the Nahua {{paintings}} {{remain the}} most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> of gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s. The Otomi still sell <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types of paper. These <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> include depictions of various gods, especially those related to beans, coffee, corn, pineapples, tomatoes and rain. However, these <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are not 100% authentic, with exact replicas still reserved to shamans for ritual purposes. Innovation has included the development of books, and <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> of suns, flowers, birds, abstract designs from traditional beadwork and even Valentine hearts with painted flowers. Most <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are made of one type of paper, then glued onto a contrasting background. Their sizes range from miniatures in booklets to sizes large enough to frame and hang like a painting. [...] The production and sale of these paper products have brought tourism to San Pablito, mostly from Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico City, but some come from the far {{north and south of}} Mexico and even from abroad.|$|R
