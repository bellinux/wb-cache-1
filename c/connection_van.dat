40|$|In recent decades, {{the field}} of applied {{linguistics}} has witnessed a growth {{of interest in the}} study of multilingualism. A particular subset of studies in multilingualism is that of heritage languages (Montrul, 2010). A heritage language (HL) can be broadly defined as an ancestral language with which one feels a cultural <b>connection</b> (<b>Van</b> Deusen-Scholl, 2003), or more narrowly defined as a home language that a person is exposed to in early childhood before becoming socialized into the host country’s dominant language (Valdés, 2001). The present discussion suggests a direction for future research for HLs. First, the various approaches through which HLs have been studied will be mentioned. Next, Cenoz and Gorter’s (2011) Focus on Multilingualism (FOM) approach will be presented and discussed in relation to its potential contributions to the study HLs...|$|E

40|$|Research {{shows that}} 61 % of {{adolescents}} reported {{at least one}} experience of relational aggression within the last month, and many experienced repeated instances (Sullivan, Farrell, & Kliewer, 2006). Due to added stressors from their sport and team dynamics, female adolescent athletes may be {{at greater risk for}} such experiences than non-athletes. Increasing awareness among school-based professionals and developing strategies to help these students deal with relational aggression may be helpful in reducing the prevalence of this problem. Studies have shown that school-based programs targeting relational aggression have been successful in fostering a positive school climate and healthy <b>connections</b> (<b>Van</b> Schoiack-Edstrom, Frey, & Beland, 2002). School-based professionals, especially school counselors, are in an excellent position to help establish an effective system with which to deal with these behaviors in all groups, including athletic teams. This research paper reviews the existing literature on relational 111 aggression, gender, and adjustment implications. In addition, this review examines how relational aggression may affect female adolescent athletes.

30|$|Congenitally {{corrected}} TGA {{is characterized}} by discordant atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculo-arterial <b>connections</b> (<b>Van</b> Praagh 1970). Surgical approaches for ccTGA include physiological or anatomical repair. In patients undergoing the physiological procedure, the morphologic RV continues to support the systemic circulation, with disappointing late results. DSO involves an anatomical repair, wherein the LV {{is connected to the}} aorta with an arterial switch or a Rastelli procedure, and the AV concordance is established through an atrial switch procedure (Imai 1997). Although DSO remains a challenging procedure, DSO was often applied as much as possible to the patients with ccTGA to get better long-term outcomes (Shin’oka et al. 2007). The atrial switch procedure, which contains complex incisional suture lines, might promote atrial flutter and intra-atrial macroreentrant tachycardia. Due to the Rastelli procedure involving right ventriculotomy and VSD patch closure, this case developed arrhythmogenic substrates of VT. This necessitated understanding the precise anatomy of this patient, the type of ablation catheter to use and the approach to reach the target sites. The superior approach via the jugular veins is useful for mapping of the ventricles with complex anatomies. Nevertheless, manual manipulation of the ablation catheter may be difficult even by skillful and experienced hands. Magnetic robotic navigation is an alternative maneuver for complex CHD.

40|$|Colipase (Mr 10 kDa) confers {{catalytic}} activity to pancreatic lipase under physiological conditions (high bile salt concentrations). Previously determined 3 -A-resolution X-ray structures of lipase-colipase complexes have shown that, {{in the absence}} of substrate, colipase binds to the noncatalytic C-terminal domain of pancreatic lipase (van Tilbeurgh H, Sarda L, Verger R, Cambillau C, 1992, Nature 359 : 159 - 162; van Tilbeurgh et al., 1993 a, Nature 362 : 814 - 820). Upon lipid binding, conformational changes at the active site of pancreatic lipase bring a surface loop (the lid) in contact with colipase, creating a second binding site for this cofactor. Covalent inhibition of the pancreatic lipase by a phosphonate inhibitor yields better diffracting crystals of the lipase-colipase complex. From the 2. 4 -A-resolution structure of this complex, we give an accurate description of the colipase. It confirms the previous proposed disulfide <b>connections</b> (<b>van</b> Tilbeurgh H, Sarda L, Verger R, Cambillau C, 1992, Nature 359 : 159 - 162; van Tilbeurgh et al., 1993 a, Nature 362 : 814 - 820) that were in disagreement with the biochemical assignment (Chaillan C, Kerfelec B, Foglizzo E, Chapus C, 1992, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 184 : 206 - 211). Colipase lacks well-defined secondary structure elements. This small protein seems to be stabilized mainly by an extended network of five disulfide bridges that runs throughout the flatly shaped molecule, reticulating its four finger-like loops. The colipase surface can be divided into a rather hydrophilic part, interacting with lipase, and a more hydrophobic part, formed by the tips of the fingers. The interaction between colipase and the C-terminal domain of lipase is stabilized by eight hydrogen bonds and about 80 van der Waals contacts. Upon opening of the lid, three more hydrogen bonds and about 28 van der Waals contacts are added, explaining the higher apparent affinity {{in the presence of a}} lipid/water interface. The tips of the fingers are very mobile and constitute the lipid interaction surface. Two detergent molecules that interact with colipase were observed in the crystal, covering part of the hydrophobic surface...|$|R
40|$|We {{present some}} new results and {{concepts}} which {{have emerged from}} the rigorous application of the integral equation methods of liquid state physics {{to the problem of}} inhomogeneous ionic fluids in the vicinity of charged surfaces. The report summarizes our recent results for surface interactions in mono- and divalent electrolytes obtained using the anisotropic Hypemetted Chain approximation. Compared to the Poisson-Boltzmann mean-field theory the major differences are an attractive contribution to the surface interaction due to ion-ion correlations and a repulsion from the ionic cores. The attraction is particularly strong in divalent electrolytes, where the double-layer repulsion is dramatically weakened or turned into an attraction. Some consequences of this pressure contribution and its <b>connection</b> to <b>Van</b> der Waals interactions are pointed out. The size of the ions affects the pressure predominantly at short surface separations, and then to a substantial extent for large ion radii or at high surface charge...|$|R

50|$|The {{prosecution}} and the defence both made appeals against the sentence.

The prosecution argued that the court had not taken account of the political nature of the murder, and asked again for life imprisonment. The defence argued that the sentence didn't take account of the harsh conditions under which Van der Graaf had been held, nor the damage that had been done by unsubstantiated allegations that had appeared in the media (such as the <b>connection</b> with <b>Van</b> der Werken), and requested a reduction in sentence to 16 years.

50|$|Hoogendijk {{was born}} in Krimpen aan den IJssel and studied law at Leiden University before {{entering}} the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam. In the years 1890-1899 he built up an enormous collection of paintings, financed with the fortune he inherited from his father. The collection {{could be seen in}} his mansion on the Bezuidenhoutseweg in The Hague where he lived with his sisters. His family became alarmed and had him committed to Veldwijk asylum in Ermelo, where he later died. He is known as a major collector of modern art, including many paintings by Cézanne and Van Gogh. It is probably his <b>connections</b> to <b>Van</b> Gogh that caused him to be sent to the sanatorium in Ermelo, as that is also where Van Gogh's sister Wilhelmina was sent. In 1906 the Vereeniging tot Christelijke Verzorging van Geestes- en Zenuwzieken opened a new cemetery on the Horsterweg, where burials took place from 1908-1973. The most famous was Wilhelmina van Gogh, who was committed 4 December 1902 and thus must have met and known Hoogendijk there.
