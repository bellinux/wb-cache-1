40|$|<b>Crude</b> <b>lecithin,</b> {{a mixture}} of mainly phospholipids, {{potentially}} helps to increase the systemic availability of dietary omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFA), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Nevertheless, no clear data exist {{on the effects of}} prolonged combined dietary supplementation of DHA and lecithin on RBC and plasma PUFA levels. In the current experiments, levels of DHA and choline, two dietary ingredients that enhance neuronal membrane formation and function, were determined in plasma and red blood cells (RBC) from rats after dietary supplementation of DHA-containing oils with and without concomitant dietary supplementation of <b>crude</b> <b>lecithin</b> for 2 â€“ 3 weeks. The aim was to provide experimental evidence for the hypothesized additive effects of dietary lecithin (not containing any DHA) on top of dietary DHA on PUFA levels in plasma and RBC. Dietary supplementation of DHA-containing oils, either as vegetable algae oil or as fish oil, increased DHA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and total n- 3 PUFA, and decreased total omega- 6 PUFA levels in plasma and RBC, while dietary lecithin supplementation alone did not affect these levels. However, combined dietary supplementation of DHA and lecithin increased the changes induced by DHA supplementation alone. Animals receiving a lecithin-containing diet also had a higher plasma free choline concentration as compared to controls. In conclusion, dietary DHA-containing oils and <b>crude</b> <b>lecithin</b> have synergistic effects on increasing plasma and RBC n- 3 PUFA levels, including DHA and EPA. By increasing the systemic availability of dietary DHA, dietary lecithin may increase the efficacy of DHA supplementation when their intake is combined. Nutricia Researc...|$|R
40|$|Gas anti-solvent {{crystallization}} (GASC) {{has been}} utilized for refining of <b>crude</b> <b>lecithin</b> (L) from its solution in hexane (H) with dense carbon dioxide as the anti-solvent, leaving behind its {{oil in the}} solution. The performance of {{the process has been}} evaluated in terms of the lecithin content and its recovery in the final solid product. The effects of various process parameters have been analyzed at temperatures in the range of 283 - 313 K, pressures in the range of 15 - 80 bar, initial oil in <b>crude</b> <b>lecithin</b> in the range of 20 - 60 wt. % and hexane in the feed solution in the range of 80 - 95 wt. %. The crystallization of lecithin is facilitated by a drastic reduction of its solubility in hexane solution due to CO(2) dissolution which varied in the range of 40 - 75 wt. % CO(2) at temperatures in the range of 283 - 313 K. However, any phase separation of oil was avoided which occurred with more than 63 wt. % CO(2) in the solution. The highest value of selectivity of lecithin (defined as the ratio of the wt. % ratios of lecithin and oil in the product to that in the feed solution) was observed at 298 K and 65 bar for a complete (100 %) recovery lecithin, and the selectivity decreased on lowering the temperature to 283 K. At any temperature, crystallization of lecithin occurred over a range of pressure or a range of CO(2) dissolution, allowing different combinations of enrichment and recovery of lecithin from the feed solution. The highest enrichment in the product was 98. 6 wt. % lecithin with 78 % recovery and this could be obtained at 298 K and 58 bar, starting from the <b>crude</b> <b>lecithin</b> feed having 60 wt. % oil. For a lower initial oil content, even a lower pressure was required to obtain a final solid product having the same lecithin content. Also, the lecithin content in the final product increased with an increase in the hexane-to-feed ratio, as oil remained miscible in the excess hexane. (C) 200...|$|R
40|$|Although dietary {{phospholipids}} (PL) {{and particularly}} phosphatidylcholine (PC) {{have been found}} to enhance growth and survival in penaeid shrimp, precise requirements have yet to be established.

Fulton and Spooner (1956) reported that the phospholipid fraction of blood serum supported the respiration of Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae.

Semipurified soybean lecithin (3 %) allowed the highest overall recovery of virus from all sediments tested; <b>crude</b> soybean <b>lecithin</b> produced the lowest recovery. A difference in the percentage of virus able to be recovered from a sediment was related to the percentage of clay in the sample.

Microfiche. ix, 113 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmStimulatory {{effect of}} phospholipids, lecithin and cephalin on sexual reproduction of Phytophthora cactorum was increased by purification with column chromatography or {{thin layer chromatography}} (TLC). Gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry analysis (MS) failed to detect sterols in the highly purified phospholipid samples. Trace amount of cholesterol added to the cephalin did not significantly changed the amount of oospores produced. Therefore, confirming the previous reports that sterols are not essential to sexual reproduction in pythiaceous fungi. Purification and identification of oospore stimulatory compounds from com oil and <b>crude</b> soybean <b>lecithin</b> were carried out by saponification, Florisil column chromatography, TLC, digitonin precipitation, high performance liquid chromatography and GC-MS analysis. Phytol, one of the compound identified from com oil, stimulated sexual reproduction of P. cactorum and P. parasitica. The minimum concentrations of phytol stimulatory to sexual reproduction of P. cactorum and P. parasitica were 0. 002 ppm. Lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids, and geraniol and squalene induced oospore formation of P. cactorum following purification on TLC. Purified palmitoleic acid was stimulatory to oospore formation of P. cactorum and P. parasitica. Retinol and its esters were also stimulatory to sexual reproduction of P. cactorum and P. parasitica. Nutrient deprivation or growth limitation induced sexual reproduction of P. cactorum cultured on basal medium. The fungus grown in solid or liquid basal medium formed oospores after being transferred to water agarose. Mycelial age, concentration of the basal medium and size of petri plate affected the number of oospores produced by P. cactorum. The non-saponifiables extracted from mycelia of P. cactorum cultured in liquid basal medium stimulated oospore formation of P. cactorum and P. parasitica, while the saponifiables were stimulatory to P. cactorum only. Over all results showed that many compounds commonly found in plants and fungi are stimulatory to sexual reproduction in pythiaceous fungi. The contention that this group of fungi has an absolute requirement of exogenous sterols is, therefore, refuted...|$|R
40|$|Pigment gallstones contain {{considerable}} {{amounts of}} unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) {{in the form}} of calcium bilirubinate and/or bilirubin polymers. Since more than 98 % of bile pigments are excreted as conjugates of bilirubin, the source of this UCB needs to be identified. By using a rapid h. p. l. c. method, we compared the non-enzymic hydrolysis of bilirubin monoglucuronide (BMG) and bilirubin diglucuronide (BDG) to UCB in model bile and in native guinea-pig bile. Model biles containing 50 microM solutions of pure BMG and BDG were individually incubated in 25 mM-sodium taurocholate (NaTC) and 0. 4 M-imidazole/ 5 mM-ascorbate buffer (TC-BUF) at 37 degrees C. Over an 8 h period, BMG hydrolysis produced 4 - 6 times more UCB than BDG hydrolysis. At pH 7. 4, 25 % of the BMG was converted into UCB, whereas only 4. 5 % of BDG was converted into UCB. Hydrolysis rates for both BMG and BDG followed the pH order 7. 8 greater than 7. 6 approximately equal to 7. 4 greater than 7. 1 Incubation with Ca 2 + (6. 2 mM) at pH 7. 4 in TC-BUF resulted in precipitated bile pigment which, at 100 X magnification, appeared similar to precipitates seen in the bile of patients with pigment gallstones. At pH 7. 4, <b>lecithin</b> (<b>crude</b> phosphatidylcholine) (4. 2 mM) was a potent inhibitor of hydrolysis of BMG and BDG. The addition of a concentration of cholesterol equimolar with that of lecithin eliminated this inhibitory effect. Guinea-pig gallbladder bile incubated with glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone (an inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase) underwent hydrolysis similar to the model bile systems. The non-enzymic hydrolysis of bile pigments, especially BMG, may be an important mechanism of bile-pigment precipitation and, ultimately, of gallstone formation...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is {{a deadly}} {{infectious}} microbial disease {{that is currently}} dominating public health concerns. Among the pharmacological issues {{in the management of}} TB are the poor bioavailability of some anti-TB drugs, mostly due to the fast first-pass metabolism, and high drug load needed for combination therapy. These result in a lengthy treatment with several adverse effects causing decreased patient compliance. These factors often lead to the therapeutic failure and promote the development of drug resistant strains, justifying the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. Liposomes are lipid-based particulate vehicles known to be the most clinically appointed drug carriers currently. Liposomal systems are reported to be rapidly engulfed by macrophages - where the mycobacterium often resides. This makes liposomes appropriate vehicles for targeted anti-TB drug delivery. Many research groups have reported the potential of liposomes systems to deliver anti-TB drugs. However, the costly formulation status of liposomes, due the use of expensive synthetic or highly purified natural phospholipids, is a limitation to the treatment of a poverty related infectious disease like TB. The aim {{of this study was to}} design and develop liposomes for pulmonary delivery of anti-TB drugs using <b>crude</b> soybean <b>lecithin</b> (CL) and its purirified version. CL is an FDA- approved naturally occurring phospholipid mixture that is quite cheap and readily available. Various liposome batches were prepared using a film hydration method and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Liposomes composed of CL and cholesterol (Chol) in a 3 : 1 mass ratio were selected for drug encapsulation based on the following characteristics: polydispersity index (PDI, 0. 28), mean particles sizes (PS, 502 nm) and zeta potential (ZP, - 56 mV). Isoniazid (INH) was encapsulated as a model drug using a freeze-thaw loading technique and an HPLC method was validated for quantitative analysis. The physicochemical properties of INH-loaded liposomes were comprehensively investigated using thermal, microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. This formulation showed a high encapsulation efficiency (%EE) of 78 %, much better than the liposomes made from purified lecithin, 20 %. Other characteristics of INH- loaded liposomes, which make them attractive for pulmonary TB therapy, are presented in this dissertation. These include a controlled release of 50 % of the encapsulated INH over 12 hours. Finally, rifampicin (RIF) was added as a hydrophobic model drug and several evaluations were conducted on these dual drug-loaded liposomes. Of particular interest, it was noted that the dual drug-loaded liposomes made of CL alone showed the highest %EE (59 % for INH and 90 % for RIF) compared to those containing Chol or those made of purified lecithin. Surprisingly, the average PS of the dual CL-based liposomes (1114 nm) was in the size range reported for optimum deep lung deposition and macrophage uptake. In addition, the mean ZP of these liposomes (- 63 mV) seems to be favourable for their shelf stability and internalization by macrophages. Overall, these findings show that the dual CL-based liposomes developed would be promising for macrophage-targeting pulmonary delivery of anti-TB drugs...|$|R

30|$|An {{example for}} complex {{biological}} raw materials are vegetable oils, such as soy bean oil (SBO). It was shown that SBO {{leads to an}} increase in fungal biomass growth and a 50 % increase in antibiotics production (Goldschmidt and Koffler 1950; Pan et al. 1959). Although the reasons for this positive effect are still obscure, possible explanations are: (i) SBO serves as nutritional source, (ii) SBO changes the medium for improved oxygen transfer, and (iii) the antifoam capacity of the oil reduces microbial cell damage (Goldschmidt and Koffler 1950; Jones and Porter 1998). Two critical factors for SBO supplementation are known, namely (i) the time point of addition and (ii) the dosage (Anderson et al. 1956; Ohta et al. 1995). It has been shown that low-level supplementation of SBO is beneficial, whereas medium to high-level supplementation is disadvantageous. To shed more light on that, the effect of crude and refined SBO was tested, however no significant differences in the production of tetracycline were found (Jones and Porter 1998). Although crude SBO is about 1 / 5 cheaper than refined oil and contains phospholipids, some minerals and tocopherols, it may also contain pesticides, which is why refined SBO is mostly used as medium supplement today. However, several studies have shown the positive impact of phospholipids in crude SBO on fungal growth and productivity (Bateman and Jenkins 1997; Goldschmidt and Koffler 1950; Tarafdar and Claassen 1988). We hypothesize that lecithin, which we define as phosphatidylcholines, is the kMA in SBO causing this positive impact. To investigate this hypothesis, we isolated lecithin from SBO, added defined amounts thereof to the media for a Penicillium chrysogenum strain and analyzed the effects on fungal growth. For the extraction of lecithin from oily matrices several solid phase extraction (SPE) methods have been reported (Bateman and Jenkins 1997; Bligh and Dyer 1959; Carelli et al. 1997; Nash and Frankel 1986; Ruiz-Gutierrez and Perez-Camino 2000). However, SPE is quite tedious and time consuming and delivers the wanted lecithin in an organic solvent, which is commonly not suitable for media supplementation. Hence, we adopted a simple and cheap extraction procedure, which is currently applied in industrial refinery processes (Dijkstra and Van Opstal 1989), delivering lecithin in an aqueous background. Additionally, we present a semi-quantitative HPLC-CAD method for <b>crude</b> SBO and <b>lecithin</b> analysis, which allows dosage of the extracted lecithin without the need of mass spectrometry analysis. The effect of crude SBO and extracted lecithin on fungal growth was evaluated in shake flask experiments with P. chrysogenum. Summarizing, in this study we demonstrate that lecithin is in fact the kMA in SBO affecting fungal growth and consequently productivity.|$|R
