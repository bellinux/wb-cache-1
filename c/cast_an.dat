5|$|The {{following}} year, the Box Office Attractions {{name was}} replaced with the newly incorporated Fox Film Corporation. Edwards remained one of the studio's most important directors and one of William Fox's closest advisers. He became known for his epic filmmaking and for a permissive approach to directing his starring <b>cast,</b> <b>an</b> attitude that led Bara's biographer to compare him to Alfred Hitchcock. Often, that cast included Bara, whose films with him include Under Two Flags (1916), the epic historical drama Cleopatra (1917), and A Woman There Was (1919).|$|E

5|$|At a diner called Winkie's, a man {{tells his}} {{companion}} about a nightmare {{in which he}} dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing {{the man with the}} nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he <b>cast</b> <b>an</b> unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.|$|E
5|$|Shah Rukh Khan was {{the first}} actor to be {{approached}} with the script and {{was the first}} lead actor to be signed for the film. Rohit Shetty stated that despite the title, Khan would not play a South Indian in the film. The casting of the lead heroine was the subject of much press speculation; Kareena Kapoor, Asin and Deepika Padukone were rumoured to be involved. Shetty denied those rumours, stating that the cast would be finalised in April 2012, and {{that he was going to}} <b>cast</b> <b>an</b> established actress in the role. In October 2012, it was confirmed that Deepika Padukone had been signed to play the female lead opposite Khan, and photographs showing Padukone and Khan shooting were released. This was Padukone's second film opposite Khan, with whom she made her Bollywood debut in the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om. Starting with this film, which was released on Women's Day, Khan wished to have the name of his female co-star appear above his own in the credits.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as James Bond, but he declined. At the same time United Artists approached both Batman actor Adam West and Burt Reynolds. Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by an Englishman and turned the offer down. Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover, John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington. United Artists was still pushing to <b>cast</b> <b>an</b> American to play Bond but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained {{on the top of}} the list in the event that Moore would decline to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately cast. He tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.|$|E

However, broadcast executives were resistant to <b>cast</b> <b>an</b> American as a Canadian icon. Schuyler Grant ended up playing Anne’s best friend, Diana, and Anne Shirley was ultimately played by Megan Follows.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a {{columnist}} for The Advocate, criticized the series for having never <b>cast</b> <b>an</b> Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that Asian women have been cast on the show because heterosexual men have been socialized by the media {{to think of them}} as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian men have been largely invisible in popular media.

This technique is known as a periodizing transformation.|$|E

It was claimed that actors from Australia’s long-running soaps, Neighbours or Home and Away, were being considered.

25|$|Stephen Tobolowsky {{was tapped}} {{to play the}} Tool Time co-host, Glen.

Therefore, the producers set out to <b>cast</b> <b>an</b> alternate character that would stand in as Tim's co-host for the pilot, or for however many episodes were required until Tobolowsky was available. The casting department auditioned Richard Karn, for what would be his first major appearance on a TV sitcom; the character of Al Borland was created from there. After the first few episodes completed with Patricia Richardson as Jill, Tobolowsky was still tied up with his other commitments, and Karn found himself in his role permanently when Tobolowsky decided he would have no time to do a series. Thus, the character of Glen never came into being.|$|E
25|$|Disfavored by {{the brief}} union of Angevin Poland and Hungary (the latter {{was still the}} country's overlord), Bogdan's {{successor}} Lațcu accepted conversion to Roman Catholicism around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences. Despite remaining officially Eastern Orthodox and culturally connected with the Byzantine Empire after 1382, princes of the House of Bogdan-Mușat entered a conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchy over control of appointments to the newly founded Moldavian Metropolitan seat; Patriarch Antony IV even <b>cast</b> <b>an</b> anathema over Moldavia after Roman I expelled his appointee back to Byzantium. The crisis was finally settled {{in favor of the}} Moldavian princes under Alexander I. Nevertheless, religious policy remained complex: while conversions to faiths other than Orthodox were discouraged (and forbidden for princes), Moldavia included sizable Roman Catholic communities (Germans and Magyars), as well as non-Chalcedonic Armenians; after 1460, the country welcomed Hussite refugees (founders of Ciuburciu and, probably, Huși).|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} regeneration or renewal {{was that the}} Doctor's body would rebuild itself in a younger, healthier form. The Second Doctor {{was intended to be}} a literally younger version of the First; biological time would turn back, and several hundred years would get taken off the Doctor's age, rejuvenating him. In practice, however, since the Doctor stated his age in the Second Doctor serial The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), his age has been recorded progressively (see below). In six out of ten transitions, the new actor was younger than his predecessor had been when he began the role. In the revived programme, the pattern is resumed with the transition of the Ninth to the Tenth and the Tenth to the Eleventh Doctor, although Steven Moffat is on record stating the intention was to <b>cast</b> <b>an</b> actor in his mid-30s to 40s for the role of the Eleventh Doctor, despite casting Matt Smith, who is the youngest actor to ever have played the role.|$|E
