5|$|Cacti {{may also}} be planted {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water <b>conservation</b> <b>in</b> arid regions {{has led to the}} promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping). For example, in California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E

The {{theoretical}} part is focused on description of problems of <b>conservation</b> farming <b>in</b> third world countries, agro-ecological conditions in Zambia and characteristics of the agrarian sector. The practical part uses SWOT analysis to assess the potential of <b>conservation</b> farming <b>in</b> Zambia. The final assessment is discussed with four case studies of benefits and risks. Based on the theoretical and practical parts of this thesis, the implementation of <b>conservation</b> farming <b>in</b> Zambia is considered a success {{and it is a}} better alternative to current prevailing conventional agriculture. <b>Conservation</b> farming <b>in</b> Zambia contributes to regional, or sustainable development...|$|R

5|$|As Secretary, Jewell {{approved}} {{the first phase}} of the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP).

At the signing ceremony, held September 16, 2016, at the Santa Rosa & San Jacinto Mountains National Monument Visitor Center, Secretary Jewell stated phase one was intended to streamline approval for solar, wind, and geothermal projects. The DRECP also aimed to preserve 4.2million acres of land. Conservation groups viewed the initiative more favorably than did wind and solar developers, who criticized the DRECP for removing some public land designated for development.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association {{was founded}} to promote <b>conservation</b> <b>in</b> the region. One of the association's initial {{concerns}} was the acidification of streams, which they originally attributed to tannic acid {{from the trees}} used by the beavers to construct their dams. With the assistance of Pennsylvania's Department of Forests and Waters, Game Commission, and Fish and Boat Commission, they dynamited 79 dams. Afterward, they discovered the water was acidic upstream of the dams too, and eventually realized that the problem was caused by acid rain, not the beavers. The association has operated several stations to reduce the acidity of Mosquito Creek and its tributaries, with technical assistance from the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).|$|E

URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed re-routing the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage <b>conservation</b> <b>in</b> general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran counter to the spirit of the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster civic participation and active citizenry.|$|E
5|$|One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish Seabird Centre, {{near the}} {{important}} bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock, Fidra {{and the surrounding}} islands. The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, puffins, skuas and other seabirds. The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face {{and how we can}} protect them, and has helped to significantly raise the profile of seabird <b>conservation</b> <b>in</b> the UK. Seabird tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation.
