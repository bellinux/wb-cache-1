2500|$|As well {{as being}} {{painstakingly}} restored by enthusiasts to accurate wartime specification, the M20 has also been developed by specialists for speed trials. A 1938 BSA M20 ridden by Bill Jenkins from Dallas achieved {{a top speed of}} 108mph at Bonneville Salt Flats making it the fastest M20 for this venue in the world. The original side-valve engine was extensively modified and fuelled with nitrous oxide. [...] The intake port fed by the carburetor, originally horizontal, was re-drilled at a steep angle into the cylinder casting so it pointed up at the underside of the intake valve. The motorcycle did however retain the long BSA prop stand that hinged under the seat and clipped to the rear mudguard when not in use [...] so it looked like a stock M20. [...] In October 1995 an M20 fitted with a BSA Gold Star [...] <b>crankshaft</b> <b>sprocket</b> and running on a 95% methanol / 5% acetone mix ridden by Pat Jeal achieved a terminal speed of 112mph at the disused airfield of RAF Elvington, Yorkshire.|$|E
50|$|The DOHC {{cylinder}} head had 16 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminium. The camshafts were held in the {{cylinder head}} with bearing caps and driven by a chain off the front <b>crankshaft</b> <b>sprocket.</b> Motion from the camshafts was transmitted to the 16 valves by direct-acting hydraulic lifters.|$|E
50|$|The SOHC (LK0/L24) {{cylinder}} head had 8 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminum. The camshaft was located {{in the center of}} the {{cylinder head}} and driven by a chain off the front <b>crankshaft</b> <b>sprocket.</b> Motion from the camshaft was transmitted to the eight valves by the hydraulic lifters and rocker arms.|$|E
50|$|The cam lobes act {{directly}} on bucket type tappets, which are adjusted {{by means of}} shims between {{the underside of the}} bucket and the top of the valves. Two duplex chains drive the camshafts, one from the <b>crankshaft</b> to a <b>sprocket</b> {{at the level of the}} combustion chambers, and one from the sprocket to each camshaft. The original sprung slipper design of the lower cam chain tensioner proved to be too weak and after a couple of years was changed to an improved hydraulic design, using engine oil pressure.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1973 {{a team of}} Matra {{engineers}} led by Georges Pinardaud {{completed the}} initial design for project M560, {{which was to be}} a more powerful Bagheera. A key part of the project was the creation of a unique [...] "U engine" [...] out of two existing Simca straight-4 engines. The blocks came from two different Simca applications and rotated in opposite directions but shared the same 1294 cc displacement. One block was from the 1100Ti and was adapted to transverse mounting while the other was from the Simca 1000 Rallye II in which it had been mounted longitudinally. The two blocks were joined at an 82Â° angle using a common cast-aluminum sump that also carried a common oil supply for the engine. At the non-drive end another aluminum casting assured the alignment of the blocks while at the drive end a steel adapter fit the ends of both <b>crankshafts.</b> A <b>sprocket</b> and Morse chain from each crankshaft were connected to a 0.9 in shaft running {{down the middle of the}} sump that transmitted power from the left-hand crank to the right. Each block retained its own crankshaft, distributor, and water pump. The clutch and bell-housing of the engine from the Rallye II engine provided the transaxle mounting while a flywheel was only mounted to the 1100Ti crankshaft. The resulting [...] 8-cylinder assembly was fitted with four Weber 36 DCNF carburetors and, with a 9.8:1 compression ratio, produced [...] @ 6200 rpm and 216 Nm @ 4000 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines often use a timing chain {{to drive the}} camshaft(s). This is {{an area in which}} chain drives frequently compete directly with timing belt drive systems, particularly when the engine has one or more overhead camshafts, and provides an excellent example of some of the differences and similarities between the two approaches. For this application, chains last longer, but are often harder to replace, as they must be enclosed in a space into which lubricating oil can be introduced. Being heavier, the chain robs more power, but is also less likely to fail. The camshaft of a four stroke engine rotates at half crankshaft speed, so the camshaft sprocket has twice as many teeth as the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>sprocket.</b> Less common alternatives to timing chain drives include spur gears or bevel gears combined with a shaft.|$|E
