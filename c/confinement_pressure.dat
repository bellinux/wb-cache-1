In the available studies on Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) columns, axial compressive strength of the columns is expressed as functions of unconfined concrete compressive strength and the lateral <b>confinement</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this study, available experimental investigation results of the axial compressive strength of SFRC square columns have been compiled. This study also proposes axial compressive strength models of the SFRC square columns using artificial neural network (ANN). In the proposed models, axial compressive strength of SFRC columns has been expressed as functions of unconfined concrete compressive strength (fc 2 ̆ 7), <b>confinement</b> <b>pressure</b> due to lateral reinforcement (fle) and <b>confinement</b> <b>pressure</b> due to the action of steel fibres (flb).

Increase in the volumetric ratio of a specific grade of steel directly translates into a proportional increase in the <b>confinement</b> <b>pressure.</b> Therefore, both strength and ductility of confined concrete are increased. According to Table  3, it is obvious that displacement ductility increases by increasing volumetric ratio of confinement steel. However, some cases do not obey this rule; these exceptions occurred due to change in other parameters. Therefore, confinement steel was studied further along with transverse reinforcement spacing, concrete compression strength, and strength of confinement reinforcement, which is discussed in the following section.|$|E

The triaxial compression Kolsky bar differs from a traditional Kolsky bar by having two pressure chambers, one enclosing the specimen and the other enclosing {{the end of the}} transmission bar, so that a specimen may be pre-stressed axially and radially before a dynamic axial load is applied. The result is a modified Kolsky bar capable of measuring axial deformation and axial stresses of a specimen at various strain rates under a range of <b>confinement</b> <b>pressures.</b> Borosilicate glass was subjected to triaxial <b>confinement</b> <b>pressures</b> of 25 MPa, 50 MPa, and 100 MPa at a strain rate around 1500 s- 1, and soda-lime glass was subjected to triaxial <b>confinement</b> <b>pressures</b> of 25 MPa, 50 MPa, and 75 MPa at a strain rate of around 1100 s- 1. These results were compared to unconfined experiments at similar strain rates, as well as unconfined experiments on a servo-hydraulic machine at a strain rate of 0. 001 s- 1. It was concluded that glass under compression is not sensitive to strain rate, and glass confined triaxially has a higher strength than unconfined glass.

The recently released Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (M-E PDG) and the associated „AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design” software of the United States considers permanent deformations in all the rut- susceptible layers (asphalt concrete and unbound granular material layers) on the overall cumulative rutting in the pavement.

An asphalt concrete mixture, Bituminous Concrete (Grade- 1) confirming to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) specifications was cast at three air voids contents of 7, 4 and 2 %. The dynamic moduli of these samples were determined at 5, 15, 20, 40 and 55 °C for frequencies ranging from 0. 01 to 25 Hz at 0 and 200 kPa <b>confinement</b> <b>pressure.</b> In addition, the dynamic modulus values of Dense Bituminous Macadam (Grade 2) mix at these temperature and frequencies for an air voids content of 4 % were determined in the unconfined condition.
