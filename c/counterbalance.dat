5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic <b>counterbalance</b> and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a <b>counterbalance</b> against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective <b>counterbalance</b> to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{identified}} several domestic {{factors that may}} influence a country?s level of structural coup-proofing, i. e., <b>counterbalancing</b> strategies that shall prevent internal groups from seizing power via a coup d?�tat. We suggest that a country?s level of <b>counterbalancing</b> is also affected by such policies in what we term countries? ?peer groups. ? When deciding the appropriate level of <b>counterbalancing,</b> rulers may be affected by external information flows from a ?peer group? with similar structural coup-risk characteristics (institutions) or a similar coup-risk experience (coup history). Using maximum likelihood spatial lag models and data in 1976 ? 2005, we find that leaders learn from and emulate <b>counterbalancing</b> in other states, but rather only through an ?experiential peer group. ...|$|R

5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to <b>counterbalance</b> its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E
5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a <b>counterbalance</b> to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue in}} this paper that negating and <b>counterbalancing</b> should be {{recognised}} as two fundamental categories of corrective action. First, I show that recognising the distinction helps to avoid confusion when asking normative questions about the justification of imposing corrective duties. Second, I argue that we have moral reasons {{to care about the}} difference between negating and <b>counterbalancing</b> detrimental states, and this has implications for permissible action. I then outline some ways in which the discussion helps us explain and justify specific legal remedies in private law, and I conclude by noting some exceptions to the normative priority of negating over <b>counterbalancing...</b>|$|R

5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a <b>counterbalance</b> to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the meeting, {{confidential}} negotiations took place between Britain and Russia in April and May 1878. The Russians were willing to make changes to the big Bulgaria, but were determined to retain their new possessions, Bessarabia in Europe and Batum and Kars {{on the east coast}} of the Black Sea. To <b>counterbalance</b> this, Britain required a possession in the Eastern Mediterranean where it might base ships and troops, and negotiated with the Ottomans for the cession of Cyprus. Once this was secretly agreed, Disraeli was prepared to allow Russia's territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to <b>counterbalance</b> the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E

5|$|As {{requested}} by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, {{which was designed to}} <b>counterbalance</b> the Austro-Spanish Treaty of Vienna and protect British trade.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, the Japanese had {{suffered}} a string of defeats {{for nearly two years}} in the South West Pacific, the Marianas campaign, and the Philippines campaign. In July 1944, following the loss of Saipan, General Hideki Tōjō was replaced as prime minister by General Kuniaki Koiso, who declared that the Philippines would be the site of the decisive battle. After the Japanese loss of the Philippines, Koiso in turn was replaced by Admiral Kantarō Suzuki. The Allies captured the nearby islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa {{in the first half of}} 1945. Okinawa was to be a staging area for Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. Following Germany's defeat, the Soviet Union began quietly redeploying its battle-hardened European forces to the Far East, in addition to about forty divisions that had been stationed there since 1941, as a <b>counterbalance</b> to the million-strong Kwantung Army.|$|E
5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could <b>counterbalance</b> society with independence of thought, but admitted {{that he did not}} know how to facilitate this.|$|E

5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to <b>counterbalance</b> the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a <b>counterbalance</b> for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, while Metternich {{was still}} at Laibach with Tsar Alexander, the revolt of Alexander Ypsilantis {{threatened}} to bring the Ottoman Empire {{to the brink of}} collapse. Wanting a strong Ottoman Empire to <b>counterbalance</b> Russia, Metternich opposed all forms of Greek nationalism. Before Alexander returned to Russia, Metternich secured his agreement not to act unilaterally and would write to the Tsar again and again asking him not to intervene. For extra support he met with Viscount Castlereagh (now also Marquis of Londonderry) and King George IV of the United Kingdom in Hanover in October. The warmness of Metternich's welcome was sweetened by his promise to settle in part Austria's financial debts to Britain. The earlier Anglo-Austrian entente was thus restored, and the pair agreed that they would support the Austrian position concerning the Balkans. Metternich went away happy, not least because he had met Dorothea Lieven once more.|$|E

5|$|In the Peace of Westphalia, Frederick William was {{compensated}} for Western Pomerania with the secularized bishoprics of Halberstadt and Minden {{and the right}} of succession to the likewise secularized Archbishopric of Magdeburg. With Halberstadt, Brandenburg-Prussia also gained several smaller territories: the Lordship of Derenburg, the County of Regenstein, the Lordship of Klettenberg and the Lordship of Lohra. This was primarily due to French efforts to <b>counterbalance</b> the power of the Habsburg emperor by strengthening the Hohenzollern, and while Frederick William valued these territories lower than Western Pomerania, they became step-stones {{for the creation of a}} closed, dominant realm in Germany in the long run.|$|E
5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version.

To <b>counterbalance</b> other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game.
