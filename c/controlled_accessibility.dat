40|$|Software {{development}} for small, real-time and resource constrained, embedded systems {{is becoming increasingly}} complex. Multi-threading and object- orientation are examples of complicating factors. Even though automated memory management has shown significant advantages, it is commonly considered to be too costly and unpredictable for real-time systems. Timber is a programming language that is based upon a reactive, deadline- driven, concurrent, and object-oriented programming model. It is furthermore based on a functional programming paradigm. In this thesis we put forward a generic garbage collector for the run-time system of Timber. It is based upon a copying collector scheme and it especially makes use {{of the distinction between}} mutable and immutable data (induced by the language semantics), as well as the <b>controlled</b> <b>accessibility</b> of mutable data. Our collector is transparent, which means that it never preempts the application, and furthermore is incremental with extremely fine granularity. Minimal synchronization is needed between the application and the collector. Allocation takes an extremely small and constant amount of time (incrementing a pointer). Due to the reactive environment along with deadline-driven scheduling it will never compete for execution time with the application. Sufficient collector progress must thus be guaranteed by static analysis, and we address issues concerning this by briefly discussing memory usage behavior attributes (as a starting point for future work).

40|$|AbstractMolecular traffic {{between the}} {{cytoplasm}} and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Hundreds, if not thousands, of molecules interact with and transit through each NPC every second. The pore is {{blocked by a}} permeability barrier, which consists {{of a network of}} intrinsically unfolded polypeptides containing thousands of phenylalanine–glycine (FG) repeat motifs. This FG-network rejects larger molecules and admits smaller molecules or cargos bound to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). For a cargo transport complex, minimally consisting of a cargo molecule plus an NTR, access to the permeability barrier is provided by interactions between the NTR and the FG repeat motifs. Numerous models have been postulated to explain the <b>controlled</b> <b>accessibility</b> and the transport characteristics of the FG-network, but the amorphous, flexible nature of this structure has hindered characterization. A relatively recent development is the ability to monitor the real-time movement of single molecules through individual NPCs via single molecule fluorescence (SMF) microscopy. A major advantage of this approach is that {{it can be used to}} continuously monitor a series of specific molecular interactions in an active pore with millisecond time resolution, which therefore allows one to distinguish between kinetic and thermodynamic control. Novel insights and prospects for the future are outlined in this review.

Five cases, including the author 2 ̆ 7 s experience as a product manager for computer security software, and reviews of the theoretical and general business literatures, are used to establish this argument. The analytical approach to the cases relies heavily on Schon 2 ̆ 7 s concept of experimentation-in-action by the 2 ̆ 2 reflective practitioner. 2 ̆ 2 ^ The socio-technical systems approach and various comparable learning theories suggest themselves as a superior analytical framework for the information security problem. The utility of these approaches as solutions to the information security problem is limited, however, by the fundamental fact that security problems may not provide the feedback that is necessary to the learning process that comprises comparison of actual to expected results, detection of deviations, and correction of errors. Since security errors may, and often do, go undetected, they do not provide the reliable feedback required for learning. ^ A program of education and other measures is proposed to address the information security problem. Sample policies and programs, such as how to create 2 ̆ 2 feedback, 2 ̆ 2 are detailed. Also discussed is the issue of how to integrate security education and related measures into existing programs. ^ Desirable information security products or features that could be provided by PC hardware and software firms are also described. ^ The thesis concludes with a discussion of why information security will remain a concern for both the organization and for society at large. ...|$|E

The integration of leprosy care with locally available primary health care services is therefore a common feature of leprosy control programmes. Within these guidelines, a National Leprosy Control Programme was established in Nepal in 1975, with intensive case-finding surveys {{and the provision of}} leprosy care in government basic health posts. A study of one district, Lamjung, in West Nepal suggests that far from being a deterrent, distance afforded welcome anonymity for leprosy cases anxious to disguise their diagnosis and thereby avoid the social ostracism which could result. Cases from ethnic groups in which the stigma of leprosy was high travelled farther for treatment. Gender differences in distance travelled suggest that women's mobility was restricted, but the local availability of care did not increase attendance for regular treatment.

40|$|NFATc (a {{member of}} the family of nuclear factors of {{activated}} T cells) is a transcriptional factor responsible for the Ca 2 +-inducible activation of cytokine genes during the immune response. In resting T cells, NFATc is retained in the cytoplasm by a mechanism that depends on multiple phosphorylations in an N-terminal regulatory domain. Physical interaction with and dephosphorylation by Ca 2 +-activated calcineurin (Cn) allows the protein to enter the nucleus, where it binds to specific sites in cytokine gene promoters. Previous studies had identified a peptide segment in NFATc that binds Cn stably. Here we report the identification of a second Cn-binding element in NFATc, which synergizes with the previously identified element. Although these sequences are conserved in all isoforms of NFAT, we find that the two sites contribute differentially to the overall affinity for Cn in an isoform-dependent manner. The regulatory domain of NFAT also was found to be entirely devoid of structure, both in the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated state. This finding suggests that the NFAT regulatory domain does not undergo phosphorylation-induced conformational switching, but instead requires partner proteins to <b>control</b> <b>accessibility</b> of the NFAT nuclear localization and nuclear export signals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFörster {{resonance}} energy transfer {{was used to}} monitor the dynamic conformations of mononucleosomes under different chromatin folding conditions to elucidate {{the role of the}} flexible N-terminal regions of H 3 and H 4 histones. The H 3 tail was shown to partake in intranucleosomal interactions by restricting the DNA breathing motion and compacting the nucleosome. The H 3 tail effects were mostly independent of the ionic strength and valency of the ions. The H 4 tail was shown to not greatly affect the nucleosome conformation, but did slightly influence the relative population of the preferred conformation. The role of the H 4 tail varied depending on the valency and ionic strength, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a primary role in H 4 tail interactions. Interestingly, despite the H 4 tail’s lack of influence, when H 3 and H 4 tails were simultaneously clipped, a more dramatic effect was seen than when only H 3 or H 4 tails were clipped. The combinatorial effect of H 3 and H 4 tail truncation suggests a potential mechanism by which various combinations of histone tail modifications can be used to <b>control</b> <b>accessibility</b> of DNA-binding proteins to nucleosomal DNA...|$|R

40|$|Induction of cell {{autonomous}} apoptosis following oncogene-induced overproliferation {{is a major}} tumor-suppressive {{mechanism in}} vertebrates. However the detailed mechanism mediating this process remains enigmatic. In this study we demonstrate that dMyc-induced cell-autonomous apoptosis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster relies on an intergenic sequence termed the IRER (Irradiation Responsive Enhancer Region). The IRER mediates expression of surrounding pro-apoptotic genes, and we use an in vivo reporter of the IRER chromatin state to gather evidence that epigenetic <b>control</b> of DNA <b>accessibility</b> within the IRER is an important determinant {{of the strength of}} this response to excess dMyc. In prior work we showed that the IRER also mediates P 53 -dependent induction of pro-apoptotic genes following DNA damage, and the chromatin conformation within IRER is regulated by Polycomb group-mediated histone modifications. dMyc-induced apoptosis and the P 53 -mediated DNA damage response thus overlap in a requirement for the IRER.

The interactions {{of the different}} RAMPs with this class B GPCR yield high-affinity calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or adrenomedullin (AM) receptors. However, the mechanism for this is unclear. Experimental Approach Guided by receptor models, we mutated residues in the N-terminal helix of CLR, RAMP 2 and RAMP 3 hypothesized {{to be involved in}} peptide interactions. These were assayed for cAMP production with AM, AM 2 and CGRP together with their cell surface expression. Binding studies were also conducted for selected mutants. Key Results An important domain for peptide interactions on CLR from I 32 to I 52 was defined. Although I 41 was universally important for binding and receptor function, the role of other residues depended on both ligand and RAMP. Peptide binding to CLR/RAMP 3 involved a more restricted range of residues than that to CLR/RAMP 1 or CLR/RAMP 2. E 101 of RAMP 2 had a major role in AM interactions, and F 111 /W 84 of RAMP 2 / 3 was important with each peptide. Conclusions and Implications RAMP-dependent effects of CLR mutations suggest that the different RAMPs <b>control</b> <b>accessibility</b> of peptides to binding residues situated on the CLR N-terminus.

The evolutionarily conserved family of Groucho/Transducin-Like Enhancer of split (Gro/TLE) proteins act as co-repressors for numerous transcription factors. Gro/TLE proteins act in several key pathways during development (including Notch and Wnt signaling), and are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human cancers. Gro/TLE proteins form oligomers {{and it has been}} proposed that their ability to exert long-range repression on target genes involves oligomerization over broad regions of chromatin. However, analysis of an endogenous gro mutation in Drosophila revealed that oligomerization of Gro is not always obligatory for repression in vivo. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to profile Gro recruitment in two Drosophila cell lines. We find that Gro predominantly binds at discrete peaks (, 1 kilobase). We also demonstrate that blocking Gro oligomerization does not reduce peak width as would be expected if Gro oligomerization induced spreading along the chromatin from the site of recruitment. Gro recruitment is enriched in ‘‘active’’ chromatin containing developmentally regulated genes. However, Gro binding is associated with local regions containing hypoacetylated histones H 3 and H 4, which is indicative of chromatin that is not fully open for efficient transcription.

However, little is known on control mechanism of Vg region by the IL- 7 R. To elucidate the regulation by STAT 5, we first analyzed the chromatin status of Vg region in primary thymocytes. The levels of histone H 3 acetylation are high at Vg 5, HsA element and Vg 2 in Rag 2 2 / 2 thymocytes but low in IL- 7 R a-chain (IL- 7 Ra) -deficient early thymocytes, suggesting that IL- 7 R signaling <b>controls</b> the <b>accessibility</b> of the Vg region. In addition, high levels of histone H 3 acetylation and germ line transcription were induced at Vg 5 and HsA by cytokine and STAT 5 in cytokine-dependent Ba/F 3 and other hematopoietic cell lines. Importantly, the chromatin accessibility of Vg 5 gene is increased by cytokine signal. Furthermore, STAT 5 was not recruited to a non-canonical STAT-binding motif in the endogenous chromatin of the Vg 5 promoter by cytokine stimulation, while STAT 5 binds to a consensus motif in the HsA element. In accordance with this result, STAT 5 does not directly activate the Vg 5 promoter by reporter assay. These results suggested that while STAT 5 directly binds to Hs...|$|R
