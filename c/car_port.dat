50|$|There were {{innovations}} in home {{design and construction}} during this period. Houses generally became bigger. New materials such as vinyl siding became common and often replaced more expensive brick for home exteriors. The <b>car</b> <b>port</b> and garage became widespread features and the latter was often located close to the curb, creating a rather crowded streetscape. The home dishwasher and the microwave oven were introduced. Large-screen televisions usually of the cathode ray or projection type were found in many homes. The Sony Walkman, introduced in 1979, quickly gained popularity {{as a means for}} listening to music on the go. There were {{innovations in}} the field of domestic cuisine including the introduction of microwave popcorn. In 1981, the development of the susceptor bag (a paper bag impregnated with an aluminum-coated polyester film), allowed popcorn therein to be popped in a microwave oven without scorching.|$|E

Many locations throughout the park were updated with energy efficient LED lighting, most notably {{the train station}}. At the end of the 2013 season, the Flying Puppies and Tour De Paris were closed. On select night's throughout October, Adventureland was host to an exclusive fundraising event, called Nightmare on the Midway. The haunted Halloween event featured four haunted attractions, live actors and multiple scare zones. At the beginning of the 2014 season, two new attractions were opened: NYC race and the Teacups, both made by SBF.
