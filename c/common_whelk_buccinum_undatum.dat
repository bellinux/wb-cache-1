50|$|Leptasterias polaris {{is a major}} {{predator}} in {{the cold}} waters in which it lives. Young individuals are mostly found on rocks less than 10 m deep and feed on such bivalve molluscs as the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and Hiatella arctica. Older individuals move to deeper waters where the seabed is sand or mud and feed on clams such as the Greenland cockle (Serripes groenlandicus), Spisula polynyma, the blunt gaper (Mya truncata) and the Atlantic jackknife clam (Ensis directus) which they dig up with their tube feet. They also eat gastropod molluscs such as the <b>common</b> <b>whelk</b> (<b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum)</b> and the American pelicanfoot (Arrhoges occidentalis). In a laboratory study {{it was found that}} the starfish detected their prey by odours in the water. Hungry starfish which had not fed for two months, worked their way across the current until their olfactory tube feet, located near the tips of their arms, smelt an edible prey item after which they begin to travel up-current towards the source of the odour. Moving upstream in this way had the advantage that the prey was less likely to detect the approach of the starfish. Well fed starfish wandered in a more random fashion.|$|E

Some whelks had survived being dredged several times. The very consistent size-shape relationship made it likely the whelks were all from a single habitat, probably in the fast tidal flows typical of the oyster-beds just north of the island. The whelks were harvested along with oysters: the whelks' shells were encrusted in a similar way to the oysters in the same midden, and the whelks even bore sub-adult oysters (spat), despite these being potential prey for whelks. This may be the first time whelks have been shown to have been harvested along with oysters and also seems the first direct evidence for a bottom-fishery for whelks...|$|E
40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>whelk</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum</b> is an {{abundant}} predatory and scavenging gastropod that is widely distributed {{on both sides}} of the North Atlantic, from Canada to New Jersey in North America and from Svalbard to France in Europe. The species range extends to 708 N along the western shores of Greenland and fossil shells (late Pliocene formation of Kap København) have been found as far north as 828300 N (Global Biodiversity Information Facility, 2013). It occurs on various substrates in coastal areas from low tide level to 200 m and sometimes deeper, but shows a preference for waters of about 20 – 30 m depth (Weetman et al., 2006; Włodarska-Kowalczuk, 2007; Heude-Berthelin et al., 2011). The biology of this important commercial species has been relatively well studied throughout its range, and includes studies of the seasonality of reproduction.

IgE-binding components were identified by means of SDS-PAGE and IgE-immunoblotting. The effects of digestive enzymes were evaluated in both raw and thermally treated extracts. SPT to common whelk was positive (≥ 2 +) in 83 (4. 9 %) patients studied. Twenty-four (38. 7 %) out of 62 SPT positive patients had high serum specific IgE to common whelk. ELISA inhibition test showed significant inhibitions by abalone as well as by common whelk. IgE-immunoblotting demonstrated three IgE-binding components (40, 71, 82 kDa), which were digested by simulated intestinal fluid and moderately digested by simulated gastric fluid, and the digestibility of allergens remained unchanged after thermal treatment.

50|$|Although Calliactis parasitica will {{occasionally}} {{attach to}} stones or empty shells, it is typically {{found on a}} gastropod shell inhabited by a hermit crab, and several individuals may live on the same shell.

While its reproductive cycle has been well documented, past observations on the encapsulated development in this species do not match our observations and nurse egg partitioning within a capsule has not previously been discussed. Here, using laboratory reared B. undatum egg masses from the south coast of England, intracapsular development at 6 °C is described including nurse egg partitioning, timing of nurse egg consumption and intracapsular size differences through development.

30|$|Monitoring {{bioaccumulation}} {{can also}} support risk assessment of various natural or anthropogenic {{events such as}} floods or dredging activities. For the maintenance of waterways, dredging of sediments may be necessary. As an example, the amount of sediments had increased to an unacceptable level in the Hamburg Port in 2004. In consequence, 6.5  Mio.[*]m 3 of sediments were dredged from the lower Elbe river in the Hamburg Port area and disposed 25  km north-west of the island Scharhörn in the inner German Bight between 2005 and 2010. To assess the potential ecological impacts on the marine environment, a comprehensive monitoring program has been established [43]. Among many other parameters, bioaccumulation of metals and organic chemicals has been measured in two benthic invertebrates (mussels (white furrow shell, Abra alba) and snails (<b>common</b> <b>whelk,</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum))</b> and fish (dab, Limanda limanda) sampled {{in and around the}} disposal site as well as in reference sites. These species were selected since they are abundant in the monitoring area and they represent different trophic levels. Since 2008, significantly increased levels of the organotin compounds monobutyltin (MBT) and dibutyltin (DBT) were detected in snails from the disposal site hinting at an increased bioavailability of contaminants due to the sediment disposals. Indeed, bioaccumulation decreased again after cessation of the disposals in 2010 : concentrations of the DDT metabolites p,p′-DDD and p,p′-DDE that had increased in snails sampled at the disposal site attained the same level as in reference sites in 2011. Sediment disposals had, in contrast to snails, no clear effect on concentrations of chemicals in fish and mussels. This shows that the selection of monitoring species can influence the outcome of monitoring studies.|$|E

The <b>common</b> <b>whelk</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum</b> is a commercially important North Atlantic shallow-water gastropod. Development is intracapsular in this species, with individuals hatching as crawling juveniles. While its reproductive cycle has been well documented, further work is necessary to provide a complete description of encapsulated development. Here, using B. undatum egg masses from the south coast of England intracapsular development at 6 °C is described. Number of eggs, veligers and juveniles per capsule are compared, and nurse egg partitioning, timing of nurse egg consumption and intracapsular size differences through development are discussed. Total development took between 133 and 140 days, over which 7 ontogenetic stages were identified. The number of both eggs and veligers {{were significantly related to}} capsule volume, with approximately 1 % of eggs developing per capsule. Each early veliger consumed nurse eggs rapidly over just 3 – 7 days. Within each capsule, initial development was asynchronous, but it became synchronous during the veliger stage.

50|$|M. {{modiolus}} {{is found}} growing on hard substrates including shells and stones and the byssus threads of other mussels. Survival rates of young individuals are low {{but by the}} time they reach about 4 cm long, at an age of 4 years, individuals are too large and tough to be predated upon by starfish such as Asterias rubens, the <b>whelk</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum</b> and crabs. Juveniles growing on byssus threads are more likely to survive than free living individuals and this results in the formation of cold-water reefs of mussels. These mostly occur in locations with fairly strong currents. The species is tolerant of low levels of oxygen and of a diminished quantity of the phytoplankton on which they feed. The boring sponge Cliona celata sometimes damages the shells of older individuals.|$|R

40|$|Background: The organotin {{compound}} tributyltin (TBT), {{used as an}} antifouling agent in ship hull paint, is known to cause imposex in several species of marine gastropods. Imposex is the imposition of male sexual characteristics on females, {{and can lead to}} female sterility. The <b>common</b> <b>whelk,</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum,</b> is a common species in Norway and has received attention for its export potential. Because B. undatum varies geographically in reproduction and morphology it is important to study the species before exploiting the populations. No work has been done to assess imposex in the common whelk in Norway, and {{little is known about the}} species in Norway altogether. Methods: Buccinum undatum was caught at Berg and Balsnes in Balsfjord, Troms county, Northern Norway, for comparative studies of imposex and morphology. Shell length and male penis length were measured, and females were checked for imposex. Age was read by counting striae on the backside of the operculum. Sediment samples were taken at each location for analysis of TBT contents, and snails with and without imposex were also analyzed for TBT. Results: There was a significant difference in shell length between Berg and Balsnes. The whelks at Berg seemed to be longer than at Balsnes. There were no differences in incidence of imposex between the localities, nor between length groups within each locality. There seemed to be an increase in percentage of imposex with increasing age at Balsnes. No female whelks had imposex severe enough to cause sterility. TBT consentration was below detection limit in the sediments at both locations, while it was detected at low concentrations in females both with and without imposex. Conclusions: Buccinum undatum display morphological differences between close localities. TBT contamination at Berg and Balsnes is low and has low impacts on the whelk populations with respect to imposex. Imposex has no impact on reproductive abilities of the common whelk at Berg and Balsnes...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{a series of}} {{experiments}} on the development and occurrence of imposex in the <b>common</b> <b>whelk,</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum,</b> {{under the influence of}} (chronic) exposure to butyltin compounds. The main objective of the experiments was to obtain more information about the effects of organotin compounds in the marine environment, which possibly relate to the reported decline of B. undatum in Dutch coastal waters. In these studies tributyltin (TBT) dose-dependently induced the development of male sexual organs in juvenile whelks. A TBT concentration > 7 ng Sn/l induced imposex in juvenile whelks. Growth in TBT-exposed juvenile whelks was significantly reduced compared to the reference group at a nominal TBT dose ≥ 4 ng Sn/l in one of the exposure studies. After 5 years in the laboratory, egg-laying was only observed in reference aquaria. Thus, TBT might impair whelk reproduction through growth reduction. The results showed a sensitivity towards imposex development in different life-stages. Juveniles were the most sensitive, adolescent females also responded, but adult females did not respond to TBT exposure, although they dose-dependently increased their organotin (OT) body-burden when exposed. Environmental TBT during only the in ovo stage, did not result in an increased masculinisation compared to non-exposed developing whelks. Histological studies showed no sterilisation due to mechanical blockage of the (adult) female genital opening by sperm-duct tissue. Gonadal development in 2 -year old juveniles was not observed. This implies that the differentiation of a penis and a vas deferens, which already occurred in the first few months after hatching, was not controlled by gonadal factors. No other sexual characteristics than those already visible with the eye were found. TBT inactivated CYP 450 to its inactive form CYP 420 in in vitro exposure studies with microsomal fractions of whelks. The studies have shown TBT to disrupt sexual development dose dependently in juvenile common whelks. TBT also dose dependently exerts an effect on enzymatic (CYP 450) processes. Although no mechanical sterilisation was observed, reproduction might be impaired through growth reduction. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Common</b> <b>whelk,</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum</b> (L.) is a {{conspicuous}} benthic scavenger in Irish waters, {{and is a}} valuable fisheries resource in South East Ireland. B. undatum is fished {{in many parts of}} its range, and previous studies have shown that certain life history parameters, which vary with location, make this species vulnerable to overexploitation. This makes research into each exploited stock essential to ensure sustainable fisheries management of the species. In 2003, interest in B. undatum as a complementary species in the inshore fishery east of the Inishowen Peninsula, North West Ireland, initiated investigation into fisheries related biological and population aspects of the species in this region. The current study presents estimates of spatial variation and density of the stock, size at age and growth rates, size and age at onset of sexual maturity, and timing of reproductive events in the region of the North West Irish whelk fishery for the period of June 2003 to May 2004. Analysis of variance of the total shell length of whelk landings to the fishery was conducted over spatial scales of fishing pot, fishing string and landings to vessels. Landings varied significantly in shell length at the spatial scale at which whelks are attracted to baited pots, but did not vary significantly over larger spatial scales. Depletion estimates of stock density from fisheries derived Catch per Unit Effort data and a mark re-capture experiment estimate 0. 134 - 0. 227 whelks per m 2. Two independent methods of age determination found similar growth logistics functions for B. undatum. Modal analysis of length frequency distribution of landings to the fishery estimated symptotic length, Leo = 151. 64 mm and Brody growth coefficient, K = 0. 04. Analysis of the striae in individual opercula, where each stria was found to represent annual growth, estimated Loo = 137. 73 mm and K = 0. 12. Common whelks in the region of the North West Irish whelk fishery grow slowly and are long-lived, with 19 opercula striae recorded in one individual. Onset of sexual maturity is late, and no sex-specific differences in size or age at maturity were determined in the present study. Males were found to achieve sexual maturity at 83. 30 ± 10. 77 mm, and 8. 9 - 11. 1 years of age, and females at 82. 62 ± 10. 68 mm and 8. 8 to 11. 1 years of age. Systematic observations of reproductive events, including histological changes to the female ovary and male testis, and changes in the size and mass of body components, suggest that breeding occurred between the autumn and winter months of October and December 2003. Biological aspects of B. undatum in the study region are compared with previous studies from other regions, and discussed in relation to sustainable management of the fishery...|$|E

The toxicity of 5 extracts, prepared and submitted to chemical analysis at the RIKILT, was tested in a mouse-bioassay according tot the official method of the Associated of Official Analytical Chemists. In one of the extracts toxicity was noticed, corresponding to ca. 35 - 40 mug saxitoxin- equivalents per 100 g shellfish meat. The other extracts tested in the mouse-bioassay were not lethal. The day after the toxicity experiment it became known that the suspected lot of shellfish contained "red" whelks (Neptunea antiqua) in addition to whelks. Red whelks naturally contain the poisonous substance tetramine. Consumption of these red whelks might have caused the observed intoxications. A second toxicity-experiment with mice was carried out, directed towards differences in symptoms caused by saxitoxin (one of the PSP) and the positive extract. The results of the latter experiment strengthened the assumption that tetramine rather then PSP had caused the shellfish poisoning...|$|R

The responses to acetylcholine {{were found to be}} partly dependent upon intracellular calcium. Responses to the peptides phenylalanine-methionine-arginine-phenylalanine-NH 2 and phenylalanine-leucine-arginine-phenylalanine-NH 2 were much more resistant to calcium-free conditions and appeared to engage the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism by mobilizing stored intracellular calcium. Sucrose-gap studies of radular retractor muscles showed that the organic calcium “antagonist” nifedipine enhanced potassium-induced depolarization responses, initiating spike-like action potentials and associated fast twitch activity. The inorganic calcium antagonist gadolinium exerted concentration-dependent inhibitory actions on these muscles. Basal tonus and fast twitch activity in response to potassium-induced depolarization were eliminated as were the spike-like action potentials of the membrane electrical response. The inorganic calcium “antagonist” cadmium greatly enhanced potassium-induced contractures in all four muscles, and on its own it induced tonic force and fast twitches in all the muscles. It seems likely that cadmium may have displaced stored intracellular calcium to induce myofilament activation. While these molluscan smooth muscles appear to possess calcium channels with fast and slow characteristics, their behaviour and pharmacological manipulation is very different from their more well known mammalian transient and long-lasting channel counterparts...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{sea urchin}} Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis predation on egg {{masses of the}} <b>whelk</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum.</b> The urchin actively grazes on the egg masses, even as they are being deposited on the bottom. Whelks preferentially lay their egg masses on vertical areas where urchin densities are 4 -fold less than on flat areas. This strategy is advantageous, as experimental trials showed that the loss in the mass of capsules was 4 fewer on walls than on flat areas. Nevertheless, {{a high proportion of}} egg masses on walls show damage from predation. Urchins provided with egg masses in the laboratory, ingested the capsules at a steady rate over a 9 -d period (5 urchins ingested 2. 8 g. d- 1). Urchins provided agar discs that included a preferred alga and whelk capsule walls ingested the discs at a rate that was half that observed for discs that only included the alga. Discs that included the preferred alga and capsule contents were eaten {{at the same rate as}} discs that only included the alga. Thus, capsule walls, but not the capsule contents, provide a defence against urchin predation. Laying aggregate egg masses likely provides only a limited advantage, as the attachment surface does not increase with the number of egg masses deposited together, so the risk of detachment increases. Consideration of the interactions between urchins and whelks is important in managing the fisheries of the two species.

Here, we validate an annual periodicity of growth ring formation in B. undatum statoliths that provides an alternative, reliable and accurate method for determining a whelk’s age. Laboratory-reared juvenile B. undatum of known provenance and age deposited a hatching ring at the time of emergence from their egg capsule and a clearly defined growth ring during February of their first and second years. Stable oxygen isotope profiles from the shells of 2 adult whelks confirmed annual growth ring deposition by demonstrating seasonal cycles of δ 18 O in the shell that matched the relative position and number of visible growth rings in the statolith. Validation of annually resolved statolith growth rings will, for the first time, provide fisheries scientists with a tool to determine the age structure of B. undatum populations and allow analytical stock assessments that will enable informed decisions for future management practices of whelk fisheries...|$|R

40|$|The <b>whelk,</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum,</b> is {{a commercially}} {{important}} shellfish species {{found throughout the}} North Atlantic. Many problems face fisheries scientists attempting to assess and monitor populations of this species, due to several life history traits such as highly variable growth rates and sizes at maturity both between and within populations. One major problem has been {{the lack of a}} reliable ageing tool, limiting the ability of scientists to develop accurate population age structure estimates for stock assessments. This thesis focuses on three major areas of research: the reproductive assessment, growth and age of <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum</b> collected from three geographically distinct populations from the Shetlands, North Wales and the Jersey Islands. Reprodictive assessments of several B. undatum populations across the UK were undertaken by utilising several previously published maturity estimation techniques to ascertain the most accurate and reliable methods. It was found that size (total shell length) at maturity was highly variable, even over relatively small geographical distances. The timing of the reproductive cycle was assessed in a whelk population from the Menai Strait (North Wales, UK) to investigate changes in maturity assessments over an annual seasonal cycle. It was discovered that size at maturity varied throughout an annual cycle, suggesting an optimal season for maturity assessments. Spatial variations in shell morphology between populations highlighted clear differences driven by the shape of the aperture and the angle of the shell apex. The crystalline structure of B. undatum shells was also investigated for the first time; using a combination of analytical techniques a multi-layered aragonite shell structure was uncovered. The shells of B. undatum were also assessed for their potential as environmental recorders. The oxygen isotope ratio contained within B. undatum shells was found to be a reliable proxy for seawater temperature, allowing the development of a species-specific palaeotemperature equation that will greatly aid future studies of this species where seawater temperature reconstructions are required. Population growth rates were also assessed, using the isotope data, uncovering clear differences in patterns of shell growth between populations. A novel age determination technique for B. undatum was developed that utilised growth rings present in in a pair of calcium carbonate statoliths contained within the foot matrix of each whelk. An annual periodicity of the growth rings was determined by measuring growth in monthly samples of statoliths removed from laboratory reared juvenile whelks of known provenance and age. Cutting edge analytical techniques were also used to assess the structure and seasonal variations in the chemical composition of the statoliths. Following this, the use of statolith growth rings for fisheries monitoring purposes was assessed and compared to the currently used age determination method, operculum growth rings. Using data on size at age, population growth curves were constructed for a range of whelk populations across the U. K. It was confirmed that counting the annual rings in statoliths providea a more reliable assessment of the age of B. undatum, delivering a new more reliable tool for fisheries scientists to assess population age structure...|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{regarded}} as an important focus of brown crab Cancer pagurus landings, the fishery in south east Ireland is poorly documented and the official statistics are believed to under-record the species {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3. This appraisal of the south east Ireland brown crab fishery is based on > 22, 000 records of sales transactions from the 1990 s and a comparison of the biological characteristics of landings in the late 1960 s with thirty years later, in the context of increasing fishing effort. The three buyers who gave access to their books inwards for periods of the 1990 s, purchase from the same fishing community and they compete for product but they occupy slightly different market niches: a vivier truck operator exports to Spain, a processor concentrates on autumn purchases of female crab for vacuum packing while the third buys crab claws for human consumption and crab bodies which are used as bait for <b>whelk</b> <b>Buccinum</b> <b>undatum.</b> Only the first sales of crab from 55 km of coastline are considered. In this area fishing effort doubled between 1972 and 1988 but expansion accelerated in the following decade by at least 128 %; a single operator increased his effort by 80 % between 1988 and 1998. In the 30 years after 1968, the number of pots per km of coastline rose by 241 %. The sale of brown crab is recorded in consignments which are raised to live weights in the analysis. Consignment size fell steeply in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s after which it stabilised; adjusting the figures to allow for increasing effort accentuated the trend; at the same time consignment number rose. Allowing that a decline in consignment size was accompanied by an increase in pot number, consignment number should have risen by 310 % to maintain landings at the level recorded in 1990; the largest recorded increase in consignment number was by 230 % and while it is accepted that all sales transactions have not been obtained, it is likely that LPUE has been declining over the 1990 s in real terms in this fishery. Increasing fishing effort during that time is seen as a product of better technology, stimulated by a desire to compensate for falling LPUE. Comparison of size and sex composition of the landings recorded in the late 1960 s and the late 1990 s are inconclusive. Depth of water and type of substratum are likely to influence the composition of inshore landings. An argument is presented that the south east inshore crab fishery is fully or over-exploited. It is likely to have an offshore component and such occasional data as are available on brown crab further south suggest that the offshore is an under-exploited fishery. In which case, the rate of interchange between the two components is likely to be crucial to the continued performance of the inshore fisheryFunder: Marine Institut...|$|R
