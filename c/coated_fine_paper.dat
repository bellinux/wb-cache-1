30|$|With {{the limit}} of forest {{resources}} all over the world, high-yield pulp (HYP), containing attractive features, such as high bulk, high opacity, high stiffness, good printability et al., has been gaining increasing interests in the manufacturing of uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>fine</b> <b>paper</b> and paperboards. However, {{the main drawback of}} HYP is the color reversion, since it contains much more lignin [1 – 4]. The special chemical structure of lignin is easily influenced by a certain external environment, for instance, temperature, light, and the presence of metal cations. Among them, the light is the main factor. When the long term exposed under the sunshine, the structure of lignin can easily generate chromophores or auxochromes, losing the brightness of paper to make it yellowing. It leads to the weakness of light stability, especially the brightness stability of HYP, which greatly hindered its application in some high-value paper. According to the research about the light-induced yellowing mechanism of HYP, different proposed yellowing inhibition methods were studied, such as chemical modification of lignin, exploring a new bleaching process of high-yield pulp and adding chemical auxiliaries. From the perspective of cost and effect of light stability, adding chemical auxiliaries (ultraviolet absorbents, radical scavenger, and fluorescent brighteners, et al.) is considered as the most feasible method to exhibit the yellowing of HYP.|$|E

40|$|The {{interdependency}} between filler retention and paper formation is well-known, where a high retention {{is accompanied by}} impaired formation. A challenge for today’s papermakers {{is to increase the}} competitiveness for uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>fine</b> <b>paper,</b> by improving the formation at the same level of retention. Over the years, the use and the demands of retention aids have increased as a consequence of a higher system closure, increased machine speeds and increased filler content. The knowledge of whether some retention aid systems are more or less detrimental to paper formation than other systems, is very limited. The insuffiency of knowledge is, however, also true for other chemical, mechanical and interacting factors, which influence the retention/formation relationship in a complex manner. In order to investigate the retention/formation relationship (features, retention aids, dosage points, etc.), a pilot-scale fourdrinier former (R/F-machine) has been developed. The R/F-machine provides a short circulation of the white water and controlled experimental conditions and is appropriate for cost-effective investigations. Moreover, the R/F-machine has been designed to have a short residence time to chemical equilibrium and the machine has also shown high reproducibility in the results. This licentiate thesis presents the R/F-machine and examines, during constant experimental conditions, the retention/formation relationships for some different retention aid systems. Three single-component cationic polyacrylamides with varying molecular weights and two polyacrylamide-based microparticulate systems with varying microparticles were examined. The retention aid systems were investigated on the R/F-machine, for a fine paper stock (90 % bleached hardwood and 10 % bleached softwood) with addition of 25 % filler (based on total solids content). The results showed that the retention/formation relationship was not dependent on the retention aid system used. All systems showed the same relationship between retention and formation. On the other hand, the various retention aid systems provided different effects considering their retention performance. QC 2010111...|$|E
40|$|Mass-produced paper {{electronics}} (large area organic printed electronics on paper-based substrates, “throw-away electronics”) has {{the potential}} to introduce the use of flexible electronic applications in everyday life. While paper manufacturing and printing have a long history, they were not developed with electronic applications in mind. Modifications to paper substrates and printing processes are required in order to obtain working electronic devices. This should be done while maintaining the high throughput of conventional printing techniques and the low cost and recyclability of paper. An understanding of the interactions between the functional materials, the printing process and the substrate are required for successful manufacturing of advanced devices on paper. Based on the understanding, a recyclable, multilayer-coated paper-based substrate that combines adequate barrier and printability properties for printed electronics and sensor applications was developed in this work. In this multilayer structure, a thin top-coating consisting of mineral pigments is coated on top of a dispersion-coated barrier layer. The top-coating provides well-controlled sorption properties through controlled thickness and porosity, thus enabling optimizing the printability of functional materials. The penetration of ink solvents and functional materials stops at the barrier layer, which not only improves the performance of the functional material but also eliminates potential fiber swelling and de-bonding that can occur when the solvents are allowed to penetrate into the base paper. The multi-layer coated paper under consideration in the current work consists of a pre-coating and a smoothing layer on which the barrier layer is deposited. <b>Coated</b> <b>fine</b> <b>paper</b> may also be used directly as basepaper, ensuring a smooth base for the barrier layer. The top layer is thin and smooth consisting of mineral pigments such as kaolin, precipitated calcium carbonate, silica or blends of these. All the materials in the coating structure have been chosen {{in order to maintain the}} recyclability and sustainability of the substrate. The substrate can be coated in steps, sequentially layer by layer, which requires detailed understanding and tuning of the wetting properties and topography of the barrier layer versus the surface tension of the top-coating. A cost competitive method for industrial scale production is the curtain coating technique allowing extremely thin top-coatings to be applied simultaneously with a closed and sealed barrier layer. The understanding of the interactions between functional materials formulated and applied on paper as inks, makes it possible to create a paper-based substrate that can be used to manufacture printed electronics-based devices and sensors on paper. The multitude of functional materials and their complex interactions make it challenging to draw general conclusions in this topic area. Inevitably, the results become partially specific to the device chosen and the materials needed in its manufacturing. Based on the results, it is clear that for inks based on dissolved or small size functional materials, a barrier layer is beneficial and ensures the functionality of the printed material in a device. The required active barrier life time depends on the solvents or analytes used and their volatility. High aspect ratio mineral pigments, which create tortuous pathways and physical barriers within the barrier layer limit the penetration of solvents used in functional inks. The surface pore volume and pore size can be optimized for a given printing process and ink through a choice of pigment type and coating layer thickness. However, when manufacturing multilayer functional devices, such as transistors, which consist of several printed layers, compromises have to be made. E. g., while a thick and porous top-coating is preferable for printing of source and drain electrodes with a silver particle ink, a thinner and less absorbing surface is required to form a functional semiconducting layer. With the multilayer coating structure concept developed in this work, it was possible to make the paper substrate suitable for printed functionality. The possibility of printing functional devices, such as transistors, sensors and pixels in a roll-to-roll process on paper is demonstrated which may enable introducing paper for use in disposable “onetime use” or “throwaway” electronics and sensors, such as lab-on-strip devices for various analyses, consumer packages equipped with product quality sensors or remote tracking devices...|$|E

50|$|The {{methods used}} for the {{printing}} and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more mechanization, a book printer in 1900 had {{much in common with}} Gutenberg.

Modern paper books are printed on papers designed specifically for printed books.
