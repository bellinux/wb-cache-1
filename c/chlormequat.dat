40|$|Abstract It {{appears that}} the risk of crop {{production}} under dry land conditions would be increased due to climate change in the next future decades. Recently, because of in most dryland regions, water use efficiency (WUE) is low due to undesirable production management. Water stress affects many physiological processes, involved in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield formation. In order to improve economy of water use, regulation of root and shoot growth is important. In this study effects of different levels of nitrogen fertilizer and plant growth retardant (<b>Chlormequat</b> Chloride) on grain, phytomass yield and WUE of four rainfed wheat cultivars were examined in a field experiment during 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 growing seasons in College of Agriculture, Shiraz University located in Badjgah. The results showed that differences between cultivars for grain yield, phytomass and WUE were significant. Effects of <b>chlormequat</b> chloride and nitrogen on grain and phytomass yield were significant. In the first year the highest grain yield and phytomass production (192. 4 and 431. 2 g/m 2, respectively) were obtained from Nicknejad cultivar, <b>Chlormequat</b> Chloride application and using 80 kg/ha nitrogen, and in the second years from Azar- 2 cultivar (121. 5 and 333. 5 g/m 2, respectively). <b>Chlormequat</b> chloride and nitrogen had significant effects on WUE in both years. Interaction of <b>chlormequat</b> chloride and 80 kg/ha nitrogen application in both years on WUE were significant (0. 95 and 2. 35 g/m 2 /mm, respectively). It appeared that nitrogen and <b>chlormequat</b> chloride application with increase root expansion and proliferation improved soil water uptake. It might be recommended that selecting resistant cultivars to later season drought stress, together with application of <b>chlormequat</b> chloride and nitrogen fertilizer have beneficial effects on increase of WUE of rainfall and could improve wheat grain yield under rainfed conditions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} three growth retardants <b>Chlormequat</b> chloride, AMO 1618 and Tetcyclacis on {{accumulation}} of serpentine in Catharanthus roseus cell culture was studied. These products {{are known to}} inhibit gibberellin biosynthesis in the cell. Low and high concentrations of growth retardants were applied to C. roseus cultures {{and all of them}} affect growth and accumulation of serpentine. All of these substances lowered cell mass growth at high concentrations compared with control. All of tested compounds increased the content of serpentine compared to the control. High concentration of AMO- 1618 resulted in two-fold increase in serpentine accumulation (25. 94 ± 1. 5 μg g - 1 FW) at day 8 after treatment in the cells and the secretion of serpentine to the medium was decreased with time. <b>Chlormequat</b> chloride at high concentration resulted in serpentine productivity of 18. 6 ± 0. 8 μg g - 1 FW at day 1, but no effect on secretion in the medium. Tetcyclacis resulted in lysis of the cells and consequently release of serpentine to the medium...|$|E

Bayleton is a fungicide used for powdery mildew control that also has growth regulator effects. Two ml growth regulator solution was evenly sprayed on each plant two weeks after transplanting.

40|$|Flow {{injection}} {{combined with}} tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was investigated for the rapid detection of highly polar pesticides {{that are not}} amenable to multi-residue methods {{because they do not}} partition into organic solvents and require dedicated chromatographic conditions. The pesticides included in this study were amitrole, <b>chlormequat,</b> cyromazine, daminozide, diquat, ethephon, fosetyl-Al, glufosinate, glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid, maleic hydrazide, mepiquat and paraquat. The composition of the flow-injection solvent was optimized to achieve maximum MS/MS sensitivity. Instrumental limits of detection varied betwee...|$|E
40|$|A flow {{injection}} analysis (FIA) system {{having a}} <b>chlormequat</b> selective electrode is proposed. Several electrodes with poly(vinyl chloride) based membranes were constructed for this purpose. Comparative characterization suggestedthe use of membrane with <b>chlormequat</b> tetraphenylborate and dibutylphthalate. On a single-line FIA set-up, operating with 1 x 10 - 2 mol L- 1 ionic strength and 6. 3 pH, calibration curves presented slopes of 53. 6 ± 0. 4 mV decade- 1 within 5. 0 x 10 - 6 and 1. 0 x 10 - 3 mol L- 1, andsquaredcorrelation coefficients > 0. 9953. The detection limit was 2. 2 x 10 - 6 mol L- 1 and the repeatability equal to ± 0. 68 mV (0. 7 %). A dual-channel FIA manifold was therefore constructed, enabling automatic attainment of previous ionic strength andpH conditions and thus eliminating sample preparation steps. Slopes of 45. 5 ± 0. 2 mV decade - 1 along a concentration range of 8. 0 x 10 - 6 to 1. 0 x 10 - 3 mol L- 1 with a repeatability ± 0. 4 mV (0. 69 %) were obtained. Analyses of real samples were performed, and recovery gave results ranging from 96. 6 to 101. 1 %...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe UK {{regulatory}} methods {{currently used}} for estimating residents' potential pesticide exposure were assessed {{to determine whether}} they provide sufficiently conservative estimates. A non-random sample of 149 residents living within 100  m of fields where pesticides were sprayed provided first morning void urine samples one and/or two days after spraying. Using farmers’ spray information, regulatory exposure assessment (REA) models were applied to estimate potential pesticide intake among residents, with a toxicokinetic (TK) model used to estimate urinary biomarker concentrations in the mornings of the two days following the spray. These were compared with actual measured urinary biomarker concentrations obtained following the spray applications. The study focused on five pesticides (cypermethrin, penconazole, captan, chlorpyrifos and <b>chlormequat).</b> All measured cypermethrin urinary biomarker levels were lower than the REA-predicted concentrations. Over 98 % and 97 % of the measured urinary biomarker concentrations for penconazole and captan respectively were lower than the REA-predicted exposures. Although a number of the chlorpyrifos and <b>chlormequat</b> spray-related urinary biomarker concentrations were greater than the predictions, investigation of the background urinary biomarker concentrations suggests these were not significantly different from the levels expected had no pesticide spraying occurred. The majority of measured concentrations being well below the REA-predicted concentrations indicate that, in these cases, the REA is sufficiently conservative...|$|E
