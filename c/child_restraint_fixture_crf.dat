40|$|This project {{investigated}} the usability of Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren (LATCH) hardware by measuring LATCH implementations in 98 2011 or 2010 model-year vehicles. ISO and SAE LATCH usability rating systems {{were used to}} assess all vehicles using data from the second row left position. Child restraint/vehicle interaction was assessed using both ISO and NHTSA proposed procedures. Volunteer testing was performed with 36 subjects on 12 different vehicles using 3 different <b>child</b> <b>restraints,</b> with each subject performing 8 <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> installations. The results from the vehicle survey indicate that most vehicle manufacturers provide LATCH hardware at only the minimum number of locations required by FMVSS 225. Only 7 vehicles had three sets of LATCH hardware in the second row, while most of the remaining 91 vehicles were only equipped with LATCH in each outboard position and a tether anchor in the center position. In the 21 vehicles with a third row, four had no tether anchors and 11 had no lower anchors in the third row. The SAE <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>fixture</b> could not be installed in 27 vehicles, although head restraint interference was the cause of interference in only one vehicle. Fifty-nine vehicles met the SAE recommended lower attachment force of 75 N (16. 9 lb) or less, while 15 vehicles required forces from 2 to 8 times this value. Only 2 vehicles met SAE recommendations for clearance angle of at least 75 degrees around the lower anchors. The depth of the lower anchors relative to the bight is less than 2 cm in 28 vehicles, 2 - 4 cm in 34 vehicles, and greater than 4 cm in 36 vehicles. The mos...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: About {{one-third of}} Iranian {{children}} mortality {{is caused by}} injuries from which 36 % occur due to road traffic injuries. Using <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> embedded in vehicles can reduce road traffic fatalities by 71 % for neonates and 54 % for children. Based on its effectiveness in reduction of fatality and prevention of injury severity, <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage mandatory law is a priority. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to assess opportunities and threats to mandatory law of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage in Iran. Materials and Methods: Initially, a mixed methods research is carried out by a phenomenological qualitative study, a discussion session by traffic injuries’ stakeholders was performed to assess & discuss the opportunities and threats to mandatory law of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage in Iran, by brain storming method to find the themes in the related topic. A structured questionnaire is later prepared and completed by the stakeholders in the area of road traffic injuries. Assigned scores of 0 - 100 were considered for each response and analysis of results was performed according to target themes & the total score of the filled questionnaires. Results: Overall, 28 stakeholders participated in the study. According to the stakeholders, traffic police department obtained the highest score of 90 (from 0 - 100) as an organization to establish the mandatory law of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage, and acquired the score of 100 for future enforcement and monitoring. As threats and obstacle to the mandatory law of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> usage, lack of television and media campaigns and <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> law and legislation, obtained the highest scores of 85 & 70 respectively. And family sensitivity to their children's health, officials’ support and national facilities for broadcasting, and community awareness to use <b>child</b> <b>restraints</b> had the highest scores among existing opportunities and facilities in the country, by scores of 83, 69 and 68 respectively.

40|$|This is a report. This {{report was}} a public {{deliverable}} of the EC funded CHILD project G 3 RD-CT- 2002 - 00791 (Advanced Methods for Improved Child Safety). It provides {{a review of the}} research and public information relating to the extent of use and misuse of <b>child</b> <b>restraints</b> in the participating countries, including the UK. Whilst the rates of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> use are improving the prevalence of misuse is high and the consequences of misuse are not well understood and continue to contribute to the casualty figures for children in cars. The results from this study, together with cases from the CHILD Accident Database, were used to determine the terms of reference for a programme of testing to investigate the injury consequences of various types of misuse. This testing programme has produced results which are being used to inform the <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> design and manufacturing community of the effects of misuse in order to assist them in improving the design of <b>child</b> <b>restraints</b> to minimise the possibility and consequences of misuse. In addition the information is being used to develop and target public information to inform users of the importance of correct use and the potential consequences of misuse. This work has been particularly important {{in the light of the}} introduction of the new seatbelt/child restraint wearing law in the UK in September last year (and equivalent laws in the other EU member states) requiring all children under 12 years of age and less than 135 cm in height to use a <b>child</b> <b>restraint.</b> As many more children will be using <b>child</b> <b>restraints,</b> with an associated increase in misuse, the consequences in terms of injuries needs to be avoided with the improvement in <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> design and the education of the users...|$|R

40|$|When small {{children}} travel in minibuses, during for example daycare transports, they seldom have adequate protection {{in terms of}} crash safety. To be sufficiently protected the child should travel in a rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> system (CRS).

40|$|Australia is {{considering}} allowing {{the use of}} lower anchorage systems for <b>child</b> <b>restraints</b> in motor vehicles. However, care {{needs to be taken}} to ensure that the mix of existing Australian <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> systems and any proposed lower anchorage system does not pose safety risks for children. In addition, it is desirable to avoid unique requirements for an Australian lower anchorage system and hence an assessment of UNECE ISOFIX and US FMVSS LATCH requirements was undertaken. A series of 28 frontal impact sled tests were conducted based on the Australian Standard AS/NZS 3629 <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> dynamic test method. A further series of 15 tests were conducted in a vehicle body mounted on an impact sled with an acceleration-time history representative of a 56 km/h full frontal rigid barrier crash. Three different models of forward-facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> were tested, with varying anchorage configurations including rigid ISOFIX, flexible LATCH strap and 3 -point seatbelt. Top tethers were evaluated with anchorages directly behind the <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> (0 °) and offset at an angle of 20 °. P 3 and Hybrid III 3 year old dummies were used. Anchorage loads and safety performance of the restraint system were assessed. In tests in the vehicle body, maximum dynamic top tether loads were in the range of 7 - 8 kN and maximum dynamic lower anchorage loads are estimated to be in the range 13 - 14 kN. Tests using rigid ISOFIX anchorages generally produced lower head acceleration and forward excursion than other tested anchorage types. However, this was accompanied by increased chest deflections and neck flexion moments. These data suggest that lower anchorage systems may be acceptable in Australia, but that modifications to the UNECE and LATCH requirements may be required to ensure compatibility with existing Australian <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> systems without a degradation of child safety...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the frequency of <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> choices in a sample consisting of 357 drivers in the Adelaide metropolitan area, who were transporting to school 586 children aged up to 10 years. The main survey result was {{that the rate of}} appropriate restraint was between 64 % and 72 % on such trips, (according to weight criteria in the Australian and New Zealand Standard on <b>child</b> <b>restraints</b> for motor vehicles). Only 1 % are completely unrestrained. Most of those who were not restrained appropriately had prematurely progressed to an adult seatbelt. Appropriate <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> use is lowest for children in the age range 5 - < 7. Inappropriate restraint choice is strongly related to the child’s age, their seating location (children seated in the rear being more likely to be restrained appropriately), and possibly the child’s entry into primary school. Female drivers were more likely than male drivers to know what restraints were suitable for children in their carriage. However, it {{did not appear to be}} the case than good knowledge of <b>child</b> <b>restraints</b> is predictive of appropriate restraint use. Barriers to booster seat use included the child’s attitudes to using a booster seat. This effect may be lessened if the child’s age were able to used to guide restraint selection, as peer cues (for child and parent) would be more consistent. Drivers almost never mentioned cost as a barrier to <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> use. Encouraging parents to become better informed may also help, but recommendations should be reviewed.

40|$|This {{study was}} made within the Child Safety group at Volvo Car Corporation.   The {{purpose of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to study the different aspects of rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> systems, which is the safest way for small children to travel, in order to suggest improvements {{in the development of}} <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> systems. The studies included scientific articles regarding child safety and fatally injured children in car accidents, both in Sweden and internationally. The overall aim is to find factors that enables the increase in usage of rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> systems, including the increase of usage time to as long as possible.   Swedish accident data, obtained by the Swedish Traffic Data Acquisation, was studied. It was found that the fatally injured children during car accidents in Sweden between the years 2000 - 2016 commonly were involved in extraordinarily accident scenarios with an outcome independent of how they were restrained. The literature study and the survey that was made were both supporting the statement of inconvenience while using rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> systems. The inconvenience often corresponded to different types of misuse. The main issue with rearward facing according to the responding parents was lack of leg space, both for their child but also for the driver and the front seat passenger. These issues made some parents turning their children forward facing at early age, whereas they could still fit in the rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> system.   One key in order to increase the global use of rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> systems lies in changes of the materials and design.
