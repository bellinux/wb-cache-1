In real market situation Generators {{have to deal with}} <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> among different markets (i. e. day-ahead spot market, contract market and ancillary service market) and competition strategy optimization simultaneously. However these two interrelated problems have been studied separated with little practical reference. The <b>allocation</b> of <b>capacity</b> among three markets sets the foundation for strategy optimization while actual market performance is the evaluation criterion of <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation.</b> The key of decision-making is the risk of price uncertainty and its manipulation. Our work provides a new realistic platform of competition strategy optimization for Generation Companies. The process of strategy optimization is completed in a multi-agent system that is interactive with the user. Different kinds of software agents are designed to fulfill the optimization function. Scenario tree generation algorithm is used to deal with the uncertainty of electricity price and genetic algorithm is used to solve the complex optimization problem of generation <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> among different <b>periods.</b> Then competition strategies in spot as well as contract and ancillary market are defined. Finally evaluation process is designed for strategy improvement, which effectively combines the problem of generation <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> with competition strategy optimization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} managing flexible production capacity in a make-to-order (MTO) manufacturing environment. We present a multi-period capacity management model where we distinguish between process flexibility (the ability to produce multiple products on multiple production lines) and operational flexibility (the ability to dynamically change <b>capacity</b> <b>allocations</b> among different product families over time). For operational flexibility, we consider two polices: a fixed allocation policy where the <b>capacity</b> <b>allocations</b> are fixed throughout the planning horizon and a dynamic allocation policy where the <b>capacity</b> <b>allocations</b> change from <b>period</b> to period. The former approach is modeled as a single-stage stochastic program and solved using a cutting-plane method. The latter approach is modeled as a multi-stage stochastic program and a sampling-based decomposition method is presented to identify a feasible policy and assess the quality of that policy. A computational experiment quantifies the benefits of operational flexibility and demonstrates that it is most beneficial when the demand and capacity is well-balanced and the demand variability is high. Additionally, our results reveal that myopic operating policies may lead a firm to adopt more process flexibility and form denser flexibility configuration chains. That is, process flexibility may be over-valued in the literature since {{it is assumed that}} a firm will operate optimally after the process flexibility decision. We also show that the value of process flexibility increases with the number of periods in the planning horizon if an optimal operating policy is employed. This result is reversed if a myopic allocation policy is adopted instead...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a revenue {{management}} model to jointly make the <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> and overbooking decisions over an airline network. Our approach {{begins with the}} dynamic programming formulation of the <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> and overbooking problem and uses an approximation strategy to decompose the dynamic programming formulation by the flight legs. This decomposition idea opens up the possibility of obtaining approximate solutions by concentrating on one flight leg at a time, but the <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> and overbooking problem that takes place over a single flight leg still {{turns out to be}} intractable.

40|$|Increasing wind {{capacity}} integration {{results in}} displacement of active power from conventional generators {{and a reduction}} in reactive power sources available. As such, voltage stability may become a concern in certain periods for power system operation particularly in weaker areas of the network. Thus, it is of importance to consider the AC constraints for optimal wind generation planning (long term) in order to decrease the possibility of a wind <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> that requires costly remedies from the power system operation perspective (short term). In this work, a procedure is proposed for wind <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> with the aim of benefiting from the potential of an optimal wind <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> for enhancing the voltage stability margin.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a revenue {{management}} model to jointly make the <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> and overbooking decisions over an airline network. The crucial observation behind our model {{is that if}} the penalty cost of denying boarding to the reservations were given by a separable function, then the optimality equation for the joint <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> and overbooking problem would decompose by the itineraries. We exploit this observation by building an approximation to the penalty cost that is separable by the numbers of reservations for different itineraries. In this case, we can obtain an approximate solution to the optimality equation by plugging the separable approximation into the boundary condition of the optimality equation. Our computational experiments compare our approach with a standard deterministic linear programming formulation, as well as a recent joint <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> and overbooking model. When compared with the standard deterministic linear programming formulation, our approach can provide significant profit improvements.

30|$|Local officials, {{transportation}} policy-makers, {{and traffic}} engineers frequently face the complex task of allocating capacity {{among the various}} users of transportation networks. This <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> process takes different forms. One of them, road pricing, seeks to change the vehicular composition of the traffic by means of road user charges. After all, optimal pricing and optimal <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> {{is essentially the same}} problem [1]. Another form of <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> is vehicular access restrictions that limit access of some vehicles—frequently large trucks—to congested areas during the peak traffic hours. These types of access restriction initiatives may result in the addition of more trucks to the network, as the delivery still needs to be made to the receiver. The carrier will end up using multiple smaller trucks if unable to use a larger vehicle to complete the delivery. This may end up causing the opposite of what the strategy intends, resulting in increased congestion and negative environmental and economic impacts [2].

40|$|The induced {{liberalisation}} process {{within the}} European railway system severely affects the railway infrastructure <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure. In the past a single and often governmental owned integrated railway company planned, built and operated a national railway system. The liberalisation process {{led to a}} segregation of the integrated railway companies into railway infrastructure manager and railway undertaking in many European Countries. The open access paradigm for railway infrastructure capacity that grants any licensed railway undertaking access to the railway infrastructure capacity induces competition between different railway undertakings trying to acquire railway infrastructure capacity. Recent figures indicate that more railway undertakings emerge and do request railway infrastructure capacity. Their increasing share of uncoordinated request for railway infrastructure capacity increases {{the complexity of the}} coordination phase of the railway infrastructure <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> process. In this phase the railway infrastructure manager needs to adjust train path requests in a way to resolve conflicting requests for railway infrastructure capacity. This work introduces an algorithmic framework that shall provide efficient measures to support the railway <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> process and to analyse different allocation procedures. In order to make algorithmic approaches applicable in this domain of railway engineering a sophisticated modelling approach for railway infrastructure capacity is extended in order to account for the objectives of the railway undertakings participating on the secondary railway market for railway infrastructure capacity. The objectives for railway <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> are formulated {{from the point of view}} of the railway undertakings submitting train path requests. These objectives account for the negative effects due to adjustments applied to their train path requests during the coordination phase of the railway <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> process. The formalised railway <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> process can be optimised globally, by taking into account standardised objectives with help of algorithmic approaches introduced in this work. However, due to the required confidentiality of information provided by the railway undertakings to the railway infrastructure manager, a global optimisation, taking into account the real objectives of all railway undertakings is not applicable. In order to allow for incorporating the real objectives of the railway undertakings a game theoretical setting is formulated: the railway undertakings are players acting on the secondary railway market for railway infrastructure capacity. Assuming that these players act rationally, such a game theoretical setting always leads to a result, where no player can further improve his situation. Such a solution of the game is a Nash Equilibrium. Comparing the obtained Nash Equilibria of the game theoretical setting to the optimal solution obtained by global optimisation techniques gives an indication of the negative effect of non-cooperative behaviour in such a competitive market for railway <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation.</b> Moreover, it will be shown how the algorithmic framework for railway <b>capacity</b> <b>allocation</b> can be used to determine the degree of congestion of a railway system, based on the submitted train path requests and standardised objectives...|$|R
