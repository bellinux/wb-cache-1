5|$|Nashville has honored two of {{its players}} by {{retiring}} their uniform numbers. When a number is retired, only the player with the retired number <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> that number if {{he returns to the}} team as a player or coach. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. Nashville displays its retired numbers {{on the front of the}} press box at First Tennessee Park.|$|E

50|$|The ACF {{has its own}} stable belt which <b>can</b> be <b>worn</b> by cadets and instructors, {{but they}} <b>can</b> also <b>wear</b> the stable belt of their {{affiliated}} regiment/corps. Stable belts <b>can</b> be <b>worn</b> by cadets of any rank but many counties impose local requirements such as star level or rank. They may be issued {{at the expense of}} the detachment or company but are usually a private purchase item.|$|R

25|$|In R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, the Supreme Court {{sought to}} find a middle ground {{on the issue of}} whether a witness <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> a face-covering niqab while testifying in a {{criminal}} trial. The court found that the right to religious freedom must be balanced against the right of the accused to a fair trial.|$|E
25|$|In the NBL {{there is}} no overall #1 amateur, only a number one title for their age group, so a racer in say 17 expert that has most points <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> a {{national}} #1 plate even if the number one rider in 12 expert actually has more points. Again, the professionals have their own points system for number one pro.|$|E

25|$|The barefoot {{management}} system has not, however, gained a foothold among serious equine professionals, due to three factors: 1) increased strain {{placed on the}} hoof in sports, such as eventing and endurance riding, 2) the added weight of the rider and saddle, and 3) man-made surfaces, such as concrete, asphalt, and gravel, which <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> the walls down to the sensitive tissue over time.|$|E
25|$|The second general {{characteristic}} of Pachypodium is spinescence, or having spines. The spines come clustered in either pairs or triplets with these clusters often arranged in rings or whorls around the trunk. Spines emerge with leaves, and like leaves grow {{for a short}} period before stopping growth and hardening. Spines do not regenerate so weathering and abrasion <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> away all but the youngest spines from older specimens - leaving smooth trunks and branches.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers have {{expressed}} concern about the Velcro on the ACU. Dirt and mud can clog the hooks and loops or they <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> out with use, requiring the use of cleaning brushes for clearing the Velcro as part of daily maintenance. Zippers have also been a topic of concern. Soldiers also expressed concern because the zippers (as with any zipper) can bind up, and render the uniform uncomfortable to wear, especially with body armor.|$|E

50|$|A basic {{dress is}} a usually dark-colored dress of simple design which <b>can</b> be <b>worn</b> with various {{accessories}} to suit different occasions. Different kinds of jewelry, belts, scarves, and jackets <b>can</b> be <b>worn</b> {{with the basic}} dress to dress up or down. A little black dress {{is an example of}} a basic dress.|$|R

25|$|Because the {{position}} requires a comprehensive {{understanding of the}} game's strategies, the pool of former catchers yields {{a disproportionate number of}} managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball, including such prominent examples as Connie Mack, Steve O'Neill, Al López, Mike Scioscia, and Joe Torre. The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> catchers down over a long season, and can {{have a negative effect on}} their offensive output.|$|E
25|$|Sandanme (三段目) is {{the fourth}} highest division. This level {{represents}} the first break point in the treatment a wrestler receives as he rises up the ranks. From sandanme he is allowed {{a better quality of}} dress, most notably he no longer needs to wear geta on his feet and <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> a form of overcoat over his yukata. However, the wrestlers are still considered to be in training, receiving only an allowance rather than a salary.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of dental}} {{sealants}} {{is a means}} of prevention. A sealant is a thin plastic-like coating applied to the chewing surfaces of the molars to prevent food from being trapped inside pits and fissures. This deprives resident plaque bacteria of carbohydrate, preventing the formation of pit and fissure caries. Sealants are usually applied on the teeth of children, as soon as the teeth erupt but adults are receiving them if not previously performed. Sealants <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> out and fail to prevent access of food and plaque bacteria inside pits and fissures and need to be replaced so they must be checked regularly by dental professionals.|$|E

50|$|Bedding {{can help}} prolong {{the life of}} the stock. Repeated recoil forces can cause {{movement}} of the action in the stock. As the action moves, friction <b>can</b> create <b>wear</b> in the stock surface. Eventually the repeated <b>wear</b> <b>can</b> ruin the stock.|$|R

25|$|Friction dampers {{tend to be}} {{available}} in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates {{on the principle of}} a coulomb damper. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience stick-slip phenomenon and Cold welding. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop {{and as long as the}} building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the student}} handbook, {{students}} are expect to maintain a dignified behavior and exhibit proper speech, etiquette, and attire. Students are required to wear neat and clean clothes in the classroom, dining hall, and meditation halls. Torn, stained, or sloppy clothing is not allowed. Shorts are not allowed in class but may be worn in the dining hall. Students from other cultures and traditions <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> traditional dress. According to the 2009–2010 policy manual for the MSc Computer Professionals Program, neatly trimmed beards are permitted. Falsification of the attendance record {{is a violation of}} the honor code, along with cheating and plagiarism. The university prohibits smoking, alcohol and drugs on campus.|$|E
25|$|Dog Clothing is {{a garment}} made by humans for their canine companions. Dog clothes are {{available}} in various price ranges from inexpensive to high-end designer styles. Typically toy and small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas and Yorkshire Terriers are dressed in dog clothes, although even large breeds like Golden Retrievers <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> clothes, too. It is more common to dress small dogs because they are easier to dress and they often suffer from the cold more due to their coats being less thick. Dog clothes are made to be either functional or for show. Functional dog clothes are for protection from the elements and allergens. Dog clothes that are purely for show would be used as costumes for holidays and special occasions such as Halloween or weddings.|$|E

5|$|Preparedness for ashfalls should involve sealing buildings, {{protecting}} {{infrastructure and}} homes, and storing sufficient supplies {{of food and}} water to last until the ash fall is over and clean-up can begin. Dust masks <b>can</b> be <b>worn</b> to reduce inhalation of ash and mitigate against any respiratory health affects. Goggles <b>can</b> be <b>worn</b> to protect against eye irritation.|$|R
25|$|This system, {{invented by}} Albert Giblin and {{common in the}} UK, uses a storage tank {{similar to that used}} in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This flush valve system is {{sometimes}} referred to as a valveless system, since no traditional type of valve is required. Some would argue, however, that any system of regulating the flow of a fluid is still technically a valve. In the siphon-flush-valve system, the user pushes a lever or button, forcing the water up into the tank siphon passageway which then empties the water in the tank into the bowl. The advantage of a siphon over the flush valve is that it has no sealing washers that <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> out and cause leaks, so it is favoured in places where {{there is a need to}} conserve water.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} in fielding {{in the two}} sports {{is that even though}} a cricket ball is harder and heavier than a baseball, the fielders in cricket are more restricted in the use of protection for the hands. The only fielders who <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> protective gear are the wicket-keeper, who is allowed to wear padded gloves as well as leg guards and a box; and fielders in potentially dangerous close-in positions such as silly point and short leg, who may wear shinpads, boxes and helmets but are not allowed any gloves. In baseball, catchers and first basemen normally wear mitts, which have no fingers and are specially designed for each respective position. The other fielders wear gloves with fingers. (Early baseball was also played bare-handed; gloves were adopted in the later 19th century.) This means that the risk of hand injury due to the impact of the ball is far higher in cricket. Also, especially in Test cricket, it is common for several fielders to be stationed close to the bat (slips, short leg, silly point and similar positions) since the likelihood and value of dismissing a batsman by a catch in a close fielding position is higher. Catching at these positions require exceptional reflexes, skill and courage, associated with bare-handed catching of a hard ball travelling at up to , with reaction times of the order of 0.2 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The {{fragrance}} called [...] "L" [...] {{was launched}} in September, 2007 at Soho House in New York City. Stefani worked with perfumer Harry Fremont to develop the scent. Stefani described the fragrance as [...] "it's another thing you <b>can</b> <b>wear</b> and another thing I {{can be part of}} creatively. I created it for myself -- it's like me shrunk into a box." [...] The perfume is a blend of the aromas of hyacinth, white freesia, fresh pear, violet, jasmine, rose, lily, sweet pea, orange blossom, peach, frangipani, heliotrope and musk. The perfume was available in 50ml and 100ml bottles.|$|E
