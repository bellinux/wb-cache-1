40|$|A {{viral vector}} {{based on the}} bean yellow dwarf virus was {{investigated}} for its potential to increase transient gene expression. An intron-containing GUS reporter gene and the cis-acting viral regulatory elements were incorporated in the viral vector and could be complemented by the viral replication-associated proteins provided on a secondary vector. All vectors were delivered to Nicotiana glutinosa plant cell suspension or hairy root cultures via auxotrophic Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Cell culture generated greater yield of reporter gene expression than did root culture, {{as a result of}} the limitation imposed on roots to express the protein only in surface tissue containing actively dividing cells. Reporter gene expression increased for cell culture when the reporter gene construct was <b>co-delivered</b> with the construct supplying both viral replication associated proteins (REP and REPA); gene expression decreased when the construct supplying only the viral REP protein was <b>co-delivered.</b> Reporter protein expression increased from 0. 091 % for the reporter construct alone to 0. 22 % total soluble protein (% TSP) when the viral Rep-supplying vector was <b>co-delivered</b> with the reporter gene construct. Reporter protein was generated 3 days after the initiation of bacterial co-culture, providing for rapid generation of heterologous protein in cell culture...|$|R

40|$|Aim: A {{promising}} nanogel vaccine platform {{was expanded}} toward antigen conjugation. Materials & methods: Block copolymers containing a reactive ester solvophobic block and a PEG-like solvophilic block were synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization. Following self-assembly in DMSO, the esters allow for core-crosslinking and hydrophilization by amide bond formation with primary amines. Free thiols were accessed at the polymer chain ends through aminolysis of the reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer groups, {{and into the}} nanogel core by reactive ester conversion with cysteamine. Subsequently, free thiols were converted into vinyl sulfone moieties. Results: Despite sterical constraints, nanogel-associated vinyl sulfone moieties remained well accessible for cysteins to enforce protein conjugation successfully. Conclusion: Our present findings provide a next step toward well-defined vaccine nanoparticles that can <b>co-deliver</b> antigen and a molecular adjuvant...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Therapeutic {{strategies}} that involve the manipu-lation of the host’s immune system are gaining momentum in cancer research. Antigen-loaded nanocarriers {{are capable of}} being actively taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and have shown promising potential in cancer immunotherapy by initiating a strong immunostimulatory cascade that results in potent antigen-specific immune responses against the cancer. Such carrier systems offer versatility in that they can simulta-neously <b>co-deliver</b> adjuvants with the antigens to enhance APC activation and maturation. Furthermore, modifying the surface properties of these nanocarriers affords active targeting properties to APCs and/or enhanced accumulation in solid tumors. Here, we review some recent advances in these colloidal and particulate nanoscale systems designed for cancer immunotherapy {{and the potential for}} these systems to translate into clinical cancer vaccines.

40|$|AbstractRecombinant subunit {{vaccines}} {{in general}} are poor immunogens likely due to {{the small size of}} peptides and proteins, combined with the lack or reduced presentation of repetitive motifs and missing complementary signal(s) for optimal triggering of the immune response.

Particle-based delivery platforms, including particulate antigens and particulate adjuvants, are promising delivery vehicles for modifying the way in which immunogens are presented to both the innate and adaptive immune systems. These particle delivery platforms can also <b>co-deliver</b> non-specific immunostimodulators as additional adjuvants.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} a group-based self-management program (SMP) delivered {{as part of}} a quality improvement program, Co-Creating Health, for patients living with one of four long-term conditions (LTCs) : chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes, and musculoskeletal pain. Methods: The 7 week SMP was <b>co-delivered</b> by lay and health professional tutors. Patients completed self-reported outcome measures at pre-course and 6 months follow-up. Results: 486 patients completed (attended ≥ 5 sessions) the SMP and returned pre-course and 6 months follow up data.

Conclusion: Attending the SMP led to improvements in a range of outcomes. Improvement in patient activation is important, as activated patients are more likely to perform self-care activities.

40|$|Among the {{emerging}} subunit vaccines are recombinant protein- and synthetic peptide-based vaccine formulations. However, proteins and peptides {{have a low}} intrinsic immunogenicity. A common strategy to overcome this is to <b>co-deliver</b> (an) antigen(s) with (an) immune modulator(s) by co-encapsulating them in a particulate delivery system, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles. Particulate PLGA formulations offer many advantages for antigen delivery as they are biocompatible and biodegradable; can protect the antigens from degradation and clearance; allow for co-encapsulation of antigens and immune modulators; can be targeted to antigen presenting cells; and their particulate nature can increase uptake and cross-presentation by mimicking {{the size and shape}} of an invading pathogen. In this review we discuss the pros and cons of using PLGA particulate formulations for subunit vaccine delivery and provide an overview of formulation parameters that influence their adjuvanticity and the ensuing immune response...|$|E

The presented work in this thesis explores new applications for Layer-by-Layer (LbL) technology in the field of controlled protein delivery. The basic motives for these studies were the protein-friendly mild formulation conditions where only aqueous solutions are used, in contrast to organic solvents typically employed in the fabrication of many other protein formulations, thus correct protein folding and activity are preserved. Several formulations were designed for the loading and slow release of model and therapeutic biologicals from different carriers. Special attention was paid to testing the activity of released fractions. Moreover, double chambered nanoparticles were developed to host and <b>co-deliver</b> a protein and a small molecule drug to the same cells...|$|E

40|$|Active {{immunotherapy}} {{has shown}} promising potential for cancer treatment. However, there still remain major challenges including induction of a potent and specific T-cell response against the endogenous antigen {{and retention of}} tumor immunity. To address these problems, we used layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles (NPs) to <b>co-deliver</b> tyrosinase-related protein 2 (Trp 2) and indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase siRNA (siIDO) to dendritic cells (DCs). These LDH NPs were readily taken in by DCs, and escaped from endosomes into the cytoplasm. Compared with free Trp 2 peptide or siIDO, the vaccination with the LDH NPs co-delivering Trp 2 and siIDO significantly inhibited tumor growth in melanoma mouse models by relieving IDO-mediated immune suppression and increasing naive and specific T cell activation process in vivo. Thus, these LDH NPs, which have a high loading capacity for peptide or siRNA effectively protect and deliver Trp 2 and siIDO, overcome the immune tolerance and strengthen T cell immunity, are potential therapeutics to enhance cancer treatment...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} we employed layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (LDHs) to simultaneously deliver an anticancer drug 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and Allstars Cell Death siRNA (CD-siRNA) for effective cancer treatment. The strategy {{takes advantage of}} the LDH anion exchange capacity to intercalate 5 -FU into its interlayer spacing and load siRNA on the surface of LDH nanoparticles. LDH nanoparticles have been previously demonstrated as an effective cellular delivery system for 5 -FU and siRNA separately in various investigations. More excitedly, the combination of CD-siRNA and anticancer drug 5 -FU with the same LDH particles significantly enhanced cytotoxicity to three cancer cell lines, e. g. MCF- 7, U 2 OS and HCT- 116, compared to the single treatment with either CD-siRNA or 5 -FU. This enhancement is probably a result of coordinate mitochondrial damage process. Thus, the strategy to <b>co-deliver</b> siRNA and an anticancer drug by LDHs has great potential to overcome the drug resistance and enhance cancer treatment...|$|E
