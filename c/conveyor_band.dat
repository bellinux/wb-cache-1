This made a considerable economy of metal and reduced the cycles of stocks production. In 1940, he {{introduced the}} parallelism principle into the aircraft building industry: the preparations {{for the start of}} production were made simultaneously with design works and production of the new machine's plans. After the start of World War II and the evacuation of the factory to Kuybishev, Victor Litvinov organized the mass production of Ilyushin Il-2, introducing the new principle of the conveyor line with both planes and stocks moving on the <b>conveyor</b> <b>band.</b> This innovation was further introduced into all aircraft factories of the USSR and Litvinov was made director of the factory in 1944.

Speed of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>band</b> that carries the products is controlled by a fuzzy controller. Fuzzification, fuzzy decision making and defuzzification procedures are realized by PLC ladder instructions. Fuzzy logic controllers can infer coherent results in uncertain conditions when {{it is necessary to}} control a complex system which has difficulties to model using mathematical ways. Application of fuzzy logic theory in control systems proved to be superior to the conventional control systems.

The main sources of noise pollution are: tracked excavators with rotor and <b>band</b> <b>conveyors.</b> For the urban areas and forested areas the tracked excavators with rotor is not a source of noise pollution. They represent a source of noise just inside the career, {{because of the way}} adjacent extraction steps, which is a natural barrier against the propagation of noise. The <b>band</b> <b>conveyor</b> T 111 from the Mining Unit of Career Rosia, which is transporting excavated material represents a source of noise pollution for residents of the village of Rosia of Jiu due to he`s close location.

40|$|Purpose. One of {{the main}} {{elements}} of band conveyors is a drive. To analyze the effect of design parameters on the drive power it is necessary to carry out the calculations according to standard procedures outlined in the current technical literature. The main design parameters of the band conveyor are: the type of cargo, project performance, the geometric dimensions of sections and track configuration as a whole. The feature of band conveyor calculation as compared to the elevators is the dependence of the band width on its performance, the inclination angle and the type of cargo. In the article for the account of this fact during calculations it is necessary to construct the dependence of the band width on the generalized parameter, which takes into account change in the design parameters. To determine the general pattern of changing the value of band conveyor drive power when varying its design parameters in the article it is necessary to construct the corresponding graphic dependences taking into account the standard sizes and bands parameters. Methodology. We consider the band conveyor with two sections: the inclined and horizontal one. It is conducted a detailed analysis of dependence of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>band</b> width and its drive power on the type of cargo, project performance, geometric dimensions and configuration of the conveyor track, using the appropriate parameter dependences constructed by the authors in previous papers. Findings. For band conveyors of this type there were constructed the graphics dependences of the band width on the parameter characterizing the project performance and the inclination angle of the track section, and on the performance at a fixed angle of inclination. Taking into account the changes in the band width with an increase in the value of project performance the graph dependences of drive power on the productivity and the inclination angle of the inclined section were built. Originality. For the first time there were built the general dependences of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>band</b> width and the drive power with two sections (inclined and horizontal) on the design parameters and there were presented the corresponding graphs. Practical value. Use of the built graphic dependences of drive power of band conveyors with the inclined and horizontal sections on the design parameters makes it possible to quickly determine the approximate value of drive power at the design stage, and to determine the general change nature of its value while varying the design parameters...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical systems {{including}} <b>conveyor</b> belts, <b>band</b> saw blades, {{and power}} transmission belts {{are influenced by}} the lateral motion of the moving structure. This phenomenon was studied in the literature both using the theory of the continuous linear and nonlinear systems and following the multibody technique. The subject is studied by using the finite element method (FEM) validated with reference to the analytical models described in the literature. The contributions of the Coriolis forces, the negative stiffness linked to the transport speed, and the bending stiffness due to the transverse moment of inertia are discussed. The dynamic behavior of a prototypical belt transmission layout with two fixed pulleys and an automatic tensioner is then analyzed. The results show the effect of the transport speed on the reduction of the flexural natural frequencies of the mode shapes strictly related to the lateral motion of the belt span and evidence the design strategy that needs to be followed for a correct operation of the whole syste...|$|R
2500|$|The General Post Office (GPO) was {{the anchor}} tenant, which only {{moved in a}} {{fortnight}} after the Fullerton Building's official opening. GPO covered the two lower floors with postal halls, offices and sorting rooms. There were mail drops through which mail would fall to a <b>band</b> <b>conveyor</b> on the basement and dispatched up to the sorting room. One {{of the most memorable}} features is its curved service counter which was almost 90m long. The basement was linked to a 35-metre subway, also called the GPO tunnel [...] that ran underneath Fullerton Road to a pier. [...] From there, a lift would bring bags of mail to the Master Attendant’s Pier, and then transferred onto ships that were anchored at the pier. Special mail was all sent to the neighbouring countries via sea, which was the main transport back then, thus requiring at least 2 months to reach United Kingdom [...] This is further delayed by the fact that all mail had to be personally sorted by hands.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Overburden soils {{from open}} pit mines {{of the company}} RWE Power AG are {{excavated}} with bucket wheels and transported with <b>band</b> <b>conveyors</b> to dump heaps. The deposition of the waste soils takes place within so-called regular sections. In order to perform stability computations one needs a geotechnical characterization of the involved soils, and in particular representative values of shear strength. Undrained shear strengths from laboratory and field testing are subjected to enormous scatter which makes {{the definition of the}} representative values difficult. Therefore, a concept for a reliable determination of the undrained shear strength of waste soils in mine heaps has been introduced. It is based on a hypoplastic constitutive model for fine-grained soils which takes into account the influence of soil state (in this case represented by consistency) on the undrained shear strength. The accompanying experimental investigations include extensive laboratory testing as well as large-scale field tests suitable for a statistical evaluation. The results of numerical calculations yield an experimentally justified statistical distribution of undrained shear strengths immediately after the soil deposition. A subsequent FE analysis of the consolidation behaviour provides the time-dependent values. 1...|$|R
