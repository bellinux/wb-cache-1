40|$|Abstract. A {{method for}} {{analysing}} flexible multibody systems {{in which the}} elastic deformations are small is presented. The motion is considered a gross non-linear rigid body motion with small linear vibrations superimposed on it. For periodic gross motion, {{this results in a}} system of rheo-linear differential equations for the deformations with periodic coefficients. The determination of the required equations with a program for flexible multibody systems is discussed which calculates, besides the periodic gross motion, the linearized, or variational, equations of motion. Periodic solu-tions are determined with a harmonic balance method, while transient solutions are obtained by an averaging method. The stability of the periodic solutions is considered. The procedure has a high computational efficiency and leads to more insight into the structure of solutions. The method is applied to a pendulum with an elliptical motion of its support point, a slider-crank mechanism with flexible connecting rod, a rotor system, and a <b>Cardan</b> <b>drive</b> shaft with misalignment. Key words: periodic solutions, non-linear vibrations, rheolinear vibrations, flexible multibody sys-tems, general purpose software...|$|E
5000|$|A car {{was shown}} at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 and 1925 and tested by the LNER. To provide a better service to compete with raising levels of road traffic two of these {{articulated}} [...] two-cylinder chain-driven units were purchased, and operated in the Lowestoft area. This was followed by 22 cars to a similar design in 1927 and 1928. A prototype <b>cardan</b> shaft <b>driven</b> car with a rigid body was built in 1927 and between 1928 and 1930 forty-nine cars with six cylinder <b>cardan</b> shafts <b>drives</b> and rigid bodies were purchased, followed by five [...] cars in 1930 and 1932 and Phenomena, a twin articulated pair with two 100 hp six cylinder motors, in 1930. This could seat 39 in the power car and 83 in the trailer. Between 1927 and 1943 a number were allocated to Heaton shed, near Newcastle upon Tyne, and operated to [...] and over the Tyne Valley Line to [...] and [...] On 9 June 1929, railcar No. 220 Waterwitch overran signals at Marshgate Junction, Doncaster and was consequently in collision with an excursion train. The railcar was cut in two. It was not repaired.|$|R
50|$|An unusual feature was the {{external}} <b>cardan</b> shaft <b>drive</b> from the gearbox {{on the rear}} of a horizontally mounted engine to road-vehicle style reduction boxes outboard of the two axles on one bogie. Later units had two such engine and drive combinations placed on opposite sides.Railcars 19-20 were fitted with a separate high-low ratio gearbox on the final drive side of the gearbox. This allowed {{a top speed of}} about 60 - 70 mph in high and about 40 - 45 mph in low. Railcar W20W retains this in preservation.|$|R
50|$|The BMW R2 was a 198 cc {{overhead}} valve single-cylinder motorcycle produced by BMW between 1931 and 1936, the smallest motorcycle ever {{produced by the}} firm. Despite its much smaller design and engine capacity, the R2 retained many features of the larger boxer twin motorcycles in the range, such as <b>cardan</b> shaft <b>drive</b> and a pressed-steel duplex frame. The R2 was the smallest {{in the range of}} singles produced during the 1930s by BMW, with its big brothers being the 305 cc R3 and the 400 cc R4.|$|R
50|$|The {{motorcycles}} {{were made}} in several models ranging from 98 cc two stroke to 750 cc overhead valve four cylinder engines. There were also one and two cylinder models, with a sheet metal frame and <b>Cardan</b> shaft final <b>drive.</b> Dollar made its own engines, but also used Chaise overhead valve engines.|$|R
50|$|Track T-800CDI has an 800 cc three-cylinder CDI {{common rail}} turbo diesel engine {{developed}} by Mercedes {{and used in}} the Smart Car {{and a number of}} other products including hovercraft. Track runs an ECU especially for the motorcycle. It has a <b>cardan</b> shaft <b>drive</b> (BMW cruiser). The transmission is a Continuously Variable Transmission (CV-tech Trailbloc and Invance LV). The throttle is connected with an electronic throttle control. Dutch E.V.A. Products BV started to sell the diesel motorcycle in 2009. At the end of 2012 E.V.A. Products BV has gone into hibernation. Production has come to a halt. An estimated 50 motorcycles have been put on the road.The picture is of a prototype motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|A {{configuration}} {{known as}} a double <b>Cardan</b> joint <b>drive</b> shaft partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation. This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an intermediate shaft, with the second U-joint phased {{in relation to the}} first U-joint to cancel the changing angular velocity. In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the driving shaft, provided that both the driving shaft and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase. This assembly is commonly employed in rear wheel drive vehicles, where it is {{known as a}} drive shaft or propeller (prop) shaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{trainsets}} are 4-unit {{multiple units}} capable of operating in pairs, designed for medium-distance high-speed services. The inner axle of each carriage bogie {{is powered by}} a body mounted three phase asynchronous traction motor via a <b>cardan</b> shaft final <b>drive.</b> The electrical power is regulated by IGBT devices with one converted per carriage. The bogies are of welded steel construction with primary coil springs and secondary air suspension. Tractive forces are transmitted by a drag pivot pin.|$|R
2500|$|The design {{specifically}} includes {{features for}} safety, reliability and appearance. In place of <b>cardan</b> shaft <b>drives</b> to the wheels, coupling rods {{were used to}} give people something to watch and engine covers were omitted to give {{a good view of}} the Rolls-Royce diesel engines. The full-length canopy above the engine covers not only adds to the distinctive outline but also supports the exhaust silencer. For added safety with only one man in the cab, a dead-man device is included, a pedal that when released triggers the braking system to bring the train safely to a halt. The turbocharged six-cylinder engine is rated at [...] and drives through a hydraulic transmission that has only one drive ratio. The result is a locomotive that accelerates quickly up to speed. All four locomotives were rebuilt in 2012â€“13 in readiness for the launch of the new [...] "traditional diesel" [...] service.|$|R
5000|$|In 1923 Sentinel Waggon Works and Cammell Laird collaborated {{to build}} a {{prototype}} lightweight steam rail car for the Jersey Railway. A range of Sentinel-Cammell railcars were developed {{with a choice of}} a single car or an articulated pair and a [...] motor or [...] with one boiler and two motors. A total of 290 were built for customers worldwide, 91 for use in Britain A boiler raised steam at , feeding one or two steam motors. The first steam motors had two cylinders as were used on contemporary steam lorries but by 1925 a 6-cylinder version had been developed. In the early units chains were used in final drive until a gearbox and <b>cardan</b> shaft <b>drive</b> was developed in 1927. In the early units the engine unit was articulated, enclosed in similar coachwork to the passenger section; the whole car was made of steel.|$|R
