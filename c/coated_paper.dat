5|$|By 1943, it {{had about}} 100 employees. The magazine's offices moved to Brighton, Ohio in 1946, then to New York City in 1948. A five-column tabloid format was adopted in November 1950 and <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> {{was first used}} in Billboards print issues in January 1963, {{allowing}} for photojournalism. Billboard Publications Inc. acquired a monthly trade magazine for candy and cigarette machine vendors called Vend and, in the 1950s, acquired an advertising trade publication called Tide. By 1969, Billboard Publications Inc. owned eleven trade and consumer publications, a publisher called Watson-Guptill Publications, a set of self-study cassette tapes and four television franchises. It also acquired Photo Weekly that year.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Verso Corporation 2015 {{acquisition}} of NewPage, US authorities required two mills to be sold. Catalyst therefore bought Biron Mill in Biron, Wisconsin, and Rumford Mill in Rumford, Maine. Both produce <b>coated</b> <b>paper,</b> allowing Catalyst to expand its paper portfolio into finer grades. The mills were bought for US$62 million. The deal led to a 65-percent increase in Catalyst's production.|$|E
50|$|Different paper qualities {{can be used}} as {{book paper}} {{depending}} on the type of book. Machine-finished <b>coated</b> <b>papers,</b> woodfree uncoated <b>papers,</b> <b>coated</b> fine <b>papers,</b> and special fine papers are common paper grades.|$|R

25|$|The {{format of}} Life in 1936 {{was an instant}} classic: the text was {{condensed}} into captions for 50 pages of photographs. The magazine was printed on heavily <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> and cost readers only a dime. The magazine's circulation skyrocketed beyond the company's predictions, going from 380,000 copies of the first issue {{to more than one}} million a week four months later. The magazine's success stimulated many imitators, such as Look, which was founded a year later in 1937 and ran until 1971.|$|E
25|$|The 1900 {{hurricane}} {{that destroyed}} Galveston heavily damaged Pasadena, as well. The city received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated {{to the mainland}} following the catastrophe. Donations by the newly created Red Cross, including millions of strawberry plants to Gulf Coast farmers, helped revive the community. This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena a major fruit producer for many years afterward. As the community recovered major tracts of the Allen Ranch were liquidated opening up new development. Rice farmers from Japan settled in the community further diversifying its agriculture. Champion <b>Coated</b> <b>Paper</b> Company of Ohio opened a paper mill in 1937. Other businesses began to develop.|$|E
25|$|Norske Skog's board {{decided in}} December 1990 {{to close the}} sulfite pulp mill and build a new {{magazine}} paper machine, PM6. The decision to terminate cellulose production was both caused by the environmental impact {{as well as by}} a steady diminishing demand for chemical pulp. The recession following the dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that exports to Eastern Europe were decimated. Meanwhile, new production technologies for paper had less demand for cellulose. The closing resulted in a loss of 210 jobs, of which 25 were transferred to PM6 and 50 were retired early. Construction of the new mill took place at Skakkestad, to the northeast of the main facility. Originally PM6 was proposed to produce light weight <b>coated</b> <b>paper,</b> but after Stora bought the technological partner Feldmühle, PM6 had to revert to supercalender.|$|E

40|$|Time-dependent {{changes in}} the surface {{properties}} of <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> were studied as the evolution of surface hydrophobicity of laboratory and commercially <b>coated</b> <b>papers.</b> We measured the apparent contact angles on the papers during several weeks post-production. Hydrophobicity upon aging increased for all samples made from traditional coating colors on mechanical base stock and on base stock made from cotton linters. Accelerated aging by heat treatment intensified the increase of the apparent contact angles and accelerated the time-dependent behavior. A key mechanism in these changes may be the spreading of latex particles in a coating...|$|R
25|$|Boardman's three pence {{rotogravure}} series began {{monthly production}} in February 1948. Issues were twelve pages long and used both {{front and back}} covers as story pages. They were printed in three colours (generally black, white, and red or green) on clay <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> and saddle-stitched at the spine. In American publishing, they most closely resemble Will Eisner's Spirit Sunday newspaper inserts. Mildly inspired by Alex Raymond, Denis and Colin filled the first seven issues with the adventures of detective Roy Carson and adventure/science fiction hero Swift Morgan alternately. Although titles changed with each issue, numbering remained consistent to the entire series. Issue eight saw the addition of Lennart Ek's Buffalo Bill reprinted from a Swiss source but always repackaged by Denis. Eventually, Denis would create some original Buffalo Bill stories for the series but his involvement with other projects for Boardman caused the reprint content of the rotogravure series to increase. Still holding the rights to material from Quality Comics, Blackhawk (at least sixteen issues) and the Spirit (probably only two issues) {{were added to the}} rotation of titles. These reprints were always repackaged by Denis McLoughlin. The twelve-page rotogravure format lasted for 44 issues until October 1951. In February 1953, the series numbering continued but with color covers and black & white interiors until probably sometime in 1954. It seems possible that number 61, featuring Blackhawk, was the last issue. Rebound newsagent returns of the rotogravure series were released as Super Colour Annuals (there were three, 1949–1951).|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 and 2006, {{the company}} {{undertook}} a significant restructuring, selling over [...] of forestland in the U.S., {{along with its}} <b>coated</b> <b>paper,</b> kraft paper, wood products, and beverage packaging businesses, as well as subsidiaries Arizona Chemical and New Zealand-based Carter Holt Harvey. The <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> business (four mills in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota) were sold to Apollo Management and now operate as Verso Paper. The kraft paper business (composed of a kraft paper mill in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina and a dunnage bag plant in Fordyce, Arkansas) was sold to Kapstone Paper and Packaging and operates as Kapstone Kraft Paper.|$|E
2500|$|Color {{photography}} may form {{images as}} positive transparencies, {{which can be}} used in a slide projector, or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements on specially <b>coated</b> <b>paper.</b> The latter is now the most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment. After a transition period centered around 1995–2005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras. Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive [...] "look".|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a <b>paper</b> <b>coating</b> {{for the potential}} application in food packaging based on polylactide and montmorillonite. It {{is applied to the}} paper {{in the form of a}} stable, water-based latex with a solid content of 25 – 28 wt %. The latex is prepared from a commercially available polylactide, surfactants, montmorillonite, a plasticizer, chloroform (to be removed later) and water by an emulsion/solvent evaporation procedure. This coating formulation is applied to the paper substrate by bar-coating, followed by hot-pressing at 150 °C. The <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> achieved up to an 85 % improvement in water vapor transmission rates when compared to the pristine <b>papers.</b> The <b>coating</b> latex is prepared from inexpensive materials and can be used for a solvent-free coating process. In addition, the ingredients of the latex are non-toxic; thus, the <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> can be safely used for food packaging...|$|R
