The uniaxial symmetry non-circular hole is optimized based on finite element method (FEM), in which the maximum first principal stress is taken as the objective function. After optimization, the stress concentration is evidently relieved; the maximum first principal stress and the maximum von Mises stress on the critical area are reduced by 30. 39 % and 25. 34 % respectively, showing that the uniaxial symmetry non-circular hole is capable of reducing the stress level of bolt <b>clearance</b> <b>holes</b> on the turbine disk...|$|R

It {{is important that the}} cylindrical alignment hole closely fit the diameter of the pencil, to keep the pencil from wobbling, which would cause stepped or lurching cut-depths and point breakage. Another important feature is a larger <b>clearance</b> <b>hole</b> {{at the end of the}} cone allowing sections of the pencil lead which break away to be removed with only minor inconvenience. Prism sharpeners can be bare or enclosed in a container to collect the shavings, while some enclosed sharpeners may be harder to clear in the event of a blockage. A few prism sharpeners are hand-cranked, rotating the cutting blade instead of rotating the pencil. Moderate care is needed to not break the tip of the pencil being sharpened, requiring the pencil to be sharpened again. However, because pencils may have different standard diameters in different nations, imported sharpeners may have non-standard-sized alignment guide-holes, making sharpening attempts difficult. If the alignment hole is too small, the pencil cannot be inserted, while if it is too large, the tip of the pencil repeatedly will break off. Prism sharpeners may be right- or left-handed, requiring clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the pencil being sharpened.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis examines various aspects on connections and joints in Pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymeric (PFRP) structures. The work {{is divided into two}} experimental investigations on the determination of pin-bearing strength and the characterisation of dowel connections and joint for the Startlink Lightweight Building System (SLBS). To support the development of a strength formula for bearing resistance in bolted connections two pin-bearing strength test series were conducted to study the effects of load orientation and hot-wet conditioning. The limitations of existing standard test methods are exposed from a critical review to show that they do not specify the need for a <b>clearance</b> <b>hole,</b> the range of bolt diameters and PFRP thicknesses found in practice. Because the size of tension coupons is found to be too big to be cut from standard structural profiles an alternative test method, having a smaller coupon size, is needed for every pin-bearing strength to be quantified by testing. Reported in this thesis are test results using an in-house test method that requires a maximum blank coupon of 100 mm × 125 mm. Characteristic strength are determined using Annex D 7 of Eurocode 0. Pin-bearing strengths for load orientations of 0, 5, 10, 20, 45 and 90 o, to the direction of pultrusion are obtained for a web material taken from a standard wide flange section of 9. 53 mm thick. In the test matrix there were four sizes of pin diameter from 9. 7 mm to 25. 4 mm and a minimum <b>clearance</b> <b>hole</b> of 1. 6 mm. The in-house test method is shown to satisfactorily determine pin-bearing strength. Another finding from this study is that the Hankinson formula cannot be applied to establish pin-bearing strength at any orientation on knowing the two characteristic strengths at 0 o and 90 o. To characterise the effect of hot-wet conditioning 0, 45 and 90 o specimens were immersed under water for 3000 hours at 40 ° C.

40|$|International audienceModeling up to 45 GHz of {{coupling}} between microvias and PCB cavities considering several {{boundary conditions}} thierry le gouguec 1, najib mahdi 1, ste ' phane cadiou 1, ce ' dric quendo 1, erich schlaffer 2, walter pessl 2 and alain lefevre 3 The {{recent developments in}} electronic cards such as the network equipment are characterized by the miniaturization of the board size and the increasing complexity of the layout. Because of these requirements, multi-layered printed circuit boards are commonly used and vias connecting signal lines on different layers, or integrated circuit devices to power and ground planes, are frequently used and often essential. However, a via is not an ideal transmission line. Besides, it creates discontinuities at high frequencies leading to high insertion loss degradation of signal which limits the performances of integrated circuit and systems. In this paper, the impacts of coupling between via and parallel-plates cavity on the response of microwave integrated devices are highlighted in the first part. Then, to describe the intrinsic interaction between the via transition and parallel-plate modes, the notion of parallel-plates matrix impedances is presented and new boundary conditions like open or plated through holes shielded boundaries of the cavities are introduced. Then, using this physics-based model, an intuitive equivalent circuit has been developed. Finally, the proposed approach and the equivalent circuits were validated by using comparisons with electromagnetic simulations and measurements in different scenarios. Three-dimensional (3 D) multi-layer technologies such as low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) [1] or high-density multi-layers printed circuit board (HD-PCB) [2] are currently being strongly developed because they offer considerable size reduction {{as well as the}} embedded function possibilities. For microwave applications such as filters, couplers, diplexers, etc. [3, 4], these 3 D structures offer new design possibilities for frequencies up to 100 GHz. HD-PCB structures consist of several metal layers separated by dielectric substrates. The vias and microvias used in multilayer PCBs allow connecting lines of different metallic levels together or connecting devices to the power and ground plane [5]. The different metal planes can also be connected together with metallic plated through holes (PTHs). With the rise of working frequencies, the stacked multilayer PCB structures are subjected to electromagnetic phenomena like standing waves in cavities or like coupling and interaction between neighboring components. As example of HD-PCB technology, the AT&S TM (PCB manufacturer) technology used during MIDIMU-HD project funded by the Euripides council is presented in Fig. 1. This HD multilayer consists of eight metallic layers (30 mm thickness) separated by Megtron 6 (Panasonic TM) sub-strate of 95 mm thickness (depending on the metal densities of each level) and with a relative permittivity 1 r ¼ 3. 3 and loss tangent tan(d) ¼ 0. 0065 at 40 GHz. A single microvia hole consists of a central cylinder with a diameter of 140 mm, a conductor pad with a diameter of 240 mm, and when this via passes through a metallic plane it will also have a <b>clearance</b> <b>hole</b> called anti-pad of diameter of 350 mm. AT&S is able to stack more than three microvias and to realize buried via with diameter of 200 mm. The PTHs connecting the metal level M 1 to the metal level M 8 are 200 mm of diameter. Obviously, these multilayer structures which involve parallel planes, dielectric layers, pads, and anti-pads are not ideal transmission components at high frequencies. The electrical behavior of a microvia can be modeled by serial inductance and resistance like is done for a metallic wire [6, 7]. The vias and microvias may cause mismatch [7], crosstalk, reflections, some additional signal delays, and consequently the degradation of signal performance. On the other hand, the coupling between vias, microvias, and parallel plates also {{plays an important role in}} the electrical performances of the via transition [8, 9]. The excitation of the parallel plate modes results in conversion of energy between propagation on line and propagation on guided plated structures which imply some transmission zeros...|$|E

The aim is to characterise a method of connection that could be fatigue and slip resistant. For comparison, tests are also carried out on standard bolted connections without resin and with 2 mm <b>clearance</b> <b>holes.</b> Slip in joints is a major issue in bridge engineering, which has to be controlled if the structural scheme is to perform satisfactorily over its service life. The transfer of connection force in FRP joints, by way of frictional force, say by using High Strength Friction Grip (HSFG) bolts, cannot be relied upon [1], because steel bolting is known to lose its pre-tension with time due to the viscoelastic properties of the FRP. The aim of our preliminary study is to offer a potential solution to developing a suitable slip resistant connection.

In order to give an impulse to standardiza-t ion and to ga in more insight in the biomechanics of the push-out test, a finite element analysis of this test was per-formed. This study focused on the influ-ence of test conditions on the push-out results. The influence of the following four parameters on the interface stress distribution was tested: (a) <b>clearance</b> of the <b>hole</b> in the support jig, (b) Young's modulus of the implant; (c) cortical thick-ness; and (d) implant diameter. The dis-tance between the implant and the support jig turned out to be very critical for the occurrence of peak stresses in the inter-face. Variations of the Young's modulus of the implants resulted {{in a wide range of}} interface shear stresses. Variation of the cortical thickness showed a reciprocal relationship between cortical thickness and interface shear stress. However, the interface stress distribution remained uniform under the specific test circum-stances. These findings also hold for vari-ations in implant diameter. The present investigation shows that the <b>clearance</b> of the <b>hole</b> in the support jig, and the Young's modulus of the implant are parameters which most strongly influence the inter-face stress distribution. The <b>clearance</b> of the <b>hole</b> in the support jig is the most criti-cal parameter, but also the parameter that can be control led most easily. Lack of standardization with regard to these parameters can lead to uninterpretable test results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the short- and long-term behaviour of injected bolted connections (IBCs) with oversize holes for various injection materials. A central theme in this thesis the demountability of IBCs, {{as a result of}} which several release agents are tested for their suitability in and effects on IBCs. Injection bolts have been used successfully in engineering practice using epoxy resin to limit the amount of slip in bolted shear connections with normal <b>clearance</b> <b>holes,</b> but no explicit results are available for connections with oversize or slotted holes. The use of oversize or slotted holes may be beneficial for the (re-) erection process of structures, and thus it is investigated what the effects of such oversize or slotted holes are on the connection behaviour. First, it is examined if grout is suitable as an injection material in injected bolted connections (IBCs), as well as what precautions are necessary to ensure proper demountability of grout- and (epoxy) resin-injected bolted connections. Secondly, the connection behaviour under short-term loading is determined, on the basis of which long-term creep tests are carried out. Finally, a new injection material is developed based on the preliminary conclusions drawn from the short- and long-term tests. It is concluded that IBCs can be demounted by treating the connection members with a release agent. The results of the experiments show that the long-term behaviour of resin-injected connections is governing the design, but that modelling of this time-dependent behaviour requires additional testing. The short and long-term performance of the newly developed material (resin reinforced with steel shot) in IBCs with oversize holes is significantly better than that of only resin, on the basis of which it is recommended to further investigate the potential and behaviour of this material in engineering applications.

40|$|The study {{presented}} {{focuses on}} the development of a novel timber joint. Traditional timber joints with mechanical fasteners, particular dowel type fasteners, such as bolts exhibit a low strength and an unreliable stiffness and ductility caused by the presence of <b>hole</b> <b>clearance</b> and the unpredictable splitting of timber. The novel joint tackles all of these shortcomings. Local reinforcement glued to the timber members in the jointed area prevents unexpected splitting and results in the enhancement of the strength. By choosing a steel (gas) tube instead of a solid fastener, that fit in an over-sized hole, and by expanding the diameter after assembly of the joint, easy assembly and no <b>hole</b> <b>clearance</b> is insured. Due to the ductile behaviour of the reinforcement and the plastic deformation capacity of the tube the ductility of the joint is guaranteed. To assess the performance of this joints a comprehensive study was performed and reported in this article. Summarising the experimental results, it can be stated that densified veneer (ply) wood is an excellent mate. rial to reinforce the timber joint. It possesses a high embedding strength and stiffness compared to softwood and is able to sustain the high concentrated loads imposed by the tubes.

When certain requirements are fulfilled the joint shows a superior behaviour in cyclic loading.

One {{important component of}} the motor is the cam ring, which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose cam ring can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of the cam ring. In order to load the cam ring similar to the real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how the cam ring is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom plate where the cam ring has a given position. The cam ring is fixated using a sloted spring pin and a dowel pin that keeps the cam ring in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding the cam ring is oval, this is to allow deformation of the cam ring. The result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the <b>clearance</b> <b>holes</b> is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of the cam rings. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span.
