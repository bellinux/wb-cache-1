40|$|Intraspecific or {{interspecific}} {{competition is}} then fundamentally the same: scramble competition {{is a good}} example of this type of competition. Modern ecology increasingly is faced with the question whether the data or a paper provide evidence for the statement that is made or for testing the hypotheses one believes in. Much of the research on antelopes and ungulates in general suffers from an exuberance of possible causes to explain numerical changes in study populations. Multi-causality is the bane of community ecology. The issue of facilitation of antelopes by zebra has been a long-running theme in African savanna ecology. The cases of competition are as follows: small antelopes <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> giraffe, cattle that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> gaur, cattle that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> deer, cattle that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> impala, cattle that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> buffalo, and buffalo that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> African elephant and possibly blue wildebeest that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> African elephant. </p...|$|R

5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow <b>competes</b> <b>with</b> {{both the}} native {{southern}} grey-headed sparrow and house sparrow, which {{was introduced to}} southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully <b>competes</b> <b>with</b> both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E

5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it <b>competes</b> <b>with</b> this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species.
