5|$|Screening among {{family members}} of people with known FH is <b>cost-effective.</b> Other {{strategies}} such as universal screening {{at the age of}} 16 were suggested in 2001. The latter approach may however be less <b>cost-effective</b> in the short term. Screening at an age lower than 16 was thought likely to lead to an unacceptably high rate of false positives.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels {{shall be}} {{produced}} in the most <b>cost-effective</b> way, with a commitment to improve production efficiency and social and environmental performance in all stages of the biofuel value chain.|$|E
5|$|In March 1966 Spurr’s team {{issued its}} final report, {{finding that the}} dam was not a <b>cost-effective</b> investment.|$|E
5|$|Rubber {{injection}} moulding process produces a high yield of durable products, {{making it the}} most efficient and <b>cost-effective</b> method of moulding. Consistent vulcanisation processes involving precise temperature control significantly reduces all waste material.|$|E
5|$|Screening for aneurysms is not {{performed}} on a population level; {{because they are}} relatively rare, {{it would not be}} <b>cost-effective.</b> If someone has two or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, screening may be worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|Screening of {{toddlers}} {{has been}} suggested, and {{results of a}} trial on 10,000 one-year-olds were published in 2016. Work was needed to find whether screening was <b>cost-effective,</b> and acceptable to families.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{recommended}} that combinations of cheaper or more <b>cost-effective</b> drugs (such as co-trimoxazole with rifampicin or clindamycin) be tried before linezolid {{in the treatment}} of SSTIs when susceptibility of the causative organism allows it.|$|E
5|$|Tameside Council’s joint public-service centre {{will be a}} more <b>cost-effective,</b> {{energy-efficient}} and customer-friendly building {{than the}} rambling Tameside Administrative Centre it is replacing. It will generate considerable cost savings and provide better access to services.|$|E
5|$|A cheap, <b>cost-effective</b> and {{practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} major labels, Black Lab {{essentially}} ceased touring, fearing that a self-booked and promoted national tour {{would not be}} <b>cost-effective.</b> They maintained a relationship with fans via their website and MP3 of the Month Club, through which users were able to subscribe to monthly tracks of new content, such as soundtrack songs, unreleased works, and insights into the band's songwriting process.|$|E
5|$|Changing {{demographics}} {{and a growing}} social awareness led to increased political and architectural interest in providing <b>cost-effective,</b> sanitary, and comfortable residential space to the growing urban population {{in general and the}} working class in particular. This was known as boligsaken ("the housing cause") in Norwegian popular culture and continues to play a role to this day.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{scorched}} earth {{tactics of}} retreating Wehrmacht troops, large areas in Northern Norway {{needed to be}} rebuilt. In 1945, there was an overwhelming need for housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, <b>cost-effective,</b> and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with building standards, but met an immediate need for shelter.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} <b>cost-effective,</b> reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but {{has historically been}} limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the {{granular}} pavement {{section of}} Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested {{with a cold}} in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR process is a <b>cost-effective</b> method which recycles the top surface of a road. This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to carrying passengers and their luggage, Greyhound buses also carry packages. Through Greyhound Package Express customers can book expedited cargo shipping door-to-door or station-to-station. The company says that shipping by bus offers a <b>cost-effective</b> alternative to other ground or air carriers for same-day delivery.|$|E
5|$|In {{medicine}} and chemistry, SRI developed dry-powder drugs, laser photocoagulation (a treatment for some eye maladies), remote surgery (also known as telerobotic surgery), bio-agent detection using upconverting phosphor technology, the experimental anticancer drugs Tirapazamine and TAS-108, ammonium dinitramide (an environmentally benign oxidizer for safe and <b>cost-effective</b> disposal of hazardous materials), the electroactive polymer ("artificial muscle"), new uses for diamagnetic levitation, and the antimalarial drug Halofantrine.|$|E
5|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic {{articular}} cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering <b>cost-effective,</b> long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} in several countries with different health care system models to assess the cost-effectiveness of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more <b>cost-effective</b> than comparable antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs.|$|E
5|$|The Nova Scotia Government had {{originally}} proposed minor repairs for the structure, but {{they decided that}} a new bridge would be more <b>cost-effective.</b> Unlike the old bridge, the new bridge was designed without overhead steel arches that would have doubled the cost. It {{was built on the}} same site as the old bridge's predecessor, which was constructed in 1907.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are <b>cost-effective.</b> They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely <b>cost-effective,</b> provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|Bloodless {{heart surgery}} was pioneered by American surgeon Denton Cooley. It was also {{performed}} by doctor Jerome Kay in Los Angeles and the procedure soon {{spread around the}} world. Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open heart surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless heart surgery was <b>cost-effective</b> in India, as it did not require blood transfusions, reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless heart surgery was also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more <b>cost-effective</b> and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more <b>cost-effective</b> method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|HP {{believed}} that it was no longer <b>cost-effective</b> for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP and Intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Heating is <b>cost-effective</b> at {{many more}} sites than {{electricity}} generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and <b>cost-effective</b> disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most <b>cost-effective</b> health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while that in the United States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more <b>cost-effective</b> than alternatives such as vancomycin, mostly because of the ability to switch from intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{was unwilling}} to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the high level seen during the 1960s as NASA {{prepared}} to send men to the Moon. NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine drew up ambitious plans {{for the establishment of}} a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981. Nixon rejected both proposals due to the expense. Nixon also canceled the Air Force Manned Orbital Laboratory program in 1969, because unmanned spy satellites were a more <b>cost-effective</b> way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} <b>cost-effective</b> than {{treatment}} of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.|$|E
5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} <b>cost-effective</b> to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} built because the {{previous}} bridge, built in 1956, was {{nearing the end}} of its life span. The Nova Scotia Government had proposed minor repairs, but it was decided by the N.S. Government that an entirely new bridge would be more <b>cost-effective.</b> The new bridge was designed, unlike its predecessor, without large, overhead steel arches, because it would have been twice as costly to build. The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and {{there are very few}} rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery <b>cost-effective.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a {{forecast}} by city planners in 1967 which stated {{the need for a}} rail-based urban transport system by 1992. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more <b>cost-effective,</b> then Minister for Communications Ong Teng Cheong, {{came to the conclusion that}} an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} {{shortcomings of}} the mass housing movement led to efforts to create <b>cost-effective</b> housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens {{with the ability to}} fund construction of their homes, and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.|$|E
