2500|$|In biology, [...] "worm" [...] {{refers to}} an {{obsolete}} taxon, vermes, used by Carolus Linnaeus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals, now seen to be paraphyletic.

Invertebrate animals commonly called [...] "worms" [...] include annelids (earthworms and marine polychaete or bristle worms), nematodes (roundworms), platyhelminthes (flatworms), marine nemertean worms ("bootlace worms"), marine <b>Chaetognatha</b> (arrow worms), priapulid worms, and insect larvae such as grubs and maggots.|$|E

50|$|In bilateria, {{there are}} many methods of swimming. The arrow worms (<b>chaetognatha)</b> {{undulate}} their finned bodies, not unlike fish. Nematodes swim by undulating their fin-less bodies.

50|$|Herring-like {{fish are}} the most {{important}} fish group on the planet. They are also the most populous fish.

Conversely, they are a central prey item or forage fish for higher trophic levels.

50|$|Different {{groups of}} marine worms are related only distantly, {{so they are}} found in several {{different}} phyla such as the Annelida (segmented worms), <b>Chaetognatha</b> (arrow worms), Hemichordata, and Phoronida (horseshoe worms).

Some marine worms are tube worms, such as the giant tube worm which lives in waters near underwater volcanoes and can withstand temperatures up to 90 degrees Celsius.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chaetognatha,</b> meaning bristle-jaws, and {{commonly}} known as arrow worms, is a phylum of predatory marine worms which are {{a major component of}} plankton worldwide. About 20% of the known species are benthic, and can attach to algae and rocks. They are found in all marine waters, from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from 2 to 120 mm.|$|E

She worked at La Jolla from 1958-69 where she studied the zooplankton off the coast of California as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. During this period she discovered 12 new <b>Chaetognatha</b> species, nine Sinophora and one medusa. She also produced a model of the world's distribution of different species of <b>Chaetognatha</b> and Siphonophora.

5000|$|Gelatinous {{zooplankton}} are fragile {{animals that}} live in the water column in the ocean. They have very delicate bodies that are easily damaged or destroyed. Gelatinous zooplankton are often transparent. All jellyfish are gelatinous zooplankton, but not all gelatinous zooplankton are jellyfish. The most commonly encountered organisms include ctenophores, medusae, salps, and <b>Chaetognatha</b> in coastal waters. However, almost all marine phyla, including Annelida, Mollusca and Arthropoda, contain gelatinous species, but many of those odd species live in the open ocean and the deep sea and are less available to the casual ocean observer. Gelatinous zooplankton have also been called [...] "Gelata".|$|E
50|$|Nearly {{half of the}} Chengjiang fossil {{species are}} arthropods, few of which had the hard, mineral-reinforced exoskeletons found in most later marine arthropods; only about 3% of the organisms known from Chengjiang have hard shells, {{and most of those}} are trilobites (although Misszhouia is a soft-bodied trilobite). Many other phyla are found there: Porifera (sponges) and Priapulida (burrowing “worms” which were ambush predators), Brachiopoda (these had bivalve-like shells, but fed by means of a lophophore, a fan-like filter which {{occupied}} about of half of the internal space), <b>Chaetognatha</b> (arrow worms), Cnidaria, Ctenophora (comb jellies), Echinodermata, Hyolitha (Lophophorata with small conical shells), Nematomorpha, Phoronida (horseshoe worms), and Protista.|$|E
