Fault detection is an intricate process; an engineer must apply wits to search for ways of rectifying and preventing the faults inherent in any electronic device. By application of several electronic paradigms on raw data from test equipments, this work introduces a way of rapidly analyzing electronic circuits to ascertain their availability in the expected product lifespan. For simulation, randomly generated resistive or reactive signal values within practical operational ranges were acted upon by probabilistic functions, Ohms and Kirchhoff’s laws of electronics, etc. to produce a solution pattern for the <b>circuit’s</b> <b>availability.</b> Predictions were thus obtainable for a future trend of {{the reliability of the}} circuit under test.

40|$|Nucleic acids are information-dense, {{programmable}} polymers {{that can}} be engineered into primers, probes, molecular motors, and signal amplification circuits for computation, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes. Signal amplification circuits increase the signal-to-noise ratio of target nucleic acids {{in the absence of}} enzymes and thermal cycling. Amplification is made possible via toehold mediated strand displacement – a process where one nucleic acid strand binds to a nucleation site on a complementary helix, which then displaces one of the two strands in a nucleic acid complex. When compared to polymerase chain reactions (PCR), the sensitivity and stability of toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions suffer from circuit leakage – reactions of the system {{in the absence of an}} initiator. Presented here, from a materials science and engineering perspective, defect engineering has improved the leakage performance of model strand displacement systems made from DNA. Engineered defects used in this study included mismatched base pairs and alternative nucleic acids – both of which are known to impact the stability of hybridization. To identify sources of leakage in a model signal amplification <b>circuit,</b> <b>availability</b> was defined as the probability that a DNA base (A. T. C. G) was unpaired at equilibrium. This design metric was calculated using NUPACK, a thermodynamic modeling tool. To further understand the relationship between leakage rates and secondary structures, mutual availability was defined as the sum of all pairwise products of the availabilities of the corresponding bases in solution. This thermodynamic analysis yielded rational design principles for how to minimize leakage by as much as 4 -fold by site-specifically introducing mismatched base pairs into DNA duplex regions. To further reduce leakage, chemically modified locked nucleic acids (LNAs) were site-specifically introduced into a model DNA strand displacement system. Briefly described, LNAs are geometrically restricted RNA analogues with enhanced thermo-mechanical stability towards their complement base. When compared to a DNA control with identical sequences, the leakage exhibited by a hybrid DNA/LNA system was reduced from 1. 48 M- 1 s- 1 (for the DNA system) to 0. 03 M- 1 s- 1. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio increased ~ 50 -fold for a similar hybrid system. This research provides insight into the sources of leakage in DNA strand-displacement systems, as well as how to maximize strand-displacement performance via the selective introduction of hybridization defects. Rational design of future nucleic acid signal amplification circuits will lead to broader applications in a variety of fields that range from DNA computation to point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|At the {{frequencies}} above almost 10 GHz, rain attenuation is dominant factor which affects thecircuit {{quality of the}} radio communication systems, and the rain attenuation probability predictionmethod is used to predict the <b>circuit</b> <b>availability</b> of them. The existing rain attenuationprobability prediction method for the terrestrial radio communication systems was establishedalmost 38 years ago, and {{so far it has}} been used with several improvements, however, it should bere-evaluated from the view point of accuracy and applicability for the following reasons; (a) theapplication of the radio communication systems at {{the frequencies}} above almost 10 GHz becomesdiversified, (b) the rainfall statistical nature could be changed in recent years by climatic changessuch as the Global Warming phenomenon and Heat Island phenomenon. This paper summarizesthe study aimed at the establishment of the accurate and flexibly applicable new rain attenuationprobability prediction method. In chapter- 2, background information is prepared to be helpful for understanding about rainattenuation probability prediction. To establish the new rain attenuation probability predictionmethod, rainfall data at sufficient numbers of locations in the whole country are needed and onlyAMeDAS rainfall data provided by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) could be available forthis purpose. It is considered that cumulative distribution function (CDF) of rainfall rate forshorter interval is required to predict rain attenuation probability accurately, however it is knownthat time-averaged value of rainfall rate for every 1 -minute (1 -minute rainfall rate) is sufficientbecause rain attenuation on a radio link is an integration of point rain attenuations along a radiopath. In chapter- 3, equipments and configurations of rainfall and rain attenuation measurements forthe study are shown. In chapter- 4, it is discussed about the method to obtain 1 -minute rainfall rate CDFs accuratelyfrom the AMeDAS low resolution (0. 5 mm) 1 -minute rainfall data measured by tipping bucket raingauge. The study was done using the data measured by high resolution (0. 0083 mm) dropcounting rain gauge (DCRG) and the artificial 1 -minute rainfall data (same as AMeDAS data) made from the DCRG data (summing up 0. 0083 mm and counting at each 0. 5 mm). As a resultof the study, the second-base distribution process with random positioning of 0. 5 mm count pulsewithin each pulse counted minute is proposed as the effective method. In chapter- 5, it is discussed about the suitable distribution model for the rain attenuationprobability prediction method applicable {{in a wide range of}} probability. As a result of the studyabout the capability of approximation to 1 -minute rainfall rate CDFs obtained from the AMeDAS 1 -minute rainfall data at 136 locations, it is shown that M-distribution has superior capability toGamma distribution, Log-normal distribution and Conditional Log-normal distribution. In chapter- 6, it is shown that the spatial correlation characteristics can be approximated well byexp(-a d) for longer distance part and by exp(- bd) for shorter distance part (“d” is distance ／border is located between 2 and 3 km) as a result of the analysis of rainfall data measured at 11 locations around Otemachi in Tokyo. Also, considering that the rain attenuation coefficient(rain attenuation per kilometer) is proportional to n-th power of rainfall rate (“n” = 0. 63 ~ 1. 7 /ITU-R Rec. P. 838 - 3), it is shown that the spatial correlation characteristics vary remarkablydepending on the value of “n”, and the equations to approximate the relation between “n” and thecoefficient of the spatial correlation characteristics “α and β” are given. Furthermore, themethod to integrate a CDF of n-th power of point 1 -minute rainfall rate along a radio path usingthe spatial correlation characteristics of n-th power of 1 -minute rainfall rate is given. In chapter- 7, it is discussed about the method to obtain a 1 -minute rainfall rate CDF accuratelyfrom different integration time rainfall data such as AMeDAS 10 and 60 minutes rainfall data. As a result of the study using AMeDAS rainfall data at 136 locations, the effective conversionmethod based on M-distribution using a mean value and a standard deviation of a real probabilitydistribution of 10 and 60 minutes rainfall data is proposed. In chapter- 8, on the basis of results of the studies in chapter- 5 and - 6, the new M-distributionbased rain attenuation probability prediction method is proposed. The proposed method utilizesthe two types of spatial correlation characteristics and the integation process of 1 -minute rainfallrate CDF along a radio path shown in chapter- 6. The comparison of the rain attenuation CDFsobtained from the measured rain attenuation data and obtained by the proposed and existingprediction methods shows that the proposed prediction method gives superior accuracy to theexisting prediction method. In chapter- 9, the 0. 01 % and 0. 0001 % values of 1 -minute rainfall rate CDFs for long years(1976 to 2002 as longest) at 1150 locations in Japan obtained applying above methods (chapter- 4 and 7) to AMeDAS rainfall data are shown as the parameters for the proposed prediction method. The prepared parameters include not only the mean value but also the standard deviation andunique two additional factors related to the concept of safety factor so that the proposed predictionmethod makes it possible to predict rain attenuation probability corresponding to expected MTBF(Mean Time Between Failure / in this case Failure means occurrence of unsatisfactory condition). 電気通信大学 200...|$|E

Although diminution in d-serine level has {{been implicated in}} NMDA receptor hypofunction, which is thought to occur in schizophrenia, {{the source of the}} precursor l-serine and its role in d-serine metabolism in adult brain have yet to be determined. We investigated whether l-serine synthesized in brain via the phosphorylated pathway is essential for d-serine synthesis by generating mice with a conditional deletion of d- 3 -phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh; EC 1. 1. 1. 95). This enzyme catalyzes the first step in l-serine synthesis via the phosphorylated pathway. HPLC analysis of serine enantiomers demonstrated that both l- and d-serine levels were markedly decreased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of conditional knock-out mice, whereas the serine deficiency did not alter protein expression levels of serine racemase and NMDA receptor subunits in these regions. The present study provides definitive proof that l-serine-synthesized endogenously via the phosphorylated pathway is a key rate-limiting factor for maintaining steady-state levels of d-serine in adult brain. Furthermore, NMDA-evoked transcription of Arc, an immediate early gene, was diminished in the hippocampus of conditional knock-out mice. Thus, this study demonstrates that in mature neuronal <b>circuits</b> l-serine <b>availability</b> determines the rate of d-serine synthesis in the forebrain and controls NMDA receptor function at least in the hippocampus...|$|R

N 2 KO mice become obese due to reduced {{physical activity in}} the absence of hyperphagia making them a unique mouse model for the study weight gain, obesity and energy expenditure. Signals that regulate Nhlh 2 and the effects of Nhlh 2 on peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. ^ The research presented here utilized numerous techniques to investigate the effects of changes in energy availability on Nhlh 2 expression. We show that Nhlh 2 expression decreases significantly with food deprivation and cold exposure. Nhlh 2 expression is stimulated with food return or leptin injection following food deprivation or return to room temperature following cold exposure. These data suggest that Nhlh 2 gene expression responds positively to increased energy availability and negatively to reduced energy availability. These findings combined with the phenotype of N 2 KO mice led us to propose that Nhlh 2 integrates energy availability inputs in various hypothalamic nuclei to drive expression of genes required for body weight maintenance. ^ Investigation into peripheral tissues in N 2 KO mice revealed that responses of genes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, muscle, and brown and white adipose tissue to changes in energy availability require Nhlh 2 expression. The responses of serum total T 4 levels and UCP 1 mRNA and UCP 3 mRNA to energy availability signals are altered in N 2 KO mice. In addition, N 2 KO mice maintain body temperature with cold exposure but are unable to maintain body weight. In summary, my work provides new insight into the role of Nhlh 2 in coordinating energy availability signals to downstream genes required for body weight maintenance and thermoregulation. ...|$|R
