40|$|In {{the recent}} few years, {{there has been}} an {{observed}} trend of US legacy carriers putting more emphasis on international traffic than domestic, i. e. expanding international capacity while decreasing their domestic capacity.

40|$|Abstract—As both {{end-to-end}} network {{reliability and}} performance becomes {{a growing concern}} for large distributed organizations, <b>carriers</b> <b>face</b> an increasing pressure to offer enhanced network services with higher Quality of Service (QoS). Such premier services are exemplified by wide-area virtual private networks (VPN) with QoS guarantees, or QVPNs, for which users can specify bandwidth, latency, and reliability requirements. From a carrier’s standpoint, the primary challenge is to set up faulttolerant routes for each QVPN request across its network with user-specified reliability and performance guarantees and, at the same time, maximize the total number of QVPNs that its network can support at any instant. We propose a Fault Tolerant Load Balancing Routing (FTLBR) algorithm to select fault-tolerant routes for QVPNs. FTLBR maintains network-wide load balance while selecting primary and backup routes for QVPNs and performs resource sharing along backup routes to achieve an overall high network resource utilization efficiency. FTLBR is able to avoid formation of bottleneck links during primary-backup route selection by employing a simple quantitative metric that effectively captures network-wide load balance. Simulation results show that FTLBR can support significantly higher number of QVPNs when compared with existing traffic engineering algorithms. I...|$|R

The quest of increased efficiency will, however, not be for the most efficient supply chain if some stakeholders are left out, which previous literature shows has commonly been the case of motor carriers.

The focus {{of this paper is}} on motor carriers' transport operations with the purpose of examining their efficiency issues and analyzing the effects of supply chain management on their operations.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{focus of}} this paper is to study carrier pricing decisions for a type of vehicle routing problems defined in a competitive and dynamic environment. This paper introduces the vehicle routing problem in a competitive environment (VRPCE) as an extension of the traveling-salesman problem with profits (TSPP) to a dynamic competitive auction environment. In the VRPCE, the carrier must estimate the incremental cost of servicing new service requests as they arrive dynamically. The paper presents a rigorous and precise treatment of the sequential pricing and costing problem that a <b>carrier</b> <b>faces</b> in such an environment. The sequential pricing problem presented here is an intrinsic feature of a sequential auction problem.

However, due to the fragile nature of nucleic acid, the application of RNAi as a safe and efficient <b>carrier</b> <b>faces</b> great challenges. In this contribution, a self-assembly regime, which is based on well-defined cationic polylactides (CPLAs) with tertiary amine groups, has been used to encapsulate and protect siRNAs from fast degradation. CPLA is a safe and degradable formulation that allowed us to deliver siRNAs targeting the proangiogenic chemokine interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) to pancreatic cancer cells for gene therapy. Stable IL- 8 siRNA–CPLA nanoplexes were successfully formed by electrostatic force and high gene transfection efficiencies were shown on two pancreatic cancer cell lines. We did not observe any cytotoxicity from these CPLAs over a large concentration range via cell viability evaluations. More importantly, the silencing of IL- 8 gene expression significantly attenuated the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. Our preliminary results support the future development of gene therapy that might provide an effective and safe treatment approach towards pancreatic cancer.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of ganglioside GM 1 in intact rat liver Golgi-derived vesicles is stimulated by phosphatidylglycerol as much (about 20 -fold) as by Triton X- 100. The antibiotic tunicamycin inhibits strongly the synthesis, {{in the presence}} {{as well as in}} the absence of the phospholipid, but has no effect when Golgi membranes are solubilized with detergent. In Pronase-treated Golgi vesicles, which retain full enzyme activity, both phospholipid dependence and tunicamycin inhibition of the synthesis disappear completely. When freshly prepared Golgi vesicles are incubated with 125 microM UDP-[3 H]Gal for 10 min at 30 degrees C, the nucleotide sugar is found to be transported into the vesicles at an approximate rate of about 85 pmol/mg of protein per min, 92 % of which remains firmly bound to the membrane. Tunicamycin inhibits this transport in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate the existence of carrier proteins in rat liver Golgi vesicles, which mediate the transport of the sugar nucleotide UDP-Gal, and that the <b>carriers</b> <b>face</b> the cytoplasmic side of the vesicles.

This model facilitates carrier to value the bid price for interested packages that involve with pattern of transportation service under different competitive environment. The results of analysis with hypotheses in regression model reveal significantly that a pattern of transportation service, a number of competitors, and a pre-empty backhaul to new lane distance ratio with number of competitors do impact negatively on a bid-to-cost ratio of carrier, whereas a pre-empty backhaul to new lane distance ratio does impact positively on a bid-to-cost ratio of carrier in combinatorial transportation auction. To find optimal bid price for interested packages in the incomplete information game, the empirical study in stochastic optimization problem with Monte Carlo method can provide the best solution for carrier in order to acquire the maximum expected profit in the auction.

40|$|Abstract-The dynamic vehicle {{allocation}} problem {{arises when}} a motor carrier must simultaneously and {{in real time}} coordinate the dispatching of vehicles from one region to the next all over the country. The decision to send a vehicle loaded or empty from one region to the next, arriving in the destination region {{at some point in}} the future, must anticipate the downstream impacts of the decision. The consequences of another load in a particuiar region {{at some point in the}} future, however, are highly uncertain. A simple methodology is proposed which calculates approximately the marginal value of an additional vehicle in each region in the future. This information is then used to generate a standard pure network which can be efficiently optimized to give dispatching decisions for today. The dynamic vehicle allocation problem arises when a carrier must manage the positioning of a fleet of vehicles over time. The application motivating this paper arises from truckload motor carriers where a shipper might request a trailer to carry a load of freight from one city to the next on a given day. The shipper pays for the entire tractor-trailer combination and there is no issue of consolidating shipments on one trailer. The problem the <b>carrier</b> <b>faces</b> is one of anticipating the needs of shippers by ensuring that trailers are in the right place at the right time.

40|$|Abstract—We study an {{approach}} to quality-of-service (QoS) that offers end-users the choice between two service classes defined according to their level of transmission protection. The fully protected (FP) class offers end-users a guarantee of survivability {{in the case of}} a single-link failure; all FP traffic is protected using a 1 : 1 protection scheme at the wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) layer. The best effort protected (BEP) class is not protected; instead restoration at the IP layer is provided. The FP service class mimics what Internet users receive today. The BEP traffic is designed to run over the large amounts of unused bandwidth that exist in today’s Internet. The goal is to increase the load carried on backbone networks without reducing the QoS received by existing customers. To support two such services, we have to solve two problems: the off-line problem of mapping logical links to pairs of disjoint fiber paths, and an on-line scheduling problem for differentiating packets from two classes at the IP layer. We provide an algorithm based on a Tabu Search meta-heuristic to solve the mapping problem, and a simple but efficient scheduler based on weighted fair queueing for service differentiation at the IP layer. We consider numerous requirements that <b>carriers</b> <b>face</b> and illustrate the tradeoffs they induce. We demonstrate that we can successfully increase the total network load by a factor between three and ten and still meet all the carrier requirements.
