50|$|The Port of Alexandria {{is on the}} West Verge of the Nile Delta {{between the}} Mediterranean Sea and Mariut Lake in Alexandria, Egypt. Considered the second most {{important}} city and the main port in Egypt, it handles over three quarters of Egyptâ€™s foreign trade. Alexandria port consists of two harbours (East and West) separated by a T-shaped peninsula. The East harbour is shallow and is not navigable by large vessels. The West harbour is used for commercial shipping. The harbour is formed by two <b>converging</b> <b>breakwaters.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1890 it {{had about}} 1,500 inhabitants, but boomed when the Koninklijke Nederlandse Hoogovens {{steelworks}} settled in IJmuiden in 1918. At that time shipping {{was at a}} low, because during World War I minesweepers laid many mines {{off the coast of}} IJmuiden. Also the canal mouth needed constant dredging due to the littoral drift in both directions on an open, sandy coast, due to winds blowing alternately from opposite quarters, sand accumulates in the sheltered angles outside the harbour between each <b>converging</b> <b>breakwater</b> and the shore.|$|R
50|$|The bay {{is divided}} into an outer and inner deep water harbor. The triangular, 94 acre outer harbor is man-made, {{protected}} by two <b>converging</b> rubble <b>breakwaters</b> and maintained {{to a depth of}} 43 ft. The west breakwater has a length of 3500 ft and the east breakwater is 3950 ft. The 96 acre inner harbor is natural but dredged to maintain a minimum depth of 13 ft. The two harbors are connected by a channel 436 ft wide and 43 ft deep.|$|R
