40|$|The paper {{discusses}} advantages {{provided by}} electronically controlled hydraulically activated valves (ECVs) {{when applied to}} low heat rejection (LHR) engines. The ECV concept provides additional engine control flexibility by allowing for a variable valve timing {{as a function of}} speed and load, or for a given transient condition. The results of a study carried out to assess the benefits that this flexibility can offer to an LHR engine indicated that, when judged on the benefits to BSFC, volumetric efficiency, and peak firing pressure, ECVs would provide only modest benefits in comparison to conventional valve profiles. It is noted, however, that once installed on the engine, the ECVs would permit a whole range of certain more sophisticated variable valve timing strategies not otherwise possible, such as high compression <b>cranking,</b> <b>engine</b> braking, cylinder cutouts, and volumetric efficiency timing with engine speed...|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{the exact}} ratio of fuel ethanol to {{hydrocarbon}} may {{vary according to}} ASTM 5798 that specifies the allowable ethanol content in E85 as ranging from 51% to 83%.

50|$|The short {{dwell time}} that a crank {{produces}} {{does not provide a}} more-or-less constant volume for the combustion event to take place in. A crank system reaches significant mechanical advantage at 6° before TDC; it then reaches maximum advantage at 45° to 50°. This limits the burn time to less than 60°. Also, the quickly descending piston lowers the pressure ahead of the flame front, reducing the burn time. This means less time to burn under lower pressure. This dynamic is why in all <b>crank</b> <b>engines</b> a significant amount of the fuel is burned not above the piston, where its power can be extracted, but in the catalytic converter, which only produces heat.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} numerical estimation method for vehicle interior sound and vibration based on 5. 4 L V 8 engine radiated sound and mount vibration and to quantify the contributions of vibroacoustic paths to vehicle interior sound and vibration. The modal analysis included acoustic and mechanical excitation of the frame and body assembly of a light truck. It was performed to estimate the sound and vibration transmission characteristics from the engine compartment to vehicle interior. The respective frequency response functions were then combined with frequency based source (engine radiated sound and forces transmitted through the mounts) data to estimate the response at the receivers. The response was characterized as the binaural sound pressure and driver 2 ̆ 7 s seat track triaxial acceleration. The results were verified by actual vehicle interior sound and vibration measurements and subjective (jury) evaluations at relevant operating conditions. The subjective evaluations indicated that, despite similar overall levels measured, the differences in perceived sound may still exist and are {{due to differences in}} transfer path contribution to interior sound, as seen from interaural sound measurements (between left and right ear). The adverse changes in interior vibration comfort were related to the change in rate of change of acceleration known as jerk. The Z-direction acceleration of the seat was found to be sufficient in describing interior vibration; the directions of vibration were indiscernible by the jury in subjective evaluations. Although there were slight differences in transfer path contribution the effect of using a more production efficient cast iron <b>crank</b> <b>engine</b> compared to a more durable steel <b>crank</b> <b>engine,</b> both used in the study, is negligible in terms of interior sound and vibration as indicated in estimated, objective and subjective results.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlets) of two vehicles. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, {{the amount of}} current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for <b>cranking.</b> The <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> motor current draw will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Many vehicles turn off the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory or on position to connect the cigarette lighter outlet to the battery.|$|R
30|$|The {{synchronous}} machine model and parameters {{can be found}} in the Simulink SimPowerSystems library and follows the model in [13]. The clutch modifies the torque transmitted to the {{synchronous machine}} [6, 8] and the diesel engine speed [8]. When locking the clutch, a maximum speed difference of 10 − 5 is acceptable. Similar to the studies in [6, 7], the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> dynamics are avoided. To avoid the unnecessary diesel <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> dynamics, the <b>engine</b> rest state is simulated at a speed of 0.3 p.u. Thus, although the engine is considered stopped, the simulated value would remain at 0.3 p.u. Since the cranking delay will affect the readiness of the DG to provide frequency regulation, a 0.5  s delay is added as cranking time to the DG model [6, 7]. Thus, the diesel engine start will be delayed by 0.5  s when the speed increases from 0.3 p.u.|$|R
