5|$|Summary {{of battles}} of the 5th USCC. All except the October 2 & 21, 1864 battles had Carpenter present in the <b>command</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{contained the}} brigade's senior <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> including its Headquarters and Headquarters Company, {{as well as}} communication and support elements. Activated in 2000 from inactivating support units, the Special Troops Battalion deployed with the 173d Airborne Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan in 2007 until 2008 and again in early 2010.|$|E
5|$|The <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> is hierarchical, with {{divisions}} and brigades controlling groups of units. Major units are regiment- or battalion-sized, and minor units are company-sized units (or platoons). All units are Regular (full-time) or Army Reserve (part-time).|$|E
5000|$|NIMS {{standard}} incident <b>command</b> <b>structures</b> {{are based}} on three key organizational systems: ...|$|R
25|$|Several other {{military}} organizations exist that {{are independent of}} the Army and Navy <b>command</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Council went on {{to demand}} the disbandment of {{paramilitary}} organisations including the Koevoet and their <b>command</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{division}} underwent major reorganization in 2006. A special troops battalion {{was added}} to the division's <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> and its three brigades were redesignated. It as organized around three brigades; the 30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team of North Carolina, the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of Virginia, and the Combat Aviation Brigade, 29th Infantry Division of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{membership}} of the organization at this time remained largely static. In 1974, {{as a consequence of}} the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> but, with Turkish cooperation, were readmitted in 1980. The Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina did not result in NATO involvement because article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty specifies that collective self-defence is only applicable to attacks on member state territories north of the Tropic of Cancer. On 30May 1982, NATO gained a new member when the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance; Spain's membership was confirmed by referendum in 1986. At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5,252,800 active military, including as many as 435,000 forward deployed US forces, under a <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organized into four echelons.|$|E
5|$|By default {{this list}} sorts alphabetically. Indian and Nepalese {{convention}} {{is for the}} family name first and the given name second; this is reflected in this list. The rank column sorts by the rank of the recipient {{at the time of}} the action. This column sorts by the comparative rank of the recipient within the British Armed Forces <b>command</b> <b>structure.</b> Within the British Armed Forces the Navy is the Senior Service, followed by the Army and then the Royal Air Force (RAF).|$|E
2500|$|The rank {{structure}} of the Irish Army is organised along standard military rank and <b>command</b> <b>structures.</b> These consist of the following ranks: ...|$|R
25|$|The Irish Army Reserve is {{organised}} {{along the}} same rank and <b>command</b> <b>structures</b> as the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF), however there are some differences.|$|R
50|$|In mid-November 2016, it {{was officially}} {{confirmed}} that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO <b>command</b> <b>structures</b> had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.|$|R
5|$|Croatian {{forces were}} {{hampered}} by an inadequate <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> poor coordination and lack heavy weapons. The battle {{resulted in more}} than 200 combat deaths, and established lines of control which would remain unchanged until 1994, when the plateau was recaptured by the HVO. In 2012, Republika Srpska authorities charged seven Croats with war crimes committed at the plateau against civilians and prisoners of war. The next year, Croatian authorities charged 21 former JNA members with war crimes against HVO prisoners captured at the Kupres Plateau.|$|E
5|$|Dedaković's second-in-command, Branko Borković, {{was another}} former JNA {{officer who had}} volunteered for service in Vukovar. The two men {{established}} a unified <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> organised the defenders into a single brigade and implemented an integrated defence system. A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade. The defenders used a network of cellars, canals, ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II a regional <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> was subsequently adopted, with 2 MD becoming Eastern Command, 5 MD redesignated Western Command, while 1 MD in Queensland became Northern Command and the three southern states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania were amalgamated into Southern Command. In {{the early years of}} the war this structure proved effective for operations overseas; however, as the threat of war with Japan grew the various commands and military districts came under greater pressure. The activation of the Militia for full-time duty after Japan's entry into the war in late 1941 compounded the situation. In response, the Army <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> was reorganised in early 1942. While Western Australia remained unchanged, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia were redesignated as Lines of Communications Areas, 7 MD became Northern Territory Force and 8 MD was redesignated as New Guinea Force. In July 1942 the Military Board's functions were assumed by the commander of the military forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey.|$|E

50|$|The {{decision}} to de-activate the command was announced on 20 April 2011. The move {{is said to}} need 12-18 months for completion {{and is expected to}} reduce costs while realigning necessary functions under other <b>command</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
50|$|U.S. <b>command</b> <b>structures</b> {{continued}} to emerge. On February 8, Paul D. Harkins, then Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Pacific, under Pacific Command, {{was promoted to}} general and assigned to command the new Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MAC-V).|$|R
5|$|In mid-1976 the {{military}} <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> was simple and direct. Major General Samantar {{was not only}} commander of the National Army – and therefore commander of the organizationally subordinated navy and air force- but also {{secretary of state for}} defence and a vice president of SRC and thus a member of the major decision-making body of the government. Holding the two highest.. posts, he stood alone in the <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> between the army and President Siad, the head of state. When in July 1976 the SRC relinquished its power to the newly appointed SSRP, Samantar retained the portfolio of the Ministry of Defense. The country's real power appeared to be in the SSRP's Politburo, of which Samantar became a vice president. Before {{the military}} coup, command channels ran directly from the commander of the National Army to army sector commanders who exercised authority over military forces.. in the field, and by 1986 combat units had been reorganized along Soviet lines. There is no indication that either the chain of command to lower echelons or the organisation of combat units has changed significantly since the coup.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{lightning}} campaign {{exposed the}} Austrian indecisive <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> and poor supply apparatus. Mack completely misread the French dispositions and scattered his forces; as the French defeated each unit separately, the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications. Napoleon arrived to take personal command {{of close to}} 80,000men. At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his encircled army of 20,000infantry and 3,273cavalry. The officers were released {{on the condition that}} they not serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians, an agreement to which they held.|$|E
5|$|On establishment, {{the force}} {{consisted}} of one mounted division, one infantry brigade and four infantry battalions (equivalent {{to a second}} infantry brigade without brigade support troops or a <b>command</b> <b>structure),</b> five batteries, six sections of artillery and transport consisting of 20 lorries, 17 tractors, 34 trucks, 300 donkeys, 11,000 horses and mules. Eight days later an additional 70 donkeys, 65 lorries in the 1040 Motor Transport Company, 110 camels in 'M' Company Camel Transport Corps, were added.|$|E
5000|$|Though the {{previous}} level specifies {{details of the}} implementation, the outputs of this stage are implementation-independent and concentrate on the requirements for the human computer interface. The logical design specifies the main methods of interaction in terms of menu <b>structures</b> and <b>command</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
50|$|The combat {{forces of}} the Army are {{organised}} into three combat divisions and participate in multi-national <b>command</b> <b>structures</b> at the corps level. The Air Force maintains three divisions and the Navy is structured into two flotillas. The Joint Support Service and the Joint Medical Service are both organized in four regional <b>commands</b> of identical <b>structure.</b> All of these services also have general commands for training, procurement, and other general issues.|$|R
50|$|The BVE, as {{with all}} of the local {{volunteer}} units, was demobilised in 1946 following the end of the war. Whereas the BVRC and the BMA maintained skeleton <b>command</b> <b>structures</b> until they began recruiting again in 1951, the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers was officially disbanded.|$|R
5|$|The 10th Mountain Division Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion is {{a special}} troops {{battalion}} of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Drum, New York. It is the organization for the command elements of the 10th Mountain Division. The Battalion contains the Division's senior <b>command</b> <b>structure,</b> including its Headquarters and Headquarters Company, as well as communications, intelligence, operational and support elements {{as well as the}} Division Band which provide services to any units assigned to the Headquarters at a time.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army's <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> {{fell apart}} as Bagration was {{evacuated}} {{from the battlefield}} and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick with a cold and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was hesitant to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E
5|$|The Allied <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> in the South West Pacific Area {{faced the}} {{challenges}} of coalition warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E
50|$|The {{publishing}} of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review required further alterations to the 20th Support <b>Command’s</b> <b>structure,</b> organization, {{manning and}} equipment {{in order to}} meet its new requirement to stand-up and serve as the headquarters for the Joint Task Force for Elimination of WMD (JTF-E).|$|R
50|$|The {{basic idea}} is to use CERT to perform {{the large number of}} tasks needed in emergencies. This frees highly trained {{professional}} responders for more technical tasks. Much of CERT training concerns the Incident Command System and organization, so CERT members fit easily into larger <b>command</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{foundation of}} that system was {{an extension of the}} nomadic lifestyle of the Mongols. Other elements were invented by Genghis Khan, his generals, and his successors. Technologies useful to attack fortifications were adapted from other cultures, and foreign technical experts integrated into the <b>command</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Australian {{contribution}} to the 1991 Gulf War {{was the first time}} Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and clearance diving team deployed to the Persian Gulf did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF's capabilities and <b>command</b> <b>structure.</b> Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions imposed on Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and logistical support and was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{public and}} much of the {{military}} <b>command</b> <b>structure</b> were kept in the dark about the extent of the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy command personnel were accurately informed of the carrier and pilot losses. Consequently, even the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) continued to believe, for at least a short time, that the fleet was in good condition.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the BVE was demobilised in 1946, as {{were the}} other three territorials and the Home Guard. The BVRC and the BMA {{maintained}} skeleton <b>command</b> <b>structures</b> 'til they began recruiting again in 1951. The BVE, however, with its two main roles becoming obsolete, was disbanded completely.|$|R
