40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between fertility and fatty acid (FA) profiles of egg <b>chorions,</b> total egg, and sperm cells of Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus (L.) broodstock housed in tanks and fed a commercial diet. Fertility of semen from individual males was assessed using pooled eggs, and vice versa. Fertility of the gametes of broodstock fish was classified according to the percentages of eyed stage embryos into: (a) for males, high, ≥ 68 %, medium: 49 – 67 % and low: ≤ 48 %; (b) for females, high: ≥ 55 %; medium: 28 – 54 % and low: ≤ 27 %. Spermatozoa from the high fertility group contained less short-chain saturated FAs, more n- 3 and n- 6 FAs with a higher n- 3 to n- 6 ratio compared to the sperm from the low fertility group. Egg <b>chorions</b> from the high fertility group also had less short-chain saturated FAs compared to the low fertility group. For spermatozoa significant correlations were found between C 15 : 0, total saturated FAs, C 22 : 5 n- 3, C 22 : 6 n- 3, total n- 3 FAs, and the ratios of n- 3 to n- 6 and their fertility, but no correlations were found between fatty acid profiles of egg <b>chorions</b> and of total eggs and egg fertility.

5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, {{like those}} of other insects, are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the <b>chorion</b> protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
5|$|While escaping, {{the newly}} hatched larvae of many species {{sometimes}} eat the <b>chorion</b> to emerge. Alternatively, the egg shell {{may have a}} line of weakness around the cap which gives way allowing the larva to emerge. The egg shell and {{a small amount of}} yolk trapped in the amniotic membranes forms the first food for most lepidopteran larvae.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the <b>chorion.</b> This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT•Two {{types of}} {{evidence}} for insect ovipositional activity (i. e., actual egg <b>chorions</b> and ovipositional damage) occur on Nilssoniopteris (bennettitalean foliage) leaf cuticles from the Carnian of Austria and provide a rare direct insight into insect egg morphology and oviposition in the Late Triassic. The egg <b>chorions</b> have exclusively been found on N. haidingeri leaves, where they {{are attached to the}} outer surface of the abaxial cuticle; one specimen suggests that the eggs were arranged in circles. It is impossible at present to determine the affinities of the eggs; possible producers may be beetles, dragonflies, sawflies, or other allied basal Hymenoptera. Ovipositional damage occurs on N. angustiar leaves in the form of lenticular egg impressions surrounded by a narrow, elevated margin. The impressions are visible on the ad- and abaxial cuticle, and coincide when both cuticles are superimposed, which indicates that the eggs producing these impressions were injected into the interior of the leaf. Producers of eggs that may have caused these damages are perhaps dragonflies or damselflies. The restricted occurrence of the two types of ovipositional activity suggests that some kind of host specificity existed, perhaps related to specific preferences in larval diet...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive biology in the Twentieth Century {{produced}} comprehensive {{descriptions of}} the mechanisms of egg formation {{in most of the}} major orders of insects. While many general principles of ovarian development and physiology emerged, every order turned out to have a set of its own special motifs. Discovery of the lepidopteran motifs is summarized in this essay. The emphasis is on developmental mechanisms, beginning with the early growth and differentiation of female germ cells and ending, after many turns in morphogenesis, physiology and biosynthesis, with eggs that are filled with yolk and encased in <b>chorions.</b> Examples of uniquely lepidopteran traits include the cellular composition of ovarian follicles, the number of tubular ovarioles in which they mature, the functions of cell-to-cell junctional complexes in their maturation, their use of glycosaminoglycans to maintain intercellular patency during vitellogenesis, the role of proton and calcium pumps in their ion physiology, a separate postvitellogenic period of water and inorganic ion uptake, and the fine structure and protein composition of their <b>chorions.</b> Discovery of this combination of idiosyncracies was based on advances in the general concepts and techniques of cell and molecular biology and on insights borrowed from studies on other insects.

5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} {{in direct contact with}} the fetal <b>chorion</b> like it does in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (<b>chorion)</b> {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the <b>chorion</b> two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E
5|$|The social {{structure}} of the Byzantine Greeks was primarily supported by a rural, agrarian base that consisted of the peasantry, and {{a small fraction of}} the poor. These peasants lived within three kinds of settlements: the <b>chorion</b> or village, the agridion or hamlet, and the proasteion or estate. Many civil disturbances that occurred during the time of the Byzantine Empire were attributed to political factions within the Empire rather than to this large popular base. Soldiers among the Byzantine Greeks were at first conscripted amongst the rural peasants and trained on an annual basis. As the Byzantine Empire entered the 11th century, more of the soldiers within the army were either professional men-at-arms or mercenaries.|$|E

If both fetuses are the same sex this is of no significance, but if they are different, male hormones pass from the male twin to the female twin. The male hormones (testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone) then masculinize the female twin, and the result is a freemartin. [...] The degree of masculinization is greater if the fusion occurs earlier in the pregnancy - in about ten percent of cases no fusion takes place and the female remains fertile.|$|R

5|$|Eggs are {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the <b>chorion,</b> they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this eclosion process, the larvae work to make the exit hole larger than their heads. Larvae {{spend the rest of}} the time making a silk meshwork around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.|$|E

Depending on friction, sheet flexibility and thickness, we identify four distinct morphological phases emerging from bifurcation and present the corresponding phase diagram. Four order parameters quantifying the transitions between these phases are proposed. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|Ophryocystis elektroscirrha {{is usually}} {{transmitted}} from females to their offspring when the females scatter spores on their egg <b>chorions</b> and surfaces of milkweed leaves, the host plant of monarchs and queens, during oviposition (egg laying). Milkweeds contains toxins that partially protect monarch larvae. The spores are ingested by the larvae. After they enter a host's gut, the spores open and emerging sporozoites penetrate a larva's gut wall and migrate to its hypoderm (the layer of cells that secrete the larva's cuticle), where they undergo two phases of vegetative reproduction. After the caterpillar pupates, O. elektroscirrha starts reproducing sexually. Three days before adults emerge, developing parasite spores {{can be seen}} through their pupal integuments. The adult butterflies emerge covered with spores, mostly on their abdomens. Parasites do not continue to replicate on adult butterflies and spores must be eaten by larvae before they can cause new infections.|$|R

40|$|In Melissotarsus beccarii and M. weissi, two ant species which damage trees by digging nest {{galleries}} in bark, we observed numerous egg-producing physogastric queens situated {{more than one}} meter from each other, but within the same colony, making this the first record of oligogyny in this genus. Our analysis of ovarian development and degree of mandible wear reveals that a temporal polyethism exists and that gynes perform the worker duty of digging galleries. This is a new and previously unreported case of worker-like behaviour in gynes. These ants appear to follow a dynamic process wherein newly-inseminated gynes accepted by colonies perform worker-like tasks and do not produce eggs until they {{have the opportunity to}} dominate their own section of the colony and become physogastric.

40|$|Lampreys {{are one of}} {{the most}} basal animals in which many of the true {{vertebrate}} characteristics (e. g., neural crest, placodes, segmented brain, skull, paired sensory organs, pharyngeal skeleton) are present. Studying the molecular and developmental mechanisms responsible for the formation of these structures in lamprey and higher vertebrates can provide insight into how these vertebrate characteristics evolved. The relative ease of obtaining mature adults and embryos makes this animal an ideal model for investigations into early vertebrate evolution. In addition, studies of features that are unique to lampreys can provide insights into mechanisms of parallel evolution. Lamprey embryos are particularly amenable to injection techniques. Like zebrafish and Xenopus embryos, they have double <b>chorions</b> and are resistant to surface-tension-induced rupture when removed from liquid. They can therefore be injected in a dry dish; this eliminates the need to support the embryo while performing injections and makes the procedure very rapid. Also, a single ovulating female can contain up to 100, 000 eggs, so the number of injectable embryos per fertilization is not a limiting factor. Finally, the second division lasts for several hours, providing a very large injection window. This protocol describes how to microinject RNA and morpholinos into lamprey embryos for genetic modification studies...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Multiple pregnancies were {{obtained}} in cows treated with gonadotrophic hormones and the fetuses were removed 39 to 62 days after mating. This covers {{the period of}} sexual organogenesis in males from the initial differentiation of the testes to the final establishment of most male structures. Twenty-nine pregnancies resulting in hetero-sexual fetuses with fused <b>chorions</b> and vascular anastomoses provided forty-eight presumptive freemartins. The genital tract was studied histologically and gonadal size {{was determined by the}} paper weight method. No difference was observed between control females and presumptive freemartins up to 48 days. Thereafter, growth of the presumptive ovaries practically stopped in freemartins and the diameter of the upper part of their Mł=u" decreased, as in males. Contrary to older views, the first freemartin effects occurred at the same stage (49 to 52 days) in all the presumptive freemartins. Ovarian and Mł=u" begins simultaneously and a significant correlation between the degree of inhibition of both structures was obtained. The penis, scrotum and prostate were absent in all free-martins until Day 60. In only one case was the ano-genital distance slightly increased. A delayed appearance of seminal vesicles was found in three out of seven freemartins at 61 and 62 days. There was a notable absence of seminiferous tubules in the gonads of all these freemartins. It is suggested that if these tubules are present after birth it is because they have developed later. The factors responsible for the freemartin effect still remain to be discovered. Ovarian and Mł=u" occur during the period of time when the external genitalia of males become masculinized. This suggests that a factor of male origin which inhibits both the ovaries and the Mł=u" and which is distinct from the masculinizing hor-mone could be involved. Other possibilities are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|The larva {{inside the}} egg becomes fully {{developed}} in about {{one month after}} being laid and then enters diapause to overwinter. The egg is in the overwintering stage lasting for eight or nine months. Development ceases {{in preparation for the}} winter. After an acclimation stage, during which the larva inside the egg reduces its water content, eggs can withstand freezing temperatures. The larva inside the egg resumes activity in the spring, and reabsorbs water.

25|$|There are {{two layers}} of mesoderm; intraembryonic and extraembryonic. As the intraembryonic layer grows laterally, it becomes {{continuous}} with the extraembryonic layer, forming the <b>chorion</b> (contributing to the blood supply). At the same time during embryonic development, the ectoderm begins to thicken and fold upward, forming the neural folds, which eventually meet to form the neural tube and neural crest. Because these two events occur {{at roughly the same}} time in embryological development, abnormalities found in this syndrome can involve not only the ectodermal cells, but also disruption to development in the mesectodermal layer constituted by the neural crest.|$|E
25|$|Relaxin is {{a hormone}} {{produced}} mainly by the corpus luteum of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females.

In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of collagen thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, tendons, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.|$|E
40|$|Insects {{are often}} {{attacked}} by multiple natural enemies, imposing dynamic selective pressures {{for the development}} and maintenance of enemy-specific resistance. Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) have emerged as models {{for the study of}} variation in resistance against natural enemies, including parasitoid wasps. Internal defenses against their most common parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi, are sourced through two known mechanisms- 1) endogenously encoded resistance or 2) infection with the heritable bacterial symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa. Levels of resistance can range from nearly 0 - 100 % against A. ervi but varies based on aphid genotype and the strain of toxin-encoding bacteriophage (called APSE) carried by Hamiltonella. Previously, other parasitoid wasps were found to commonly attack this host, but North American introductions of A. ervi have apparently displaced all other parasitoids except Praon pequodorum, a related aphidiine braconid wasp, which is still found attacking this host in natural populations. To explain P. pequodorum's persistence, multiple studies have compared direct competition between both wasps, but have not examined specificity of host defenses as an indirectly mediating factor. Using an array of experimental aphid lines, we first examined whether aphid defenses varied in effectiveness toward either wasp species. Expectedly, both types of aphid defenses were effective against A. ervi, but unexpectedly, were completely ineffective against P. pequodorum. Further examination showed that P. pequodorum wasps suffered no consistent fitness costs from developing in even highly 'resistant' aphids. Comparison of both wasps' egg-larval development revealed that P. pequodorum's eggs have thicker <b>chorions</b> and hatch two days later than A. ervi's, likely explaining their differing abilities to overcome aphid defenses. Overall, our results indicate that aphids resistant to A. ervi may serve as reservoirs for P. pequodorum, hence contributing to its persistence in field populations. We find that specificity of host defenses and defensive symbiont infections, may have important roles in influencing enemy compositions by indirectly mediating the interactions and abundance of rival natural enemies...|$|R
25|$|P. exigua are small, swarm {{founding}} wasps. One {{can determine}} the wasps’ age by evaluating {{the darkness of the}} cuticle on the apical edge of the fifth gastral sternite. Older wasps typically exhibit darker shades relative to others in its colony. The front wing length is generally 4.15mm, and their wings are more rounded than other wasps. This round wing shape may enhance the wasp species’ flying abilities and increase fitness. The muscle mass on P. exigua’s mesosoma directly contributes to flight power; the larger the muscle, the stronger the output. Instead of flapping their wings, P. exigua row them due to increased wing drag. Mature P. exigua eggs have a complete <b>chorion</b> and are tinted blue with a shiny coat. Immature oocytes that are equal in size to mature eggs can be distinguished due to their cream and less glossy appearance.|$|E
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lay amniotic eggs {{covered with}} leathery or calcareous shells. An amnion, <b>chorion,</b> and allantois are present during embryonic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, {{but it is}} flexible to allow gas exchange. The <b>chorion</b> (6) aids in gas exchange between the {{inside and outside of}} the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of development. Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs, although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.|$|E
