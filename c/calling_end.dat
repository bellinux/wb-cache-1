5000|$|In {{object-oriented}} programming languages without function-valued arguments, {{such as in}} Java before its 8 version, callbacks can be simulated by passing an instance of an abstract class or interface, of which the receiver will call one or more methods, while the <b>calling</b> <b>end</b> provides a concrete implementation. Such objects are effectively a bundle of callbacks, plus the data they need to manipulate. They are useful in implementing various design patterns such as Visitor, Observer, and Strategy.|$|E

Upon receipt of a release message from the calling ISC, the releasing end DCME shall initiate the release of the unrestricted 64 kbit/s forward connection, and the opposite end DCME shall automatically initiate the release of the unrestricted 64 kbit/s return connection. Upon completion of this process, a positive release acknowledgement message shall be returned to the releasing ISC. Failure to complete the release shall be reported to the releasing ISC using the out-of-service message and the DCME shall put the trunk in a blocked condition. After manual or automatic removal of any failure condition, the DCME shall put the trunk in an idle condition and send a back-in-service message to the ISC. A <b>calling</b> <b>end</b> DCME shall detect a release initiated by the opposite end (non-controlling) ISC by the reception of a disconnect message in the control channel.
