5000|$|Tea in Azerbaijan {{is served}} freshly brewed, hot and strong. It {{typically}} has a bright colour and is served in crystal {{or any other}} glasses or cups. Azerbaijanis often use traditional armudu (pear-shaped) glass. Tea is served continuously when there are guests or {{when there is an}} interesting conversation. For Azerbaijanis tea with milk is uncommon. According to a common belief, drinking tea with lump sugar instead of sand sugar comes from the medieval period, when rulers who were afraid of being poisoned checked their tea by dunking a piece of sugar in a beverage - it was believed that the poison would react to the sugar). Traditional tea is served with lemon, <b>cube</b> <b>sugar,</b> sweets and fruit desserts (not jam). Sometimes thyme, mint or rose water is added, which is believed to be good for the stomach and heart.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, sugar was {{purchased}} in loaves, {{which had to be}} cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags. <b>Sugar</b> <b>cubes</b> were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make <b>sugar</b> in <b>cube</b> form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a sugar company in Dačice. He began <b>sugar</b> <b>cube</b> production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer of <b>sugar</b> <b>cubes</b> at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for <b>sugar</b> <b>cube</b> manufacture from German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of <b>sugar</b> <b>cubes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Sugar nips {{are a large}} pair of pincers {{with sharp}} blades, {{designed}} to cut sugar from a block. Before the introduction of granulated and <b>cube</b> <b>sugars</b> {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, the domestic consumer purchased sugar in the form of a sugarloaf, or at least a part of one, and pieces were cut from it by hand using sugar nips. Greater leverage and improved safety was provided by heavier sugar nips set in a wooden base for counter- and table-top use.|$|R
50|$|When {{drinking}} absinthe, it {{is traditionally}} prepared following French ritual, in which <b>cubed</b> <b>sugar</b> is slowly dissolved into the absinthe by pouring cold {{water over the}} sugar. Absinthe is flammable liquor, {{and it can be}} used in flaming cocktails. An alternate Bohemian (Czech) ritual involves fire, but does not actually light the absinthe on fire. Instead of slowly dissolving the sugar with cold water, it is doused in absinthe and lit on fire. This results in caramelized sugar dripping into the absinthe, changing the flavor considerably. There are several other rituals that may be used to prepare absinthe.|$|R
