40|$|Background : Postburn dorsal and palmar {{interdigital}} commissural contracture {{is one of}} {{the most}} common complications of hand burns which restricts finger motion and presents a serious <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect.</b> Many techniques and flaps have been suggested, and research continues for more effective techniques as the problem has not been solved. Methods : Anatomy of scar interdigital commissural contractures was studied in 760 operated patients aiming to develop a new, more effective surgical technique. Results : There are two anatomic types of scar commissural contractures: edge and total. Dorsal and palmar commissural contractures are identified as the edge type and are caused by the fold located along interdigital fossa’s edge. In the fold, the lateral sheet is scars, and the medial sheet and adjacent interdigital fossa are healthy skin. Total commissural contracture is characterized by interdigital fossa obliteration and phalanges’ fusion. Scar sheets have a trapeze-shaped sur face deficiency (contracture cause), which spreads from the fold’s crest to metacarpophalangeal joints. The surgical technique consists of scar surface deficiency compensation and commissural groove and slant restoration which can be optimally achieved with the trapezoid adipose-cutaneous flap. The best donor site is interdigital fossa. The small skin grafts on the lateral surface of proximal phalanges did not present a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect.</b> Conclusion : Dorsal and palmar inter digital commissural contractures are of an edge type and can be successfully reconstructed with trapeze-flap plasty. </p...|$|R

40|$|Copper (Cu) based pastes {{have emerged}} as the {{termination}} materials of choice for ceramic capacitors with base metal internal electrodes. To prevent oxidation of nickel (Ni) internal electrode and the copper terminations, {{it is necessary to}} fire the terminations in a nitrogen atmosphere. This requirement places significant restrictions on raw material selection for the termination pastes. For example, acrylic-based resins are used as organic binder for their clean burning characteristics over the traditional ethyl cellulose based binder system. As the viscoelastic behavior of acrylic resin systems are different to those of cellulose systems, differences are observed in the flow behavior of the paste. In this paper, the influence of paste rheology on the green <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defects</b> such as mooning, peaking, etc. is discussed. Additionally, the influence of process condition such as dipping parameters, drying conditions etc., on the green <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defects</b> are discussed.

40|$|In suboccipital {{craniectomy}} {{where the}} bone is not repositioned, {{there may be}} a significant <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect</b> due to lack of skull bone in the suboccipital region. It may accompanied by sensory symptoms, including pain. To prevent any <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect</b> and sensory symptoms we repositioned the bone chips at the craniectomy site in 42 suboccipital craniectomies before the closure of the scalp. At a mean follow-up of 22 months (range: 5 - 44 months), two patients complained of mild discomfort in the healed wound or of occasional local pain. One patient complained of mild itching at the site. In two patients, bone chips were accumulated at {{the lower part of the}} suboccipital craniectomy and failed to form a uniform bone cover at the operated site. In one patient, all bone chips were reabsorbed and there was no bone at the operated site. There was pseudomeningocele formation in one patient. In the rest of the cases there was satisfactory bone coverage at the operated site, both clinically and radiologically. The wound sites were aesthetically acceptable in 40 cases. Our study suggests that in the majority of cases where suboccipital craniotomy is not possible or not done, repositioning of the bone chips at the craniectomy site is associated with satisfactory aesthetic and functional outcome and formation of bone coverage at the operated site...|$|R

40|$|During {{a three-year}} period (1989 - 91), all {{patients}} living in the county of Uppsala, Sweden, with a radiographically verified fracture of the clavicle were prospectively, consecutively followed (n= 245). The epidemiological study (I) was restricted to the two first years with 187 fractures in 185 patients. The short term study (II) with 6 months follow-up included 222 patients. The long term study (III) with 10 years follow-up included 208 patients. The malunion study (IV) included eight patients and the nonunion study (V) 24 patients {{all of whom were}} consecutively operated between 1988 - 2000. Displacement, especially with no bony contact in the initial radiographs, was a statistically significant risk factor for sequelae. Comminute fractures, especially if including transversally placed fragments, were associated with a significantly increased risk of remaining symptoms. An increasing number of fragments was also associated with an increased risk of sequelae. Patients with remainig symptoms after 6 months were on average older at the time of injury as compared to patients without remaining symptoms. Advancing age was also a significant risk factor for sequelae – specifically pain at rest – still after 10 years. There was no difference between gender with respect to the risk of sequelae, except for nonunion. Fracture location did not predict outcome, except for more <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defects</b> (middle part). Shortening defined as overlapping at the fracture site was a significant risk factor for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defects</b> after 10 years. Patients who experience pain at rest and/or <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defects</b> more than twelve weeks after the fracture have a higher risk for sequelae. The radiographic examination should always consist of two projections: the AP (0 °) view and the 45 ° tilted view. Transversally placed fragments are not seen in the 0 ° view. Removal of excessive callus in patients with persistent symptoms even several years after the fracture showed a good outcome. One does not have to stabilize the clavicle when excising the hypertrophic callus. Symptomatic clavicular nonunions should be treated with surgery.

50|$|Powdery scab is {{a disease}} of potato tubers. It {{is caused by the}} cercozoan Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea and is {{widespread}} in potato growing countries. Symptoms of powdery scab include small lesions {{in the early stages of}} the disease, progressing to raised pustules containing a powdery mass. These can eventually rupture within the tuber periderm. The powdery pustules contain resting spores that release anisokont zoospores (asexual spore with two unequal length flagella) to infect the root hairs of potatoes or tomatoes. Powdery scab is a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect</b> on tubers, which can result in the rejection of these potatoes. Potatoes which have been infected can be peeled to remove the infected skin and the remaining inside of the potato can be cooked and eaten.|$|R

Descriptive Statistical Modelling of loss causes is then performed on the third step, enabling model-based enhancements of processes on the fourth step or, if necessary, a loop-back review of a given loss cause. An industrial case study was performed on production data of 88 batches and demonstrated the applicability of the procedure by prioritizing relevant loss causes, reducing required sample quantities by up to 8 % and a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect</b> by about 70 % by a process change...|$|R
40|$|Rhinophyma is a late {{manifestation of}} rosacea. Nodular {{hypertrophy}} {{of the external}} nose is a chronic disease lasting for many years. Rosacea itself is a frequent disease most common among women, yet its manifestation resulting in rhinophyma is typical for men in their 50 s and 60 s. The etiopathogenesis of rosacea is complex and not yet investigated thoroughly. Early stages are characterized with disruption of microcirculation in the nose and hypertrophy of sebaceous glands. Over the years skin and subcutaneous tissues proliferate and become fibrous leading to enlargement and malformation of the nose. Lesions pose not only a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect,</b> but may also cause obstruction to the nasal passage.

Although the outcome of this treatment method usually provides good clinical results, some <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defects</b> like asymmetry may nevertheless emerge. The objective of this work is to present a robust, mobile, and affordable three-dimensional (3 D) surface reconstruction system {{that can be used to}} assess post-surgery breast cosmetic outcome after a lumpectomy. Preliminary results obtained with this system have allowed us to test some of the hypotheses we made in our multiscale predictive modeling of BCT outcome.|$|E
40|$|Syringoma is {{a benign}} adnexal tumor derived from {{intradermal}} eccrine ducts; it predominantly occurs in women at puberty or later in life. Although syringoma {{is a common}} benign neoplasm, {{there have been no}} effective therapies for its removal. Conventional therapies for syringomas, including surgical excision, electrodessication, chemical peeling, topical atropine or tretinoin, cryosurgery, and laser therapy, can lead to <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defects</b> such as hyperpigmentation or scarring due to epidermal damage. In contrast, treatment using intralesional insulated needles, which are insulated at the point of epidermal contact, has been shown to result in good cosmetic outcomes due to selective destruction of dermal lesions.

40|$|Introduction: Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is {{a disease}} of unknown {{etiology}} and pathogenesis. Keratomas grow slowly for years. Their number grows significantly with age in some patients, resulting in <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect,</b> while separate elements remain in others not disturbing them subjectively. Details of the cell cycle destruction by the SK are not revealed despite a number of studies. It is controversial whether tumor suppressor protein p 16 influences growth {{and development of the}} tumor elements. Materials and Methods: An immunohistochemistry test with monoclonal antibodies to p 16 was accomplished, 20 SK served as a material for the test, which were obtained from patients with multiple SK – 10 people, and single SK (not more than 10 elements on the skin) – 10 people. Clinical examination of patients was being conducted, using data from the anamnesis of concomitant somatic pathology. Results: Intense cytoplasmic and nuclear staining of tumor cells was revealed by individuals with multiple SK in 70...|$|R
40|$|Attention to {{the issue}} of realizing and appreciating pain by {{children}} has been increasing within the last 20 years. Papillomavirus skin infection is a widespread dermatosis in younger children. The only treatment method is mechanical removal, which is accompanied by pain, while <b>cosmetic</b> <b>defect</b> caused by verruciform outgrowths on skin, especially in facial and hand areas, causes psychological problems leading to the child’s life quality reduction. The following study assessed efficacy of local analgesic when removing flat warts and papillomata. The obtained results indicate that the use of anesthetic plaster with 5 % lidocaine reduces both pain intensity and psychological distress. Plaster therapeutic system is a highly effective analgesic for application anesthesia used to conduct course injections, venous blood sampling and vaccination. This remedy is also recommended for anaesthetization of skin when conducting dermatologic procedures. Convenience and simplicity of use allow using it not only in clinical conditions, but also domiciliary, in particular, by patients themselves. </p...|$|R
