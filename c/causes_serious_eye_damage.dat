2500|$|While {{glyphosate}} and formulations such as Roundup {{have been}} approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist. Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that [...] "the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing" [...] with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified {{an increased risk of}} NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations. In March 2015 the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as [...] "probablynbsp&carcinogenicnbsp&in humans" [...] (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In November, 2015, the European Food Safety Authority published an updated assessment report on glyphosate, concluding that [...] "the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans." [...] Furthermore, the final report clarified that while other, probably carcinogenic, glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies [...] "that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect." [...] The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 confirming that the use of glyphosate formulations does not constitute a health risk and also gave admissible daily intake limits for chronic toxicity. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) maintained their current classification of glyphosate as a substance <b>causing</b> <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> and as a substance toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs.|$|R
40|$|Laser {{pointers}} {{are completely}} safe when properly {{used as a}} visual or instructional aid. However, they can <b>cause</b> <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> when used improperly. There have been enough documented injuries from laser pointers to trigger a warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA and Safety Notification). Before deciding to use a laser pointer, presenters are reminded to consider alternate methods of calling attention to specific items. Most presentation software packages offer screen pointer options with the same features, but without the laser hazard. Selecting a Safe Laser Pointer 1) Choose low power lasers (Class 2 or 3 R, formerly 3 a) Whenever possible, select a Class 2 laser pointer because of the lower risk of <b>eye</b> <b>damage.</b> If a more powerful laser is required, presenters may use a Class 3 R laser {{with the understanding that}} greater responsibility and care are required. Laser devices with other laser classes are inappropriate for use as a laser pointer (see Identifying Laser Characteristics below). 2) Choose red-orange lasers (633 to 650 nm wavelength, choose closer to 635 nm) Early diode laser pointers were dark red (670 nm wavelength) and difficult to see due to the eye’s lower response to red. Newer red-orange lasers are significantly brighter than their dark red predecessors using the same or even less power. See below for available products. Green and blue laser pointers are available, however each has serious drawbacks 1. Initially, green will appear brighter than red. However, green may actually be too bright and has been found to leave a distracting after-image on the retina, making it difficult to concentrate on the presentation. Safety concerns have been raised about photo-biological effects from blue light laser pointers (400 - 500 nm) and they should be avoided. 3) On/Off Switch Ensure that the on switch is a momentary contact type that is designed to shut off the pointer when released. Use of a laser pointed with a locking device to keep the laser beam on is prohibited. Each label includes: the starburst insignia, laser classification, maximu...|$|R

30|$|Targeted {{treatment}} of eukaryotic pathogen remains {{a major problem}} in our efforts to counter infectious diseases. As opposed to bacterial pathogens with unique targets, the molecular and functional similarities in eukaryotic pathogens to human cells make it particularly challenging to find novel targets for therapeutic interventions. The synthesis of derivatives of these photodynamic compounds in order to improve their selective attachment to the parasite is a complete new approach to this infection. To this end, studies have shown the presence of an adhesin, mannose-binding protein (MBP) on the surface membranes of Acanthamoeba that is critical in its pathogenesis ([Alsam et al., 2003]; [Garate et al., 2004]). For robust and targeted killing, future studies will synthesize photosensitizer-alpha-D-mannose conjugates of varying charges as well as photosensitizer-MBP antibody conjugates. This together with appropriate selection of light source (lasers) to emit monochromatic light in the visible spectrum in a given direction targeting and fully activating the photosensitizer compound will determine the potential of photochemotherapy to counter this devastating infection.

Atypical AS was detected from fish {{by a combination of}} bacterial cultivation and polymerase chain reaction techniques. A detection level of 17 aAS cells per 100 ?mg intestine tissue sample was obtained. Concomitant bacterial exposure did not enhance the severity of grayling eye rupture and nuclear extrusion induced by D. spathaceum, but D. spathaceum invasion into grayling increased the proportion of fish carrying aAS in their heart tissue. However, the number of aAS cells detected in heart tissue was low. Atypical AS did not cause acute disease or mortality during 15 ?days post-exposure. There was a higher prevalence of aAS in grayling heart samples than in intestinal samples, indicating that the intestine is not favoured by aAS. We suggest that heart tissue would be a good organ from which to isolate aAS when tracing latent carrier fish.

The aim of the project was to review the state of the science of {{non-standard}} methods that are available for assessing the toxicological and ecotoxicological properties of chemicals. Non-standard methods refer to alternatives to animal experiments, such as in vitro tests and computational models, as well as animal methods that are not covered by current regulatory guidelines. This report therefore reviews the current scientific status of non-standard methods for a range of human health and ecotoxicological endpoints, and provides a commentary on the mechanistic basis and regulatory applicability of these methods. For completeness, and to provide context, currently accepted (standard) methods are also summarised. In particular, the following human health endpoints are covered: a) skin irritation and corrosion; b) <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> and <b>eye</b> irritation; c) skin sensitisation; d) acute systemic toxicity; e) repeat dose toxicity; f) genotoxicity and mutagenicity; g) carcinogenicity; h) reproductive toxicity (including effects on development and fertility); i) endocrine disruption relevant to human health; and j) toxicokinetics. In relation to ecotoxicological endpoints, the report focuses on non-standard methods for acute and chronic fish toxicity. While specific reference is made to the information needs of REACH, the Biocidal Products Regulation and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation, this review is also expected to be informative in relation to the possible use of alternative and non-standard methods in other sectors, such as cosmetics and plant protection products.

In the period from 1995 − 2004 this prospective study included 510 patients wearing soft contact lenses for correcting ametropia. None of the patients wore contact lenses before and none suffered from any system or local diseases that could affected the development of eventual complications. The study took seven years with the patients who wore conventional lenses and three years with those who wore replacement contact lenses. All the necessary ophthalmologic examinations were done (visual acuity, refractokeratometry, the quantity of tear film, biomicroscopic examination of anterior eye segment).

40|$|AbstractBoth a {{prospective}} and a retrospective validation study were undertaken {{to assess the}} suitability of the Ocular Irritection® assay to discriminate ocular hazards {{as defined by the}} OECD and UN Globally Harmonized System (UN GHS) for classification. The primary focus {{of the study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of the Ocular Irritection® assay to reliably discriminate chemicals not requiring classification (UN GHS non-classified), from classified chemicals (UN GHS Categories 1 and 2). Furthermore a post-hoc evaluation was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of the assay to discriminate chemicals inducing <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> (UN GHS Category 1) from other classes. The prospective validation study was conducted between 2009 and 2012 following internationally agreed principles. A set of 56 coded test chemicals for which quality and/or peer-reviewed in vivo data were available were used to obtain prospective data on the assay’s reliability (reproducibility within and between laboratories) and relevance (predictive capacity). The assay showed good within-laboratory variability, transferability including to a naïve laboratory, and between-laboratory concordance of classifications (82 % for the discrimination of non-classified from classified chemicals, and 83 % for the discrimination of Category 1 from other classes). The obtained prospective data were then combined with existing data on the Ocular Irritection® collected from various sources, totaling 88 chemicals with parallel in vivo and in vitro data to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the test method performances. The enlarged dataset comprised 43 non-classified, 25 Category 2 and 20 Category 1 chemicals according to the UN GHS classification. When used for the identification of UN GHS non-classified versus classified materials (based on the existing cut-off of 12. 5) the Ocular Irritection® assay showed an overall a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 58 %. An evaluation on possible reasons for misclassification identified some organic functional groups (acrylate, carboxamide and cycloalkene) to correlate with the observed mispredictions. If these functional groups were excluded from the Ocular Irritection® applicability domain, the obtained dataset (n= 79 chemicals distributed as 41 UN GHS Classified and 38 Non-Classified chemicals) had an overall sensitivity of 98 %, and specificity of 63 %, which is in line with currently adopted test methods. When used for the identification of UN GHS Category 1 versus other categories (based on the existing cut-off of 30. 0) the Ocular Irritection® assay showed an overall specificity of 81 % and a sensitivity of 50 % which is again in line with currently adopted test methods. The Ocular Irritection® assay appeared therefore as a useful test method to predict chemicals not requiring classification for eye hazards according to the UN GHS classification system.

Specifically, I aimed to characterize the causative agent of aAS -infection, to describe putative virulence factors of the bacteria and cross pathology of the infection in charr and grayling. I also aimed to describe some of the immune defense functions in charr. I also described a concomitant presence of a common fresh water fish parasite, Diplostomum spathaceum, and aAS -bacteria in manifestation of the bacterial infection. The experimental juvenile charr and grayling, originated from Vuoksi, Kymijoki and Inari watercourses in Finland. Several (n= 66) aAS isolates from 7 watercourses in Finland and from the Baltic sea were characterized in the study. These were compared to 11 Swedish, 1 Icelandic aAS isolates, to 3 A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (ASS) isolates and to ATCC 33659, a type strain for A. salmonicida subsp. achromogenes. Classical biochemical analyzes and modern molecular tools (macrorestricted genome and plasmid profiles) were utilized in characterizing. AAS was detected from fish tissue (intestine, lens and heart) {{by a combination of}} bacterial cultivation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. Pathology of aAS infection in charr and grayling was described both in natural outbreaks at fish farms and after experimental challenge. The effects of oil-adjuvanted vaccine on the immune system and on the growth of charr at different post vaccination (p. v.) temperatures was studied. Interactions between bacteria and parasites were studied using grayling subjected to concomitant exposure of aAS bacteria and D. spathaceum parasites. Genetically identical aAS isolates within the Vuoksi and the Kymijoki watercourse were found, whereas genetic differences between aAS isolates from various river basins were observed. A major virulence factor in Vuoksi aAS -isolates need to be studied further. In charr and grayling aAS caused systemic infection. Vaccination induced in charr a significant anti-aAS specific antibody response and increased plasma lysozyme activity at all p. v. temperatures. The vaccination had no ultimate negative effects on the growth of charr. AAS bacteria was successfully detected from a heart tissue of grayling by the combination of bacterial cultivation and PCR techniques. The detection level was 17 aAS cells per 100 mg sampled tissue.

Oomen (1961) reported a mortality of nearly 30 per cent. {{in young children}} with keratomalacia and an even higher proportion in those with protein malnutrition; about 25 per cent. of the survivors became totally blind, and about 60 per cent. were left with reduced vision in one or both eyes. Deficiency diseases revealed by dietary surveys have included xerophthalmia, Bitot's spots, angular stomatitis, and phrynoderma. Gilroy (1951) observed xerophthalmia in 250 out of 4, 191 children from 44 estates in Assam. Sundararajan (1963) found signs of vitamin A deficiency in 35 to 45 per cent. of schoolchildren in Calcutta. Chandra, Venkatachalam, Belavadi, Reddy, and Gopalan (1960) reported that lack of protein and vitamin A was the most frequent cause of nutritional deficiency disorders in India; out of 14, 563 children examined in a 5 -year period, 2, 245 showed malnutrition, 551 vitamin A deficiency, and 157 keratomalacia. Rao, Swaminathan, Swarup, and Patwardhan (1959) observed two to five cases ofvitamin A deficiency for every case of kwashiorkor. A world-wide survey of xerophthalniia carried out in nearly fifty countries (including countries in Asia) by WHO in 1962 - 1963 revealed that this was often the most important cause of blindness in young children. Scrimshaw (1959), McLaren (1963), and UNICEF (1963) concluded that vitamin A deficiency {{was one of the}} main nutritional problems in tropical and subtropical areas.

40|$|Fireworks-Associated <b>Eye</b> {{injuries}} <b>caused</b> by <b>Serious</b> fireworks <b>Eye</b> are Injuries often — severe Continued and {{can cause}} permanently reduced visual acuity or blindness. Findings from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database maintained by the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) indicate that approximately 12, 000 persons are treated each year in U. S. emergency departments because of fireworks-related injuries; of these, an estimated 20 % are eye injuries. To improve characterization of fireworks-related eye injuries, data were analyzed from the United States Eye Injury Registry (USEIR) for July 1990 –December 1994 and from the Eye Injury Registry of Alabama (EIRA) for August 1982 –July 1989. This report summarizes the findings of these analyses. United States Eye Injury Registry USEIR, a nonprofit organization sponsored by the Helen Keller Eye Research Foundation, is a federation of state eye registries that uses a standardized form to obtain voluntarily reported data on eye injuries and to obtain 6 -month follow-up information. Reports are made by ophthalmologists to the USEIR database in Birmingham, Alabama. The primary purpose of USEIR is to provide prospective, population-based...|$|R
40|$|Over 2. 4 million eye {{injuries}} occur {{each year}} in the United States as a result of trauma. Eye injuries have been investigated for years; however, the role of the extraocular muscles in relation to eye injuries has yet to be quantified. In this research, Computed Tomography quasi-static tests were conducted to investigate the effect of the presence of the extraocular muscles on the biomechanical response of the human eye in situ. Three matched pairs of human eyes were displaced in 5 mm increments using a large flat cylindrical indenter to a maximum displacement of 30 mm. The loading was similar to what is experienced during a blunt impact, which is believed to <b>cause</b> the most <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> injuries. In the matched pair, one eye had the extraocular muscles intact and the other had the extraocular muscles transected. Force, pressure, and displacement measurements were collected for each test. A trend was seen where a greater amount of force was created in the eye with the extraocular muscles intact than in the eye with the muscles transected, and a correlation between them was made. The greatest force measured in an eye with the extraocular muscles intact was 92 N, while the greatest force measured in an eye with the extraocular muscles transected was 80 N. An increase i...|$|R
