5000|$|Kaldor {{believed}} that the business cycle had an inherent mechanism built into it that redistributed income across the cycle and that these mitigated [...] "explosive" [...] results. As we have seen, in a <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswing</b> where planned investment begins to outstrip planned savings prices will tend to rise. Kaldor assumed that those who set prices have more power than those who set wages and so prices will tend to rise faster than wages. This means that profits must also rise faster than wages. Kaldor argued that due to the different savings propensities of capitalists and workers this will lead to higher savings. This will then dampen the cycle somewhat. In a recession or depression Kaldor argued that prices should fall faster than wages {{for the same reasons}} that Keynes laid out in his General Theory. This meant that income would be redistributed to workers as real wages rose. This would lead savings to fall in a recession or depression and so would dampen the cycle.|$|E

With the German economy beginning to benefit from a <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswing,</b> supported by an ongoing programme of Keynesian stimulus, the Hotel Pontresina found itself operating in a financial environment that was a little more friendly. For the first time in many years, the hotel opened for a winter season in 1934/35. However, the annual report for that year included the observation that during the many years when the Pontresina had remained closed through the winter guests had learned to take their winter holidays in competitor establishments, and the much resulting loss in business must be judged permanent. [...] The interest burden on what was now 1.3 million Swiss francs of mortgage debt remained oppressive, taking more than 40,000 Swiss francs out of the business each year. By the end of the 1935/36 financial year the company had again eten through its share capital. [...] At a General Meeting on 21 October 1936 the controlling shareholder - still the Graubündner Kantonalbank - again accepted a write down the nominal value of the share capital by 80%. The new share capital of 100,000 Swiss francs was provided from a further conversion of mortgage debt (also held by the bank). This second restructuring effectively wiped out the last of the minority share holders, who were left only with Genussscheine ("participation certificates"), while the bank owned all the voting shares apart from the few qualifying shares legally required to be held by board members. The General Meeting also decided to recognise the changed ownership structure with a name change for the hotel which now became the [...] "Sporthotel Pontresina". [...] The new name also provided an eloquesnt statement of where the hotel would be looking for its clients in the future.|$|E

We find that on average 9 out of 100 randomly selected jobs were created within the last year, and that about 9 out of randomly selected 100 jobs were destroyed within the next year. Hence, the magnitude of Austrian job flows seems to be comparable to other countries, similar to the well-known results of Davis et al. (1996) for the United States. Job reallocation appears to be driven primarily by idiosyncratic shocks. However, job creation increases significantly during <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswings</b> whereas job destruction rises in downturns. We also find substantial persistence of job creation and destruction. The pronounced pattern of job reallocation rates falling with firm size and age continues to hold when we use a set of controls.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{international}} spillovers from fiscal policy shocks via trade in Europe. A fiscal expansion stimulates domestic activity, {{which leads to}} more foreign exports and, hence, higher foreign output. To quantify this, we combine a panel VAR model in government spending, net taxes and GDP with a panel trade model. On average, a public spending increase equal to 1 % of GDP implies 2. 3 % more foreign exports over the first two years. The corresponding figure for an equal-size net tax reduction is 0. 6 %. Both estimates are statistically significant. As far as the effect on foreign activity is concerned, a 1 % of GDP spending increase (net tax reduction) in Germany on average raises GDP of trading partners by 0. 23 % (0. 06 %) over the first two years.

40|$|Many {{business}} cycle indicators present asymmetric features that have long been recognized in economics. Basically the contraction periods in an economy are more violent but also more short-lived than the expansion periods, where the dynamics of GDP/GNP growth present asymmetric <b>cyclical</b> developments with <b>upswings</b> which last longer than downturns. Nonlinear models are therefore required to capture {{the features of the}} data generating mechanisms of such macroeconomic {{business cycle}} series, since linear models are incapable of generating such behaviour. Relying on the smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) model, one of the many non-linear models developed in the nineties, this paper presents empirical evidence in favour of the proposition that the dynamic behaviour of GDP changes over the business cycle. Using quarterly growth rates for seasonally unadjusted GDP data, both, for the Euro-area and Portugal we uncover evidence in favour of asymmetric behaviour for these variables. The nonlinear features are empirically far more evident for the case of Portugal and less sticking so for the GDP for the Euro-area. These nonlinear features show up not only in the form of distinct impulse response functions calculated from different starting points for the shocks, but are also apparent in the completely different dynamics displayed by the two extreme regimes that characterize the "recession" periods and the "high" growing phases of the business cycle. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{theoretical}} coherence and empirical validity (in the UK context) {{of the economic}} school whose main proponent is Alfred Eichner. The main questions addressed concern (1) the duality of pricing, savings and investment behaviour between competitive and oligopolistic sectors and (2) {{the implications of the}} cyclical financial surplus that emerges in the oligopolistic sector during the upturn. The cycle is explained as the outcome of government reaction to the consequences of this financial surplus, rather than as a reaction to capacity or trade constraints. The thesis investigates the role and effectiveness of policy instruments aimed at strengthening and prolonging the <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswing</b> so as to achieve an upward revision to the secular growth rate. The thesis makes original contributions by extending the formal treatment of the effect of the oligopolistic financial surplus. It also locates the theory in its historical theoretical context and demonstrates that it can apply also to the case of an open economy. It collates evidence on capacity and trade constraints on the UK economy to support the argument that they do not constitute sufficient reasons for government deflationary action. The duality of the UK economy is demonstrated in respect of pricing behaviour by collating the results of existing studies. Duality in respect of savings and investment behaviour is confirmed by an original study of Company Accounts data. Investment duality is confirmed as a by-product of two further studies which have the main aim of establishing that traditional investment-directed instruments are not effective in the short-run (-for the oligopolistic sector and thus cannot be relied on to reduce its financial surplus. These studies are supplemented by a survey of existing literature on investment.

The most recent upswing was about one year shorter. A comparison of the two cycles also shows considerable differences in the structure of economic development: in both cycles, the upswing was triggered – as is typical of Austria – by the stimulation of exports in the wake of an improving economic performance of the country's most important trading partners. However, rising exports did not have a sufficient impact on investments on plant and equipment in the current economic cycle, which meant that capital expenditure did not pick up accordingly. At the same time, construction activities were booming, with public-sector contracts having a pro-cyclical effect. Konjunkturzyklen Datierung...|$|E
30|$|Moreover, it {{has been}} argued that career {{progression}} prospects and employment options vary according to firm size. Results indicate that the larger the firm, the lower the rate of exits. This was especially apparent in the comparatively low unemployment risks during the cyclical decline in 2002.8 Thus, Hypothesis 3 cannot be rejected. These findings confirm that larger firms are able to strengthen the closure of their employment systems from the external job market (Struck 2006). Regarding changes from large firms during the period of economic upswing in 1999, lateral transitions between firms are particularly prominent. Those employees who change employment in the economic downturn seem restricted in their ability to increase income. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 that job exits occur mostly voluntarily and lead more frequently to lateral or even upward mobility can be confirmed only in the case of a <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswing.</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswing</b> in Austria continues. Driven by {{the swift}} {{expansion}} of global activity, exports are posting strong gains. Meanwhile, the momentum {{is being transmitted}} to private investment which is set to rise substantially over the forecast period. Short-term indicators suggest that the positive trend will persist {{in the first half}} of 2011 before moderating somewhat in parallel with developments abroad, under the impact of rising commodity and energy prices and a more restrictive policy stance in both the industrialised and the emerging economies.

30|$|This section {{examines}} how far region-specific factors correlate with employment trajectories. Hypothesis 11 predicts that employees {{who work in}} core areas will benefit from agglomeration advantages in terms of high job stability.

This confirms Hypothesis 12. During an economic downturn, support is found for Hypothesis 13, because in rural areas of lower population density, higher job instability is often accompanied by {{a greater risk of}} unemployment. Our findings indicate—as stated by Fassmann and Meusburger (1997)—that urbanized areas offer more and better options for employment; in contrast, rural areas are exposed to increased unemployment risks, especially during the cyclical periods of economic decline.|$|E
40|$|The {{upcoming}} World Cup {{has raised}} high expectations in Germany, {{not just for}} the national team, but for the economy as well. As the <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswing</b> has mainly been supported by exports so far, hopes have been growing recently that this sporting event will have a positive and stimulating effect on domestic demand - partly by increasing consumer confidence - and so enable the upswing to gain breadth. 1 The analysis of the macroeconomic effects of the Soccer World Cup presented here shows that this could only happen if the event brought a clear change in consumer and investment behavior, together with a change in future expectations. However, that is not to be expected. Nevertheless, the World Cup is of high socio-political significance due its importance as a sporting and cultural event. It is (yet another) piece in the mosaic of Germany's transition from an industrial to a service society. ...|$|E
40|$|Benefiting {{from the}} {{depreciation}} {{of the euro}} {{in the first half}} of the year, euro area exports should keep their upward trend in the remainder of 2010.

While industrial activity should prove resilient, the high government deficits and imminent consolidation moves, hesitant private investment behaviour, the need for financial sector reform and macroeconomic imbalances within the euro area will weigh on demand and output growth. For Austria, WIFO expects real GDP to expand by 2 percent in 2010 and 1. 9 percent in 2011. The revival of business activity will contribute to improvements in the labour market and in public finances. By 2011, the unemployment rate should ease to 6. 8 percent of the dependent labour force, and the government deficit, including the planned consolidation measures, should narrow to 3. 5 percent of GDP. ...|$|E

However, the cyclical buffer for the aggregate U.

40|$|In 1998 and 1999, Europe {{is likely}} to post the highest {{economic}} growth in the triad. The current upturn tends to ease the pressure on the labor market and on public households. The main risks threatening the <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswing</b> emanate less from the development in South-East Asia than from the unstable situation in Russia. The asynchronous development of the business cycle within the triad and the financial and economic crisis in South-East Asia have changed the pattern of growth in the global economy. The Asian region, formerly the main growth center of the world economy, is engulfed in a serious crisis. With domestic demand declining, South-East Asia is recording an economic slump in 1998. Japan, through its close financial and trade ties to the economies most affected, is the country most directly exposed to the Asian crisis. It is currently in a state of deflation. The U. S. economy has experienced a very favorable development since the middle of 1991. The weakening of exports, mainly a result of the rise {{in the value of the}} dollar, should lead to a slowdown, despite the continued strength of consumer and investment demand. The European economies are set to become the engines of growth for the world economy. Conditions exist for a long and vigorous upswing. The smooth transition to the EMU has contributed to stabilizing the expectations of investors and consumers. Nominal interest rates have declined markedly and relieved the interest burden for enterprises and public households. Fiscal policy should have a less restrictive effect than in the last few years. The weakness of commodity prices also tends to ease cost pressures. Growth in the EU could accelerate to 2 ¾ percent in 1998 and 3 percent in 1999. The <b>cyclical</b> <b>upswing</b> leads to a decrease in the unemployment rate to 10 percent, that will be supported by efforts of intensified active labor market policies in Europe ("National Action Plans"). The more advanced reform countries of East-Central Europe are likely to continue the catching-up process, but Russia and the other countries of CIS remain in a critical situation – that could pose a considerable risk for Europe.

40|$|Growth of the Austrian {{economy in}} 2000 is {{projected}} at 3. 1 percent in volume. Activity is being driven both by booming exports and lively domestic demand.

The increase in indirect taxes and public charges will add to inflation, projected for the consumer price level at annual rates of 1. 6 (2000) and 1. 4 percent (2001). The favourable business cycle conditions should lead to a further improvement on the labour market. Employment is set to rise substantially, by around 35, 000 in each year.
