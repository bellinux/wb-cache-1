25|$|Dam {{failures}} {{are generally}} catastrophic if {{the structure is}} breached or significantly damaged. Routine deformation monitoring and monitoring of seepage from drains in and around larger dams is useful to anticipate any problems and permit remedial {{action to be taken}} before structural failure occurs. Most dams incorporate mechanisms to permit the reservoir to be lowered or even drained in the event of such problems. Another solution can be rock grouting– pressure pumping portland <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> into weak fractured rock.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{surfaces}} (specifically, Portland cement concrete) {{are created}} using a concrete mix of Portland cement, coarse aggregate, sand and water. In virtually all modern mixes {{there will also}} be various admixtures added to increase workability, reduce the required amount of water, mitigate harmful chemical reactions and for other beneficial purposes. In many cases {{there will also be}} Portland cement substitutes added, such as fly ash. This can reduce the cost of the concrete and improve its physical properties. The material is applied in a freshly mixed slurry, and worked mechanically to compact the interior and force some of the <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> to the surface to produce a smoother, denser surface free from honeycombing. The water allows the mix to combine molecularly in a chemical reaction called hydration.|$|E

The processes taking place in fresh <b>cement</b> <b>slurries</b> were presented and their complex character analysed. The equations describing rheological models, e. g. <b>cement</b> <b>slurries,</b> were given.

40|$|Contamination of {{oilfield}} <b>cement</b> <b>slurries</b> by {{drilling fluids}} {{is one of}} the causes of cement job failures and it results in expensive remedial actions. While the general adverse effects of Pseudo Oil Base Mud (POBM) contamination of <b>cement</b> <b>slurries</b> are known, little has been published on the actual effects of POBM on specific slurry properties. The effect of POBM on the filtration losses in oil well <b>cement</b> <b>slurries</b> was investigated. POBM contaminated slurries at varying contamination volumes up to 40 % at intervals of 5 % were prepared. The filtration losses were determined using standard American Petroleum Institute (API) procedures. The results show that while API fluid losses increased with time, it decreased with increasing POBM contamination in <b>cement</b> <b>slurries...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{rubber plug}} used to {{separate}} the <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> from other fluids, reducing contamination and maintaining predictable slurry performance. Two types of cementing plug are typically used on a cementing operation. The bottom plug is launched ahead of the <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> to minimize contamination by fluids inside the casing prior to cementing. A diaphragm in the plug body ruptures to allow the <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> to pass through after the plug reaches the landing collar. The top plug has a solid body that provides positive indication of contact with the landing collar and bottom plug through an increase in pump pressure.|$|E
50|$|The {{check-valve}} assembly fixed {{within the}} float collar prevents flow {{back of the}} <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> when pumping is stopped. Without a float collar or float shoe, the <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> placed in the annulus could U-tube, or reverse flow back into the casing. The greater density of cement slurries than the displacement mud inside the casing causes the U-tube effect.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} influence of waterborne epoxy resin emulsion (WER) on the physical properties of oil well <b>cement</b> <b>slurries.</b> <b>Cement</b> <b>slurries</b> containing 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of WER bwoc were compared with WER-free slurries. The rheological behavior was carried out according to API standard. Uniaxial compressive strength and shear bond strength of cement stone were evaluated at the ages of 24, 48 and 72 h. The experimental results illustrate that the addition of WER does not alter the rheological behavior. The addition of WER has increased the shear bond strength almost 52 % at 24 h of aging for 10 % WER bwoc when compared with unmodified slurry. The enhancement on shear bond strength was attributed to the mechanical anchoring and resin film forming at the interface...|$|R

5000|$|Cementing is {{performed}} by circulating a <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> through {{the inside of}} the casing and out into the annulus through the casing shoe {{at the bottom of the}} casing string. In order to precisely place the <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> at a required interval on the outside of the casing, a plug is pumped with a displacement fluid behind the <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> column, which [...] "bumps" [...] in the casing shoe and prevents further flow of fluid through the shoe. This bump can be seen at surface as a pressure spike at the cement pump. To prevent the cement from flowing back into {{the inside of the}} casing, a float collar above the casing shoe acts as a check valve and prevents fluid from flowing up through the shoe from the annulus.|$|E

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 441 -[442]. Paper {{presents}} {{results of}} investigation on {{the properties of}} <b>cement</b> <b>slurries</b> used in casing works in horizontal wells. Six slurries were investigated. Each slurry was optimized to fulfill {{the demands of a}} particular well drilled in Pomeranian Basin in northern Poland. Slurries were designed the way to obtain flow diameter in the range 240 - 270 mm and exhibiting no sedimentation. Special emphasis was put on the stability of the slurries, due to high requirements for stability of slurries used in casing works in horizontal wells. Slurries were cured in conditions characteristic for particular wells (pressure in the range between 35 and 49 MPa, temperature in the range between 80 and 90 degrees of Celsius). For hardened slurries mechanical properties were determined. Phase composition of hardened slurries was determined with XRD and thermal analysis. In addition microstructural observations were done {{in order to determine the}} influence of temperature on microstructure of hardened cement matrix. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

30|$|A {{factorial}} design method {{has been successfully}} employed in this study to develop a model to predict the compressive strength of cement.

50|$|Silica - α quartz and {{condensed}} silica fume. α quartz is used {{to prevent}} strength retrogression in thermal wells. Silica fume (micro fume) is highly reactive, and {{is regarded as the}} most effective pozzolanic material available. The high surface area increases the water demand to get pumpable slurry. Such a mixture can produce a <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> as low as 11.0 ppg.|$|E
50|$|Deep cement mixing {{was first}} {{developed}} in Japan where first field tests began in 1970. Originally granular quicklime {{was used as}} binder to stabilize the underlying soil, but soon better results were obtained using <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> and cement mortar.

50|$|A {{float collar}} is {{installed}} {{near the bottom}} of the casing string. Cement plugs land on it during the primary cementing operation, thus retaining inside the casing a small portion of the <b>cement</b> <b>slurry</b> that may have become contaminated as the top plug scrapes the inside of the casing. It is similar to a float shoe; often both are used for redundancy. The internal check valves may be flapper type or spring-loaded balls.|$|E
40|$|When repair {{material}} is laid {{down on a}} concrete substrate, the porosity of concrete allows it to penetrate the substrate, increasing the probability of physical interactions, and subsequently increasing adhesion. Water absorption by immersion or usual capillary action tests do not provide enough information to understand what happens when contact occurs between the concrete substrate and the <b>cement</b> <b>slurries</b> used as a bonding layer. An adaptation of the capillary action test is presented; {{this is based on}} a continuous measurement of mass change of the sample. Major differences according to the type of surface preparation are pointed out: absorption rates as well as mass changes are greater for polished concrete substrates than for sandblasted ones. Centrifuged solutions of <b>cement</b> <b>slurries</b> modified with plasticizers and superplasticizers are used for water replacement in the adapted capillary action test. Results clearly show the influence of these admixtures: the greater the adhesion tension, the greater the wetting of the concrete substrate.
