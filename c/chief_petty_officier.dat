50|$|In the Navy, {{advancement}} {{to master}} <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer {{is similar to}} that of <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer and senior <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer. It carries requirements of time in service, superior evaluation scores, and selection by a board of master chiefs. Similarly, senior <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officers and <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officers are chosen by selection boards. In the Coast Guard, advancement to master <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer is similar to other advancements consisting of competition with other advancement-eligible senior <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officers. Advancement-eligible senior <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officers are prioritized based on written examination scores, evaluations, award points, time in service, and time in grade. Master <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officers are then selected monthly from this prioritization list as positions become available.|$|R

50|$|<b>Chief</b> <b>Petty</b> Officer (CPO) is {{the seventh}} enlisted rate (E-7) in the United States Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, just above {{petty officer first class}} and below senior <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer. The rate of <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer {{is that of}} a senior non-commissioned officer, and was {{established}} on 1 April 1893 for the United States Navy. The United States Congress first authorized the Coast Guard to use the promotion to <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer on 18 May 1920. <b>Chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer is also the final cadet rate in the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps. Prior to 1958, <b>Chief</b> <b>Petty</b> Officer was the highest enlisted rank in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. This changed on 20 May 1958 with the passage Public Law 85-422, the Military Pay Act of 1958, which established two new pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, the new E-8 pay grade was titled Senior <b>Chief</b> <b>Petty</b> Officer (SCPO) and the new E-9 pay grade as Master <b>Chief</b> <b>Petty</b> Officer (MCPO), with the first selectees promoting to their respective grades in 1959 and 1960.|$|R

50|$|Congress {{established}} the senior and master <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer ranks in 1958, primarily {{as an incentive}} to retain E-7's beyond their 20-year mark. This move enjoyed some initial success. Although the <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officer has always held a well-defined position of responsibility {{in the chain of}} command, the roles of the senior and master <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officers {{have been the subject of}} considerable debate almost since their beginning days. It became apparent that senior and master <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officers received little additional responsibilities than what they had as <b>chief</b> <b>petty</b> officers. This resulted in a return of the old trend where many senior enlisted members left the Navy shortly after completing 20 years of service.|$|R
50|$|A Command Master <b>Chief</b> <b>Petty</b> Officer is {{the most}} senior enlisted Sailor in a United States Navy unit.
