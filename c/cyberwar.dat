40|$|I {{present a}} unified {{discussion}} of several recently published results concerning the escalation, timing {{and severity of}} violent events in human conflicts and global terrorism, and set them in the wider context of real-world and cyber-based collective violence and illicit activity. I point out how the borders distinguishing between such activities are becoming increasingly blurred in practice [...] from insurgency, terrorism, criminal gangs and <b>cyberwars,</b> through to the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings and London riots. I review the robust empirical patterns that have been found, and summarize a minimal mechanistic model which can explain these patterns. I also explain why this mechanistic approach, which is inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, fits naturally {{within the framework of}} recent ideas within the social science literature concerning analytical sociology. In passing, I flag the fundamental flaws in each of the recent critiques which have surfaced concerning the robustness of these results and the realism of the underlying model mechanisms. ...|$|R
40|$|Cybersecurity is {{a global}} {{phenomenon}} representing a complex socio-technical challenge for governments, but requiring the involvement of individuals. Although cybersecurity {{is one of the}} most important challenges faced by governments today, the visibility and public awareness remains limited. Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity, however, the urgency and behaviour of persons do not reflect high level of awareness. The Internet is all too often considered as a safe environment for sharing information, transactions and controlling the physical world. Yet, <b>cyberwars</b> are already ongoing, and there is an urgent need to be better prepared. The inability to frame cybersecurity has resulted in a failure to develop suitable policies. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in framing policy on cybersecurity and offer strategies for better communicating cybersecurity. Communicating cybersecurity is confronted with paradoxes, which has resulted in society not taking appropriate measures to deal with the threats. The limited visibility, socio-technological complexity, ambiguous impact and the contested nature of fighting cybersecurity complicates policy-making. Framing using utopian or dystopian views might be counterproductive and result in neglecting evidence. Instead, we present evidence-based framing strategies which can help to increase societal and political awareness of cybersecurity and put the issues in perspective. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the new age}} of <b>cyberwars,</b> system {{designers}} have come to recognize the merits of building critical systems on top of small kernels {{for their ability to}} provide strong isolation at system level. This {{is due to the fact}} that enforceable isolation is the prerequisite for any reasonable security policy. Towards this goal we examine some internals of Fiasco. OC, a microkernel of the prominent L 4 family. Despite its recent success in certain high-security projects for governmental use, we prove that Fiasco. OC is not suited to ensure strict isolation between components meant to be separated. Unfortunately, in addition to the construction of system-wide denial of service attacks, our identified weaknesses of Fiasco. OC also allow covert channels across security perimeters with high bandwidth. We verified our results in a strong affirmative way through many practical experiments. Indeed, for all potential use cases of Fiasco. OC we implemented a full-fledged system on its respective archetypical hardware: Desktop server/workstation on AMD 64 x 86 CPU, Tablet on Intel Atom CPU, Smartphone on ARM Cortex A 9 CPU. The measured peak channel capacities ranging from ∼ 13500 bits/s (Cortex-A 9 device) to ∼ 30500 bits/s (desktop system) lay bare the feeble meaningfulness of Fi-asco. OC’s isolation guarantee. This proves that Fiasco. OC cannot be used as a separation kernel within high-security areas. I...|$|R
