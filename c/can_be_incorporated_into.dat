5|$|As {{the number}} of {{cavities}} {{play a vital role}} in moulding costs, so does the complexity of the part's design.

5|$|Plant virus {{particles}} or virus-like particles (VLPs) have applications in both biotechnology and nanotechnology. The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures {{and can be}} produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression {{in a variety of}} heterologous systems. Plant {{virus particles}} can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology.|$|E

5|$|The coil of the {{transducer}} adds some inductance on {{the electrical}} {{side of the}} filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the filter design. While this will not improve performance {{to the extent that}} an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.|$|E
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> {{the polymer}} during polymerisation. One {{method is to}} include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide {{can be used in}} the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic {{has a number of}} morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E
