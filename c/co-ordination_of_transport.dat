50|$|Winston Churchill, clearly {{believing that}} this wartime {{co-ordinating}} role was beneficial, introduced a similar but expanded {{system in the}} first few years of his post-war premiership. The so-called 'overlord ministers' included Frederick Leathers as 'Secretary of State for the <b>Co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transport,</b> Fuel and Power' and Frederick Marquis, 1st Baron Woolton as Lord President. Woolton's job was to co-ordinate the then separate ministries of agriculture and food. The historian Peter Hennessy quotes a PhD thesis by Michael Kandiah saying that Woolton was 'arguably the most successful of the Overlords' partly because his ministries were quite closely related, indeed they were merged in 1955 as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.|$|E

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{quantify}} the light-induced H+ efflux and influx observed in polar leaves of Potamogeton lucens. These proton fluxes are spatially separated. The H+ efflux, mediated by a plasmalemma bound H+-ATPase, occurs across the plasma membrane at the morphological lower epidermis and is accompanied by an H+ influx (or OH- efflux) at the upper side of the leaf. As a result, these leaves exhibit a remarkable pH-polarity in the light. The pH near the lower epidermis may drop to a value as low as 3. 5, while a pH of about 10. 5 can be observed at the upper epidermis. Obviously this phenomenon requires the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> processes in the different cell layers of the leaf tissue. These observations led to quantitative studies of the relation between the H+ fluxes at either plasmalemma. These fluxes were calculated from the pH values recorded at two distances from the leaf surface. Although the H+ influx always exceeded the efflux, a coupling between the transport processes across either plasma membrane became evident from the time-courses of the two fluxes...|$|E
40|$|Some {{three years}} ago {{the results of the}} EU-funded Concerted Action AMCAI were {{published}} in the book "Managing and Controlling Growing Harbour Terminals". The Riga Harbour Container Terminal served a multinational network of scientists as the background for co-ordinating their scientific studies in the areas of modelling, simulation and visualisation. The authors selected the adjective "growing" for the title of this book with the awareness that not only the flows of goods through the Riga Commercial Port would grow but so too the increasing complexity of the logistic processes associated with this which require innovative methods and techniques for their control. With the progressive restructuring of Latvian transport, growing tasks are in fact emerging for the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> processes with overlapping structures. After the successful conclusion of the AMCAI project, the need arose to employ the existing network of experts and their experience in con crete support projects for maritime companies and to process their results to make further use of them. Thus was born the idea for the project Further Development and Practical Application of Harbour Processes Managing and Controlling Models, Methods and Techniques (DAMAC-HP) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{progress}} {{in the sphere of}} transportation economic phenomena depends on improvement of methodological foundations of transport economics, that is composed of elements of general methodology and methodology of economic science and of a set of methodological problems appropriate for economic problems of transportation. Methodological aspects of development of transport economics resolve themselves into two questions: choice of general assumptions and methodological instructions in the sphere of basic research procedures and systematization of existing scientific output. In transport economics improving the first of the two basic research procedures, i. e. the settlement of scientific laws and theories, should consist in broader utilization of hypoithetistic approach, so in aiming at hypotheses and statements formulation of great informative power. It concerns above all the research on general regularities in transportation and macro-economic regularities occurring between transport and national economy. Also respecting the second basic procedure — justification and verfication of statements and theories — extension of the scope of hypothetistic approach can give advantageous results. Accepting, that falsification of statements and theories is a task of verification procedure, could promote the adequacy and more precise determination of utilization scope in transport economics. À level of logical arrangement and maturity of statements and theories of transport economics depends on principles of science systematization, which are formulated by methodology. The recent level of economic science systematization within the sphere of transport is not satisfactory. Thus a need is indicated of extending the level of logical <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> economics statements on the ground of methodological principles, that are generally accepted in science.

40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of freight vehicles on South Africa’s rural road network has received substantial attention. Insinuations persist that long-distance road freight haulage is of a somewhat unsavoury economic nature, and that strict economic re-regulation of the land freight transport is necessary. During the 1970 s road transport replaced rail carriage as the dominant form of long-distance freight transport (excluding minerals and ore) in South Africa. On long hauls road freight carriers transport certain primary products of an organic nature (such as timber, fish and agricultural produce), some semi-finished goods, many finished goods and most consumer goods. Road freight carriers are continuously gaining market share on long-distance links where rail transport is the more cost efficient mode. The greater value added by road freight carriers in comparison with rail transport through service effectiveness is often more than the cost premium paid for utilising their service rather than making use of rail transport. Throughout history, governments have involved themselves in transport. A diverse range of arguments have been advanced for this involvement in transport, including the following: Control of excessive competition, <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> integration of transport with economic policy, maintenance of safety, security, and order, provision of costly infrastructure, provision of public goods, recovery of the true resource cost of transport inputs, regulation of harmful conduct and externalities, restraint of monopoly power, and social support. A set of nine instruments can be identified that governments apply to influence the performance of the freight transport industry: Legislation, direct supply, fiscal measures, monetary measures, moral appeal and persuasion, policies relating to strategic commodities, procurement policy, provision of information, and research and development.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> grasp and <b>transport</b> {{components}} <b>of</b> one-handed catching was examined following mechanical perturbations {{applied to the}} wrist. Six skilled catchers (mean AGE= 27. 5 years) performed 64 trials in which tennis balls were projected at approximately 8 m s− 1. The trial blocks consisted of 10 non-perturbed trials (NPTs) (baseline), and a block of 54 trials of which 20 trials were perturbed. The perturbation was {{in the form of}} a resistive force (12 N) applied via a piece of cord attached to a mechanical brake. In baseline trials participants reached maximal wrist velocity closer to the time of hand–ball contact (237 ms ± 68) than in the perturbed (309 ms ± 61) condition. Furthermore the wrist velocity profile of five out of six participants exhibited a double peak immediately after a perturbation. However, aperture variables such as the relative moment of final hand closure (approximately 70 % of overall movement time) were not typically affected. The stability <b>of</b> grasp and <b>transport</b> coupling for one-handed catching was shown to vary from trial to trial.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 21 st Annual South African Transport Conference 15 - 18 July 2002 "Towards building capacity and accelerating delivery", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The National Department <b>of</b> <b>Transport’s</b> role in the transport sector is one of policy and strategy formulation, substantive regulation, and co-ordination, with reduced direct involvement in operations and {{in the provision of}} infrastructure and services. The paper focuses on the policy, strategy and <b>co-ordination</b> role <b>of</b> the Department in relation to transport infrastructure, and particularly road infrastructure. The NDoT’s policy and strategy relating to transport infrastructure are spelt out in the 1996 White Paper on Transport Policy and the 1999 Moving South Africa Strategic Framework. The paper reviews the status quo <b>of</b> the country’s <b>transport</b> infrastructure, identifies current financing, information, institutional and capacity problems, and postulates options for overcoming these problems. It describes current initiatives of the Department, including the formulation of a comprehensive roads development plan for South Africa, for both the “economic” and “social” elements of the road system. A long-standing problem in South Africa has been inadequate <b>co-ordination</b> and integration <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure provision and management, between the modes <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> between the three spheres of government, between departments of government, between countries of the region, and between the public and private sectors. The paper describes initiatives to improve such co-ordination. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

40|$|Metabolite {{transport}} between organelles, {{cells and}} source and sink tissues not only enables pathway co-ordination {{but it also}} facilitates whole plant communication, particularly in the transmission of information concerning resource availability. Carbon assimilation is co-ordinated with nitrogen assimilation {{to ensure that the}} building blocks of biomass production, amino acids and carbon skeletons, are available at the required amounts and stoichiometry, with associated transport processes making certain that these essential resources are transported from their sites of synthesis to those of utilization. Of the many possible posttranslational mechanisms that might participate in efficient <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> metabolism and <b>transport</b> only reversible thiol-disulphide exchange mechanisms have been described in detail. Sucrose and trehalose metabolism are intertwined in the signalling hub that ensures appropriate resource allocation to drive growth and development under optimal and stress conditions, with trehalose- 6 -phosphate acting as an important signal for sucrose availability. The formidable suite of plant metabolite transporters provides enormous flexibility and adaptability in inter-pathway coordination and source-sink interactions. Focussing on the carbon metabolism network, we highlight the functions of different transporter families, and the important of thioredoxins in the metabolic dialogue between source and sink tissues. In addition, we address how these systems can be tailored for crop improvement...|$|R
