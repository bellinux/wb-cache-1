5|$|The CLR's next planned {{extension}} was westward to Ealing. In 1905, the Great Western Railway (GWR) {{had obtained}} parliamentary approval {{to construct the}} Ealing and Shepherd's Bush Railway (E), connecting its main line route at Ealing Broadway to the West London Railway (WLR) north of Shepherd's Bush. From Ealing, the new line was to curve north-east through still mostly rural North Acton, then run east for a short distance parallel with the GWR's High Wycombe line, before curving south-east. The line was then to run on an embankment south of Old Oak <b>Common</b> and <b>Wormwood</b> Scrubs before connecting to the WLR a short distance {{to the north of}} the CLR's depot.|$|R

5000|$|Popularly {{this species}} is called Old Woman, in {{distinction}} to Old Man or southernwood, Artemisia abrotanum, which it somewhat resembles, {{though it is}} more delicate-looking and lacks the peculiar refreshing scent of 'Old Man.' Dr. Hill says of this species: [...] "This is a very noble bitter: its peculiar province is to give an appetite, {{as that of the}} <b>Common</b> <b>Wormwood</b> is to assist digestion; the flowery tops and the young shoots possess the virtue: the older Leaves and the Stalk should be thrown away as useless .... The apothecaries put three times as much sugar as of the ingredient in their Conserves; but the virtue is lost in the sweetness, those will not keep so well that have less sugar, but 'tis easy to make them fresh as they are wanted." ...|$|E
50|$|The Ameryka {{peninsula}} {{is located}} in between the two lakes Orzysz and Wierzbińskie, which is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Wierzbińskie Bay. From {{the western part of the}} lake there is a bridge which crosses a narrow gap. The width of the peninsula ranges from about 100 to 300 metres. In the narrowest parts of the peninsula, both of the lakes can be seen. On both sides of the lake there are overgrown patches of Alnus glutinosa. Some roots of the trees are visible due to waves eroding their soil, creating a separate characteristic to the part of the lake. Both of the lakes are eutrophic and have similar water-based plants. There is a large amount of swamp vegetation, including the following species found in the lake: bugleweed, bittersweet, water mint, yellow water-lily, and Canadian waterweed. In some parts the shore has sand and is easily accessible. There are also synanthrope plants in the lake: burdock, lion's tail, common nettle, cow parsley, tetterwort and <b>common</b> <b>wormwood.</b> To the southeastern part of the lake, the peninsula becomes more wider and the plants become luxuriant. There are different types of plants in that part than elsewhere: there are blueberries, blackberries and moss, and in the autumn mushrooms grow. In the forest there are visible trenches from World War II. Along the southern part of the shore of Wierzbińskie Lake, there is the stretched village Wierzbiny.|$|E
50|$|Artemisia biennis is {{a species}} of {{sagebrush}} known by the <b>common</b> name biennial <b>wormwood.</b> It is a common and widely distributed weed, so well established in many places that its region of origin is difficult to ascertain.

25|$|Proposals for Old Oak Common being {{considered}} by Transport for London include {{a scheme to}} realign the routes of both the West London and North London lines around the Old Oak Common site {{to create a new}} London Overground interchange station. The proposal envisages diverting the NLL Richmond route to curve around the eastern side of Old Oak Common, and re-routing the WLL to branch west south of the Mitre Bridge before curving north along a short section of the Dudding Hill Line to join the West Coast Main Line. The NLL and WLL would meet at a point on the southern side of Old Oak <b>Common,</b> adjacent to <b>Wormwood</b> Scrubs, where new interchange platforms would be built. Alternative versions of this scheme also consider cheaper options such as terminating the WLL at Old Oak Common or two separate London Overground stations.|$|R

40|$|Objective. To assess efficacy, {{local and}} {{systemic}} tolerability of balsam “Mercana-Artrovit warming” (BMAW) containing methylnicotinat, mint and eucalyptus ethereal oils, propylene glycol extracts of eucalyptus, linden, nettle, elecampane, <b>common</b> <b>wormwood,</b> tansy, terpentine oil in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) Material and methods. 60 pts {{were included in}} a two-week double blind placebo controlled randomized study. BMAW 5 ml was administered in 30 pts (the main group) twice a day (in the morning and in the evening) on the target knee joint. 30 pts of control group received placebo containing only components of stuff. Demographic and clinical parameters in the main and the control groups were comparable. Inclusion criteria: age from 40 to 70 years, pain intensity in the target joint at least 40 mm on VAS, I-III radiological stage according to Kellgren, Leqesne score 4 - 10, treatment with NSAIDs during the previous 3 months. Exclusion criteria: indications for intra-articular glucocorticoid injection, clinically significant disturbances of internal organs function and skin damages {{in the region of}} knee joint. Clinical efficacy was assessed by WOMAC index, pain at movement and at rest, time of 15 meters walking, general assessment of efficacy (separately by the pt and by the doctor). Frequency and character of adverse events was registered. Results. Local BMAW administration provided statistically significant decrease of WO MAC summated score (p= 0, 008), pain at movement (p< 0, 001) and at rest (p< 0, 005). So analgesic effect of the drug is sufficient for improvement of functional activity of pts with KOA. General efficacy assessment was significantly higher in the main group (Fisher exact test, p< 0, 005). Placebo did not significantly change efficacy measures. Adverse events were absent in both groups. Conclusion. The results of the study allows to recommend BMAW for local therapy of KO...|$|E
40|$|Artemisia annua L. is a <b>common</b> type of <b>wormwood</b> {{that grows}} {{throughout}} the world. Artemisinin, a terpene compound in A. annua, {{has recently been}} recognized as the most promising antimalaria drug. Artemisinin {{and other types of}} terpenoids are synthesized and accumulated in glandualr trichomes that appear on the surface of leaf, stem and flower bud. To identify new genes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis and trichome function in A. annua, a normalized glandular trichome cDNA collection was sequenced by Roche GS FLX pyrosequencing system. Two sequencing runs generated totally 85 M nucleotides which were further assembled into 190, 377 unigenes (42, 678 contigs and 147, 699 sigletons). Putative functions were assigned to the unigenes based on Blast search against GeneBank database. Many terpene biosynthesis pathway genes were identified from the pyrosequencing ESTs. Together with other identified A. annua terpene pathway genes, a global view of terpene biosynthesis in glandular trichomes of A. annua were re-established. Meanwhile, a WD repeat protein, AaWD 40, which show high amino acid sequence similarity with its Arabidopsis ortholog, AtTTG 1 (AT 5 G 24520) was identified. To investigate the functional relevance of AaWD 40 to its Arabidopsis counterpart, genetic complementation test using Arabidopsis mutants was conducted. When AaWD 40 was transformed into Arabidopsis transparent testa glabrous 1 (ttg 1 - 1) mutant, the anthocyanins and proanthocyanidin (PAs) production in seeds were restored, and the trichomeless phenotype of ttg 1 - 1 mutant was rescued. In addition, over-expression of AaWD 40 and AtTTG 1 modulated the expression of WUS and CLVs genes which are required to maintain the stem-cell niche of Arabidopsis shoot apex. Transcriptomic profiling of transgenic Arabidopsis over-expressing AaWD 40, TTG 1, or ttg 1 - 1 mutant revealed lists of genes modulated by these two WD 40 genes homologue and gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested that the top-ranked categories are defense, stress response and developmental programme. We hypothesize that WD 40 repeat protein act as a crucial regulatory factor {{in a wide variety of}} cellular functions in A. thaliana. Wang, Wei. Advisers: Guo Dianjing; Jiang Liwen.
