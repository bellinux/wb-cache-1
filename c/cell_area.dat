The ponds were originally created by diking off part of the lake at the Emory's confluence with Swan Pond Creek, which flows down from Harriman (just over the ridge to the northwest). [...] The disposal area consists of the main ash pond (where ash is initially dumped), which is flanked on the southeast by a stilling pond (where water from the main pond is placed to further separate it from the ash) and on the northwest by [...] "dredge cells," [...] where ash from the main pond is placed to further solidify.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{immune system}} has {{paradoxical}} roles during cancer {{development and the}} prognostic significance of immune modulating factors is controversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- beta), interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and their prognostic significance in breast cancers. Ki 67 was included as a measure of growth fraction of tumor cells. Methods On immunohistochemical stained slides from 38 breast cancer patients, we performed digital video analysis of tumor <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> and adjacent tumor stromal areas from the primary tumors and their corresponding lymph node metastases. COX- 2 was recorded as graded staining intensity. Results The expression of TGF-beta, IL- 10 and Ki 67 were recorded in tumor <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> and adjacent tumor stromal areas. In both primary tumors and metastases, the expression of COX- 2 was higher in the tumor stromal areas than in the tumor <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> (both P P = 0. 036). The expression of TGF-beta was highest in the tumor <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> of both primary tumors and metastases (both P P P P Conclusions Stromal expression of COX- 2, TGF-beta and Ki 67 may facilitate tumor progression in breast cancer. </p...|$|R
30|$|In our {{examination}} {{of the development of}} alkaline and calcified internodal <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> of C. globularis, certain parts of the periphery of old internodal cells were free of OH- ions. However, uniform carbonate assimilation was observed between the cortex and cell wall in all internodal <b>cells.</b> Smaller alkaline <b>areas</b> were also noted outside of the oldest internodal cell (23 rd cell), in contrast to the alkaline areas in the 15 th cell from the tip of the thallus (Figure  3 -I, II). However, unclear acidic areas were observed where alkaline <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> were absent from younger and older internodal cells.|$|R
30|$|The {{change in}} the number of antigen-positive cells was {{evaluated}} using simple linear regression of the log count over time. All immune cell markers (CD 2, CD 3, CD 8 α, CD 68, and CD 163) were individually evaluated in the following locations: vital tumor <b>cell</b> <b>areas,</b> granulation tissue surrounding the tumor <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> and between tumor <b>cell</b> <b>areas.</b> Multiple linear regression models, including tumor volume on day 0 or tumor volume on the day of sacrifice, were used to evaluate {{the extent to which the}} time trends were confounded by tumor volume. Although the linear regression models for the different markers and locations did not always show a good fit to the observed data, they still provided an estimate of trends over time. However, the corresponding regression coefficients should be interpreted as average effects over the follow-up period.|$|R
50|$|Blue light hits a plant's {{leaves and}} causes the {{downstream}} activation of proton pumps. In turn, {{this results in}} a decrease of the cell wall's pH. The decrease, in conjunction with membrane-bound proteins called expansins, increases the plasticity of the apoplastic membrane. This plasticity enables more <b>cell</b> <b>area</b> to be created during cell division, which expands the leaf as more standard-sized cells are added. The increase in overall organelles and <b>cell</b> <b>area</b> cause more stomates to form and more light to be utilized.|$|E

40|$|This study {{identifies}} a {{dendritic cell}} (DC) subset that constitutively transports apoptotic intestinal epithelial cell remnants to T <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> of mesenteric lymph nodes in vivo. Rat intestinal lymph contains two DC populations. Both populations have typical DC morphology, are {{major histocompatibility complex}} class II hi, and express OX 62, CD 11 c, and B 7. CD 4 � /OX 41 � DCs are strong antigen-presenting cells (APCs). CD 4 � /OX 41 � DCs are weak APCs and contain cytoplasmic apoptotic DNA, epithelial cell–restricted cytokeratins, and nonspecific esterase (NSE) � inclusions, not seen in OX 41 � DCs. Identical patterns of NSE electrophoretic variants exist in CD 4 � /OX 41 � DCs, intestinal epithelial cells, and mesenteric node DCs but not in other DC populations, macrophages, or tissues. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) -positive DCs and strongly NSE � DCs are present in intestinal lamina propria. Peyer’s patches and mesenteric but not other lymph nodes contain many strongly NSE � DCs in interfollicular and T <b>cell</b> <b>areas.</b> Similar DCs are seen in the ileum and in T <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> of mesenteric nodes in gnotobiotic rats. These results show that a distinct DC subset constitutively endocytoses and transports apoptotic cells to T <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> and suggest a role for these DCs in inducing and maintaining peripheral self-tolerance.

5000|$|In {{order to}} reduce indium content, {{decrease}} processing difficulty, and improve electrical homogeneity, amorphous transparent conducting oxides have been developed.

Indium-zinc-oxide has some comparable properties to ITO. The amorphous structure remains stable even up to 500 °C, which allows for important processing steps common in organic solar cells.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to lymphocyte homing, {{little is known}} about molecular cues controlling the motility of lymphocytes within lymphoid organs. Applying intravital two-photon microscopy, we demonstrate that chemokine receptor CCR 7 signaling enhances the intranodal motility of CD 4 + T cells. Compared to wild-type (WT) cells, the average velocity and mean motility coefficient of adoptively transferred CCR 7 -deficient CD 4 + T lymphocytes in T <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> of WT recipients were reduced by 33 and 55 %, respectively. Both parameters were comparably reduced for WT T lymphocytes migrating in T <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> of plt/plt mice lacking CCR 7 ligands. Importantly, systemic application of the CCR 7 ligand CCL 21 was sufficient to rescue the motility of WT T lymphocytes inside T <b>cell</b> <b>areas</b> of plt/plt recipients. Comparing the movement behavior of T <b>cells</b> in subcapsular <b>areas</b> that are devoid of detectable amounts of CCR 7 ligands even in WT mice, we failed to reveal any differences between WT and plt/plt recipients. Furthermore, in both WT and plt/plt recipients, highly motile T cells rapidly accumulated in the subcapsular region after subcutaneous injection of the CCR 7 ligand CCL 19. Collectively, these data identify CCR 7 and its ligands as important chemokinetic factors stimulating the basal motility of CD 4 + T cells inside lymph nodes in vivo...|$|R

30|$|For {{vessels in}} earlywood, the <b>cell</b> lumen <b>area</b> {{and the total}} of cell lumen area + cell wall area {{initially}} decrease, while <b>cell</b> wall <b>area</b> increases, during [C 2 mim][Cl] treatment. After these initial changes, both the <b>cell</b> lumen <b>area</b> and the total of cell lumen area + cell wall area decrease gradually during further [C 2 mim][Cl] treatment. Meanwhile, the <b>cell</b> wall <b>area</b> increases gradually. These results indicate that cell walls of vessels in earlywood swelled towards the cell lumen without swelling outwards. Similar trends are observed for swelling of vessels in latewood, although the areas are smaller than those for vessels in earlywood. That is, the cell walls swelled toward the cell lumen, and the vessels were compressed by surrounding swollen tissues.|$|R
