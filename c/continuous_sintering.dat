40|$|Problems {{associated}} with improper delubrication are frequently encountered during the manufacturing of sintered components but {{are very difficult}} to identify in a <b>continuous</b> <b>sintering</b> process. The effect of delubrication parameters on the final properties of chromium prealloyed PM steels has been studied by varying the delubrication processing conditions (thermo-profile and processing atmosphere) followed by sintering in Ar/ 10 %H 2 mixture at 1120 ºC. The best results after sintering were obtained for the compacts delubricated at 450 °C in dry nitrogen. Increasing the delubrication temperature to 900 °C resulted in slightly higher impact energy and as-sintered oxygen content but high carbon loss and lower hardness. Delubrication in air resulted in high carbon losses and the lowest impact energy and hardness values. These effects were related to considerable surface oxide changes during delubrication detected by HR SEM+EDX analyses. Delubrication at 300 °C was insufficient resulting in soot formation and inferior as-sintered mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Challenges in {{controlling}} carbon potential during sintering of steel powder {{have been discussed}} in many experimental and theoretical studies. The main issues lie within the complex thermodynamics and kinetics of processing atmosphere chemistry in <b>continuous</b> <b>sintering</b> furnaces.

The {{purpose of this article}} is to summarize these discussions and investigate the interaction of the atmosphere constituents with the sintered compact within a sintering furnace. Considering an industrial practice perspective, the paper ensures the PM industry with a few new look into the understanding of furnace operations and provides recommendations to improve the control of the furnace conditions.

In {{order to reduce the}} production cost, the volume of printing technology will be an inevitable choice. In current laboratory research on dry sintering, the object of the dry sintering is still in the static state. In order to study on the related problem of moving dry <b>sintering</b> object under <b>continuous</b> dry <b>sintering</b> process while the volume of printing technology, to solve problems of the static motionless state, we designed a test apparatus for printing electronic dry sintering. The experimental device was driven by stepping motor, controlled by PLC, temperature controlled by external circulation heat conduction oil, heated by roller drying sintering object. Assembly test results showed that the roller surface temperature was uniform heated by experimental device, and the impact on the uniformity of dry sintering was small. The experimental device could simulate volume of continuous motion state, and also could adapt to the preparation of the shorter sample to save the experiment cost...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research program has been to improve the rate-of-penetration in deep hostile environments by improving the life cycle and performance of coiled-tubing, {{an important component of}} a deep well drilling system for oil and gas exploration, by utilizing the latest developments in the microwave materials technology.

40|$|Reuse of the fly ash {{from the}} {{municipal}} solid waste incinerator (MSWI) is a policy of Taiwan EPA. However, the fly ash is often classified as a hazardous waste and cannot be reused directly because the concentrations of heavy metals exceed the TCLP regulations. The main objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the <b>continuous</b> <b>sintering</b> behavior of fly ash with a rotary kiln and seek a solution to reduce the concentrations of heavy metal to an acceptable value. The partitions of the heavy metals in the process are also considered. The results of TCLP showed that among the metals of Cr, Cd, Cu and Pb, only the concentrations of Pb in raw fly ash exceeded the regulation. At sintering temperatures of 700, 800 and 900 degrees C, the concentration of Pb decreased in sintering products, however, the concentration of Pb still exceeded the limitation at 700 and 800 degrees C. Additionally, the water-washing was used to pre-treat the fly ash before sintering process. The washing treatment effectively reduced the leaching concentrations of Pb to agree the regulations. Therefore, water-washing followed by a sintering treatment is an available process for detoxifying the fly ash of MSWI. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The cost {{efficiency}} {{and performance of}} Powder Metallurgy (PM) steels can be improved by replacing conventionally used alloying elements such as copper and nickel with chromium. Utilizing chromium imposes a challenge in terms of processing due to its effect on powder compressibility and high oxygen affinity, the latter of which, to a certain extent, is dealt with by introducing chromium in prealloyed form that decreases its activity. Therefore, each stage in the PM processing route has to be reconsidered to satisfy the thermodynamic and kinetic requirements to appropriately sinter components based on chromium alloyed steel powder for manufacturing high-performance PM parts. For conventional PM steels, consolidation is typically achieved by compaction, where the final dimensions of the part are achieved, followed by sintering, where metallurgical bonding between the powder particles takes place. To facilitate compaction, powder is mixed with lubricant, which also improves the tool life; but the lubricant has to be removed prior to sintering. Among the problems encountered during sintering, those concerning delubrication are frequent but are difficult to detect. In the present study, a reliable approach for in-situ monitoring of the delubrication of PM steel compacts is presented. The method is based on continuous monitoring of the process atmosphere using sensors commonly used in the industry (CO 2 and O 2). Using this method, the effect of various process parameters on lubricant removal has been investigated and the changes occurring in the surface chemistry of the compacts during delubrication {{and their impact on}} sintering have been assessed. Based on these studies, delubrication at 450 °C in dry N 2 with dynamic gas flow conditions around the sample and a low heating rate were proposed to be optimum for the delubrication of chromium-alloyed PM steels. Sintering of water-atomized chromium-alloyed powder compacts is typically performed in hydrogen-containing atmospheres with nitrogen as the carrier gas. However, attaining good carbon control in these atmospheres is challenging. Hence, the effect of different active constituents in the atmosphere, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide and propane, on the reduction-oxidation and carburization-decarburization processes during the sintering of chromium-alloyed PM steels was investigated. It was shown that concentration of carbon monoxide above 1 vol. % in the sintering atmosphere results in significant oxidation of the compacts, whereas lower concentrations contribute to counteract the carbon loss and provide for the possibility of carburization during a <b>continuous</b> <b>sintering</b> process. Furthermore, lean atmospheres containing carbon monoxide, hydrogen and hydrocarbons as active constituents, with their total concentration not exceeding 5 vol. %, were shown to be potential candidates for sintering of chromium-alloyed PM steels, since they provide carburization while confining oxidation to acceptable levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{conductive}} nanomaterials {{applicable to}} unconventional printing techniques have attracted {{a great deal}} of attention, and in particular, cost-effective copper-based electrode materials have been recognized as viable candidates for replacement of the expensive silver counterpart. In this study, we synthesize newly designed Cu/Cu 10 Sn 3 core/shell nanoparticles, as an additive material for overcoming the critical drawbacks in Cu nanoparticle-based electrodes, in combination with a large-area processable, <b>continuous</b> photonic <b>sintering</b> process on a time scale of 10 - 3 s. By virtue of the low-melting point nature of the Cu 10 Sn 3 phase, the facile electrode fabrication process is easily triggered, yielding resistivities of 27. 8 and 12. 2 μω cm under energy dose conditions of 0. 97 and 1. 1 J/cm 2, respectively, at which highly conductive electrodes cannot be obtained from phase-pure Cu nanoparticles. The suspension mixture of Cu and Cu/Cu 10 Sn 3 nanoparticles permits roll-to-roll processable, highly uniform Cu-based electrodes (with a sheet resistance and a standard deviation of 1. 21 and 0. 29 ω/square, respectively) even on vulnerable polyethylene naphthalate substrate, while the electrodes derived from Cu 10 Sn 3 phase-free Cu nanoparticles suffer from nonuniform characteristics and even a partially insulating nature. The practical applicability of Cu/Cu 10 Sn 3 core/shell nanoparticles is demonstrated with the fabrication of a touch screen panel and an antenna for wireless power transmission. clos...|$|R

Originally, it was proposed to accomplish this by developing an efficient and economically viable continuous microwave process to sinter continuously formed/extruded steel powder for the manufacture of seamless coiled tubing and other tubular products. However, based on the results and faced with insurmountable difficulties in the extrusion and de-waxing processes, the approach of achieving the goals of the program has been slightly changed. In the continuation proposal an approach of microwave sintering combined with Cold Isostatic Press (CIP) and joining (by induction or microwave) is adopted. This process can be developed into a semi-continuous sintering process if the CIP can produce parts fast enough to match the microwave sintering rates.

40|$|Changes of {{atmosphere}} composition during sintering of water atomized powder prealloyed with Mn and Cr (up to 2 % of both) were studied. Increasing sensitivity to atmosphere purity with increasing alloying elements content was registered. <b>Continuous</b> monitoring of <b>sintering</b> atmosphere composition (CO/CO 2 /H 2 O) indicates three critical stages during the heating up to final sintering temperature: {{the importance of}} rapid atmosphere purification after lubricant decomposition and removal; {{the reduction of the}} iron oxide layer by hydrogen at temperatures up to ~ 500 °C and by carbon at temperatures around ~ 720 °C; the reduction of the spinel oxides on the powder surface at above 900 °C and further reduction of thermodynamically stable surface oxides and mixed internal oxides close to the sintering temperature. The measured ratio of CO/CO 2 indicates favorable thermodynamic conditions for reduction of stable oxides as (Cr,Mn) xOy close to sintering temperature (1120 C) for the applied sintering conditions. The experimental results were confirmed by modeling the metal-gas interactions using the thermodynamic/thermochemical softwares ThermoCalc and HSC Chemistry.

40|$|An {{original}} {{approach for}} {{the synthesis of}} iron aluminides of the type FeAl 1 -x is presented, based {{on the use of}} a squeeze-casting equipment for inducing the reactive infiltration of Al into a porous preform made by <b>sintering</b> <b>continuous</b> Fe-based fibres. The casting is subsequently homogenised by heat treatment in the solid state. Preforms with fibre volume fractions ranging between 40 and 80 % (fractions that correspond to stoichiometries close to FeAl and Fe 3 Al. respectively) are prepared using steel-wool fibres with various diameters. Small fibre diameters and high processing temperatures are found to be beneficial for obtaining, after squeeze casting a low-porosity material with a large amount of uniformly distributed reaction compounds. However, the preform thickness that can be properly infiltrated is limited to about 6 mm. The homogenisation of the intermetallic phase is complete after only 5 h at 1000 degreesC. A major problem to be solved is the heterogeneity of the porosity distribution in the sample after homogenisation. This heterogeneity results from an insufficiently uniform distribution of the fibre volume fraction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
