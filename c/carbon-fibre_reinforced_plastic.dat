40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review recent {{research}} on the applications of existing non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques, especially radio frequency (RF) NDT, for <b>carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> (CFRP) composites.

The anisotropic characteristic of the conductivity and the relationship between the penetration depth and conductivity should be paid much attention. Then, the well-established RF NDT including eddy current technique, microwave technique and RF-based thermography are well categorised into four types (i. e. electromagnetic induction, resonance, RF-based thermography and RF wave propagation) and demonstrated in detail.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> in loadbearing automotive structures provides a great potential toreduce vehicle weight and fuel consumption. To enable themanufacture and assembly of composite structural parts,reliable and cost-effective joining technologies must bedeveloped. This thesis addresses {{several aspects of}} joining andload introduction in <b>carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> based onnon-crimp fabric reinforcement. The bearing strength of carbon fibre/epoxy laminates wasinvestigated considering the effects of bolt-hole clearance. The laminate failure modes and ultimate bearing strength werefound to be significantly dependent upon the laminate stackingsequence, geometry and lateral clamping load. Significantreduction in bearing strength at 4 % hole deformation was foundfor both pin-loaded and clamped laminates. The ultimatestrength of the joints {{was found to be}} independent of theinitial bolt-hole clearance. The behaviour of hybrid (bolted/bonded) joints wasinvestigated both numerically and experimentally. Athree-dimensional non-linear finite element model was developedto predict the load transfer distribution in the joints. Theeffect of the joint geometry and adhesive material propertieson the load transfer was determined through a parameter study. An experimental investigation was undertaken to determine thestrength, failure mechanisms and fatigue life of hybrid joints. The joints were shown to have greater strength, stiffness andfatigue life in comparison to adhesive bonded joints. However,the benefits were only observed in joint designs which allowedfor load sharing between the adhesive and the bolt. The effect of the environment on the durability of bondedand hybrid joints was investigated. The strength and fatiguelife of the joints was found to decrease significantly withincreased ageing time. Hybrid joints demonstrated increasedfatigue life in comparison to adhesive bonded joints afterageing in a cyclic freeze/thaw environment. The strength and failure mechanisms of composite laminatessubject to localised transverse loading were investigatedconsidering the effect of the specimen size, stacking sequenceand material system. Damage was found to initiate in thelaminates at low load levels, typically 20 - 30 % of the ultimatefailure load. The dominant initial failure mode wasintralaminar shear failure, which occurred in sub-surfaceplies. Two different macromechanical failure modes wereidentified, fastener pull-through failure and global collapseof the laminate. The damage patterns and ultimate failure modewere found to depend upon the laminate stacking sequence andresin system. Finite element analysis was used to analyse thestress distribution within the laminates and predict first-plyfailure.

Modern shells are usually made of <b>carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> in a honeycomb structure.

50|$|The {{decline in}} the cost of carbon fibre during the 1970s allowed {{sailplane}} designers to design large components from <b>carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> (CFRP). The use of carbon-fibre lay-ups, designed to reduce aero-elasticity of wings, has allowed CFRP gliders to be designed to cruise at much higher speeds than those with wings made from fibreglass (GFRP) or wood, as well as take advantage of thinner aerofoil sections. The Ventus has a 15-metre wingspan, using CFRP in its structure, complying with 15m Racing Class specifications. Extended wingtips can be fitted to increase the span to 16.6 metres for competition in the Open Class. The fuselage was also produced in two sizes to suit pilots of different heights - the Ventus A for short pilots and Ventus B with a longer and wider cockpit. Both Ventus A and Ventus B have a complex flap/brake arrangement {{similar to that of the}} Glasflügel Mosquito and the Mini-Nimbus, but the Ventus C reverted to conventional upper-surface air-brakes that are separate from the trailing-edge flaps.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Spin-blind-riveting (SBR) is a newly {{developed}} joining process, which combines {{the advantages of}} conventional blind riveting and flow drilling screws. With this technology, {{it is possible to}} join two different materials by one-sided accessibility without the need of pre-drilling holes. This complex process cannot be simulated by 2 D finite element method. Therefore, a more realistic 3 D finite element model for the SBR process is developed using the commercial software package ABAQUS. The applicability of this work is demonstrated for joining magnesium alloy AZ 31 B and <b>carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics.</b> Dynamic effects, thermomechanical coupling, material damage laws, and contact criterion were taken into account in the model. The Johnson–Cook material constitutive equation was used, considering the effects of strain, strain rate, and temperature on material properties. Finally, through simulation, the joint formation, stress distribution and riveting temperature were obtained. Furthermore, a series of experiments were carried out to validate the simulation results.

40|$|High {{performance}} composites, such as <b>carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> (CFRP), {{are increasingly}} being used in high engineering industries. Their wide acceptance introduces an issue regarding the bonding of these materials and their mechanical behaviour. As this reinforced thermoplastic is not easily bonded with adhesives due to the chemical inertness, the fusion bonding process {{could be used to}} make a structural bond. In this paper, the interlaminar fracture behaviour of infrared welded bonds was investigated based on experimental analysis. The material used, is a 5 -harness satin-weave (5 HS) carbon fabric-reinforced polyphenylene sulphide (PPS). Laminates were welded using infrared light and a delamination was introduced by a Kapton film. Welding parameters were first optimized using lapshear tests, then mode I and mode II tests were conducted to determine the fracture toughness behaviour of the welded bonds. Tests under mode I loading were carried out using double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens whereas for mode II loading, three-point end notched flexure (ENF) specimens were considered. Crack growth under mode I and mode II loading conditions was observed to be unstable resulting in a sawtooth like load-displacement response, but nevertheless, values for the fracture toughness were derived...|$|R

50|$|While {{most of the}} {{fuselage}} is made of aluminium alloys, composite materials comprise more than 20% of the A380's airframe. <b>Carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic,</b> glass-fibre reinforced plastic and quartz-fibre reinforced plastic are used extensively in wings, fuselage sections (such as the undercarriage and rear end of fuselage), tail surfaces, and doors. The A380 is the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic. It is also the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross section. The wings of other commercial airliners are partitioned span-wise into sections. This flowing continuous cross section reduces aerodynamic drag. Thermoplastics {{are used in the}} leading edges of the slats. The hybrid fibre metal laminate material GLARE (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers' leading edges. This aluminium-glass-fibre laminate is lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation. Unlike earlier composite materials, GLARE can be repaired using conventional aluminium repair techniques. The application of GLARE on the A380 has a long history, which shows the complex nature of innovations in the aircraft industry.|$|E

40|$|<b>Carbon-fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> {{have been}} widely used in the {{aerospace}} industry as materials for structural components. During recent years, the focus has been on preform/RTM materials with the aim of improving material properties and reducing costs. Harnessing the full potential of these materials requires a model for assessing the properties and in particular long-term behaviour. Such a model needs {{to take into account the}} special conditions of these materials. Basic failure mechanisms have to be analysed in order to develop this kind of model. Consequently, the aim of the work was to investigate the fatigue phenomenon in preform-CFRP materials with thermoset matrices on a microstructural level. The influence of the dynamic loading and the temperature on the emerging fracture phenomena should be identified. Based on the results, a common fracture mechanism should be found. The failure should be described on a mesoscopic level so that it is not restricted on the fatigue failure at a single crack front. To achieve this aim, different preform materials with EP matrix (some of which had been subjected to impact) were loaded with dynamic compression load and high frequent alternate bending. The fatigue behaviour of the matrix systems was investigated by CT tests. By means of microfractography, the only method for detecting fatigue failure as such, the failure mechanisms were analysed at submicroscopic level. The results showed correlations between microstructure and failure. It became apparent that what in the technical literature has been given as an explanation for the appearance of the fatigue striations in the scanning electron microscope had to be corrected. As undercuts are not reflected in the SEM as dark striations, the appearance of the striations must be based on different inclinations of the local fractured surface to the primary electron beam. On the basis of this result the shape and the formation of the fatigue striations could be shown in resin pockets and fibre imprints. Fatigue striations have a shape which sticks out from the fracture plane, preferably in the form of steps. There was no proof for an influence of the high frequent load on the formation of fatigue striations. However, it was possible to find lamellar fracture phenomena which have not been described in the technical literature yet. Due to their shape and their occurrence these can be understood rather as a sign of a dynamic load then as a fracture phenomenon of a high frequent cyclic loading. The examinations of the high frequent loaded samples, where temperatures up to 120 °C occurred, as well as in the CT tests with elevated temperatures (60...|$|R
