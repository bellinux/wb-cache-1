The German intelligence agency, BND, announced it was seeking to hire 130 [...] "hackers" [...] for a new [...] "cyber defence station" [...] unit. In March 2013, BND president Gerhard Schindler announced that his agency had observed up to five attacks a day on government authorities, thought mainly to originate in China. He confirmed the attackers had so far only accessed data and {{expressed concern that the}} stolen information could be used as the basis of future sabotage attacks against arms manufacturers, telecommunications companies and government and military agencies. Shortly after Edward Snowden leaked details of the U.S. National Security Agency's <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> system, German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich announced that the BND would be given an additional budget of 100 million Euros to increase their <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> capability from 5% of total internet traffic in Germany to 20% of total traffic, the maximum amount allowed by German law.|$|E

40|$|Model-based {{approaches}} have become important tools to model data and infer knowledge. Such approaches {{are often used}} for clustering and object recognition which are crucial steps in many applications, including but not limited to, recommendation systems, search engines, <b>cyber</b> security, <b>surveillance</b> and object tracking. Many of these applications have the urgent need to reduce the semantic gap of data representation between the system level and the human being understandable level. Indeed, the low level features extracted to represent a given object can be confusing to machines which cannot differentiate between very similar objects trivially distinguishable by human beings (e. g. apple vs tomato). Such a semantic gap between the system and the user perception for data, makes the modeling process hard to be designed basing on the features space only. Moreover those models should be flexible and updatable when new data are introduced to the system. Thus, apart from estimating the model parameters, the system should be somehow informed how new data should be perceived according to some criteria {{in order to establish}} model updates. In this thesis we propose a methodology for data representation using a hierarchical mixture model basing on the inverted Dirichlet and the generalized inverted Dirichlet distributions. The proposed approach allows to model a given object class by a set of components deduced by the system and grouped according to labeled training data representing the human level semantic. We propose an update strategy to the system components that takes into account adjustable metrics representing users perception. We also consider the "page zero" problem in image retrieval systems when a given user does not possess adequate tools and semantics to express what he/she is looking for, while he/she can visually identify it. We propose a statistical framework that enables users to start a search process and interact with the system in order to find their target "mental image". Finally we propose to improve our models by using a variational Bayesian inference to learn generalized inverted Dirichlet mixtures with features selection. The merit of our approaches is evaluated using extensive simulations and real life applications...|$|R

5000|$|Scorponok {{was portrayed}} as a {{dangerous}} combination known as [...] "a thug with a brain". Acting as infantry and a powerful enemy. He also displayed above average scientific knowledge {{with an emphasis on}} chemistry. Although he brutishly shot his barrage of missiles like a [...] "thug", his missiles would more often than not be enhanced via chemical experimentation and inventions. Scorponok has knowledge enough about Transformer anatomy and physiology {{that he was able to}} completely rebuild Megatron piece by piece after being destroyed by Terrorsaur. Inventions contributed to his works include: Mega Missile, Vibro Rocket, <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Cyber</b> Bee, Mood manipulating Cyber Bee, Cyber Sting fluid. Although he was an inventor, he was largely overshadowed by his comrades scientific prowess. Not to mention most, if not all of Scorponok's creations didn't work or had some obvious flaw in their design. Scorponok had several important roles in season one, like finding an old Predacon cannon (which he almost lost to Cheetor), and then chased Cheetor in the Darksyde with Waspinator. He then tried to infect Optimus Primal with a virus that was supposed to make him a coward, but instead made him a berserker. He was partners with Blackarachnia who betrayed him twice. Scorponok also didn't get along with Terrorsaur because Terrorsaur always wanted to usurp Megatron. Throughout season one, Scorponok's faith in Megatron was unmatched, almost to the extent of looking up to him. Scorponok was arguably the lone original Predacon who was completely loyal to Megatron; the other 4 original Predacons - Terrorsaur, Tarantulas, Waspinator, and Dinobot - all tried to usurp Megatron's position of leader at one point of the first season. Sadly this was never reciprocated, and Megatron treated Scorponok as disposable as the rest of his minions.|$|R

On 14 September, a former prime minister Matti Vanhanen noted that the government needed to regain control on who enters the country and to divert asylum seekers to special camps. He {{did not think that}} it would be appropriate that the asylum seekers could continue to freely move around. Later on the same day, the Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo, who is also a member of the National Coalition Party, noted that tightened border controls would be imposed on the northern border stations by the end of the week. On 14 November 2015 Finnish prime minister Juha Sipilä noted that border controls need to be tightened and he expressed his concern that Schengen Agreement and freedom of movement was not working. He stressed, that border controls will be restored if Schengen agreement is not fixed. Furthermore, he noted, that Finnish National Bureau of Investigation will improve its <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance.</b> On the same day Finnish President Sauli Niinistö (elected from the National Coalition Party) was referred to have noted that national solutions needed to be formed if the Schengen agreement could not be repaired.|$|E
40|$|ENGLISH: When Edward Snowden in 2013 leaked {{documents}} about U. S. surveillance, {{the focus}} shifted to how nation-states perform surveillance of Internet and telecom communications, {{and it was}} then a need for educated information about the topic. In this master thesis we investigate how nation-states can perform their <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance,</b> how suppliers of products or services can support the nation-states’ <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and how we can protect ourselves against it. We found that the most prominent way consists of collecting data from central points of communication, e. g. Internet and telecom providers. In some cases, it is necessary for the nation-state to perform targeted surveillance by installing surveillance software onto their suspects’ devices. The information they collect from centralized and targeted surveillance can lead to big data issues that relate to collecting, storing, and processing the massive amounts of data. A supplier can decide to help nation-states in their <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and by exploiting the trust we lay in the supplier it would result in that we would face a completely different threat landscape, where we find it difficult to protect our privacy and security...|$|E
40|$|The thesis titled, Cyberspace, Surveillance, Law and Privacy {{analyses}} {{the implications}} of state sponsored <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> on the exercise of the human right to privacy of communications and data privacy of individuals, subject to untargeted interception of digital communications. The principle aim of the thesis is to assess the legality of mass <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> of the Five Eyes alliance, {{with an emphasis on}} the United States and the United Kingdom. The study also considers the growing trend among the law enforcement agencies to access data without consent located in foreign jurisdictions without recourse to the Mutual Legal Assistance arrangements. The objective of the thesis is to demonstrate that these activities breach states’ human rights obligations under the international human rights frameworks and to show the unprecedented impact that surveillance technologies continue to have on this right. The research also highlights the inadequate protection of privacy in the internet. This leads to the evaluation of a number of possible legal solutions on the international level to the problem of mass surveillance, since the internet is a global environment designed for unrestricted data flows among jurisdictions and therefore facilitates continued violation of privacy of communications and data privacy. The thesis finds that bearing in mind (a) the highly politicised nature of the internet governance discourse, (b) the reluctance of states to subject peacetime espionage to international law regulation through a legally binding treaty, (c) the fact that international human rights law relating to privacy of communications is in need of modernization, (d) the reluctance of states to commit to a legally binding cyber treaty, (e) the slow pace with which customary cyber international law rules emerge and (f) the tendencies of states on the domestic level towards the introduction of draconian surveillance legislation at the expense of privacy, any progress in this regard at this stage will be piecemeal and likely to be achieved through a combination of the updating of the existing international and regional human rights and data protection instruments and soft law agreements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} brings {{opportunities for}} network forensics tracing Internet criminals in the distributed environment. We {{may use the}} new “pay-as-you-go ” model of the cloud computing to deploy the on-demand <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> sentinels and conduct distributed traceback in complicated cyber crime scene investigations. To trace criminals abusing anonymous communication networks such as Tor, law enforcement can deploy high-bandwidth Amazon EC 2 sentinels into the Tor network. Some sentinels are configured as Tor entry guards and others work as Tor exits nodes. With the high bandwidth and appropriate number of such sentinels, we can achieve a required probability that a Tor circuit passes through an entry sentinel and an exit sentinel in order to capture the suspects. The proposed “pay-as-you-go ” traceback model is cost-effective since the investigation may last for just hours with effective traceback techniques. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this new traceback strategy through the cloud...|$|E
40|$|Post-coup Thailand has {{witnessed}} a troubling shift toward censorship, surveillance, and suppression in cyberspace. With cyber security ranking prominently on the military’s agenda {{and the expansion}} of the military’s cyber intervention, the country’s online infrastructure has undergone politicization, securitization, and militarization. This paper argues that the militarization of cyberspace in Thailand represents the process in which cyber warfare capabilities have been integrated with other military forces and with support from the masses. This process has been effective through at least three significant mechanisms, including mass surveillance, surveillance by the masses, and normalization of surveillance. Social media have been turned into an absolute digital panopticon. Cyber dystopia, created by the 2014 coup and supported by the masses, has served to sustain a ‘state of exception’ not only within the territorial borders of the state, but also more importantly, within the virtual space of civil society. <b>Cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> by the military and the masses has continued to jeopardize the already vulnerable Thai democracy...|$|E
40|$|This study explores a {{particular}} form of <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> in China known as "human flesh search," in which unrelated Internet users collaboratively conduct surveillance on fellow citizens. Its theoretical framework draws up the notion of panoptic model, first articulated in the early 1800 s by Jeremy Bentham and then developed by the French social theorist and philosopher Michel Foucault. Unlike some previous studies on human flesh searching, which focus on highly publicized search incidents, this study examines <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> in its daily practice, and probes how and why collaborative searches occur in China. It also explores structural constraints and empowerment experienced by search participants {{through the lens of}} power, in order to understand such a controversial activity. The study involved content analysis of a Chinese leading search forum [...] MOP Human Flesh Search Forum; an online survey with 158 search participants; and in-depth interviews with 9 search participants. The study found that Chinese human flesh search often took the forms of coveillance (peer-to-peer surveillance) and sousveillance (bottom-up surveillance). Fun-seeking was the primary motive for participants, who are mainly male youths; being helpful is the next. Privacy invasions and power abuses have complicated or even undermined search practices, limiting the potential of this activity to contribute to civil governance. In terms of empowerment, participating in the human flesh search seemed to give individual searchers a sense of empowerment, but such effects vary greatly depending on individuals' knowledge, social resources and search experiences. Privacy invasions and power abuses were consistently evident in searching practices, limiting the potential of this crowd-based searching, even when this is said to promote justice, to contribute to civil governance. The study also found that the panoptic model is still highly relevant and useful in understanding collaborative online surveillance, especially the function and effects of "gaze. " Once conducted in a collective manner, the gaze of fellow citizens can be greatly extended in its reach and intensified by massive participation. The human flesh search mechanism studied here has great potential to profoundly change China's media landscape, but such potential is limited by current media censorship and the lack of accountability of search participants. Although the study examines searching phenomenon only in Chinese cyber space, the findings may shed light on similar surveillance practices which have emerged elsewhere in recent years. The whole question of citizen participation might benefit from the explication of the role of participation in this form of surveillance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe use of {{monitoring}} devices (data collection) in business organizations is facilitated through New Information and Communication Technologies (NICT) such as fingerprint, facial or eyes biometric, time clocks, <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance,</b> remote tracking of employees via GPS, and others. While standard economic theory advocates {{the use of}} incentive systems and surveillance to increase performance at work, some empirical studies show a fall in the level and quality of effort after the introduction {{of monitoring}}. Using self-determination theory (SDT), we explain this phenomenon by {{the negative impact of}} “monitoring systems extensiveness” on employees’ intrinsic motivation (IM). We hypothesize the mediation of this impact by the degree to which employees perceive their supervisors as being “autonomy supportive”. We also investigate the possibility of a moderating effect of “employees’ beliefs about the purposes of devices for monitoring” on the relationships between “monitoring systems extensiveness”, “perception of supervision” and “intrinsic motivation”. We test these hypotheses using a questionnaire, collected in France, from 579 employees having at least one supervisor. Developing a structural equation model, we find: firstly, a significant crowding out effect of IM by monitoring; secondly, this crowding out effect is significantly mediated by employees’ perception of supervision; thirdly, we confirm a strong positive relation between an autonomy supportive supervision and IM. Finally, we do not find any significant moderation by employees’ beliefs about the purposes attributed to monitoring devices...|$|E
40|$|Regional heavy {{rainfall}} is usually {{caused by the}} influence of extreme weather conditions. Instant {{heavy rainfall}} often results in the flooding of rivers and the neighboring low-lying areas, {{which is responsible for}} a large number of casualties and considerable property loss. The existing precipitation forecast systems mostly focus on the analysis and forecast of large-scale areas but do not provide precise instant automatic monitoring and alert feedback for individual river areas and sections. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an easy method to automatically monitor the flood object of a specific area, based on the currently widely used remote <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems and image processing methods, in order to obtain instant flooding and waterlogging event feedback. The intrusion detection mode of these surveillance systems is used in this study, wherein a flood is considered a possible invasion object. Through the detection and verification of flood objects, automatic flood risk-level monitoring of specific individual river segments, as well as the automatic urban inundation detection, has become possible. The proposed method can better meet the practical needs of disaster prevention than the method of large-area forecasting. It also has several other advantages, such as flexibility in location selection, no requirement of a standard water-level ruler, and a relatively large field of view, when compared with the traditional water-level measurements using video screens. The results can offer prompt reference for appropriate disaster warning actions in small areas, making them more accurate and effective...|$|E
40|$|Various youth {{initiated}} grassroots environmental {{campaigns have}} emerged within Vietnam’s complicated political and media context {{over the past}} few years. This raises questions regarding how Vietnamese youth have taken advantage of the Internet to protect the environment. Guided by the research question “How do young Vietnamese citizens use online media for environmental activism?” and using the ‘Save Son Doong’ movement as the case study, this research evaluates the effort of the ‘Save Son Doong’ activists in using online media to run the movement. This research also generally explores the opportunities and challenges for grassroots groups to run environmental movements in the Vietnamese context. In-depth individual interviews and a focus group with the ‘Save Son Doong’ activists were employed as the main data collection methods. Content mapping and content analysis were also applied in order to produce a comprehensive assessment of the movement activities. Research findings indicate that young, highly educated and tech-savvy activists have been very diligent in taking advantage of the Internet to circumvent the state-controlled mainstream media system and lack of resources to run the ‘Save Son Doong’ movement. By employing online media to organize advocacy activities (petitioning, media advocacy and obtaining endorsement from well-known people), social mobilization activities (building coalition and mobilizing resources) and public will campaigns, they succeeded in raising public awareness, provoking public discourse about the issue, stimulating the mainstream media into massively covering the story and pressuring the decision makers into responding to the matter. However, their weak-tie connections, as well as the shortage of finance and human resources, are reasons for the unsustainability of the movement. It is recommended that the ‘Save Son Doong’ working group consider institutionalising their organisation. The ‘Save Son Doong’ movement has become an inspiration for other online grassroots movements to emerge in Vietnam. However, activists will most likely encounter some obstacles including hacking, the digital divide, state <b>cyber</b> <b>surveillance</b> or the illegitimacy of online activism in Vietnam. The research’s focus has been on discovering the ‘Save Son Doong’ activists’ methods and perceptions of online activism. An evaluation {{of the impact of the}} movement from the perspective(s) of the public audience, as well as the mainstream media, would be helpful, as it will provide a more objective view of how effectively the activists have used online media in this movement. Future research can also expand on this topic by scaling up the case study, or by adopting a quantitative method that supplies scholars and activists with a broader view of the Vietnamese context of citizen online activism in general, and grassroots environmental activism in particular...|$|E
