5|$|The site is {{only able}} to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> LEO {{satellites}} in ten of their fourteen orbits, unlike SvalSat and TrollSat which can communicate in all orbits. All three stations are interconnected and <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> the Tromsø Network Operations Center, {{which is part of}} the TSS complex. This allows for redundancy as TSS, SvalSat and TrollSat can be used to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> all satellites connected to the system. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution, in addition to network planning, customer support and ground station control. The facilities use interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E

50|$|The best {{software}} developers {{understand the importance}} of <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> people over <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> the computer, according to Code Complete by Steve McConnell. On average, 85 percent of a programmer's time is spent <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> people, while only 15 percent is spent <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> the computer. Maintenance programmers spend 50 to 60 percent of their time trying to understand the code they have to maintain and a software program will have, on average, 10 generations of maintenance programmers in its lifetime.|$|R

5|$|Bird {{calls and}} songs, which are {{produced}} in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> sound. This communication can be very complex; some species can operate {{the two sides of}} the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.|$|E
5|$|Captive whales have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire {{on behalf of the}} whales to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> humans, as whales have a very different vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.|$|E

50|$|The QuickPath {{architecture}} differs {{considerably from}} earlier Intel architectures, and is {{much closer to}} AMD's HyperTransport architecture. Except {{for the lack of}} a memory interface, the X58 is similar to the traditional northbridge: it <b>communicates</b> <b>with</b> the processor(s) via the high bandwidth QuickPath Interconnect, it <b>communicates</b> <b>with</b> the southbridge via Direct Media Interface (DMI), and it <b>communicates</b> <b>with</b> high bandwidth peripherals via PCI Express (PCIe).|$|R

The protocol is {{used to refer to}} and <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> processes, programs, and data, including both the user interface and the network. With the release of the 4th edition, it was modified and renamed 9P2000.|$|E

An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E
