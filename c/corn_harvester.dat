5000|$|A <b>corn</b> <b>harvester</b> is {{a machine}} used on farms to harvest corn {{stripping}} the stalks about one foot {{from the ground}} shooting the stalks through the header to the ground. The corn is stripped from its stalk and then moves through the header to the intake conveyor belt. From there it goes up the conveying system through a fan system, separating the remaining stalks from the ears. The stalks blow out the fan duct into the field while the ears drop onto another conveyor belt. The ears ride the belt and drop into a large moving bucket.|$|E

As the {{installed}} base {{of all other}} assemblies, the <b>corn</b> combine <b>harvester</b> chassis supports a variety of loads from the harvester and ground, so its reliability directly affects the quality and safety of the <b>corn</b> combine <b>harvester.</b> The analysis of <b>corn</b> combine <b>harvester</b> chassis was carried out with finite element analysis software. First, the 3 D part of the chassis was established and simplified {{in accordance with the}} relevant principles. Second, the stress distribution and displacement of the chassis in the no-loaded and full-loaded conditions were calculated by meshing，applying loads and constraining boundary conditions. The analysis result is of great significance to enhance the quality and reliability of the chassis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{developed}} <b>corn</b> stubble <b>harvester</b> can simultaneously finish {{such as the}} digging, picking up, cleaning, {{collection and}} Stripy laying stubble process and so on, but it cost more man-hour time {{because of the high}} digging resistance and high engine power consumption in digging stubble works. The digging spring tooth for <b>corn</b> stubble <b>harvester</b> including self-exited vibration S-shaped spring handle and curved chisel-shaped bionic tooth is designed based on the mechanism of drag reduction of self-excited vibration and bionic drag reduction for reduce digging resistance and power consumption, and the statics analysis of digging spring tooth is done by ANSYS software, the stress and strain distribution diagrams show the design is reasonable...|$|R
40|$|Harvesting corn {{proved to}} be one of the most back-breaking and labor {{intensive}} jobs on the farm, with most of the work being done by hand until the late 19 th century. By the 1880 s, inventors began designing mechanical <b>corn</b> <b>harvesters</b> to cut the corn more rapidly and with less labor. However, these machines did not husk the ears – that job was left to the family to do. From the back of the stereograph: Corn is a double food supply for stock. The grain is one of the best foods known for horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs. The stalks and leaves when cured take the place of hay and straw both as food and bedding. [...] . The first of these harvesters that were operated did not meet with favor. They knocked off too many ears of corn. This objection has been partially overcome. At any rate it is no great task to pick up the fallen ears in a field where the corn has been so harvested. And there is a great saving in labor and in time by using machinery instead of men.

5000|$|James Pickering Dovel, (26 December, 1868 - 30 July, 1948) [...] {{author and}} inventor, {{spent most of}} his life searching for ways to improve blast furnace operation. Born in 1868 in the {{community}} of Pickerington, Ohio near Columbus, Dovel spent his early years running a farm for his invalid father. Still, his inventive genius did not go untapped. The hard work of farming turned his attention to the need for labor saving machinery and stirred him, at age seventeen, to invent a mechanical <b>corn</b> <b>harvester.</b> While the device was never patented, it was adopted by several manufacturers of farm equipment. The depression of the 1890s drove Dovel, his wife and children to the city, where he landed a job at Columbus Steam and Boiler Company. Within days Dovel's boss had discovered his talent and promoted him to foreman, launching a long career in industrial invention.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} some {{conditions which}} cause grain breakage and grain loss during harvesting process of horizontal roller <b>corn</b> <b>harvester.</b> If the transmission rate between two snapping rollers can be changed, the grain breakage and grain loss {{can be solved}} at a certain level. So a pair of differential speed snapping rollers for horizontal roller <b>corn</b> <b>harvester</b> was designed, and the work effects between the constant speed snapping rollers and the differential speed snapping rollers were compared by using software CATIA and ADAMS, {{and found that the}} rolling speed of inner snapping roller is 500 r/min, and the outer snapping roller is 460 r/min are the best transmission rate. Finally, a physical experiment was conducted to certificate the simulation effect. In or-der to avoid some disadvantages of field experiment and soil bin experiment in laboratory, half laboratory and half field environment were used in this physical experiment. As a result, the physical experiment confirmed that the analyses above and the simulation by ADAMS were valid. In conclusion, it is an effective method to reduce grain breakage and grain loss by using differential speed snapping rollers for horizontal roller <b>corn</b> <b>harvester...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceUse a very {{important}} tool called ICEM CFD integrated in ANSYS Workbench to mesh the model of toss device and then apply the software FLUENT to simulate numerically and analyze the velocity distribution and pressure distribution, based on the RNG k-epsilon model. Numerical simulation results showed that air flow field and pressure distribution of toss device were asymmetry. Maximum wind speed of fan exit was 42. 8 m/s, which met the actual needs. In a word, the design of toss device was reasonable. But there was {{the existence of the}} secondary flow in toss cylinder, making some gas couldn’t flow smoothly, thus affecting delivery efficiency. Through analysis of the stress field in the blower, the results showed that static pressure of windward side blade increased from roots to ends and flow channels between fan blades in different positions showed different static pressure characteristics. The maximum static pressure of windward side blade was 878 pa, the minimum static pressure of lee side blade just passing the export of fan was - 950 pa, the negative pressure meaning suction. The conclusions provided a reference for structural optimization and performance improvement of the toss device of Yellow <b>Corn</b> Forage <b>Harvester...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The main {{function}} of <b>corn</b> <b>harvester</b> frame is to bear loads from working parts, such as engine, cab, transmission, chopped header, husking machine. In this paper, {{three kinds of}} typical working conditions of <b>corn</b> <b>harvester,</b> namely, driving on uneven road at relatively high speed, braking and unloading, were researched. Then the most dangerous working condition was determined and used as a foundation to analyze {{the reliability of the}} frame. Based on reliability analysis results, it could be confirmed whether the structures of frame needed to be optimized. If needed, the sensitivity analysis results were applied as a support to optimize the structure parameters of frame. Based on above methods, the cross sections ’ parameters of longitudinal beams and cross beams were optimized to satisfy the requirement of the frame mechanical properties. As a result, the weight of the frame decreased by 19. 6 %, which achieved the purpose of lightweight. It is concluded that this method is effective to reduce costs and improve efficiency in manufacturing processes. Furthermore, the method may be beneficial to improve the manufacturing level of harvesting machinery...|$|E
40|$|The {{blocking}} {{between two}} snapping rollers will seriously constrict the harvesting efficiency for <b>corn</b> <b>harvester.</b> A variable screw pitch rib snapping roller {{was developed to}} solve this problem. The comparative experiment between fixed screw pitch rib snapping rollers and variable screw pitch rib snapping rollers illustrated that variable screw pitch ribs can avoid corn-stalk blocking effectively, and it can improve working efficiency by 56. 7 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A <b>corn</b> silage <b>harvester</b> using a shredding/crushing {{mechanism}} was designed, fabricated, {{and tested}} during two harvesting {{seasons with the}} objective of improving the feed value of corn silage. Two pairs of toothed rolls turning at different speeds shredded whole-plant corn. Corn stalks were shredded, kernels were broken, and cobs were crushed. Average specific energy required to shred whole-plant corn ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 9 kWh/Mg DM. Average specific energy for an added flail cutter/blower ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 7 kWh/Mg DM for a total harvester specific energy requirement of 4. 5 to 10. 6 kWh/Mg DM. Average specific energy requirements for shredding varied significantly among different roll speed treatments at a unit roll force of 15 N/mm (front and rear), but no significant effect of roll speed configuration was found at other unit roll forces. Packed density was lower for shredded silage than for chopped silage, but shredded and chopped samples both ensiled well with pH values of 3. 8 to 4. 1 after fermentation. Particle size distributions of shredded and flail-cut samples were similar at moisture levels of 60 % and 65 % w. b.; however, the 70 % moisture crop was coarser. Shredding produced fewer small particles ( 9 mm) than chopping, while shredded and flail-cut samples had more small particles and more large particles than chopped samples...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{invention}} of a combine <b>harvester,</b> <b>corn</b> was picked on the ear and threshed later. This led to an availability of corn cobs and many uses were found. A renewed interest in the heat/energy value of the cob has increased the focus on harvesting corn cobs. A corn cob separation system was developed and installed on a single pass biomass harvesting combine. The system included a blower and two fans and the combine was capable of harvesting grain only, grain and stover, and grain and cobs. The cob separation system was evaluated using a stationary test with earcorn and stover bales with minimal field testing to validate the lab tests. The stationary tests evaluated 5 different separation zone configurations, 2 blower speeds, and 2 fan speeds. Cob purity averaged 71 % and the collection efficiency averaged 84 % with fan power consumption of 20 and 36 kW and blower power consumption of 3. 1 and 5. 3 kW. Field tests showed cob purity averages of 84 % while the collection efficiency averaged 76 %...|$|R
40|$|Existing <b>corn</b> <b>harvester</b> cutting blades have {{problems}} associated with large cutting resistance, high energy consumption, and poor cut quality. Using bionics principles, a bionic blade was designed by extracting the cutting tooth profile curve of the B. horsfieldi palate. Using a double-blade cutting device testing system, a single stalk cutting performance contrast test for corn stalks obtained at harvest time was carried out. Results show that bionic blades have superior performance, demonstrated by strong cutting ability and good cut quality. Using statistical analysis of two groups of cutting test data, the average cutting force and cutting energy of bionic blades and ordinary blades were obtained as 480. 24 [*]N and 551. 31 [*]N and 3. 91 [*]J and 4. 38 [*]J, respectively. Average maximum cutting force and cutting energy consumption for the bionic blade were reduced by 12. 89 % and 10. 73 %, respectively. Variance analysis showed that both blade types {{had a significant effect}} on maximum cutting energy and cutting energy required to cut a corn stalk.

40|$|Cm vistas a estudar o efeito do sistema de debulhamento na qualidade dos grãos de milho, realizou-se o presente trabalho, onde foram estudados os danos mecânicos sofridos pelos grãos, bem como os danos mecânicos invisíveis, evidenciados pelos testes de germinação. Nos diversos tratamentos estudados, determinou-se a porcentagem de umidade presente nos grãos de milho. Definiu-se a velocidade periférica do debulhador, pelo diâmetro (300 mm) do mesmo e as rotações, para os diversos tratamentos. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi de blocos ao acaso com 5 tratamentos e 6 repetições onde foram estudados os valores percentuais de grãos inteiros e quebrados, os teores de umidade correspondentes e os valores de germinação através da análise de variância. Empregou-se o teste F aos níveis de 1 % e 5 % de probabilidade e o teste Tukey para comparação entre as médias. da análise pode-se concluir que em relação ao teor de umidade dos grãos, os tratamentos não diferiram estatisticamente. This work {{deals with}} {{the effect of the}} shelling system of a <b>corn</b> <b>harvester</b> on the quality of corn kernels. The mechanical damage, both visible and invisible were evaluated, the last one using germination tests. The moisture content of the kernels for each treatment was determined. The peripheral velocity of the shelling cylinder was defined considering the diameter (300 mm) and the angular velocity for the various treatments. The statistical design used was randomized blocks with 5 treatments and 6 repetitions to study the percentage values of whole and broken kernels, the correspondent moisture content and germination values. The F test at 1 % and 5 % probability level and Tukey's test were used for comparison between means. From the analysis it is possible to conclude that the effect of moisture content was not statistically significant with an average moisture content of 15, 78 %. The comparions between means showed that there are highly significant differences for the peripheral velocity of the shelling cylinder on the percentage of whole kernels, it could be assumed that there was an inverse relation between those two parameters for the conditions tested. The germination test which was used to characterize invisible damage showed significant differences for some of the treatments. The results indicated an inverse relation between peripheral velocity of the shelling cylinder and the percentage of germination of the whole kernels. Some influence of the material flow through the shelling system was detected suggesting further studies of this phenomenon if these harvesters are to be used to harvest corn seed...|$|E
