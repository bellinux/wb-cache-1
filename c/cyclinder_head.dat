40|$|An EGR {{system for}} {{turbocharged}} (and aftercooled) heavy-duty diesel engines {{have been demonstrated}} on a 12 litre 315 kW engine with 4 valves per <b>cyclinder</b> <b>head</b> and high pressure injection system. In the EGR system exhaust gas is tapped of before the turbine, run through a cooler and mixed with the intake air after the compressor and aftercooler. This is done {{with a minimum of}} disturbance to the pressure balance across the engine by combining a very efficient venturi-mixer unit with a VGT turbocharger. The venturi-mixer is positioned between the aftercooler and the intake manifold and provides a suction power to the EGR gas. Optimization of EGR quantity and injection timing reduced the NOx emission over the European 13 -mode test by almost 60 % to 2. 4 g/kWh. Particulate emissions were 0. 107 g/kWh and the BSFC penalty 2, 5 %. Initial tests demonstrate acceptable transient behaviour when using a dedicated control strategy. The expected EURO 4 emission requirements are 3 g/kWh NOx and 0. 10 g/kWh particulates (approximate time of implementation is 2004) ...|$|E
