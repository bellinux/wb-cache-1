40|$|AbstractDespite the {{relevance}} of corruption in project selection, planning and delivery, the project management literature pays little attention to this crucial phenomenon. This paper sets the background to foster the discussion concerning how to select, plan and deliver infrastructure in corrupt project contexts. It presents {{the different types of}} corruptions and the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> that are more likely to suffer from it. Corruption is particularly relevant for large and uncommon projects where the public sector acts as client/owner or even as the main contractor. Megaprojects are “large unique projects” where public actors play a key role and are very likely to be affected by corruption. Corruption worsens both cost and time performance, and the benefits delivered. This paper leverages the institutional theory to introduce the concept of “corrupt project context” and, using the case study of the Italian high-speed railways, shows the impact of a corrupt context on megaprojects...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{new product}} {{development}} (NPD) and innovation processes encompass {{a range of}} activities that contribute to find opportunities for new products and more efficient ways to produce them. In this sense, new {{ways of looking at}} the process of product development may be associated to dynamic capabilities, understood as a set of attributes that enable organizations to reconfigure its businesses and set of competences, reducing production and transactions costs and gaining new market opportunities, including distinctive competencies in the use of balanced exploration and exploitation. So, this study departs from the literature review on the dynamic capabilities and the concepts on exploration and exploitation. It aims to understand the contribution of these approaches in the development and maintenance of skills in the search for survival and competitiveness of enterprises in a changing environment.

It analyses the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> generating a greater or smaller number of jobs. The paper finds a substantial concentration of investment in {{a relatively small number}} of projects, but that the jobs are much less so. At the project level, the characteristics that are important for determining the number of jobs are the project activity and type (i. e. start-up, acquisition, joint venture or re-investment), but other factors have no influence. However, in aggregate, the paper finds that there is a substantial concentration of jobs by the country of origin, the location and by the manufacturing activity. It also finds that the national inward investment agencies tend to concentrate their efforts on certain kinds of project. It concludes by questioning the optimality of this concentration of inward investment for regional development and employment. Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E

To answer this question, I use real-life investment data collected at the largest German market for peer-to-peer lending. Investors' utility {{is assumed to be}} a function of the projects expected return and its standard deviation, whereas standard deviation serves as a measure of risk. Gender differences regarding the responses to projects' risk are tested by estimating a random parameter regression model that allows for variation of risk preferences across investors. Estimation results provide no evidence of gender differences in investors' risk propensity: On average, male and female investors respond similarly to the changes in the standard deviation of expected return. Moreover, no differences between male and female investors are found with respect to other <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> that may serve as a proxy for projects' risk. Significant gender differences in investors' tastes are found only with respect to preferred investment duration, purpose of investment project and borrowers' age. gender, investment choice, risk preferences...|$|E

Knowledge about how users will react and what their attitudes will be when tolls are implemented is still scant in the literature. In this paper we study elasticities of travel demand and users attitudes towards tolls in 19 Norwegian road projects. We collected survey data before and after tolls were implemented or removed and supplemented them with data from traffic counts and other sources. We find a mean short-run elasticity at - 0. 45 and a mean long-run elasticity at - 0. 82. Further, elasticities seem to vary with the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects,</b> e. g. road type, project location, etc. Users' attitudes towards tolls as a means of financing infrastructure are generally negative. Negative attitudes are highly correlated with the level of information supplied to users on the intentions with tolls prior to implementation. Finally, we have combined elasticities and attitudes in a taxonomy that can guide decision making and we offer suggestions on how attitudes may be improved. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry plays {{a very important}} role in the Portuguese economy. In 2009, it was among the top five economic sectors, representing 13 % of total employment. Nevertheless, project failures are still frequent mainly due to inadequate management practices and to the intrinsic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> of the {{construction industry}}. Even though Portuguese construction has improved in recent years, cost and schedule overruns, low productivity and final product quality problems are still common. In this context, project management is a crucial tool for improving construction operations and for the overall success of projects.

40|$|International audienceAbout a {{third of}} {{development}} projects fail to achieve satisfactory outcomes, according to agencies’ independent evaluation units. To a large extent, these outcomes appear to be baked into projects at their inception due to inadequate project design or relevance. This prompts questions about the diffusion of project design concepts: To what extent are better-designed or better-performing projects {{more likely to be}} emulated? Do factors of bureaucratic or political attractiveness—such as ease of set-up and rapidity of disbursement—play a role? To address these questions, this paper explores the use ofmethods from network science. It constructs a network graph of the relationship among the components of all World Bank investment projects initiated from 1996 to 2014, based on the semantic similarity of the component descriptions. It uses the network to assess the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> that are more ‘prolific’ in the sense of having closely related followers, and as tool for visualizing diffusion of design concepts. This illustrative exercise defines a measures of project ‘influence’ on subsequent projects and tests simple, nonexclusive hypotheses about the determinants of influence. It finds nosignificant impact of project outcome or quality of entry (as independently rated) on ‘influence. ’ Nor does ease of project preparation (as proxied by time from concept note to effectiveness) have any significant effect. However, very small projects (less than $ 10 million) have markedly lower ‘influence’on average. This finding may have implications for the usefulness of small projects as pilots for subsequent scale up...|$|E
40|$|Companies {{participating}} in the Dutch voluntary agreements on energy efficiency are required to announce the energy-saving projects that they have planned for a specified reporting period in an Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP). All projects with a payback period less than 5 years should be implemented. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide insight into the differences in planning and implementation of energy efficiency investments by companies. This analysis is based on the EEPs submitted in the period 2009 - 2012. By comparing the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> that have been implemented with those that were planned, insight is gained in the adjustments that companies make in their energy efficiency investment plans. We look at external circumstances that could explain these adjustments. Our results show that over 12, 000 projects have been planned by the 904 long-term agreement (LTA) participants, about half of which are planned 'certain', which means that companies are certain that these projects will be implemented. However, we find a large difference between the planned and realised savings of companies and a huge variation in the payback period of both planned and implemented projects. We do not find a correlation between implementation rate and payback period. This suggests that the payback period in the EEPs was not assessed properly or that other than economic motives are more decisive for investment decisions. Our results can be used to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of voluntary agreements...|$|E
