5|$|Players control {{one of two}} diamond trading companies: the eponymous Diamond Trust of London or {{an unnamed}} Antwerp-based competitor. The game is set in 2000 and {{the aim is to}} extract {{diamonds}} from Angola before the Kimberley Process <b>Certification</b> <b>Scheme</b> is put in place. The winner is the one who finishes the game with the most diamonds after nine turns. Each turn, players decide where to send their three agents. They can be sent to six different Angolan regions to extract diamonds, or recalled to the player's headquarters to deposit extracted diamonds. Players make decisions in secret, and both sets of decisions are resolved on the game board simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBioenergy is {{receiving}} increasing attention {{because it may}} reduce greenhouse gas emissions, secure and diversify energy supplies and stimulate rural development. The environmental sustainability of bioenergy production systems is often determined through life-cycle assessments that focus on global environmental effects, such as the emission of greenhouse gases or air pollutants. Local/regional environmental impacts, e. g., the impacts on soil or on biodiversity, require site-specific and flexible options {{for the assessment of}} environmental sustainability, such as the criteria and indicators used in bioenergy <b>certification</b> <b>schemes.</b> In this study, we compared <b>certification</b> <b>schemes</b> and assessed the indicator quality through the environmental impact categories, using a standardized rating scale to evaluate the indicators. Current <b>certification</b> <b>schemes</b> have limitations in their representation of the environmental systems affected by feedstock production. For example, these schemes predominantly use feasible causal indicators, instead of more reliable but less feasible effect indicators. Furthermore, the comprehensiveness of the depicted environmental systems and the causal links between human land use activities and biophysical processes in these systems have been assessed. Bioenergy <b>certification</b> <b>schemes</b> seem to demonstrate compliance with underlying legislation, such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive, rather than ensure environmental sustainability. Beyond, <b>certification</b> <b>schemes</b> often lack a methodology or thresholds for sustainable biomass use. Lacking thresholds, imprecise causal links and incomplete indicator sets may hamper comparisons of the environmental performances of different feedstocks. To enhance existing <b>certification</b> <b>schemes,</b> we propose combining the strengths of several <b>certification</b> <b>schemes</b> with research-based indicators, to increase the reliability of environmental assessments...|$|R

25|$|Region-wide {{accreditation}} {{has also}} been planned for vocational skills. Currently local training agencies award National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) or national Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) certification, which are not valid across Member States. However, in 2003, the Caribbean Association of National Agencies (CANTA) was formed as an umbrella organization of the various local training agencies including Trinidad and Tobago's National Training Agency, the Barbados TVET Council and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States TVET agency and the HEART Trust/NTA of Jamaica. Since 2005, the member organizations of CANTA have been working together to ensure a uniformed level of certified skilled labour under the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) and CANTA itself has established a regional <b>certification</b> <b>scheme</b> that awards the Caribbean Vocational Qualification (CVQ), which is to replace NVQs and national TVET certifications. The CVQ will be school-based and although based on the <b>certification</b> <b>scheme</b> of CANTA, will be awarded by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) which will be collaborating with CANTA on the CVQ programme. At the February 9–10, 2007 meeting of the Regional Coordinating Mechanism for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, officials discussed arrangements for the award of the CVQ which {{was approved by the}} Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) in October 2006. It was expected that the CVQ programme may be in place by mid-2007, if all the requirements are met and that provisions were being made for the holders of current NVQs to have them converted into the regionally accepted type (although no clear mandate is yet in place). This deadline was met and in October 2007, the CVQ programme was officially launched. The CVQ now facilitates the movement of artisans and other skilled persons in the CSME. This qualification will be accessible to persons already in the workforce as well as students in secondary schools across the Caribbean region. Those already in the work force will be required to attend designated centres for assessment.|$|E
