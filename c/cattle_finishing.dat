25|$|The {{survival}} of Alberta's cattle industry was seriously in doubt {{for most of}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At two points during this time, 1887–1900 and 1914–20, the industry enjoyed great prosperity. The latter boom began when the United States enacted the Underwood Tariff of 1913, allowing Canadian cattle free entry. Exporting Alberta cattle to Chicago markets proved highly profitable for the highest quality livestock. By 1915, most stocker and feeder cattle from the Winnipeg stockyards were exported to the United States, harming Canada's domestic beef market. Several factors, including the severe winter of 1919-20, the end of inflated wartime prices for beef, and the reinstitution of the US tariff on Canadian cattle, all contributed to the collapse of the Alberta cattle market. The boom ultimately worked against Alberta's economic interests because the high prices during that period made it unfeasible to establish local <b>cattle</b> <b>finishing</b> practices.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a trend toward feeding high-grain or low {{roughage}} level finishing rations to beef cattle. Such feeding programs minimize the nutritive contributions of roughage in the ration and place emphasis on the non-nutritive factors. The increased size of many feedlots coupled with the need for mechanization has brought about a demand for roughage substitutes. Undigested feeds contained in the rumen at time of slaughter present a tremendous disposal problem for packing plants or for sewage treatment plants. The disposal of these materials also poses pollution problems. In many instances paunch material is washed into the community sewage system or simply piled and allowed to decompose. If left piled on the ground, paunch materials pollute the area and may contaminate local water supplies and, by their very presence, take up valuable space. If burned, air pollution can result. It may not be economical to use these products as a fertilizer because transportation costs may be prohibitive or they may further limit crop production or they may enter into some natural water supplies. A solution to these problems may be the use of paunch material in animal feeds. Because of their unique digestive system, ruminant animals offer a means of disposing of as well as utilizing such fibrous feedstuffs. Since paunch feed may be odorous and not readily acceptable by cattle, and since only small amounts of roughage are needed in beef <b>cattle</b> <b>finishing</b> rations, it seemed logical to utilize paunch feed as a roughage source in beef <b>cattle</b> <b>finishing</b> rations. Dried paunch feed has a coarse texture, with hay and other fibrous materials up to several centimeters in length being evident. Thus it appears that paunch feed would incorporate into mechanical feedlot operations quite well. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine: 1. The acceptability of low levels of paunch feed in beef <b>cattle</b> <b>finishing</b> rations, 2. Roughage characteristics of paunch feed in beef <b>cattle</b> <b>finishing</b> rations, 3. Performance (gains, feed consumption, and efficiency of feed utilization) of beef cattle fed paunch feed compared to hay, 4. The economic value of paunch feed compared to hay, and 5.

A total of 20 animals of the Tabapuã breed and 20 animals of the Nellore breed were confined for 112 days: 28 days of adaptation and 84 days of data collection. Performance was determined by the average daily weight gain (ADG) and average dry matter intake (DMI) estimated through the use of indicators. On the 1 st, 42 nd and 84 th days of the experiment, two methods were used to measure the animal reactivity: animal reactivity in mobile cage and visual reactivity during handling. The characteristics of meat quality were evaluated by the color, shear force and pH 24 after slaughter (pH 24). Through the study of correlation, the degree and direction of linear association on animal reactivity, performance and meat quality were established. Regression equations were generated for the parameters evaluated according to the values of animal reactivity. Correlations between mobile cage and visual reactivity were 0. 77, 0. 56 and 0. 45 in the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd evaluations, respectively. There was no correlation between animal reactivity and DMI. The correlations between ADG, pH 24, and color with animal reactivity were - 0. 31, 0. 40, 0. 47 and - 0. 34, and - 0. 33 for mobile cage, 0. 74, 0. 71 and - 0. 51, for visual reactivity, respectively.
