5|$|Bondi Junction had {{originally}} been intended only as an intermediate turnback station before the extension to Kingsford was abandoned. As part of the Rail <b>Clearways</b> Program, the $77 million Bondi Junction Turnback project saw a new rail crossover was built between the single-track tunnels, enabling 20 trains an hour, up from 14, to use the station. The work was completed {{in time for the}} introduction of a new timetable on 28 May 2006.|$|E
25|$|A new {{timetable}} {{released in}} October 2013 broke the loop {{between the two}} lines. As part of the Rail <b>Clearways</b> Program, new turnbacks were constructed at Lidcombe and Homebush to allow the separation of both lines and increase their reliability and frequency. Services were also changed to operate mostly around the City Circle via Town Hall on weekdays (rather than via Museum). As part of the timetable change, a new numbering system was also introduced and the line was given the number T3. A sextuplication project between Erskinevile and Sydenham was also proposed {{as part of the}} Rail <b>Clearways</b> Program, but was cancelled in 2011. It was intended to separate Bankstown line services from those operating towards East Hills. The 2013 timetable see most East Hills line trains using the Airport line to access the city.|$|E

Despite this, Brands Hatch holds race meetings on almost every weekend during the motorsport season, ranging from small club series to major international races attracting up to 50,000 spectators.|$|E

25|$|Carlingford {{railway station}} is the {{terminus}} of the Carlingford Line on the Sydney Trains network. The Carlingford Line, which opened on 20 April 1896 {{as a private}} railway, then as a public line on 1 August 1901, is a mostly single-track line. There is currently only one service {{in the early morning}} which connects to the city directly, at other times a train-change at Clyde, is necessary to reach other stations, and consequently the service has a low patronage, though it is quite popular during peak hours. As part of the CityRail <b>Clearways</b> Project, a passing loop was promised to the Carlingford Line with two services per hour all day to become effective in 2010. This was however scrapped in the 2008 mini-budget.|$|E
25|$|The full Grand Prix Circuit {{begins on}} the Brabham Straight, an off-camber, {{slightly}} curved stretch, before plunging into the right-hander at Paddock Hill Bend. Despite {{the difficulty of}} the curve, due to the straight that precedes it, {{it is one of the}} track's few overtaking spots. The next corner, Druids, is a hairpin bend, negotiated after an uphill braking zone at Hailwood Hill. The track then curves around the south bank spectator area into the downhill, off-camber Graham Hill Bend, and another, slightly bent stretch at the Cooper Straight, which runs parallel to the pit lane. After the straight, the circuit climbs uphill though the decreasing-radius Surtees turn, before moving onto the back straight where the track's top speeds can be reached. The most significant elevation changes on the circuit occur here at Pilgrim's Drop and Hawthorn Hill, which leads into Hawthorn Bend. The track then loops around the woodland with a series of mid-speed corners, most notably the dip at Westfield and Dingle Dell and the blind Sheene curve. From there the track then emerges from the left hand and cambered Stirlings Bend onto the short straight to <b>Clearways</b> and rejoins the Indy Circuit for Clark Curve with its uphill off-camber approach to the pit straight and the start/finish line.|$|E

50|$|In aviation, <b>clearway</b> {{is a term}} {{related to}} the {{dimension}} of some runways and it is abbreviated with CWY. <b>Clearway</b> is an area beyond the paved runway, free of obstructions and {{under the control of}} the airport authorities. The length of the <b>clearway</b> may be included in the length of the takeoff distance available. For example, if a paved runway is 2000 m long and there are 400 m of <b>clearway</b> beyond the end of the runway, the takeoff distance available is 2400 m long. When the runway is to be used for takeoff of a large airplane, the maximum permissible takeoff weight of the airplane can be based on the takeoff distance available, including <b>clearway.</b> <b>Clearway</b> allows large airplanes to take off at a heavier weight than would be allowed if only the length of the paved runway is taken into account.|$|R

2500|$|In January 1960 Kent County Council gave {{planning}} permission for {{the extension of}} Brands Hatch – an extension which would double {{the length of the}} track offering a choice of long or short circuits. The new 2.65-mile track used, all of this existing one with the extension of Kidney Bend; South Bank became a long, uphill 160° sweep out into the country and making the approach to <b>Clearways</b> very much faster. From South Bank there followed a long straight dipping {{into and out of the}} next valley to the right-hand Hawthorn Bend followed by Portobello Straight to Westfield Bend leading to the dip to Dingle Dell, Dingle Dell Corner and the difficult left-hand Stirling's Bend. A short straight then brought the circuit back to <b>Clearways</b> at much higher speed than hitherto.

2500|$|Finding no top drivers {{available}} despite coming {{close to}} bringing Rindt {{back to the}} team, Brabham decided to race for one more year. He began auspiciously, winning the first race of the season, the South African Grand Prix, and then led the third race, the Monaco Grand Prix until the very last {{turn of the last}} lap. Brabham was about to hold off the onrushing Rindt (the eventual 1970 F1 champion) when his front wheels locked in a skid on the sharp right turn only yards from the finish and he ended up second. While leading at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch, he ran out of fuel at <b>Clearways</b> and Rindt passed him to take the win while Brabham coasted to the finish in second place. After the 13th and final race of the season, the Mexican Grand Prix, Brabham did retire. He had tied Jackie Stewart for fifth in the points standings in the season he drove at the age of 44. Brabham also drove for the works Matra team during the 1970 World Sportscar Championship season and won the final race of the season and his final top level race at the Paris 1000km in October that year. He then made a complete break from racing and returned to Australia, to the relief of his wife who had been [...] "scared stiff" [...] each time he drove.|$|E
