Two different <b>cooling</b> <b>modes,</b> rapid and natural cooling, were employed for the crystallization process.

2500|$|Cooling towers {{are also}} used in HVAC systems that have {{multiple}} water source heat pumps that share a common piping water loop. In this type of system, the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the <b>cooling</b> <b>mode,</b> then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the atmosphere. [...] By contrast, when the heat pumps are working in heating mode, the condensers draw heat {{out of the loop}} water and reject it into the space to be heated. [...] When the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building, the cooling tower is normally shut down (and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage), and heat is supplied by other means, usually from separate boilers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{heat pump}} is a {{refrigeration}} based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the {{indoor and outdoor}} coils. [...] This is done by energizing a reversing valve (also known as a [...] "4-way" [...] or [...] "change-over" [...] valve). [...] During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat {{is removed from the}} outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil. [...] The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool. [...] Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an [...] "O" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a [...] "B" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating. [...] The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building. [...] A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point. [...] Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place. [...] This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity. [...] Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil. [...] This is done by reversing the cycle to the <b>cooling</b> <b>mode,</b> shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements. [...] The electric heat in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building. [...] The elements are then used in the [...] "reheat" [...] function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail. [...] This function is normally activated by an [...] "E" [...] terminal on the thermostat. [...] When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the total Coefficient of Performance (CoP) of a thermoelectric module in combined heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>modes,</b> obtained through experiments and thermodynamics mathematical model. Thermoelectric module {{is a solid}} state heat pump which has a capability to pump heat with the capacity of 100 W or lower. One of the module surface will acts as a heat sink while another surface of the module rejects heat. This provides an opportunity to utilize both surfaces for cooling and heating applications. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} total CoP of the thermoelectric module when it was operated in a combination of heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>modes.</b> The total CoP was inferred by fitting the temperature of cold and hot water streams which were obtained from experiments to a mathematical model of the thermoelectric heating and cooling system. The highest temperature difference between hot and cold streams was 40 Kelvin. The worst root-mean-square error between the measured and calculated temperature was 2 Kelvin, except for the hot stream temperature curve in the Condition 1 (RMS error was 3. 5 Kelvin).   It was proved that the total CoP of 4. 5 was achievable for thermoelectric module operated in the combined heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>modes.</b> However, the total CoP decreased as the temperature difference between hot and cold streams was increased. It can be concluded that the use of thermoelectric module in heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>modes</b> can improve its CoP which contribute to saving in electrical consumption by the module...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe energy {{impact of}} {{different}} post-combustion CO 2 capture plants integrated in an advanced air-blown IGCC is simulated in this paper. Ammonia scrubbing is considered as the CO 2 capture technology and chilled and <b>cooled</b> <b>modes</b> are investigated {{with reference to}} operation temperatures at the absorber equal to 7 °C and 20 °C respectively.

50|$|Direct {{exchange}} {{heat pumps}} are closed-loop geothermal systems which rely on small copper pipes (¼” to 1-1/8”) to exchange heat with the earth.

50|$|VRFs {{come in two}} system formats, two {{pipe and}} three pipe systems. In a heat pump 2 pipe system all of the zones must either be all in cooling or all in heating. Heat Recovery (HR) systems {{have the ability to}} {{simultaneously}} heat certain zones while cooling others; this is usually done through a three pipe design, with the exception of Mitsubishi and Carrier who are able to do this with a 2 pipe system using a BC controller to the individual indoor evaporator zones. In this case the heat extracted from zones requiring cooling is put to use in the zones requiring heating. This is made possible because the heating unit is functioning as a condenser, providing sub-cooled liquid back into the line that is being used for cooling. While the heat recovery system has a greater initial cost, it allows for better zoned thermal control of a building and overall greater efficiencies.In heat recovery VRF systems some of indoor units are in <b>cooling</b> <b>mode</b> and some others are in heating mode that it leads to energy consumption saving. if the coefficient of performance in <b>cooling</b> <b>mode</b> of a system be 3 and the coefficient of performance in heating mode be 4 then heat recovery performance can reach to more than 7.

50|$|Control of the system's fan {{capacity}} {{is critical in}} VAV systems. Without proper and rapid flow rate control, the system's ductwork, or its sealing, can easily be damaged by overpressurization. In the <b>cooling</b> <b>mode</b> of operation, as {{the temperature in the}} space is satisfied, a VAV box closes to limit the flow of cool air into the space. As the temperature increases in the space, the box opens to bring the temperature back down. The fan maintains a constant static pressure in the discharge duct regardless of the position of the VAV box. Therefore, as the boxes closes, the fan slows down or restricts the amount of air going into the supply duct. As the boxes open, the fan speeds up and allows more air flow into the duct, maintaining a constant static pressure.|$|E

The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent gradient in 46 °C (115 °F) weather.
