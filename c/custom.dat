A number of examples were also found in Carmarthenshire, with a single example found in both Brecknockshire and Ceredigion. There is a single record of the <b>custom</b> being performed in North Wales, in an example from Wrexham, which Cawte believed was the result of a Glamorgan man bringing the <b>custom</b> with him as he moved north. Previously, Peate had cautioned that the comparative absence of recorded examples from Mid and North Wales was not proof that the Mari Lwyd <b>custom</b> had never been present in those areas.|$|E

This paper outlines the progression of key reform and modernization initiatives in these countries since the early 1990 s, and assesses the gap between these reforms and those of more modern <b>Customs</b> agencies. The review suggests that <b>Customs</b> administration reform and modernization initiatives in Anglophone African countries generally lag behind international good practice and {{it is necessary to}} speed up implementation if revenue, trade facilitation, and trade chain security objectives are to be achieved. The findings also have implications on the design of reform programs and focus of potential technical assistance for the outstanding reform agenda. <b>Customs</b> administration;Revenue mobilization;Statistics;Tax collection;Tax reforms;Trade;customs, <b>customs</b> administrations, import duties, trade facilitation, international trade, <b>customs</b> tariff, <b>customs</b> processes, <b>customs</b> union, supply chain, tariff structure, regional trade, trade arrangements, import duty, tariff rate, <b>customs</b> revenue, tariff reform, <b>customs</b> operations, regional trade arrangements, tariff rates, <b>customs</b> staff, <b>customs</b> valuation, <b>customs</b> organization, economic community, <b>customs</b> duty, <b>customs</b> administration automation, trading blocs, rules of origin, <b>customs</b> clearance, <b>customs</b> modernization, <b>customs</b> agencies, <b>customs</b> legislation, free trade, trade taxes, <b>customs</b> duties, dispute resolution, external tariff, <b>customs</b> administration modernization, country of export, <b>customs</b> data, common external tariff, world trade organization, <b>customs</b> efficiency, trade areas, domestic taxes, <b>customs</b> management system, trade patterns, <b>customs</b> integrity, <b>customs</b> declarations, average tariff, global competitiveness, <b>customs</b> statistics, economic cooperation, free trade areas, global trade, tariff classification, reforming <b>customs,</b> world trade, import tax, <b>customs</b> modernization handbook, transactions costs, <b>customs</b> union issues, multilateral trade, domestic production, border trade, trading arrangement, <b>customs</b> reforms, international trade policy, <b>customs</b> reform, sales taxes, <b>customs</b> business, regional <b>customs,</b> <b>customs</b> tariffs, <b>customs</b> release, applied tariff, <b>customs</b> procedures, import tariff, harmonization of <b>customs</b> procedures, external trade policy, trade changes, lowering trade, <b>customs</b> standards, nontariff barriers, multilateral trade arrangements, import sources, <b>customs</b> unions, <b>customs</b> exemptions, <b>customs</b> officials, reduction in tariffs, trade policy review, internal taxes, trade negotiations, <b>customs</b> fraud, <b>customs</b> strategy, import value, international <b>customs</b> standards, <b>customs</b> revenues, preferential tariff treatment, <b>customs</b> offices, trade area, increased trade, common market, <b>customs</b> practices, preferential tariff, <b>customs</b> territory, <b>customs</b> applications, <b>customs</b> officers, average tariff rates, regional integration, rent-seeking behavior, <b>customs</b> organizations, free trade area, import preferences, external trade, trade policies, international standards, value-added tax, <b>customs</b> value, <b>customs</b> information, <b>customs</b> brokers, global supply, bilateral trade, tariff reductions, trade flows, <b>customs</b> cooperation, regulatory framework, international trading, trade costs...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of tariff {{policies}} on evasion of <b>customs</b> duties, {{in the context of the}} trade reform in India of the 1990 s. We exploit the variation in tariff rates across time and products to identify the evasion elasticity, namely, {{the effect of}} tariffs on evasion, and relate this elasticity to factors related to <b>customs</b> enforcement or the quality of <b>customs</b> institutions. We find a positive and robust effect of tariffs on import tax evasion. We then show that the evasion elasticity is influenced by certain product characteristics that determine how easy it is to detect evasion (with more differentiated products exhibiting a higher evasion elasticity). This evasion elasticity, which we broadly interpret as reflecting the quality of <b>customs</b> administration, has not improved over the 1990 s. Finally, our results suggest that the effectiveness of <b>customs</b> in addressing evasion may be better in India than China, although China appears to be catching up over time.
