5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid <b>conditions,</b> most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other <b>conditions</b> {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated <b>conditions</b> include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid <b>conditions.</b> Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid <b>conditions</b> that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid <b>conditions</b> and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E

5|$|As {{the planet}} is not known to transit from Earth and {{atmospheric}} <b>conditions</b> are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the planet has been confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Conditions</b> {{in camps}} varied {{considerably}} geographically and over time. <b>Conditions</b> were particularly {{poor in the}} summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient to accommodate the large number of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, <b>conditions</b> generally improved. From 1943, however, as the war on the Eastern Front turned against Germany, <b>conditions</b> worsened and the food supply became more precarious. Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E

50|$|A {{decision}} <b>condition</b> {{is constructed}} with a <b>condition</b> stub and a <b>condition</b> entry. A <b>condition</b> stub is declared as {{a statement of}} a <b>condition.</b> A <b>condition</b> entry provides a value assigned to the <b>condition</b> stub. Similarly, an action (or decision) composes two elements: an action stub and an action entry. One states an action with an action stub. An action entry specifies whether (or in what order) the action is to be performed.|$|R
30|$|As in Corollary 6, in Theorem 2 {{we can use}} <b>condition</b> (16) {{to replace}} <b>condition</b> (15), and in Theorem 3, we use <b>condition</b> (15) to replace <b>condition</b> (16).|$|R
5|$|For burnt bone, {{testability}} {{depends on}} the <b>conditions</b> under which the bone was burnt. If the bone was heated under reducing <b>conditions,</b> it (and associated organic matter) may have been carbonized. In this case the sample is often usable.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{used for}} chariot warfare {{were not only}} trained for combat <b>conditions,</b> but because many chariots were pulled {{by a team of}} two to four horses, they also had to learn to work {{together}} with other animals in close quarters under chaotic <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Bermuda, the outflow {{from the}} storm {{produced}} cloudy <b>conditions</b> throughout the island. Squally <b>conditions</b> were reported a short distance {{to the west of}} the island, though no rain was reported on Bermuda.|$|E
30|$|In Theorems 3.18 and 3.19 we {{can replace}} the {{requirement}} of <b>condition</b> (G) or <b>condition</b> (G') with that of <b>condition</b> (K). But as in Examples 3.8 and 3.9, there exist functions α and T such that T is α-identical and T satisfies <b>condition</b> (G) and <b>condition</b> (G') but does not satisfy <b>condition</b> (K). Hence our approach is new and justifiable.|$|R
3000|$|The {{above-mentioned}} Hypothesis  4 is {{the so-called}} non-Lipschitz <b>condition.</b> The non-Lipschitz <b>condition</b> {{has a variety of}} forms [31 – 34]. Here, we consider one kind of them. In particular, we see clearly that if we let κ([...] q) = K'q, then the non-Lipschitz <b>condition</b> reduces to the Lipschitz <b>condition.</b> In other words, the non-Lipschitz <b>condition</b> is weaker than the Lipschitz <b>condition.</b>|$|R
30|$|Remark 3.3. It {{is clear}} that <b>condition</b> (C 1)' is {{strictly}} weaker than <b>condition</b> (C 1). In the meantime, <b>condition</b> (C 5)' is also strictly weaker than <b>condition</b> (C 5).|$|R

5|$|Most sights {{have either}} active or passive {{adjustments}} for the reticle brightness, which help the shooter adapt to different lighting <b>conditions.</b> A very dim reticle will help prevent loss of night vision in low-light <b>conditions,</b> while a brighter reticle will display more clearly in full sunlight.|$|E

50|$|As {{technology}} has advanced, Facility <b>Condition</b> Assessment Modeling {{has become more}} recognized in the <b>condition</b> assessment industry. In 2007, Graphic Systems, Inc., following research they had performed for the United States Federal Government, published a white paper on <b>Condition</b> Indices and Strategic Planning, demonstrating the value that strategic <b>condition</b> assessment modeling and the theoretical <b>condition</b> index can offer to traditional visual <b>condition</b> assessment programs.|$|R
5|$|Singapore's LTA {{together}} with IBM, ran a pilot from December 2006 to April 2007, with a traffic estimation and prediction tool (TrEPS), which uses historical traffic data and real-time feeds with flow <b>conditions</b> from several sources, {{in order to}} predict the levels of congestion {{up to an hour}} in advance. By accurately estimating prevailing and emerging traffic <b>conditions,</b> this technology is expected to allow variable pricing, {{together with}} improved overall traffic management, including the provision of information in advance to alert drivers about <b>conditions</b> ahead, and the prices being charged at that moment.|$|E

5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and <b>conditions</b> of her detention rendered the detention unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or <b>conditions</b> of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman <b>conditions</b> must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the <b>conditions</b> of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.|$|E
