5|$|On 1 March 2012, Blackpool manager Ian Holloway {{confirmed}} that Fowler was training with the Seasiders {{and that he}} could earn a deal {{until the end of the}} season. However, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> a deal and Fowler decided against signing when Karl Oyston offered the striker just £100 a week with £5,000 for every first-team appearance.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 2012, {{a divided}} Supreme Court {{held that the}} Stolen Valor Act's {{prohibition}} against making false statements of having been awarded a military medal violated the First Amendment. However, the six justices in the majority <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on a single rationale for the decision.|$|E
5|$|Since Minnesota had divided governments {{for decades}} before 2010, {{a number of}} past budgets had brought the state close to a {{shutdown}}, {{and there had been}} one shutdown before in state history. After Governor Pawlenty and the Republican-majority House <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on a budget with the DFL-majority Senate in 2005, the state government went through a nine-day shutdown.|$|E

5|$|The Turkish Grand Prix {{was removed}} from the {{calendar}} after Formula One Management and the event organisers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on a renewed contract. In August 2011, organisers of the race revealed that they were negotiating with Bernie Ecclestone to resume their place on the calendar. However, the race {{was removed from}} the calendar later that month.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part because the two <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{interest}} in the battlecruiser project, the two sides <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on terms. The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country be guaranteed, with financial compensation {{to be paid to}} German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release a complete set of plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve any deal, did not convene during the summer of 1939.|$|E

5|$|According to Islamic belief Muhammad is {{credited}} with setting the Black Stone in the current place in {{the wall of the}} Kaaba. A story found in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah Rasul Allah tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.|$|E
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Como died in {{his sleep}} on May 12, 2001, {{at his home in}} Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida, six days before his 89th birthday. He was {{reported}} to have suffered from symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Como's older son, Ronnie, and his daughter, Terri, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on their interpretations of Como's 1999 living will and it became a matter for the courts in the year before his death. His funeral Mass took place at St. Edward's Catholic Church in Palm Beach, Florida. Como and his wife, Roselle are buried at Riverside Memorial Park, Tequesta (Palm Beach County), Florida.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, Zardari relented, and the {{coalition}} agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf's impeachment by drafting a charge-sheet against him. The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law. He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and {{the coalition}} selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned {{in order to avoid}} impeachment. Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on a decision. The coalition also could not reach a united stance {{on the future of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|In the 1992–93 tournament, Derby County {{lost the}} final 3–1 to Cremonese. Brescia won the final in 1994 against Notts County, but Notts County reached the final again in 1995 and {{defeated}} Ascoli 2–1. The last instalment {{of the competition}} was held in 1995–96, and Genoa triumphed 5–2 over Port Vale in the final on 17 March 1996. The competition was abandoned in 1996 because the two leagues <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on dates for fixtures, and due to increasing violence at matches.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{broke into}} the NHL in 1989, playing for the St. Louis Blues. In the {{off-season}} following the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils. Shanahan was a restricted free agent, and thus the Devils were entitled to compensation. The teams <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on what the compensation was; the Blues offered Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, while the Devils wanted Scott Stevens. Joseph {{seemed to be the}} answer the Devils were looking for in goal, however the case went to arbitration, and a judge ruled that Stevens was to be awarded to the Devils in September 1991.|$|E

5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on the location of the terminal station. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was playing}} semi-professional {{baseball}} in Clarinda, Iowa when in June 1976 {{he was selected}} in the seventh round of the amateur entry draft by the Detroit Tigers. The parties <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on a contract; Smith wanted a $10,000 ($ today) signing bonus, while the Tigers offered $8,500 ($ today). Smith returned to Cal Poly for his senior year, then in the 1977 draft was selected in the fourth round by the San Diego Padres, ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 signing bonus ($ today). Smith spent his first year of professional baseball during 1977 with the Class A Walla Walla Padres of the Northwest League.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{received}} Royal Assent on 13 August 1888 with Hanley listed {{among those}} places {{to be granted}} county borough status. The corporation of Hanley vacillated for several months as to how best to proceed, then in February 1889 opted for Hanley to take its county borough status, effectively killing both the county proposal and the county borough proposal. Why Hanley corporation made such a decision is not recorded, but it {{was reported in the}} Staffordshire Sentinel of 5 February 1901 that it was because Stoke Corporation insisted that the administrative centre of the new county be in Stoke, not Hanley, and this was something that Hanley <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> too.|$|E

5|$|A ten-man tag team {{match was}} {{supposed}} to take place next, but it was canceled due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on who would be the team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly ("Sparky Plugg"), stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Dougan succeeded Terry Neill – {{his future}} Northern Ireland manager – as {{chairman}} of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1970. He advocated the belief that players should control their own destiny and used his position as Chairman of the PFA to further players' rights. He oversaw the inaugural PFA awards in 1973–74, which included the PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Team of the Year, and PFA Merit Award. He pushed for freedom of contract for players, and in 1978 accepted a compromise deal that allowed players to switch clubs {{at the end of their}} contracts, providing that the player's new club and old club could agree on a transfer fee, with a tribunal agreeing on a fee in cases where clubs <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b>|$|E
