5|$|A global {{strategy}} {{to stem the}} crisis was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian <b>Conservation</b> Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian <b>conservation.</b> Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ <b>conservation</b> recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and <b>Conservation</b> Project that built on existing <b>conservation</b> efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E

It maintains a database of rare and endangered species in botanical gardens' living collections. Many gardens hold ex situ <b>conservation</b> collections that preserve genetic variation. These may be held as: seeds dried and stored at low temperature, or in tissue culture (such as the Kew Millennium Seedbank); as living plants, including those that are of special horticultural, historical or scientific interest (such as those held by the NCCPG in the United Kingdom); or by managing and preserving areas of natural vegetation. Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats. The Center for Plant <b>Conservation</b> at St Louis, Missouri coordinates the <b>conservation</b> of native North American species.|$|E

Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity <b>Conservation</b> Act 1999 and Queensland's Nature <b>Conservation</b> Act 1992. The Convention on Migratory Species works for the <b>conservation</b> of loggerhead sea turtles on the Atlantic coast of Africa, {{as well as in}} the Indian Ocean and southeast Asia. Throughout Japan, the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the <b>conservation</b> of loggerhead sea turtles. Greece's ARCHELON works for their <b>conservation.</b> The Marine Research Foundation works for loggerhead <b>conservation</b> in Oman. Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol of the Cartagena Convention, which deals with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems, also protects them. <b>Conservation</b> organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) to exclude even the largest turtles.
