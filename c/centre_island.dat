2500|$|It {{was clear}} that a {{lighthouse}} was needed in Foveaux Strait, but there were long discussions in the 1860s where to place it. Captains with local experience were asked for their opinion, and they suggested possible sites on <b>Centre</b> <b>Island,</b> Ruapuke Island, Stewart Island, Solander Islands, and Dog Island. The latter was chosen as Southland's first site for a lighthouse; the recommendation was made the by the Invercargill Harbour Master to James Alexander Robertson Menzies, the first Superintendent of the Southland Province. The Harbour Master's rationale was that the island was dangerous, as [...] "it is very low and not seen till close upon it". At the time, the Southland Province had just split from Otago Province, and both provincial governments were involved. There was confusion over who would take ownership of the situation, and in the end, the central government assumed responsibility {{for the construction of}} all lighthouses throughout the colony.|$|E
