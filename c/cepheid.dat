5|$|Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began {{a series}} of studies of {{globular}} clusters, published in about 40 scientific papers. He examined the RR Lyrae variables in the clusters (which he assumed were <b>Cepheid</b> variables) and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was found that RR Lyrae variables are fainter than <b>Cepheid</b> variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{using the}} <b>Cepheid</b> {{variable}} method, the distance {{was estimated to}} be 2.51 ± 0.13 million light-years (770 ± 40 kpc).|$|E
5|$|Located near Alpha is R Muscae, a Classical <b>Cepheid</b> {{variable}} {{ranging from}} apparent magnitude 5.93 to 6.73 over 7.5days. It is a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F7Ib and G2Ib, located around 2037light-years away. S Muscae is likewise a Classical <b>Cepheid,</b> a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F6Ib and G0Ib and magnitudes 5.89 to 6.49 {{over a period}} of 9.66days. A luminous star around 5.9times as massive as the Sun, it is a binary star with a blue-white main sequence star companion likely to be of spectral type B3V to B5V with a mass of just over 5solar masses, one of the hottest and brightest companions of a <b>Cepheid</b> known. The two stars orbit each other every 505days.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 20th century, {{significant}} {{problems with the}} astronomical distance scale were resolved by dividing the <b>Cepheids</b> into different classes with very different properties. In the 1940s, Walter Baade recognized two separate populations of <b>Cepheids</b> (classical and type II). Classical <b>Cepheids</b> are younger and more massive population I stars, whereas type II <b>Cepheids</b> are older fainter Population II stars. Classical <b>Cepheids</b> and type II <b>Cepheids</b> follow different period-luminosity relationships. The luminosity of type II <b>Cepheids</b> is, on average, less than classical <b>Cepheids</b> by about 1.5 magnitudes (but still brighter than RR Lyrae stars). Baade's seminal discovery led to a fourfold increase in the distance to M31, and the extragalactic distance scale. RR Lyrae stars, then known as Cluster Variables, were recognized fairly early as being a separate class of variable, {{due in part to}} their short periods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. By {{correlating}} the Fernie et al. (1995) electronic database on <b>Cepheids</b> {{with the}} variable catalog " of the hipparcos mission and the simbad catalog one nds {{that there are}} 280 <b>Cepheids</b> in the hipparcos catalog. By remov-ing W Vir stars (Type ii <b>Cepheids),</b> double-mode <b>Cepheids,</b> <b>Cepheids</b> with an unreliable solution in the hipparcos catalog, and stars without photometry, {{it turns out that}} there are 248 classical <b>Cepheids</b> left, of which 32 are classied as rst-overtone pulsators. For these stars the literature was searched for I-band and near-infrared data. Intensity-mean I-band photometry on the Cousins system is derived for 189 stars, and intensity-mean JHK data on the Carter system is presented for 69 stars...|$|R
40|$|Context: <b>Cepheids</b> are {{excellent}} tracers of young stellar populations. They {{play a crucial}} role in astrophysics as standard candles. The chemistry of classical <b>Cepheids</b> in the Milky Way is now quite well-known. Despite a much larger sample, the chemical composition of Magellanic <b>Cepheids</b> has been only scarcely investigated. Aims: For the first time, we study the chemical composition of several <b>Cepheids</b> located in the same populous cluster: NGC 1866, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). To also investigate the chemical composition of <b>Cepheids</b> at lower metallicity, four targets are located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample allows us to increase the number of <b>Cepheids</b> with known metallicities in the LMC/SMC by 20...|$|R
5|$|The {{estimated}} {{distance of}} the Andromeda Galaxy from our own was doubled in 1953 when {{it was discovered that}} there is another, dimmer type of <b>Cepheid.</b> In the 1990s, measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the Hipparcos satellite measurements were used to calibrate the <b>Cepheid</b> distances.|$|E
5|$|Triangulum Australe {{contains}} several <b>cepheid</b> variables, all {{of which}} are too faint to be seen with the naked eye: R Trianguli Australis ranges from apparent magnitude 6.4 to 6.9 over a period of 3.389 days, S Trianguli Australis varies from magnitude 6.1 to 6.8 over 6.323 days, and U Trianguli Australis' brightness changes from 7.5 to 8.3 over 2.568 days. All three are yellow-white giants of spectral type F7Ib/II, F8II, and F8Ib/II respectively. RT Trianguli Australis is an unusual <b>cepheid</b> variable which shows strong absorption bands in molecular fragments of C2, ⫶CH and ⋅CN, and has been classified as a carbon <b>cepheid</b> of spectral type R. It varies between magnitudes 9.2 and 9.97 over 1.95 days. Lying nearby Gamma, X Trianguli Australis is a variable carbon star with an average magnitude of 5.63. It has two periods of around 385 and 455 days, and is of spectral type C5, 5(Nb).|$|E
5|$|During their stellar evolution, some stars {{pass through}} phases {{where they can}} become {{pulsating}} variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, {{depending on the size}} of the star. This category includes <b>Cepheid</b> and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period variables such as Mira.|$|E
40|$|We present here {{a nearly}} {{complete}} census of classical <b>Cepheids</b> in the Magellanic System. The sample extends {{the set of}} <b>Cepheids</b> published in the past by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to the outer regions of the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The entire collection consists of 9535 <b>Cepheids</b> of which 4620 belong to the LMC and 4915 {{are members of the}} SMC. We provide the I- and V-band time-series photometry of the published <b>Cepheids,</b> their finding charts, and basic observational parameters. Based on this unique OGLE sample of <b>Cepheids</b> we present updated period [...] luminosity relations for fundamental, first, and second mode of pulsations in the I- and V-bands and for the W_I extinction-free Wesenheit index. We also show the distribution of classical <b>Cepheids</b> in the Magellanic System. The OGLE collection contains several classical <b>Cepheids</b> in the Magellanic Bridge - the region of interaction between the Magellanic Clouds. The discovery of classical <b>Cepheids</b> and their estimated ages confirm the presence of young stellar population between these galaxies. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The seventh {{part of the}} OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars (OIII-CVS) {{consists}} of 4630 classical <b>Cepheids</b> in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The sample includes 2626 fundamental-mode (F), 1644 first-overtone (1 O), 83 second-overtone (2 O), 59 double-mode F/ 1 O, 215 double-mode 1 O/ 2 O, and three triple-mode classical <b>Cepheids.</b> For each object basic parameters, multi-epoch VI photometry collected within 8 or 13 years of observations, and finding charts are provided in the OGLE Internet archive. We present objects of particular interest: exceptionally numerous sample of single-mode second-overtone pulsators, five double <b>Cepheids,</b> two <b>Cepheids</b> with eclipsing variations superimposed on the pulsation light curves. At least 139 first-overtone <b>Cepheids</b> exhibit low-amplitude secondary variations with periods in the range 0. 60 - 0. 65 of the primary ones. These stars populate three distinct sequences in the Petersen diagram. The origin of this secondary modulation is still unknown. Contrary to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we found only a few candidates for anomalous <b>Cepheids</b> in the SMC. This fact may be a clue for the explanation {{of the origin of}} the anomalous <b>Cepheids.</b> The period and luminosity distributions of <b>Cepheids</b> in both Magellanic Clouds suggest that there are two or three populations of classical <b>Cepheids</b> in each of the galaxies. The main difference between the LMC and SMC lays in different numbers of <b>Cepheids</b> in each group. We fit the period-luminosity (PL) relations of SMC <b>Cepheids</b> and compare them with the LMC PL laws. Comment: 23 pages, 11 (color) figure...|$|R
40|$|We present <b>Cepheids</b> {{located in}} the close {{neighborhood}} of star clusters from the Magellanic Clouds. 204 and 132 such stars {{were found in the}} LMC and SMC, respectively. The lists of objects were constructed based on catalogs of <b>Cepheids</b> and star clusters, recently published by the OGLE-II collaboration. Location of selected <b>Cepheids</b> on the sky indicates that many of them are very likely cluster members. Photometric data of <b>Cepheids</b> and clusters are available from the OGLE archive. ...|$|R
5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to <b>Cepheid</b> variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of <b>Cepheid</b> variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, the {{prevailing}} view still {{was that the}} Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified <b>Cepheid</b> variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and <b>cepheid</b> variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} sample of 93 double-mode <b>Cepheids</b> {{detected}} in the 2. 4 square degree area in {{the central part of}} the SMC. 23 stars from the sample pulsate in the fundamental mode and the first overtone while 70 objects are the first and second overtone pulsators. This is the largest sample of such type <b>Cepheids</b> detected in one environment so far. We analyze period ratio of double-mode <b>Cepheids,</b> Fourier parameters of decomposition of the light curves of these objects and also ${V-I}$ color distribution of <b>Cepheids</b> in the observed fields. We also find one object which is probably a blend, either physical or optical, of two <b>Cepheids</b> pulsating in the fundamental mode...|$|R
40|$|We present 741 new {{photometric}} observations for 22 <b>Cepheids</b> with periods between 3 and 8 days. Many of {{the stars}} are probable type II <b>Cepheids,</b> but we have included some type I <b>Cepheids</b> for comparison. The shapes and stability of {{the shapes of the}} light curves, the stability of the periods, and the scatter of individual data points are discussed. Although none of these proves to be a reliable discriminator between type I and type II <b>Cepheids,</b> they do permit the identification of several unusual stars...|$|R
50|$|Type II <b>Cepheids</b> (also termed Population II <b>Cepheids)</b> are {{population}} II {{variable stars}} which pulsate with periods typically between 1 and 50 days. Type II <b>Cepheids</b> are typically metal-poor, old (~10 Gyr), low mass objects (~half {{the mass of}} the Sun). Type II <b>Cepheids</b> are divided into several subgroups by period. Stars with periods between 1 and 4 days are of the BL Her subclass, 10-20 days belong to the W Virginis subclass, and stars with periods greater than 20 days belong to the RV Tauri subclass.|$|R
5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of <b>Cepheid</b> variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars. At {{the time it was}} a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed <b>Cepheid</b> variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed <b>Cepheid</b> stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{her death}} four years prior, the Swedish {{mathematician}} Gösta Mittag-Leffler considered nominating her for the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, and wrote to Shapley requesting more information on her work on <b>Cepheid</b> variables, offering to send her his monograph on Sofia Kovalevskaya. Shapley replied, letting Mittag-Leffler know that Leavitt had died, and suggesting that the true credit belonged to his (Shapley's) interpretation of her findings. She was never nominated, because the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{attempt to}} revise the period-amplitude (P-A) {{relationship}} of Galactic <b>Cepheids</b> based on multi-colour photometric and radial velocity data. Reliable P-A graphs for Galactic <b>Cepheids</b> constructed for the U, B, V, R_C, and I_C photometric bands and pulsational radial velocity variations facilitate investigations of previously poorly studied interrelations between observable amplitudes. The effects of both binarity and metallicity on the observed amplitude, and the dichotomy between short- and long-period <b>Cepheids</b> can both be studied. Results: Large amplitude <b>Cepheids</b> with companions exhibit smaller photometric amplitudes on average than solitary ones, as expected, while s-Cepheids pulsate with an rbitrary (although small) amplitude. The ratio of the observed radial velocity to blue photometric amplitudes, A_V_RAD/A_B, {{is not as good}} an indicator of the ulsation mode as predicted theoretically. This may be caused by an incorrect mode assignment to a number of small amplitude <b>Cepheids,</b> which are not ecessarily first overtone pulsators. The dependence of the pulsation amplitudes on wavelength is used to identify duplicity of <b>Cepheids.</b> More than twenty stars previously classified as solitary <b>Cepheids</b> are now suspected to have a companion. The ratio of photometric amplitudes observed in various bands confirms the existence of a dichotomy among normal amplitude <b>Cepheids.</b> The limiting period separating short- and long-period <b>Cepheids</b> is 10. 47 days. Conclusions: Interdependences of pulsational amplitudes, the period dependence of the amplitude parameters, and the dichotomy have {{to be taken into account}} as constraints in modelling the structure and pulsation of <b>Cepheids.</b> Studies of the P-L relationship must comply with the break at 10. 47 instead of the currently used `convenient' value of 10 days.

40|$|Twenty-one <b>Cepheids,</b> {{known or}} {{suspected}} to have blue companions, were studied with the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite. For 13 of them, companions were indeed seen, {{though they were}} generally fainter in the UV than expected. For four Population I <b>Cepheids,</b> the suspected companions were not seen. For none of the Population II <b>Cepheids</b> could a companion be detected. The effective temperatures and luminosities of the companions which could be observed are discussed, and the positions of <b>Cepheids</b> and companions in the T(eff) luminosity diagrams are compared with positions expected from stellar evolution calculations...|$|R
50|$|These {{stars are}} {{somewhat}} similar to <b>Cepheids,</b> {{but are not}} as luminous and have shorter periods. They are older than type I <b>Cepheids,</b> belonging to Population II, but of lower mass than type II <b>Cepheids.</b> Due to their common occurrence in globular clusters, they are occasionally referred to as cluster <b>Cepheids.</b> They also have a well established period-luminosity relationship, and so are also useful as distance indicators. These A-type stars vary by about 0.2-2 magnitudes (20% to over 500% change in luminosity) {{over a period of}} several hours to a day or more.|$|R
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as <b>Cepheid</b> variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|AK Pyxidis is a {{red giant}} of {{spectral}} type M5III and semi-regular variable that varies between magnitudes 6.09 and 6.51. Its pulsations take place over multiple periods simultaneously of 55.5, 57.9, 86.7, 162.9 and 232.6 days. UZ Pyxidis is another semi-regular variable red giant, this time a carbon star, that is around 3560 times as luminous as the Sun with a surface temperature of 3482 K, located some 2116 light-years away from Earth. It varies between magnitudes 6.99 and 7.83 over 159 days. VY Pyxidis is a BL Herculis variable (type II <b>Cepheid),</b> ranging between apparent magnitudes 7.13 and 7.40 {{over a period of}} 1.24 days. Located around 650 light-years distant, it shines with a luminosity approximately 45 times that of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination {{that supported the}} theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some <b>Cepheid</b> variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E

Using the relationship between the period ratio and the main pulsation period, we are able to define a range of models which correspond to the observed beat <b>Cepheids,</b> and thereby constrain the physical characteristics of the LMC beat <b>Cepheids.</b> We are also able to make some predictions about the nature of the yet-to-be-discovered SMC beat <b>Cepheids.</b> Subject headings: Cepheids: observations – galaxies: distances – 3...|$|R

5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of <b>Cepheid</b> variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|Many of the constellation's {{brighter}} {{stars are}} members of the Scorpius–Centaurus Association, a loose group of hot blue-white stars that appear to share a common origin and motion across the Milky Way.
