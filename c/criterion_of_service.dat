The leadership criterion especially emphasizes continuous improvement towards creating and promoting {{a culture of}} patient safety environment [2]. The Quality Healthcare Accreditation (QHA), a certification institution of England, considers safety of patients, employees and people as a top priority.

40|$|TH E growing {{international}} interest in local self-government has received considerable attention. A 1969 {{resolution of the}} Council of Europe [1, 53] has called {{for the inclusion of}} the right to local self-government in the constitution of states. Many European countries have already recognised this right formally [2, 328] and others are considering methods for the devolution of power to areas with a defined national or regional consciousness. Discussions in the United Kingdom on greater autonomy for Scotland, Wales, etc. are a case in point. It would seem that much of the stimulus for this development arises from the increasing awareness of the many problems associated with access and service which are concomitant in the ever increasing role in planning and economic development universally being played by the State. Access is said to be good whenever an individual feels he can participate in public affairs through his ability to contact and influence elected representatives and officials. Service implies not only the economic discharge of public functions but also the alignment of these functions as closely as possible with public needs and decisions. Good government requires that both these fundamental values of a political community be given due recognition. However, this poses a difficulty in that the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> wil...|$|E
40|$|Model of {{priority}} service of aerodrome operations is analyzed. The {{assumption of the}} legality of replacing the ran- dom variable queue length at its most probable value is used. The model is characterized in that the take-off and landing are described not by means of only safety priorities, but by technical and flight characteristics as well. Evaluations of the ser- vice waiting time of service and the probability of failure (or re-service) were obtained. ICAO experts have put forward the concept of "System Wide Information Management" and "Collaborative Air Traffic Management", which require for their introduction of new instruments operational management decision making for air traffic services. It should provide participants with the joint organization of new software for rapid analysis of computer results. One of the possible directions of such support is discussed in this article. Analysis of the two priority model shows that the efficiency {{of priority}} service is reduced {{in the case of}} a large spread of values of average request processing time. As a result of the loss probability for both types of requests become comparable or even approximately equal. Experiment with the five priority flows confirms the order of request losses in accordance with an increase of flow index, identified by formulas for an arbitrary number of input streams. The tendency of the values for the partial converging efficiency <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> can only be observed in non-real case where the values of the average service time varies several hundred times. Moreover, this effect can easily be compensated by a slight increase in volume of storage buffer. It becomes obvious that the best conditions for the maintenance of the flow of requests are provided {{in the case of a}}pproxi- mate equality of the average processing times; that is, when all the coefficients of the sequence tend to a single value. The obtained formulas have a sufficient degree of generality and can be used to analyze the priority system in a wide range of data acquisition and processing tasks...|$|E

40|$|Trust and {{reputation}} mechanisms {{are often used}} in peer-to-peer networks, multi-agent systems and online communities for trust-based interactions among the users. Trust values are used to differentiate {{among members of the}} community as well as to recommend service providers. Although different users have different needs and expectations in different aspects <b>of</b> the <b>service</b> providers, traditional trust-based models do not use trust values on neighbors for judging different aspects <b>of</b> <b>service</b> providers. In this thesis, I use multi-faceted trust models for users connected in a network who are looking for suitable service providers according to their preferences. Each user has two sets of trust values: i) trust in different aspects of the quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> providers, ii) trust in recommendations provided for these aspects. These trust models are used in a decentralized user modeling system where agents (representing users) have different preference weights in different <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> providers. My approach helps agents by recommending the best possible service provider for each agent according to its preferences. The approach is evaluated by conducting simulation on both small and large social networks. The results of the experiments illustrate that agents find better matches or more suitable service providers for themselves using my trust-based recommender system without the help of any central server. To {{the best of my knowledge}} this is the first system that uses multi-faceted trust values both in the qualities of service-providers and in other users’ ability to evaluate these qualities <b>of</b> <b>service</b> providers in a decentralized user modeling system...|$|R
