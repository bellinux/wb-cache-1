40|$|The {{application}} of molecular techniques to {{the characterization of}} <b>caliciviruses</b> has resulted in an extensive database of sequence information. This information {{has led to the}} identi®cation of 4 distinct genera. The human enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> have been assigned to 2 of these genera. This division is re¯ected not only in sequence diversity but in a fundamental difference in genome organization. Complete genome sequences are now available for 5 enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> and demonstrate that human and animal enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> are phylogenetically closely related. Currently, there is no cell culture system for the human viruses; therefore, studies have relied on heterologous expression and in vitro systems. These studies have shown that in both human and animal viruses the viral nonstructural proteins are produced from a polyprotein precursor that is cleaved by a single viral protease. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide an overview of the current knowledge of genome structure and gene expression in the enteric <b>caliciviruses.</b> <b>Caliciviruses</b> have a positive polarity, single-stranded RNA genome of » 7. 5 kb that is polyadenylated at its 30 terminus [1].

25|$|Feral cats, as {{with all}} cats, are {{susceptible}} to diseases and infections including rabies, bartonellosis, toxoplasmosis, plague, parasites, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), rickettsial diseases, and feline respiratory disease complex (FRDC, a group of respiratory illnesses including feline herpesvirus type 1, feline <b>calicivirus,</b> Chlamydia felis, and Mycoplasma felis).|$|E
25|$|Domestic cats also {{transmit}} diseases to the wildcat, including feline <b>calicivirus,</b> feline coronavirus, feline foamy virus, and {{the fatal}} feline leukemia virus.

40|$|Food-borne {{diseases}} {{are a major}} cause of morbidity and hospitalization worldwide. Enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> are capable of persisting in the environment and in the tissues of shellfish. Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) have been implicated in outbreaks linked to shellfish consumption. The genetic and antigenic relatedness between human and animal enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> suggests that interspecies transmission may occur. To determine the occurrence of human and animal enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> in United States market oysters, we surveyed regional markets. Oysters were collected from 45 bays along the United States coast during the summer and winter of 2002 and 2003. Samples were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR, and results were confirmed by hybridization and sequence analysis. Nine samples (20 %) were positive for HuNoV genogroup II after hybridization. Animal enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> were detected in 10 samples (22 %). Seven of these samples were positive for porcine norovirus genogroup II, and one sample was positive for porcine sapovirus after hybridization and confirmation by sequencing. Bovine noroviruses were detected in two samples, and these results were confirmed by sequencing. Five HuNoV samples sequenced in the polymerase region were similar to the norovirus genogroup II US 95 / 96 subset (genogroup II- 4) previously implicated in diarrhea outbreaks. Different seasonal and state distributions were detected. The presence of animal enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> was associated with states with high livestock production. Although the presence of human <b>caliciviruses</b> in raw oysters represents a potential risk for gastroenteritis, disease confirmation by investigation of outbreaks is required. The simultaneous detection of human and animal enteric <b>caliciviruses</b> raises concerns about human infection or coinfection with human and animal strains that could result in genomic recombination and the emergence of new strains...|$|R

40|$|Gastroenteritis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{illnesses}} of humans, and many different viruses have been causally associated with this disease. Of those enteric viruses that have been established as etiologic agents of gastroenteritis, only the human <b>caliciviruses</b> cannot be cultivated in vitro. The cloning of Norwalk virus and subsequently of other human <b>caliciviruses</b> has led to the development of several new diagnostic assays. Antigen detection enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) using polyclonal hyperimmune animal sera and antibody detection EIAs using recombinant virus-like particles have supplanted the use of human-derived reagents, but the use of these assays has been restricted to research laboratories. Reverse transcription-PCR assays for the detection of human <b>caliciviruses</b> are more widely available, and these assays have been used to identify virus in clinical specimens as well as in food, water, and other environmental samples. The application of these newer assays has significantly increased the recognition of the importance of human <b>caliciviruses</b> as causes of sporadic and outbreak-associated gastroenteritis...|$|R
25|$|Domestic kittens in {{developed}} societies are usually vaccinated against common illnesses {{from two to}} three months of age. The usual combination vaccination protects against feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), feline <b>calicivirus</b> (C), and feline panleukopenia (P). This FVRCP inoculation is usually given at eight, twelve, and sixteen weeks, and an inoculation against rabies may be given at sixteen weeks. Kittens are usually spayed or neutered at seven months of age, but kittens may be neutered as young as seven weeks (if large enough), especially in animal shelters. Such early neutering {{does not appear to have}} any long-term health risks to cats, and may even be beneficial in male cats. Kittens are commonly wormed against roundworms from about four weeks.|$|E
25|$|The European rabbit or common rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is {{a species}} of rabbit native to southwestern Europe (Spain, Portugal and Western France) and {{northwest}} Africa (Morocco and Algeria). It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases myxomatosis and rabbit <b>calicivirus,</b> as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle. It is known as an invasive species {{because it has been}} introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, {{due to the lack of}} natural predators there.|$|E
25|$|One problem plaguing the {{national}} park (as with all the Flinders) is feral goats, which are capable of traversing the rugged stony terrain, and which, thanks {{to the lack of}} predators, flourish. These introduced animals are pests due to the damage their hoofs do to the ground, and the vegetation they consume. The population in {{the national}} park has been reduced by means of hunters staking out waterholes and helicopters picking off animals on the ridge-tops: the help of the local sporting shooters' association has been employed in managing the problem. Undergrowth vegetation has improved markedly in recent years, presumably reflecting reduced numbers. Large-scale baiting programs carried out as part of Operation Bounceback have reduced the number of foxes in {{the national park}}. Rabbit numbers have declined by approximately 85% since the introduction of the rabbit <b>calicivirus.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background. Human <b>caliciviruses</b> {{represent}} a genetically and antigenically {{diverse group of}} single-stranded RNA viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans. In last two years the number of notified gastroenteric cases in Slovenia is increasing. Samples were analysed by direct electron microscopy (EM). For increased sensitivity RT-PCR assay was performed. Using molecular methods {{for the detection of}} <b>caliciviruses</b> we tried to detect causative agent in outbreaks where no viruses were found by direct EM. Methods. After onset of outbreak an epidemiologic questionnaire was performed, hygienic testing, and determination of pathogenic bacteria. Latex agglutination for determination of rota- and adenoviruses 40 / 41 were performed. Additionally ELISA test for determination of astroviruses was used. Stool samples were examined by direct electron microscopy. RNA was isolated from 15 positive samples in which small roundstructured viruses (SRSVs) were observed. RNA was amplified by RT-PCR using specific primers and the obtained products were confirmed in hybridisation test. Results. 20 children from 97 and 2 adults form 20 became ill. Symptoms included diarrhoea, vomiting and fever lasting for 1 to 3 days. None of patients sought medical help neither were hospitalized. Obtained food samples were not contaminated. From five hygienic smears coagulase positive staphylococci were isolated. All stool samples tested for pathogenic bacteria were negative, as well as for rota- and adenoviruses. Electron microscopy revealed 15 stool samples containing SRSVs. 11 of them were positive for <b>caliciviruses,</b> corresponding to genogroup II (GG II), as determined by RT-PCR and hybridisation assay. Conclusions.
