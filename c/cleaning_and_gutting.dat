5000|$|Boom! is an American reality {{television}} series that aired on Spike TV in 2005 and was hosted by Kourtney Klein. It featured {{a group of}} demolition experts using explosives to destroy objects such as trailers, houses, boats and cars. Often, the suggestions on what should be blown up were sent in by home viewers via a [...] "BOOM! Mailbag". Each episode covered obtaining the materials (such as the item to be destroyed), <b>cleaning,</b> <b>gutting,</b> <b>and</b> rigging the thing with explosives, and then making the final countdown and pushing the detonator, and watching the devastation.|$|R

This particularly relates to indoor activities such as house cleaning. We therefore investigated the associations between washing <b>and</b> vacuum <b>cleaning</b> frequency <b>and</b> the <b>gut</b> microbiota composition in a large longitudinal cohort of mothers and their children. The gut microbiota composition was determined using 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene Illumina deep sequencing. Results: We found that high vacuum cleaning frequency about twice or more a week was associated with an altered gut microbiota composition both during pregnancy and for 2 -year-old children, while there were no associations with house washing frequency. In total, six Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) showed significant False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected associations with vacuum cleaning frequency for mothers (two positive an...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cleaning</b> <b>and</b> {{disinfection}} of {{the broiler}} stable environment {{is an essential}} part of farm hygiene management. Adequate <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection is essential for prevention and control of animal diseases and zoonoses. The goal of this study was to shed light on the dynamics of microbiological and non-microbiological parameters during the successive steps of <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection and to select the most suitable sampling methods and parameters to evaluate <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection in broiler houses. The effectiveness of <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection protocols was measured in six broiler houses on two farms through visual inspection, adenosine triphosphate hygiene monitoring and microbiological analyses. Samples were taken at three time points: 1) before cleaning, 2) after <b>cleaning,</b> <b>and</b> 3) after disinfection. Before <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> after disinfection, air samples were taken in addition to agar contact plates and swab samples taken from various sampling points for enumeration of total aerobic flora, Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia coli and the detection of E. coli <b>and</b> Salmonella. After <b>cleaning,</b> air samples, swab samples, and adenosine triphosphate swabs were taken and a visual score was also assigned for each sampling point. The mean total aerobic flora determined by swab samples decreased from 7. 7 +/- 1. 4 to 5. 7 +/- 1. 2 log CFU/ 625 cm(2) after <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> to 4. 2 +/- 1. 6 log CFU/ 625 cm(2) after disinfection. Agar contact plates were used as the standard for evaluating <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection, but in this study they were found to be less suitable than swabs for enumeration. In addition to measuring total aerobic flora, Enterococcus spp. seemed to be a better hygiene indicator to evaluate <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection protocols than E. coli. All stables were Salmonella negative, but the detection of its indicator organism E. coli provided additional information for evaluating <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection protocols. Adenosine triphosphate analyses gave additional information about the hygiene level of the different sampling points...|$|R

40|$|Campylobacter is {{responsible}} for human bacterial enteritis and poultry meat is recognised as a primary source of infection. In slaughterhouses, <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection procedures are performed daily, {{and it has been}} suggested that disinfectant molecules might select for antibiotic resistant strains if shared targets or combined resistance mechanisms were involved. The aim of the study was to investigate if <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection procedures in poultry slaughterhouses select for antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli and to determine the genotypes of isolates collected after <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection. Nine sampling visits were made to four French slaughterhouses. Samples were collected from transport crates and equipment surfaces, before <b>and</b> after <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the recovered C. jejuni and C. coli isolates to six antibiotics and two disinfectants were measured. The C. jejuni isolates collected from equipment surfaces after <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection were subjected to PCR-RFLP typing. Twenty-five C. jejuni isolates and 1 C. coli were recovered from equipment surfaces after <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection during five visits to three different slaughterhouses. Those isolates did not show an increased resistance to the tested antibiotics compared to isolates collected before <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection. Only one or two genotypes were recovered after <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection during single visits to each slaughterhouse. This observation suggests that such genotypes may be particularly adapted to survive <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection stress. Understanding the survival mechanisms of Campylobacter should facilitate the implementation of better-targeted strategies and reduce the public health burden associated with Campylobacter infection...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{efficacy}} of computer-based endoscope <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection using a hospital management information system (HMIS). MethodsA total of 2, 674 gastroscopes were eligible for inclusion in this study. For the processes of disinfection management, the gastroscopes were randomly divided into 2 groups: gastroscope disinfection HMIS (GD-HMIS) group and manual group. In the GD-HMIS group, an integrated circuit card (IC card) chip was installed to monitor <b>and</b> record endoscope <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection automatically and in real time, whereas the endoscope <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection in the manual group was recorded manually. The overall disinfection progresses for both groups were recorded, and the total operational time was calculated. ResultsFor the GD-HMIS group, endoscope disinfection HMIS software was successfully developed. The time to complete a single session of <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfecting on a gastroscope was 15. 6 [*]minutes (range, 14. 3 - 17. 2 [*]minutes) for the GD-HMIS group and 21. 3 [*]minutes (range, 20. 2 - 23. 9 [*]minutes) for the manual group. Failure to record information, such as the identification number of the endoscope, occasionally occurred in the manual group, which affected the accuracy and reliability of manual recording. ConclusionsComputer-based gastroscope <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection using a hospital management information system could monitor the process of gastroscope <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection in real time and improve the accuracy and reliability, thereby ensuring the quality of gastroscope <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if lairages of pig slaughterhouses can act as a source of contamination of slaughtered pigs with Salmonella. The prevalence and variety of serotypes of Salmonella in the lairages of two pig slaughterhouses were determined, and the efficacy of the usual <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection on the presence of Salmonella was estimated. Lairages of two pig slaughterhouses were sampled three times when pigs were present. Furthermore, these lairages were sampled after the usual <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection, whereas the lairage of one slaughterhouse was sampled an additional time after improved <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection. Samples were collected by swabbing floor and wall surfaces and collecting the residing fluids on the floor throughout the lairage. Salmonella was isolated in 70 to 90 % of the samples when pigs were present. The usual <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection reduced the level of contamination with Salmonella to 25 % positive samples, whereas improved <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection reduced this level to 10 % positive samples. It is concluded that the waiting period in the lairage of at least 2 h contains a substantial risk for slaughter pigs to become infected with Salmonella, especially for pigs originating from Salmonella-free herds. The usual <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection of the lairage were not sufficient to eliminate this risk, whereas an improved procedure for <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> disinfection still was unsatisfactory...|$|R
