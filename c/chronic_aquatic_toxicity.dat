50|$|Chronic toxicity, the {{development}} of adverse effects {{as a result of}} long term exposure to a contaminant or other stressor, is an important aspect of aquatic toxicology. Adverse effects associated with chronic toxicity can be directly lethal but are more commonly sublethal, including changes in growth, reproduction, or behavior. Chronic toxicity is in contrast to acute toxicity, which occurs over a shorter period of time to higher concentrations. Various toxicity tests can be performed to assess the chronic toxicity of different contaminants, and usually last at least 10% of an organism’s lifespan.

Halogen Free Flame Retardants (HFFRs) have been suggested as alternatives and are already being marketed, although their potential impact on the environment cannot be properly assessed {{because of a lack of}} information regarding their environmental and ecotoxicological properties. The aim of this study was to determine the aquatic fate and effects of a selection of HFFRs that are currently being applied in polymers as alternatives of hazardous brominated flame retardants. To this end, we have identified the current state of knowledge on PBT properties of a selection of HFFRs and prioritized those for further research. We have developed analytical methods to determine organophosphorus HFFRs in water. Next, we quantified the aerobic biodegradation of organophosphorus HFFRs.

40|$|An {{environmental}} assessment of long-chain alcohols (LCOH) {{has recently been}} conducted under the OECD SIDS High Production Volume (HPV) Program via the Global International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) Aliphatic Alcohols Consortium. LCOH are used primarily as intermediates, as a precursor to alcohol-based surfactants and as alcohol per se {{in a wide variety}} of consumer product applications. Global production volume is approximately 1. 58 million metric tonnes. The OECD HPV assessment covers linear to slightly branched LCOH ranging from 6 to 22 alkyl carbons (C). LCOH biodegrade exceptionally rapidly in the environment (half-lives on the order of minutes); however, due to continuous use and distribution to wastewater treatment systems, partitioning properties, biodegradation of alcohol-based surfactants, and natural alcohol sources, LCOH are universally detected in wastewater effluents. An environmental risk assessment of LCOH is presented here by focusing on the most prevalent and toxic members of the linear alcohols, specifically, from C 12 - 15. The assessment includes environmental monitoring data for these chain lengths in final effluents of representative wastewater treatment plants and covers all uses of alcohol (i. e., the use of alcohol as a substance and as an intermediate for the manufacturing of alcohol-based surfactants). The 90 th percentile effluent discharge concentration of 1. 979 ?g/L (C 12 -C 15) was determined for wastewater treatment plants in 7 countries. <b>Chronic</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies with Daphnia magna demonstrated that between C 13 and C 15 LCOH solubility became a factor and that the structure–activity relationship was characterized by a toxicity maximum between C 13 and C 14.

Risk quotients based on a toxic units (TU) approach were determined for various scenarios of exposure and effects extrapolation. The global average TU ranged from 0. 048 to 0. 467 depending on the scenario employed suggesting a low risk to the environment.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of aquatic toxicity {{is an important}} component of the environmental hazard and risk {{assessment of}} all types of chemicals, and is therefore included in several pieces of EU chemicals legislation. Aquatic toxicity refers to the effects of chemicals on organisms living in the water and is usually determined by testing on organisms representing three trophic levels, i. e. plants (or algae), invertebrates (crustaceans such as Daphnia spp.) and vertebrates (fish). Whereas acute aquatic toxicity testing is a basic requirement in most pieces of EU chemicals legislation, <b>chronic</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity</b> testing may be required when the outcome of the acute testing indicates a risk, or in the case that long-term exposure is expected. EU chemicals legislation encourages the use of all available information for hazard and risk assessment before new tests on vertebrates are proposed or conducted. In this context, scientific options for avoiding chronic fish testing on the basis of existing data and extrapolation approaches have been explored. For the purposes of this work, data on acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity</b> (Daphnia and fish) from several databases (US EPA Ecotox database, Aquatic ECETOC, Aquatic OASIS, Aquatic Japan MoE databases and ECHA database as implemented in the OECD QSAR Toolbox Version 2. 3) were collated and analysed. Simple linear relationships and interspecies sensitivity ratios were calculated using either acute Daphnia data (48 h LC 50) or chronic Daphnia data (14 days NOEC) and chronic fish data (> 21 days NOEC). Acute to chronic relationships and acute to chronic ratios (ACR) were also calculated based on acute fish data (96 h LC 50) and chronic fish data. These analyses were carried out on the whole set of chemicals and on subgroups of chemicals classified according to the Verhaar mode of action (MOA) scheme, which attribute general mode of acute aquatic toxic action based on the chemical structure of the molecule. Outliers were identified applying the Robust regression and Outlier removal (ROUT) method. Our results show that the best fitted relationships for the prediction of chronic fish toxicity are obtained based on acute fish data (r 2 = 0. 87) and acute Daphnia data (r 2 = 0. 64) when dealing with the whole set of chemicals regardless of the MOA. The quality of the relationships was increased by using the geometric mean (calculated across all the values extracted for a given chemical and a given endpoint) instead of the lowest value for a given endpoint. When considering the MOA, MOA 3 and MOA 1 chemicals give the strongest acute Daphnia to chronic fish relationship and chronic Daphnia to chronic fish relationship; however the relationships obtained with acute Daphnia data are better (r 2 = 0. 83 and 0. 69 for MOA 3 and MOA 1 respectively) than the one obtained with chronic Daphnia data (r 2 = 0. 66 and 0. 65 for MOA 1 and 3 respectively). When considering acute fish data, all the MOA classes give strong relationships (r 2 = 0. 88 for MOA 3 and MOA 5 chemicals, 0. 85 for MOA 4 chemicals and 0. 83 for MOA 1 and MOA 2 chemicals). Therefore when acute toxicity data on fish are available, they might give a reliable basis to extrapolate the chronic toxicity on fish as a first tier assessment or within a weight of evidence approach. There is a correlation between chemicals with high ACR values or interspecies sensitivity ratios and the outliers identified in the above-mentioned relationships. When considering chemicals with a high interspecies sensitivity ratio, Daphnia being more sensitive than fish, several aniline derivatives and pesticides acting through cholinesterase inhibition were identified. When considering high interspecies sensitivity ratio chemicals for which Daphnia is less sensitive than fish, we found pesticides and known endocrine disruptors such as ethynil oestradiol and 17 ß-oestradiol. Extreme (i. e. 100) interspecies sensitivity ratios were mainly evident for MOA 2, 4 and 5 chemicals. Regarding ACR for fish, around 50 % of the chemicals in each MOA class have an ACR within a factor of 10; whereas 100 % of MOA 3, 90. 9 % of MOA 2, 88. 3 % of MOA 4 and 85. 5 % of MOA 1 chemicals have an ACR within a factor of 100. Therefore, the safety factor of 100 commonly applied in environmental risk assessment does not seem to be equally protective for every MOA. JRC. I. 5 -Systems Toxicolog...|$|E
40|$|Short-term whole {{effluent}} toxicity testing, {{which is}} currently a requirement of the U. S. EPA`s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), commonly uses the cladoceran species Ceriodaphnia dubia. Despite the advantages to using a common test species to model the toxic effects of effluents, {{it could be argued}} that toxicity test results would be more meaningful if a wider variety of test organisms were commonly used. One particular argument against C. dubia is that tests conducted with this species do not always reflect local, site-specific conditions. The careful selection and use of an indigenous test species would produce a more realistic model of local instream effects and would account for regional differences in water quality. Permitted effluent discharges from Savannah River Site (SRS), a government weapons facility operated by the U. S. Department of Energy, require toxicity testing with C. dubia. However, water quality in these receiving streams is markedly different (lower pH and hardness) from standard laboratory water used for the culturing and testing of C. dubia, and it has been shown that this receiving water presents varying degrees of toxicity to C. dubia. Based on these results, it is possible that toxic effects observed during an effluent study could be the result of test organism stress from the dilution water and not the effects of SRS effluents. Therefore, this study addressed the substitution of C. dubia with an indigenous cladoceran species, Daphnia ambigua for routine regulatory testing at SRS. Given the indigenous nature of this species, combined with the fact that it has been successfully cultured by other investigators, D. ambigua was ideal for consideration as a replacement for C. dubia, but further study of the overall success and sensitivity of laboratory-reared D. ambigua was required. This investigation determined that D. ambigua could be laboratory cultured with only minimal changes to established regulatory protocol and that the life-cycle characteristics of this species were conducive to traditional acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity</b> test methods. Acute toxicity tests showed that when comparing LC 50 values for C. dubia and D. ambigua, D. ambigua was less sensitive to some toxicants (sodium chloride, copper sulfate, and sodium lauryl sulfate) while more sensitive to others (chlorpyrifos). Results of chronic tests with copper sulfate and sodium chloride resulted in the same NOEC/LOEC values for both species. When exposed to unaltered SRS stream water, C. dubia demonstrated a `toxic` response for two of the three streams tested, while reproduction for D. ambigua was higher in all stream samples. Acute toxicity tests with sodium chloride in stream water, generally followed the sensitivity trend noted in tests conducted with regular laboratory water...|$|E
