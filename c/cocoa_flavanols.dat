40|$|Scope: Cocoa and (-) -epicatechin (EC), a main <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanol,</b> {{have been}} {{suggested}} to exert beneficial effects in diabetes, but the mechanism for their insulin-like effects remains unknown. In this study, the modulation of insulin signalling by EC and a cocoa phenolic extract (CPE) on hepatic HepG 2 cells was investigated by analysing key proteins of the insulin pathways, namely insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and 2, PI 3 K/AKT and 5 ′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), {{as well as the}} levels of the glucose transporter GLUT- 2 and the hepatic glucose production. Methods and results: EC and CPE enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation and total insulin receptor, IRS- 1 and IRS- 2 levels and activated the PI 3 K/AKT pathway and AMPK in HepG 2 cells. CPE also enhanced the levels of GLUT- 2. Interestingly, EC and CPE modulated the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a key protein involved in the gluconeogenesis, leading to a diminished glucose production. In addition, EC- and CPE-regulated hepatic gluconeogenesis was prevented by the blockage of AKT and AMPK. Conclusion: Our data suggest that EC and CPE strengthen the insulin signalling by activating key proteins of that pathway and regulating glucose production through AKT and AMPK modulation in HepG 2 cells. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that regenerative v. degenerative endothelial responses can be integrated in a clinical endothelial phenotype, reflecting the net result between damage from risk factors and endogenous repair capacity. We have previously shown that a <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanol</b> (CF) intervention can improve endothelial function and increase the regenerative capacity of the endothelium by mobilising circulating angiogenic cells in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether CF can lower the levels of circulating endothelial microparticles (EMP), markers of endothelial integrity, along with improvements in endothelial function. The levels of EMP in the frozen plasma samples of CAD patients were measured along with endothelial function (flow-mediated vasodilation, FMD); n 16, FMD data published previously), and these data were compared with those of young (n 12) and age-matched (n 12) healthy control subjects. The CAD patients exhibited significantly increased levels of EMP along with impaired FMD when compared with the healthy control subjects. The levels of CD 144 + and CD 31 +/ 41 - EMP were inversely correlated with FMD (r - 0 · 67, P= 0 · 01 and r - 0 · 59, P= 0 · 01, respectively). In these CAD patients, the levels of EMP were measured after they had consumed a drink containing 375 mg of CF (high-CF intervention, HiFI) or 9 mg of CF (macro- and micronutrient-matched low-CF control, LoFl) twice daily over a 30 -d period in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study. After 1 month of HiFI, the levels of CD 31 +/ 41 - and CD 144 + EMP decreased (- 25 and - 23 %, respectively), but not after LoFl. Our data show that flavanols lower the levels of EMP along with higher endothelial function, lending evidence to the novel concept that flavanols may improve endothelial integrity.

We investigated the effects of CF on surrogate markers of cardiovascular health in low risk, healthy, middle-aged individuals without history, signs or symptoms of CVD. In a 1 -month, open-label, one-armed pilot study, bi-daily ingestion of 450 mg of CF led to a time-dependent increase in endothelial function (measured as flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD)) that plateaued after 2 weeks. Subsequently, in a randomised, controlled, double-masked, parallel-group dietary intervention trial (Clinicaltrials. gov: NCT 01799005), 100 healthy, middle-aged (35 – 60 years) men and women consumed either the CF-containing drink (450 mg) or a nutrient-matched CF-free control bi-daily for 1 month. The primary end point was FMD. Secondary end points included plasma lipids and blood pressure, thus enabling the calculation of Framingham Risk Scores and pulse wave velocity. At 1 month, CF increased FMD over control by 1 · 2 % (95 % CI 1 · 0, 1 · 4 %).

40|$|Background: Cocoa {{flavanol}} intake, {{especially that}} of (−) -epicatechin, {{has been linked}} to beneficial effects on human cardiovascular function. However, cocoa also contains the methylxanthines theobromine and caffeine, which may also affect vascular function. Objective: We sought to determine whether an interaction between <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> and methylxanthines exists that influences cocoa flavanol–dependent vascular effects. Design: Test drinks that contained various amounts of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> (0 – 820 mg) and methylxanthines (0 – 220 mg), either together or individually, were consumed by healthy volunteers (n = 47) in 4 different clinical studies— 3 with a randomized, double-masked crossover design and 1 with 4 parallel crossover studies. Vascular status was assessed by measuring flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), brachial pulse wave velocity (bPWV), circulating angiogenic cells (CACs), and blood pressure before and 2 h after the ingestion of test drinks. Results: Although cocoa flavanol intake increased FMD 2 h after intake, the consumption of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> with methylxanthines resulted in a greater enhancement of FMD. Methylxanthine intake alone did not result in statistically significant changes in FMD. Cocoa flavanol ingestion alone decreased bPWV and diastolic blood pressure and increased CACs. Each of these changes was more pronounced when <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> and methylxanthines were ingested together.

A second objective was to assess the effects of select purified cocoa flavonoids, epicatechin, catechin, the procyanidin Dimer B 2 and one of its major metabolites, 3 ÃŠÂ¹-O-methyl epicatechin, on free radical-induced erythrocyte hemolysis in vitro. Peripheral blood was obtained from 8 healthy subjects before and 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after consuming a flavonoid-rich cocoa beverage that provided 0. 25 g/kg body weight (BW), 0. 375 or 0. 50 g/kg BW of <b>cocoa.</b> Plasma <b>flavanol</b> and dimer concentrations were determined for each subject.

40|$|ObjectivesOur {{goal was}} to test {{feasibility}} and efficacy of a dietary intervention based on daily intake of flavanol-containing cocoa for improving vascular function of medicated diabetic patients. BackgroundEven in fully medicated diabetic patients, overall prognosis is unfavorable due to deteriorated cardiovascular function. Based on epidemiological data, diets rich in flavanols {{are associated with a}} reduced cardiovascular risk. MethodsIn a feasibility study with 10 diabetic patients, we assessed vascular function as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, plasma levels of flavanol metabolites, and tolerability after an acute, single-dose ingestion of cocoa, containing increasing concentrations of flavanols (75, 371, and 963 mg). In a subsequent efficacy study, changes in vascular function in 41 medicated diabetic patients were assessed after a 30 -day, thrice-daily dietary intervention with either flavanol-rich <b>cocoa</b> (321 mg <b>flavanols</b> per dose) or a nutrient-matched control (25 mg flavanols per dose). Both studies were undertaken in a randomized, double-masked fashion. Primary and secondary outcome measures included changes in FMD and plasma flavanol metabolites, respectively. ResultsA single ingestion of flavanol-containing cocoa was dose-dependently associated with significant acute increases in circulating flavanols and FMD (at 2 h: from 3. 7 ± 0. 2 % to 5. 5 ± 0. 4 %, p < 0. 001). A 30 -day, thrice-daily consumption of flavanol-containing cocoa increased baseline FMD by 30 % (p < 0. 0001), while acute increases of FMD upon ingestion of flavanol-containing cocoa continued to be manifest throughout the study. Treatment was well tolerated without evidence of tachyphylaxia. Endothelium-independent responses, blood pressure, heart rate, and glycemic control were unaffected.

Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} explore links between the consumption of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols,</b> muscle microvascular blood flow and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in response to nutrition in older men. To achieve this objective leg blood flow (LBF), muscle microvascular blood volume (MBV) and MPS were measured under postabsorptive and postprandial (I. V glamin, dextrose to sustain glucose ~ 7. 5 mmol·l- 1) conditions in 20 older men. Ten of these men were studied with no cocoa flavanol intervention and a further 10 were studied with the addition of 350 mg of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> at the same time as nutrition began. Leg [femoral artery] blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound, muscle MBV by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using DefinityTM perflutren contrast agent and MPS using [1, 2 - 13 C 2] leucine tracer techniques. Our results show that although older individuals do not show an increase in LBF or MBV in response to feeding, these absent responses are apparent when <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> are given acutely with nutrition.

An acute dose of flavanols and oligomeric procyanidins from cocoa powder inhibits platelet activation and function over 6 h in humans. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate whether 28 d of supplementation with <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> and related procyanidin oligomers would modulate human platelet reactivity and primary hemostasis and reduce oxidative markers in vivo. DESIGN: Thirty-two healthy subjects were assigned to consume active (234 mg <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> and procyanidins/d) or placebo (< or = 6 mg <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> and procyanidins/d) tablets in a blinded parallel-designed study. Platelet function was determined by measuring platelet aggregation, ATP release, and expression of activation-dependent platelet antigens by using flow cytometry. Plasma was analyzed for oxidation markers and antioxidant status. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of epicatechin and catechin in the active group increased by 81 % and 28 %, respectively, during the intervention period. The active group had significantly lower P selectin expression and significantly lower ADP-induced aggregation and collagen-induced aggregation than did the placebo group. Plasma ascorbic acid concentrations were significantly higher in the active than {{in the placebo group}} (P < 0. 05), whereas plasma oxidation markers and antioxidant status did not change in either group.

Common polyphenols in the diet are <b>flavanols</b> (<b>cocoa,</b> tea, apples, broad beans), flavanones (hesperidin in citrus fruit), hydroxycinnamates (coffee, many fruits), flavonols (quercetin in onions, apples and tea) and anthocyanins (berries).

For example, flavanols decrease endothelial dysfunction, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and modulate energy metabolism. Coffee and tea both reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, through action of their constituent polyphenols. Despite extensive research, the exact mechanisms of action of polyphenols in the human body have not been decisively proven, but there is strong evidence that some targets such as nitric oxide metabolism, carbohydrate digestion, and oxidative enzymes are important for health benefits.

Finally we investigated whether the high flavanol intervention could preferentially benefit those individuals who were carriers of the E 4 version of the apolipoprotein E gene, and who were therefore at an increased risk of experiencing cognitive decline and developing Alzheimer's disease. Here we found that the flavanol intervention improved episodic memory to a greater degree in E 4 carriers compared to that observed in their E 3 counterparts.

40|$|Background – Recent {{research}} on <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> adds substance to traditional {{beliefs in the}} health benefits of chocolate. Review – In addition to generic antioxidant effects, these polyphenols can enhance endothelial nitric oxide production to influence physical and possibly mental health status through circulatory improvements. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD), a non-invasive index of endothelial function which is impaired in obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking and diabetes, increases following consumption of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols.</b> 1 We recently found that flavanol-rich cocoa supplementation for 12 wks led to sustained FMD improvement, lower blood pressure (BP) and enhanced glucose metabolism in overweight/obese but otherwise healthy non-smokers (Davison et al, unpublished). Others have shown that such benefits are dose related 1 and attainable with modest flavanol intakes from chocolate. 2, 3 This is consistent with epidemiological evidence of lower BP and reduced cardiovascular mortality in cocoa/chocolate consumers. 4, 5 Recent studies link cognitive decline to impaired cerebral vasodilatation and show that consuming flavanol-rich cocoa can increase cerebral blood flow 6. Thus enhanced endothelial function may be a common mechanism by which vasoactive nutrients improve cardiometabolic risk factors, mood and cognition. Conclusion- Further evaluation of the potential role of specific <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> in healthy ageing is warranted. Reference...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 y, {{evidence}} derived from in vitro experiments, animal models, observational studies, and clinical interventions {{have suggested that}} cacao (cocoa) flavonoids act {{through a variety of}} mechanisms to modify a number of risk factors associated with chronic conditions, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have elucidated the synthesis of flavonoids by plants, making available for research specific flavonoids and their metabolites. The body of evidence suggesting that <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> {{may play a role in}} reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease has been sufficient to generate several systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Studies are now being directed to identify the molecular pathways underlying the effect of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols,</b> and clinical trials are being planned to test their impact on disease endpoints.

40|$|Rationale: There has {{recently}} been increasing interest in the potential of flavanols, plant derived compounds found in foods such as fruit and vegetables, to ameliorate age-related cognitive decline. Research suggests that <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> improve memory and learning, possibly {{as a result of}} their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. These effects may be mediated by increased cerebral blood flow (CBF), thus stimulating neuronal function. Objectives: The present study employed arterial spin labelling (ASL) functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to explore the effect of a single acute dose of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> on regional CBF. Methods: CBF was measured pre and post consumption of low (23 mg) or high (494 mg) 330 ml equicaloric flavanol drinks matched for caffeine, theobromine, taste and appearance according to a randomised counterbalanced crossover double-blind design in eight males and ten females, aged 50 - 65 years. Changes in perfusion from pre to post consumption were calculated as a function of each drink. Results: Significant increases in regional perfusion across the brain were observed following consumption of the high flavanol drink relative to the low flavanol drink, particularly in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the central opercular cortex of the parietal lobe. Conclusions: Consumption of cocoa flavanol improves regional cerebral perfusion in older adults. This provides evidence for a possible acute mechanism by which <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> are associated with benefits for cognitive performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Dark {{chocolate}} and flavanol-rich cocoa products have attracted interest {{as an alternative}} treatment option for hypertension, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Previous meta-analyses concluded that cocoa-rich foods may reduce blood pressure. Recently, several additional trials have been conducted with conflicting results. Our study summarises current evidence {{on the effect of}} flavanol-rich cocoa products on blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive individuals. Methods We searched Medline, Cochrane and international trial registries between 1955 and 2009 for randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of cocoa as food or drink compared with placebo on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) for a minimum duration of 2 weeks. We conducted random effects meta-analysis of all studies fitting the inclusion criteria, as well as subgroup analysis by baseline blood pressure (hypertensive/normotensive). Meta-regression analysis explored the association between type of treatment, dosage, duration or baseline blood pressure and blood pressure outcome. Statistical significance was set at P Results Fifteen trial arms of 13 assessed studies met the inclusion criteria. Pooled meta-analysis of all trials revealed a significant blood pressure-reducing effect of cocoa-chocolate compared with control (mean BP change ± SE: SBP: - 3. 2 ± 1. 9 mmHg, P = 0. 001; DBP: - 2. 0 ± 1. 3 mmHg, P = 0. 003). However, subgroup meta-analysis was significant only for the hypertensive or prehypertensive subgroups (SBP: - 5. 0 ± 3. 0 mmHg; P = 0. 0009; DBP: - 2. 7 ± 2. 2 mm Hg, P = 0. 01), while BP was not significantly reduced in the normotensive subgroups (SBP: - 1. 6 ± 2. 3 mmHg, P = 0. 17; DBP: - 1. 3 ± 1. 6 mmHg, P = 0. 12). Nine trials used chocolate containing 50 % to 70 % cocoa compared with white chocolate or other cocoa-free controls, while six trials compared high- with low-flavanol <b>cocoa</b> products. Daily <b>flavanol</b> dosages ranged from 30 mg to 1000 mg in the active treatment groups, and interventions ran for 2 to 18 weeks. Meta-regression analysis found study design and type of control to be borderline significant but possibly indirect predictors for blood pressure outcome.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{absorption}} of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> {{in the small}} intestine is limited, {{and the majority of}} the flavanols reach the large intestine where they may be metabolized by resident microbiota. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the prebiotic potential of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, controlled intervention study. DESIGN: Twenty-two healthy human volunteers were randomly assigned to either a high-cocoa flavanol (HCF) group (494 mg cocoa flavanols/d) or a low-cocoa flavanol (LCF) group (23 mg cocoa flavanols/d) for 4 wk. This was followed by a 4 -wk washout period before volunteers crossed to the alternant arm. Fecal samples were recovered before and after each intervention, and bacterial numbers were measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A number of other biochemical and physiologic markers were measured. RESULTS: Compared with the consumption of the LCF drink, the daily consumption of the HCF drink for 4 wk significantly increased the bifidobacterial (P < 0. 01) and lactobacilli (P < 0. 001) populations but significantly decreased clostridia counts (P < 0. 001). These microbial changes were paralleled by significant reductions in plasma triacylglycerol (P < 0. 05) and C-reactive protein (P < 0. 05) concentrations. Furthermore, changes in C-reactive protein concentrations were linked to changes in lactobacilli counts (P < 0. 05, R(2) = - 0. 33 for the model). These in vivo changes were closely paralleled by cocoa flavanol-induced bacterial changes in mixed-batch culture experiments. CONCLUSION: This study shows, {{for the first time to}} our knowledge, that consumption of <b>cocoa</b> <b>flavanols</b> can significantly affect the growth of select gut microflora in humans, which suggests the potential prebiotic benefits associated with the dietary inclusion of flavanol-rich foods.
