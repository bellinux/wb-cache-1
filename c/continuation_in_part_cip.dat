40|$|Why do firms use <b>continuations</b> <b>in</b> the {{prosecution}} of their patents? Motivated by {{the widespread use of}} continuations by U. S. firms and the prominence of this procedure in U. S. patent policy debates, we investigate the influence of corporate and patent characteristics on the use of continuations. We employ novel data on applicants and their filings of three types of continuations [...] the continuation application (CAP), the <b>continuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> (<b>CIP),</b> and divisions [...] during 1981 - 2000 to distinguish among the motives for continuing patents. We find that CIPs are disproportionately filed by research and development-intensive firms that patent heavily, and that these continuations are more common in chemical and biological technologies. Patents issuing from CIPs cover relatively important inventions and their use appears consistent with a strategy of protecting "pioneering inventions. " In contrast, CAPs and divisions are associated with less important patents assigned to capital-intensive firms, particularly in computer and semiconductor fields, and appear to be used in defensive patenting strategies. We analyze the effects of the 1995 change in patent term, and find that the act reduced continuations overall and shifted the output of continuations toward less important patents. research and development, intellectual property rights, patents...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was a <b>continuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> of a NPS project {{relating}} to microwave wireless power transmission for micro air vehicles (MAVs). The concept of using microwaves for transferring power in free space has existed {{since the beginning}} of the 20 th century. The emphasis of this thesis is the experimental study of powering micro air vehicles via the use of using a microstrip rectenna (rectifying antenna) at 10 GHz. A microstrip rectenna was built and experiments were conducted to measure the efficiency of the rectenna elements. The conversion of radio frequency (RF) power into usable DC power was performed by a rectenna. Its function could be broken down into the following four stages: reception of radio frequency (RF) power, prerectification filtering, rectification, and post-rectification filtering. A rectenna model based on past research by NPS students was simulated, built, and tested. The analysis and findings of the rectenna model were presented, with suggested improvements highlighted.

50|$|Ildefonsus' De viris illustribus is a <b>continuation,</b> <b>in</b> {{thirteen}} <b>parts,</b> {{of a work}} of Isidore {{bearing the}} same name. The book contains no biblical quotations, but expands the biographies of famous writers to include illustrious leaders in the Church and government, including Isidore himself (though Ildefonsus appears ignorant of Braulio of Zaragoza's better biography of Isidore). Ildefonsus' edition emphasised the monastic backgrounds of Toledo's earlier bishops (adding seven biographies). Nonetheless, modern editors note his pastoral concern and emphasis on praedicatio (preaching). Ildefonsus' continuation became an important historical source concerning Toledo during the 6th and 7th centuries. Ildefonsus also prepared an anthology of Isidore's works, excluding the Epistula ad Leudefredum.|$|R
40|$|Connexin 43 (Cx 43) is a {{transmembrane protein}} that forms gap {{junction}} channels. Regulation of Cx 43 turnover is one mechanism {{to control the}} level of intercellular communication that occurs through gap junction channels. Proteasomal degradation of Cx 43 is regulated <b>in</b> <b>part</b> through <b>CIP</b> 75, a ubiquitin-like and ubiquitin-associated domain containing protein. CIP 75 interacts with endoplasmic reticulum-localized Cx 43, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments. CIP 75 also binds to free monoubiquitin and lysine 48 -linked tetraubiquitin chains in vitro and binds to ubiquitinated proteins in cellular lysates. However, analysis of Cx 43 that immunoprecipitated with CIP 75 demonstrated that the Cx 43 associated with CIP 75 was not ubiquitinated, and a mutant form of Cx 43 that lacked lysines capable of ubiquitination retained the capacity to interact with CIP 75. These results suggest that although CIP 75 can interact with ubiquitinated cellular proteins, its interaction with Cx 43 and stimulation of Cx 43 proteasomal degradation {{does not require the}} ubiquitination of Cx 43...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a <b>continuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> of a NPS project {{relating}} to wireless transmission {{of power to}} a MAV. The conversion of rf power into usable dc power is done by a rectifying antenna or rectenna. The emphasis of this thesis is an indepth study of all components of the rectenna to determine the limitations of an existing design which has low efficiency, and to determine improvements to the design, specifically for MAV applications. Studies relating to each rectenna subsystem were conducted, highlighting improvements and design trade-offs. The analysis of the rectenna is broken into four subsystem, namely, (1) the receiving antenna, (2) the pre-rectification filtering, (3) the rectification and lastly, (4) post-rectification filtering. From {{the findings of this}} thesis, the final rectenna design implemented a capacitive probe fed circular patch that exhibits relatively wide bandwidth, high tolerance to manufacturing variances, and a radiation efficiency of 95 %. The pre-rectification filter was re-designed to increase its transmittance characteristics to 94 %. The Schottky diode was re-analyzed and its conversion efficiency and trade-offs for MAV applications were documented. The post-rectification filter was reconstructed taking into consideration the positioning of the Schottky diode, and impedance matching for both antenna and Schottky diode was explained. The issue of microstrip discontinuities and probe feed connection was subsequently addressed. The final design has a dimension of approximately 112. 5 mm 2 which is only 15 % of the existing design, and has an estimated weight of less than a gram. The estimated rf-to-dc conversion efficiency is approximately 50 %...|$|R
40|$|SYNERGETICS, INC., has designed, developed, {{and tested}} an air {{handling}} duct system that integrates the air duct with the cornice trim of interior spaces. The device {{has the advantage}} that the normal thermal losses from ducts into unconditioned attics and crawl spaces can be totally eliminated by bringing the ducts internal to the conditioned space. The following report details work conducted in the second budget period to develop the Cornice Duct System into a viable product {{for use in a}} variety of residential or small commercial building settings. A full-scale prototype has been fabricated and tested in a laboratory test building at the Daylighting Facility at North Carolina State University., Based on the results of that testing, the prototype design as been refined, fabricated, installed, and extensively tested in a residential laboratory house. The testing indicates that the device gives substantially superior performance to a standard air distribution system in terms of energy performance and thermal comfort. Patent Number US 6, 511, 373 B 2 has been granted on the version of the device installed and tested in the laboratory house. (A copy of that patent is attached.) Refinements to the device have been carried through two additional design iterations, with a particular focus on reducing installation time and cost and refining the air control system. These new designs have been fabricated and tested and show substantial promise. Based on these design and testing iterations, a final design is proposed as part of this document.
