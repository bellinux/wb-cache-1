5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{can live}} {{for more than}} 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years. Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting for}} help to arrive, they make phone calls to their {{respective}} families. A lone creature silently approaches the station. Hiding, Samantha observes several tentacles exploring {{the inside of the}} store, seemingly soaking up a television's light. Samantha quickly unplugs the television and the creature loses interest. Another creature appears, and they <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and possibly mate via light impulses. The creatures leave as the military arrives. Samantha and Andrew kiss before they are rushed into different vehicles. The chronological ending takes place {{at the beginning of the}} film, filmed in green night vision sight, when the military rescue team is attacked by a single creature.|$|E
50|$|Another {{prevalent}} {{theme is}} the characters' inability to <b>communicate</b> productively <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The play depends more on dialogue than on action; however, {{though there are}} fleeting moments in which each of them does seem to reach some understanding with the other, more often, they avoid <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{as a result of}} their own psychological insecurities and self-concerns.|$|R
50|$|In {{the right}} aisle, {{the first and}} second chapel, <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> they {{preserve}} the imperial and royal tombs of the Normans, those of Frederick II and father of Henry VI.|$|R
50|$|Often these {{machines}} are implemented as threads or processes <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{as part of}} a larger application. For example, a telecommunication protocol is most of the time implemented as an event-driven finite-state machine.|$|R
5|$|Al-Badr {{had formed}} two royalist armies— one under his uncle Prince Hassan {{in the east}} and one under his own control in the west. Both armies {{controlled}} most of the north and east of Yemen, including the towns of Harib and Marib. The provincial capital of Northern Yemen, Sadah, which would have given the Imam a key strategic road towards the main capital San'a, was controlled by the republicans. There were also areas like the town of Hajjah, where the royalists controlled the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans controlled the town and fortress. Mercenaries from France, Belgium and England, who had fought in Rhodesia, Malaya, Indochina and Algeria, were sent to assist the Imam in planning, training and giving the irregular forces the ability to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and the Saudis. They trained tribesmen in the use of antitank weapons, such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques. The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds, although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15,000. Royalist tactics were confined to guerilla warfare, isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces, and conducting attacks on supply lines.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{encounters}} {{took place}} as the Battle of Hannut was being fought in Belgium. The results were much the same. On the southern face of Bulson, General Friedrich Kirchner, commander of the 1st Panzer Division, suffered several tactical reverses and saw the 37mm shells from his 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank guns and Panzer IIIs bounce off the more heavily armoured French tanks. A number of the German tanks were knocked out in rapid succession. The Germans had to hold the French at the ridge. Kirchner was forced to send in his tanks in dribs and drabs, tactics which Guderian hated, but which he himself decided {{there was no other}} recourse. It was once again the German tanks' radio equipment that enabled them to move around quickly and <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> to change the point of defence or attack quickly. The speed of the German tanks also enabled them to offset their inferiority in combat power to the French tanks. Often, the Panzer III and IVs could speed into the rear of French formations, closing quickly and knocking out the French armour from the rear. The Germans noted the particular weakness between the chassis and turret of the French tanks, which were vulnerable to their fire.|$|E
25|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} found to have signature whistles unique to a specific individual. These whistles are used for dolphins to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> by identifying an individual. It {{can be seen as the}} dolphin equivalent of a name for humans.|$|E
50|$|HP OpenView {{software}} provided large-scale {{system and}} network management of an organization's IT infrastructure. It included optional modules from HP {{as well as}} third-party management software, which connected within a common framework and <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the [...] "Asa Gray disjunction", one of Gray's greatest achievements was the vast network of scientists he built who all <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and exchanged ideas. He is considered the preeminent American botanist of the 19thcentury.|$|R
25|$|Circuits {{interconnecting}} switches {{are called}} trunks. Before Signalling System 7, Bell System electromechanical switches in the United States <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> over trunks {{using a variety}} of DC voltages and signaling tones. It would be rare to see any of these in use today.|$|R
25|$|These {{systems could}} use the old {{electromechanical}} signaling methods inherited from crossbar and step-by-step switches. They also introduced {{a new form of}} data communications: two 1ESS exchanges could <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> using a data link called Common Channel Interoffice Signaling, (CCIS). This data link was based on CCITT 6, a predecessor to SS7.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} as {{an effective}} mode of driver communication has been questioned, and researchers have found the ability of drivers to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{is about the same}} as the communication abilities among insects. However, when used as a means of increasing conspicuousness to other drivers, {{as in the case of}} motorcycle high/low beam modulators, it is highly effective.|$|E
25|$|The British built {{about fifty}} Martello towers around the Irish coastline, {{especially}} {{along the east}} coast, from Millmount (Drogheda), to Bray, around Dublin Bay but also around Cork Harbour on the south coast. On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were {{in line of sight}} of each other, providing the ability to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> or warn of any incoming attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Requires {{telephone}} companies to have TRS {{seven days a}} week, twenty four hours a day. It requires {{telephone companies}} to create accommodations for people with hearing disabilities by providing a third party that {{will be able to}} assistant both parties in <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Free Software Foundation (which {{holds the}} {{copyright}} of several notable GPL-licensed software products {{and of the}} license text itself) asserts that an executable which uses a dynamically linked library is indeed a derivative work.

50|$|Lanen {{comes to}} know Akhor, {{and for the}} first time since the Kantri {{departed}} the mainland, Kantri and Gedri are once again <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Their meetings must be secret and both must break the rules of their people in order to meet with each other.|$|R
25|$|Horses {{maintain}} {{visual contact}} with their family and herd at all times and have a host of ways to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> including vocalizations, scent marking, and {{a wide range of}} visual and tactile signals. Each kick, groom, tilt of the ear, or other contact with another horse is a means of communicating. This constant communication leads to complex social behaviors among Przewalski's horses.|$|E
25|$|Players {{are able}} to form squads of up to six {{soldiers}} in order to more effectively work as a team. Up to nine squads are permitted per team; each squad has a number (automatically assigned) and name (usually a phonetic alphabet letter) for identification. Members of a squad {{have the ability to}} <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> via Battlefield 2s integrated voice over IP (VoIP) system.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{one-on-one}} {{channels of communication}} grows more rapidly {{than the number of}} workers, thus increasing the time and costs of communication. At some point one-on-one communications between all workers becomes impractical; therefore only certain groups of employees will <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> (e.g. within departments or within geographical locations). This reduces, but does not stop, the increase in unit costs; and also the organisation will incur some inefficiencies due to the reduced level of communication.|$|E
50|$|Extinguishment {{relations}} {{occur between}} types {{confident in the}} same area of the psyche but who place different emphases on each function. These relations often consist of similar lifestyles but differing thought processes. Partners will have similar interests and areas of expertise, and have little trouble <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R
50|$|Various {{forms of}} {{one-to-one}} electronic messaging {{were used in}} the 1960s. People <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> using systems developed for specific mainframe computers. As more computers were interconnected, especially in the US Government's ARPANET, standards were developed to allow users of different systems to email <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> SMTP grew out of these standards developed during the 1970s.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dynamical}} system model, {{which represents}} networks composed of integrated neural systems <b>communicating</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> between unstable and stable phases, {{has become an}} increasingly popular theory underpinning the understanding of metastability. [...] Coordination dynamics forms the basis for this dynamical system model by describing mathematical formulae and paradigms governing the coupling of environmental stimuli to their effectors.|$|R
25|$|Gordon's {{announcement}} gave Indiana a {{very strong}} 2007 recruiting class, ranked by some analysts as the third-best incoming class in the country. Kelvin Sampson and Bruce Weber both received criticism from fellow coaches for failing to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> about Gordon's recruitment. Although the NCAA does not regulate verbal commitments or the recruitment of orally committed players, some observers have stated that Sampson had acted unethically in recruiting a committed player without first contacting Weber.|$|E
25|$|Between Bewdley North and Bewdley South {{the double}} track section through {{platforms}} 1 & 2 is signalled with absolute block. The single track through platform 3 is signalled with direction lever. The line furthest {{from the main}} station buildings, known as the Rock siding, is a double-ended siding. Whilst {{this means that the}} signalmen need not <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> before arranging movements into or out of this siding from either end, in practise they would liaise before conducting any unusual movement.|$|E
25|$|Neuropharmacology is a {{very broad}} region of science that {{encompasses}} {{many aspects of the}} nervous system from single neuron manipulation to entire areas of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. To better understand the basis behind drug development, one must first understand how neurons <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> This article will focus on both behavioral and molecular neuropharmacology; the major receptors, ion channels, and neurotransmitters manipulated through drug action and how people with a neurological disorder benefit from this drug action.|$|E
50|$|Historically, off-duty sailors {{were used}} as fly crews in theaters because they had {{comprehensive}} knowledge of knots and ropes due to their experience <b>with</b> sails. They <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> using high-pitched whistles. Because of this, whistling was not allowed in theaters {{to prevent it from}} accidentally being interpreted as a flyrail command. It is still considered 'bad luck' to whistle in a theater.|$|R

25|$|ICE {{operates}} the only nationwide {{radio communication system}} in the federal law enforcement community. The system, known as the National Law Enforcement Communications Center (NLECC) is Motorola-based and employs a technology specifically designed for ICE known as COTHEN (Customs Over The Horizon Network). Consequently, HSI special agents, ICE officers, and authorized subscribers are able to <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> across the nation using NLECC's strategically placed repeaters and high-speed data lines. The center, commonly referred to internally as Charlie-100, is based in Orlando, Florida.|$|E
25|$|According {{to former}} {{employee}} Alberto Pelliccione, {{the company began}} as security services provider, offering penetration testing, auditing and other defensive capabilities to clients. Pelliccione states that as malware and other offensive capabilities were developed and accounted for {{a larger percentage of}} revenues, the organization pivoted in a more offensive direction and became increasingly compartmentalized. Pelliccione claims fellow employees working on aspects of the same platform – for example, Android exploits and payloads – would not <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> possibly leading to tensions and strife within the organization.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in September 2008, DCFEMS began {{testing a}} new {{communications}} system {{developed by the}} United States Department of Homeland Security that linked radio, cell phones, GPS, wireless devices, and the DCFEMS dispatch system together. Known as the Radio Over Wireless Broadband (ROW-B) system, the system was designed to overcome long-standing problems where DCFEMS, police, Metro, and other agencies could not <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> because they used different systems, different frequencies, and different kinds of technology. The ROW-B system was not {{designed to be a}} permanent solution to the city's problems, but a pilot project.|$|E
