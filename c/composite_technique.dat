One test was made with multispectral scanner data using a <b>composite</b> <b>technique</b> which consists of (1) a strictly sequential statistical clustering which is a sequential variance analysis, and (2) a generalized K-means clustering. In this <b>composite</b> <b>technique,</b> the output of (1) is a first approximation of the cluster centers.

Another test was made using the three emulsion layers of color-infrared aerial film as a three-band spectrometer. Relative film densities were analyzed using a simple clustering technique in three-color space. Important advantages of the clustering technique over conventional supervised computer programs are (1) human intervention, preparation time, and manipulation of data are reduced, (2) the computer map, gives unbiased indication of where best to select the reference ground control data, (3) use of easy to obtain inexpensive film, and (4) the geometric distortions can be easily rectified by simple standard photogrammetric techniques...|$|E

40|$|Summary Given {{increased}} tooth retention into {{later years}} of life, dentists face increasing challenges in maintaining teeth with extensive composite restorations. Accompanying {{the increase in}} placement of composite restorations in general practice, {{there has also been}} increased evidence that repair, rather than replacement, of composite restorations is being increasingly considered as a treatment option. Previous work has demonstrated that such techniques are often underutilised in practice. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine contemporary teaching of <b>composite</b> repair <b>techniques</b> in Scandinavian dental schools. A questionnaire was distributed by email to each of the 12 Scandinavian dental schools in late 2010 /early 2011. This questionnaire sought information on the undergraduate teaching of <b>composite</b> repair <b>techniques</b> as well as indications and materials utilised for this technique. A 100 % response rate was achieved (12 schools). Eleven of the 12 respondent schools indicated that they included the teaching of <b>composite</b> repair <b>techniques</b> within their dental school programme. The most commonly reported indications for the teaching of the repair of direct composite restorations were tooth substance preservation (11 schools) and reduced risk of harmful effects on the pulp (10 schools). The most commonly taught surface treatment was mechanical roughening of the existing composite restoration, including the removal of the surface layer of material, prior to application of fresh composite (11 schools). Overall, the results of this study showed that the teaching of <b>composite</b> repair <b>techniques</b> is established within Scandinavian dental schools. This may influence the practising habits of dentists graduating from these schools when considering treatment options for defective composite restorations...|$|R
