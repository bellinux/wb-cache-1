40|$|AbstractMolecular phylogenies {{support a}} common ancestry between animals (Metazoa) and Fungi [1 – 3], but the {{evolutionary}} descent of the Metazoa from single-celled eukaryotes (protists) {{and the nature}} and taxonomic affiliation of these ancestral protists remain elusive. We addressed this question by sequencing complete mitochondrial genomes from taxonomically diverse protists to generate {{a large body of}} molecular data for phylogenetic analyses. Trees inferred from multiple concatenated mitochondrial protein sequences demonstrate that animals are specifically affiliated with two morphologically dissimilar unicellular protist taxa: Monosiga brevicollis (<b>Choanoflagellata),</b> a flagellate, and Amoebidium parasiticum (Ichthyosporea), a fungus-like organism. Statistical evaluation of competing evolutionary hypotheses [4] confirms beyond a doubt that <b>Choanoflagellata</b> and multicellular animals share a close sister group relationship, originally proposed {{more than a century ago}} on morphological grounds [5]. For the first time, our trees convincingly resolve the currently controversial phylogenetic position of the Ichthyosporea, which the trees place basal to <b>Choanoflagellata</b> and Metazoa but after the divergence of Fungi. Considering these results, we propose the new taxonomic group Holozoa, comprising Ichthyosporea, <b>Choanoflagellata,</b> and Metazoa. Our findings provide insight into the nature of the animal ancestor and have broad implications for our understanding of the evolutionary transition from unicellular protists to multicellular animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of multicellular metazoans from a unicellular ancestor {{is one of}} the most important advances in the history of life. Protein tyrosine kinases play important roles in cell-to-cell communication, cell adhesion, and differentiation in metazoans; thus, elucidating their origins and early evolution is crucial for understanding the origin of metazoans. Although tyrosine kinases exist in choanoflagellates, few data are available about their existence in other premetazoan lineages. To unravel the origin of tyrosine kinases, we performed a genomic and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based survey of the genes that encode tyrosine kinases in the two described filasterean species, Capsaspora owczarzaki and Ministeria vibrans, the closest relatives to the Metazoa and <b>Choanoflagellata</b> clades. We present 103 tyrosine kinase-encoding genes identified in the whole genome sequence of C. owczarzaki and 15 tyrosine kinase-encoding genes cloned by PCR from M. vibrans. Through detailed phylogenetic analysis, comparison of the organizations of the protein domains, and resequencing and revision of tyrosine kinase sequences previously found in some whole genome sequences, we demonstrate that the basic repertoire ofmetazoan cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases was established before the divergence of filastereans from the Metazoa and <b>Choanoflagellata</b> clades. In contrast, the receptor tyrosine kinases diversified extensively in each of the filasterean, choanoflagellate, and metazoan clades. This difference in the divergence patterns between cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases suggests that receptor tyrosine kinases that had been used for receiving environmental cues were subsequently recruited as a communication tool between cells at the onset of metazoan multicellularity.

40|$|Globular fossils showing palintomic cell {{cleavage}} in the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation, China, {{are widely}} regarded as embryos of early metazoans, although metazoan synapomorphies, tissue differentiation, and associated juveniles or adults are lacking. We demonstrate using synchrotron-based x-ray tomographic microscopy that the fossils have features incompatible with multicellular metazoan embryos. The developmental pattern is comparable with nonmetazoan holozoans, including germination stages that preclude postcleavage embryology characteristic of metazoans. We conclude that these fossils are neither animals nor embryos. They belong outside crown-group Metazoa, within total-group Holozoa (the sister clade to Fungi that includes Metazoa, <b>Choanoflagellata,</b> and Mesomycetozoea) or perhaps on even more distant branches in the eukaryote tree.

40|$|Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) {{require the}} {{absolutely}} conserved sequence motif CCA at their 3 ′-ends, representing {{the site of}} aminoacylation. In the majority of organisms, this trinucleotide sequence is not encoded in the genome and thus has to be added post-transcriptionally by the CCA-adding enzyme, a specialized nucleotidyltransferase. In eukaryotic genomes this ubiquitous and highly conserved enzyme family is usually represented by a single gene copy. Analysis of published sequence data allows us to pin down the unusual evolution of eukaryotic CCA-adding enzymes. We show that the CCA-adding enzymes of animals originated from a horizontal gene transfer event in the stem lineage of Holozoa, i. e. Metazoa (animals) and their unicellular relatives, the Choanozoa. The tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, acquired from an α-proteobacterium, replaced the ancestral enzyme in Metazoa. However, in <b>Choanoflagellata,</b> the group of Choanozoa that is closest to Metazoa, both the ancestral and the horizontally transferred CCA-adding enzymes have survived. Furthermore, our data refute a mitochondrial origin of the animal tRNA nucleotidyltransferases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransitions from unicellularity to {{multicellularity}} {{have occurred}} {{several times in}} the history of life. Two of the most conspicuous multicellular kingdoms, Metazoa and Fungi, form a monophyletic clade, known as the opisthokonts, which comprises some unicellular lineages, such as <b>Choanoflagellata,</b> Nucleariidae, Ichthyosporea (also known as the DRIPs or Mesomycetozoea), Ministeria and Corallochytrium[1, 2]. Among these unicellular opisthokonts we should expect to find the closest extant relatives of the multicellular Metazoa and Fungi. Choanoflagellates have traditionally been considered to be closely related to metazoans [1 – 6] and the Ichthyosporea are proposed to be the next closest outgroup [5]. By contrast, the position of the nucleariids is controversial [7 – 10]. Nuclearia sp. (ATCC 30864), recently renamed as Capsaspora owczarzaki, a filose amoeboid symbiont of a pulmonate snail, has never been confidently assigned to any opisthokont lineage [7 – 9]. Here, we report large subunit ribosomal and actin sequences of Capsaspora owczarzaki and an actin sequence of the novel ichthyosporean species Sphaeroforma arctica[11].

40|$|Abstract Background Comparative {{genomics}} of {{the early}} diverging metazoan lineages and of their unicellular sister-groups opens new window to reconstructing the genetic changes which preceded or accompanied the evolution of multicellular body plans. A recent analysis found that the genome of the nerve-less sponges encodes the homologues of most vertebrate post-synaptic proteins. In vertebrate excitatory synapses, these proteins assemble to form the post-synaptic density, a complex molecular platform linking membrane receptors, components of their signalling pathways, and the cytoskeleton. Newly available genomes from Monosiga brevicollis (a member of <b>Choanoflagellata,</b> the closest unicellular relatives of animals) and Trichoplax adhaerens (a member of Placozoa: besides sponges, the only nerve-less metazoans) offer an opportunity to refine our understanding of post-synaptic protein evolution. Results Searches for orthologous proteins and reconstruction of gene gains/losses based on the taxon phylogeny indicate that post-synaptic proteins originated in two main steps. The backbone scaffold proteins (Shank, Homer, DLG) {{and some of their}} partners were acquired in a unicellular ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoans. A substantial additional set appeared in an exclusive ancestor of the Metazoa. The placozoan genome contains most post-synaptic genes but lacks some of them. Notably, the master-scaffold protein Shank might have been lost secondarily in the placozoan lineage. Conclusions The time of origination of most post-synaptic proteins was not concomitant with the acquisition of synapses or neural-like cells. The backbone of the scaffold emerged in a unicellular context and was probably not involved in cell-cell communication. Based on the reconstructed protein composition and potential interactions, its ancestral function could have been to link calcium signalling and cytoskeleton regulation. The complex later became integrated into the evolving synapse through the addition of novel functionalities. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{ribosome}} biogenesis (RiBi) genes encode a highly-conserved eukaryotic set of nucleolar proteins {{involved in}} rRNA transcription, assembly, processing, and export from the nucleus. While {{the mode of}} regulation of this suite of genes has been studied in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, how this gene set is coordinately regulated in the larger and more complex metazoan genomes is not understood. Results Here we present genome-wide analyses indicating that a distinct mode of RiBi regulation co-evolved with the E(CG) -binding, Myc:Max bHLH heterodimer complex in a stem-holozoan, the ancestor of both Metazoa and <b>Choanoflagellata,</b> the protozoan group most closely related to animals. These results show that this mode of regulation, characterized by an E(CG) -bearing core-promoter, is specific to {{almost all of the}} known genes involved in ribosome biogenesis in these genomes. Interestingly, this holozoan RiBi promoter signature is absent in nematode genomes, which have not only secondarily lost Myc but are marked by invariant cell lineages typically producing small body plans of 1000 somatic cells. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of 10 fungal genomes shows that this holozoan signature in RiBi genes is not found in hemiascomycete fungi, which evolved their own unique regulatory signature for the RiBi regulon. Conclusion These results indicate that a Myc regulon, which is activated in proliferating cells during normal development as well as during tumor progression, has primordial roots in the evolution of an inducible growth regime in a protozoan ancestor of animals. Furthermore, by comparing divergent bHLH repertoires, we conclude that regulation by Myc but not by other bHLH genes is responsible for the evolutionary maintenance of E(CG) sites across the RiBi suite of genes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{eukaryotic}} phylogenomic analyses published to date {{were based}} on alignments of hundreds to thousands of genes. Frequently, in such analyses, the most realistic evolutionary models currently available are often used to minimize the impact of systematic error. However, controversy remains {{over whether or not}} idiosyncratic gene family dynamics (i. e., gene duplications and losses) and incorrect orthology assignments are always appropriately taken into account. In this paper, we present an innovative strategy for overcoming orthology assignment problems. Rather than identifying and eliminating genes with paralogy problems, we have constructed a data set comprised exclusively of conserved single-copy protein domains that, unlike most of the commonly used phylogenomic data sets, should be less confounded by orthology miss-assignments. To evaluate the power of this approach, we performed maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses to infer the evolutionary relationships within the opisthokonts (which includes Metazoa, Fungi, and related unicellular lineages). We used this approach to test 1) whether Filasterea and Ichthyosporea form a clade, 2) the interrelationships of early-branching metazoans, and 3) the relationships among early-branching fungi. We also assessed the impact of some methods that are known to minimize systematic error, including reducing the distance between the outgroup and ingroup taxa or using the CAT evolutionary model. Overall, our analyses support the Filozoa hypothesis in which Ichthyosporea are the first holozoan lineage to emerge followed by Filasterea, <b>Choanoflagellata,</b> and Metazoa. Blastocladiomycota appears as a lineage separate from Chytridiomycota, although this result is not strongly supported. These results represent independent tests of previous phylogenetic hypotheses, highlighting the importance of sophisticated approaches for orthology assignment in phylogenomic analyses. © The Author 2011.

40|$|Hydra polyps {{predominantly}} reproduce through budding in {{the lower}} half of the parent’s body column. FGFRa (Kringelchen), a member of FGF receptor tyrosine kinases, plays an essential role and controls bud detachment from the parent. Whether signal transduction through Hydra FGFR is comparable to FGFR signal- ing in vertebrate and fly is unknown. In both Bilateria, activated FGFRs recruit docking proteins to connect to downstream pathways and negative regulators. While vertebrates use FRS 2 to dock FGFR to the Ras/MAPK or PI 3 K pathways, a completely unrelated protein, Downstream- of- FGFR (Dof/Stumps/Heartbro- ken), fulfills this function in Drosophila. In Drosophila, Dof couples FGFR to MAPK signaling and transcriptionally activates the negative regulator Sprouty (Spry). Spry proteins are necessary to modulate receptor tyrosine kinase activity by in- terfering with MAPK signaling downstream of RTK. To elucidate potential downstream signaling elements of ancestral FGFRs, I an- alyzed genomic and EST sequence databases and identified Spry, FRS 2, and/or Dof proteins in phyla derived early from the main lineage of animals – including Hydra. Dof was found only within the Eumetazoa, while FRS 2 proteins were also predicted in Metazoa and their sister taxon, the <b>Choanoflagellata.</b> For the known FRS 2 proteins of Deuterostomia and Ecdysozoa an N- terminal myristoylation site, a PTB domain and multiple C- terminal Grb 2 and Shp 2 binding sites are typ- ical. This structure also applies to FRS 2 in <b>Choanoflagellata</b> and sponges (Porif- era). A deviating domain structure of FRS 2 proteins is predicted in Placozoa, Cnidaria, and Spiralia (Annelida, Mollusca). Their FRS 2 proteins all carry an N- terminal PH, a PTB domain and few Grb 2 and Shp 2 binding sites. Phylogenetic analysis identified a novel protein family (PH- FRS 2). Expression analysis of Dof and FRS 2 in Hydra revealed high levels of Dof transcripts in the upper body re- gion and the tentacle zone. FRS 2 mRNA, in contrast, was detected only weakly at the tentacle bases. The presence of both putative docking proteins in Metazoa hints to an early toolkit for the transduction of FGFR signals. Their functional sig- nificance remains to be shown. I also identified four spry genes in Hydra, all positioned in the basal most position of the phylogenetic tree. They encode the typical features of Spry proteins namely a c- Cbl TKB (Tyrosine kinase binding) site, a Raf 1 - binding and a Spry domain. Transcripts of spry 2 were detected at the bud base adjacent to Hydra FGFRa from mid to late stages. Since no spry- encoding genes were found in the ge- nomes of Parazoa (Trichoplax), sponges (Oscarella, Amphimedon), or choanoflagellates (Salpingoeca), Sprouties might have occurred in the Cnidaria first - or been lost from the early derived taxa. Tissue dynamics and the spatiotemporal expression pattern of FGFRa, dof and spry 2, reveals (a) spry 2 and FGFRa are present in the same cells at the bud base, (b) co- expression of FGFRa (weakly) and dof (strongly) in the head region. In summary, data suggest the existence of two FGFR pathways. The first path- way functions in bud detachment, as shown previously, and potentially links FGFRa to a negative feedback loop activating Spry 2. A second pathway function for FGFR signaling in Hydra might be at the bud and at the adult head – in a zone, where the mRNA encoding the docking protein Dof is expressed at a high level, and where the two FGFRs are transcribed at a low level. Here, FGFR might func- tion to control or modulate cell migration towards the head and/or cell differentia- tion necessary to form and maintain a fully functional head. Further elucidation of these potential functions and the molecular network, in which Hydra FGFRs act, is a very interesting task for the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{earliest}} {{evolution of}} the animals remains a taxing biological problem, as all extant clades are highly derived and the fossil record is not usually considered to be helpful. The rise of the bilaterian animals recorded in the fossil record, {{commonly known as the}} ‘Cambrian explosion’, {{is one of the most}} significant moments in evolutionary history, and was an event that transformed first marine and then terrestrial environments. We review the phylogeny of early animals and other opisthokonts, and the affinities of the earliest large complex fossils, the so-called ‘Ediacaran’ taxa. We conclude, based on a variety of lines of evidence, that their affinities most likely lie in various stem groups to large metazoan groupings; a new grouping, the Apoikozoa, is erected to encompass Metazoa and <b>Choanoflagellata.</b> The earliest reasonable fossil evidence for total-group bilaterians comes from undisputed complex trace fossils that are younger than about 560 [*]Ma, and these diversify greatly as the Ediacaran–Cambrian boundary is crossed a few million years later. It is generally considered that as the bilaterians diversified after this time, their burrowing behaviour destroyed the cyanobacterial mat-dominated substrates that the enigmatic Ediacaran taxa were associated with, the so-called ‘Cambrian substrate revolution’, leading to the loss of almost all Ediacara-aspect diversity in the Cambrian. Why, though, did the energetically expensive and functionally complex burrowing mode of life so typical of later bilaterians arise? Here we propose a much more positive relationship between late-Ediacaran ecologies and the rise of the bilaterians, with the largely static Ediacaran taxa acting as points of concentration of organic matter both above and below the sediment surface. The breaking of the uniformity of organic carbon availability would have signalled a decisive shift away from the essentially static and monotonous earlier Ediacaran world into the dynamic and burrowing world of the Cambrian. The Ediacaran biota thus played an enabling role in bilaterian evolution similar to that proposed for the Savannah environment for human evolution and bipedality. Rather than being obliterated by the rise of the bilaterians, the subtle remnants of Ediacara-style taxa within the Cambrian suggest that they remained significant components of Phanerozoic communities, even though at some point their enabling role for bilaterian evolution was presumably taken over by bilaterians or other metazoans. Bilaterian evolution was thus an essentially benthic event that only later impacted the planktonic environment and the style of organic export to the sea floor...|$|E
