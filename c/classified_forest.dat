5|$|The royal {{antelope}} {{has been}} categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated {{the total population}} to be about 62,000, however {{this is likely to}} be an underestimate. The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat to the survival of this antelope is hunting for bushmeat; it is seldom hunted in Sierra Leone and Liberia, whereas it is a major source of bushmeat in Côte d'Ivoire. Protected areas where the royal antelope occurs include the Tai National Park, Haut Bandama Fauna and Flora Reserve and Mabi-Yaya <b>Classified</b> <b>Forest</b> (Côte d'Ivoire); Kakum National Park and Assin-Attandanso Game Production Reserve (Ghana); Ziama and Diecke Forest Reserves (Guinea); Tiwai Island and Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone).|$|E
25|$|The use {{of these}} rare {{hardwoods}} by local people is limited and sustainable, unlike the unsustainable exploitation from illegal and government-approved logging for international markets. The logging of rosewoods and ebonies in Madagascar {{can be traced back}} more than twenty years prior to the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. Until recently, the island's forests had not experienced the levels of intense logging seen in countries like Malaysia or Indonesia due to its smaller trees, challenging terrain, and national policies favoring locally controlled, small-scale operations. Forestry laws have been in place since at least the 1960s, and commercial logging has been regulated by the state. For decades, artisanal loggers have extracted high-value trees from most remaining forests on the island. Between 1974 and 1980, logging was permitted in the northern section of the Zombitse protected area. In the 1970s, a logging company received permission from the state to selectively harvest precious hardwoods from Ihera <b>Classified</b> <b>Forest,</b> which continued legally until all trees of commercially valuable size had become rare. However, illegal logging began when local leaders manipulated the remaining loggers to continue the extracting on a smaller scale for their own benefit.|$|E

The invariance properties of optimal coherences may be used to overcome some limitations encountered with the Wishart approach.

The spatial models based on aspect, elevation, incorporated aspect-height and homogenous units constructed for each type individually. Probability occurrence rates of types were extracted in the each class. Classification was accomplished with the best spectral data sets by maximum likelihood classifier using only spectral data and with spatial models separately. The accuracy of results was assessed with a sample ground truth map. The results showed that spatial models could improve considerably results in compare with only spectral data (14 %).

40|$|Malaysia is {{the third}} largest {{country in the world}} that had lost forest cover. Therefore, timely {{information}} on forest cover is required to help the government to ensure that the remaining forest resources are managed in a sustainable manner. This study aims to map and detect changes of forest cover (deforestation and disturbance) in Iskandar Malaysia region in the south of Peninsular Malaysia between years 1990 and 2010 using Landsat satellite images. The Carnegie Landsat Analysis System-Lite (CLASlite) programme was used to <b>classify</b> <b>forest</b> cover using Landsat images. This software is able to mask out clouds, cloud shadows, terrain shadows, and water bodies and atmospherically correct the images using 6 S radiative transfer model. An Automated Monte Carlo Unmixing technique embedded in CLASlite was used to unmix each Landsat pixel into fractions of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and soil surface (S). Forest and non-forest areas were produced from the fractional cover images using appropriate threshold values of PV, NPV and S. CLASlite software was found to be able to <b>classify</b> <b>forest</b> cover in Iskandar Malaysia with only a difference between 14 % (1990) and 5 % (2010) compared to the forest land use map produced by the Department of Agriculture, Malaysia. Nevertheless, the CLASlite automated software used in this study was found not to exclude other vegetation types especially rubber and oil palm that has similar reflectance to forest. Currently rubber and oil palm were discriminated from forest manually using land use maps. Therefore, CLASlite algorithm needs further adjustment to exclude these vegetation and <b>classify</b> only <b>forest</b> cover...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying forest {{structure}} {{is important for}} sustainable forest management, {{as it relates to}} a wide variety of ecosystem processes and services. Lidar data have proven particularly useful for measuring or estimating a suite of forest structural attributes such as canopy height, basal area, and LAI. However, the potential of this technology to characterize forest succession remains largely untested. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of lidar data for characterizing forest successional stages across a structurally diverse, mixed-species forest in Northern Idaho. We used a variety of lidar-derived metrics in conjunction with an algorithmic modeling procedure (Random <b>Forests)</b> to <b>classify</b> six stages of three-dimensional forest development and achieved an overall accuracyN 95 %. The algorithmic model presented herein developed ecologically meaningful classifications based upon lidar metrics quantifying mean vegetation height and canopy cover, among others. This study highlights the utility of lidar data for accurately <b>classifying</b> <b>forest</b> succession in complex, mixed coniferous forests; but further research should be conducted to <b>classify</b> <b>forest</b> successional stages across different forests types. The techniques presented herein can be easily applied to other areas. Furthermore, the final classification map represents a significant advancement for forest succession modeling and wildlife habitat assessment. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 1...|$|R
