In SharedARK, users at separate workstatibns interact {{in real time}} with the same world of simulated physical objects. In the experiments, two users are in separate rooms with a workstation each, and communicate through 'a high fidelity, hands-free audio and a <b>camera-monitor</b> <b>device</b> called a "video tunnel ' which enables eye contact. For comparison, we have removed the video tunnel for some subjects, and have placed other subject pairs in the same room, giving them only a workstation each. Within SharedARK, subjects are given a "microworld " within which {{to solve a problem}} in everyday physics.

We also catalogue eye glances and eye contact in terms of their relation to these activities. Our primary purpose has been to assess the learnability and usability of this technology, and to identify factors that are important in facilitating collaborative problem solving by directly comparing remote, electronically mediated communication with physical co-presence. We find the system is easily learned and fairly easily used. Subjects normally find the task engaging, and usually work together throug h largely unarticulated tas...|$|E
