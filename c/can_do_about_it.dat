5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

25|$|Hartmann {{is also a}} vocal {{critic of}} the effects of {{neoliberal}} globalization on the U.S. economy, claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of Ronald Reagan have led, in large part, to many American industrial enterprises' being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries, leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs'—once considered a major foundation of the U.S. economy—being relocated to countries in Asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the U.S. and the concurrent reversal of the United States' traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods (exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as China). Hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the American middle class, whose survival Hartmann deems critical to the survival of American democracy. This argument is expressed in Hartmann's 2006 book, Screwed: The Undeclared War Against The Middle Class and What We <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>About</b> <b>It.</b> One of the book's main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate media's shifting the American consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class.|$|E

500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lisa's departing storyline {{revolved}} around rekindling of her romance with Phil. After beginning an affair, she left Mark taking {{her daughter to}} live with the Mitchells. Benjamin discussed her character's motive: [...] "There has always been a spark between her and Phil and it’s never been put out. Lisa has tried to love Mark and in her own way, she does— but it’s not passionate between them. She knows it’s wrong. She chose Mark, but Phil is her weakness. She wants him, and there’s nothing she <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Phil knows she loves the danger and for once, Lisa’s being impulsive. She’s a wife and mother and, although she loves her daughter and doesn’t want to hurt Mark, being with Phil is an escape. It gives her something she doesn’t have with Mark— passion. You’d think she’d learn not to get involved again. But Lisa is a victim of her love for Phil. It led her astray last time, and it’s happening again. She’s playing with fire, but it’s exciting.” Explaining his interpretation of Phil's motive, Steve McFadden added, [...] "He likes the new, spirited Lisa. She’s very different from the girl who let him walk all over her. She was just living to please him and he didn’t like that [...] Lisa isn’t the woman she used to be. She fought to keep her family together. She stood up to Phil. She even shot him! He wants a family, and he’s also attracted to her.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The buildup to Steven's exit {{involved}} in a bisexual love triangle storyline between him, Stacey and Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who is the gay brother of Jane. On-screen, Steven and Stacey's friendship progressed into something more serious in March 2008, when they shared a kiss. Steven later decided {{he was ready to}} lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice [...] "to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself," [...] which Sidwell has described as, [...] "a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show." [...] Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: [...] "Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and would do anything for her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality..." [...] On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; {{in an interview with the}} Daily Star he explained, [...] " [...] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [...] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [...] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it." [...] The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and [...] "out" [...] him. John Partridge, has commented, [...] "Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's nothing you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and if you try to hide it, people get hurt." [...] After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him – a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot has been described as [...] "controversial" [...] and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: [...] "A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well." ...|$|E
