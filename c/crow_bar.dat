Demerchyan, who spent seven weeks constructing housing for the 2014 Winter Olympics, was accused by his supervisor of stealing wiring. Demerchyan denied the allegations but when the victim returned to work to collect his pay, he was met by several police officers who beat him, breaking two of his teeth and sexually assaulted him with a <b>crow</b> <b>bar.</b> He was treated in hospital, but doctors told his family they had found no serious injuries on his body.|$|E

500|$|The chase scene {{involving}} Joseph and Olivia required much preparation, as {{the crew}} had to simulate an exploding transformer. Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a [...] "mechanical trip" [...] to support an electrical cable, which he then strung {{to the other side}} of the adjacent road using a pole. The crew filled the fuse box with [...] "sparking devices", meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines. Demonstrating this, Brink noted, [...] "What happens is the panel cover will blow off, sparks will come out, the cable will go up, sparking down to the ground." [...] Misiano said of the sequence, [...] "This young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up. It really blew!" [...] The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach later told him, [...] "that was actually really scary" [...] to film.

In general, as little road work as possible was done. Travel was often {{along the top of}} ridges to avoid the brush and washes common in many valleys. Because the wagons tipped over easily on a side hill they were often dragged straight up a steep hill, with multiple teams if necessary and then skidded straight down the opposite side with chained up wheels if required.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first record}} of the hammer mill dates to the year 1607, when {{the owner of the}} demesne in Freibergsdorf, Ernst Schönlebe, was granted water for his (iron) bar mill or Zainhammer. On several occasions, the water of the Goldbach was the subject of dispute between the Freiberg Mine, the hammer mill and a {{neighbouring}} mill. Over the course of the centuries, the hammer works primarily manufactured iron products both for the mining industry (e. g. tools like hammers, chisels, <b>crow</b> <b>bars)</b> as well as implements for agricultural use. Until its sale to St. John's Hospital in 1903, the hammer mill had been privately owned. Between 1903 and 1945 it made copper products almost exclusively. Commercial operations were finally ended in 1974.|$|R
2500|$|On 15–16 December 1944, Havildar Umrao Singh was a field gun {{detachment}} {{commander in}} an advanced {{section of the}} 30th Mountain Regiment, Indian Artillery, attached to the 81st West African Division. Singh's gun was in an advanced position, supporting the 8th Gold Coast Regiment. After a 90-minute sustained bombardment from 75mm guns and mortars, Singh's gun position was attacked by at least two companies of Japanese infantry. Using a Bren light machine gun he directed the rifle fire of the gunners, holding off the assault, and was wounded by two grenades. A second wave of attackers killed all but Singh and two other gunners, but was also beaten off. The three soldiers {{had only a few}} bullets remaining, and these were rapidly exhausted in the initial stages of the assault by a third wave of attackers. Undaunted, Singh picked up a [...] "gun bearer" [...] (a heavy iron rod, similar to a <b>crow</b> <b>bar)</b> and used that as a weapon in hand-to-hand fighting. He was seen to strike down three infantrymen, before succumbing to a rain of blows. Six hours later, after a counterattack, he was found alive but unconscious near to his artillery piece, almost unrecognisable from a head injury, still clutching his gun bearer. Ten Japanese soldiers lay dead nearby. His field gun was back in action later that day.|$|E

50|$|Maitre André Gobillot (Jean Gabin), a {{distinguished}} lawyer in his mid 50s, defends {{a beautiful young}} woman, Yvette Maudet (Brigitte Bardot), who has committed a robbery with a toy gun and a <b>crow</b> <b>bar.</b> Despite the fact that Yvette injured an elderly woman with the <b>crow</b> <b>bar,</b> the brilliant lawyer successfully clears Yvette of the charges. Having accepted the case without payment, André's wife, Vivianne (Edwige Feuillère), assumes he wants to sleep with Yvette which proves to be the case. He also {{falls in love with}} her, putting his reputation and marriage at risk. However, Yvette is not true to him, and continually goes back to her younger, jealous lover, Mazzetti (Franco Interlenghi). André moves her to a new apartment where Mazzetti can't find her and attempts to create a small family and a happy home.|$|E

5000|$|This led to {{numerous}} incidents throughout {{different parts of}} the city centre before the protest rally even started as the police tried, often brutally, to impede the stream of people heading to the square. Soon after, the battles started at the square itself as the police started using armoured vehicles, water cannons, and tear gas in an attempt to drive the protesters out of the square. Enraged protesters immediately began responding, some of them armed with sticks, traffic sign poles, <b>crow</b> <b>bars</b> or whatever else they could get their hands on. The crowd from the adjoining streets jeered the police, chanting angrily at them to [...] "go to Pakrac" [...] or to [...] "go to Kosovo". Some of the others from the crowd that managed to get into the square made allusions to the Romanian Revolution of 1989 chanting [...] "alea alea Securitatea" [...] while calling Milošević a fascist.|$|R

50|$|Enormous {{quantities}} of stone were needed for these structures and {{the remains of}} the numerous quarries used can still be found, especially in the vicinity of Jerusalem’s Old City, notably those to the north known as Solomon's Quarries. Freeing the stones from the bedrock was an elaborate process: Wide grooves were chiseled with metal tools around the intended stone block. The block was then freed up by driving metal wedges into the grooves. The initial dressing of the stone was probably accomplished on site before transport. Many of these stones were very large, weighing between two and five tons. (The largest found, in the Western Wall Tunnel, measures some 12.8 meters in length, 3.4 meters high and 4.3 meters deep; it weighs about 660 tons.) Once moved to the building site, further fine chiseling was done and the blocks were hauled into place using ramps, cranes and <b>crow</b> <b>bars.</b> The stones were laid in dry courses, typically about 1 meter high without the use of any mortar. Each course was set 3 to 5 cm back from the course underneath it. Final dressing and refinements were carried out once the stones had been set in place.|$|R
40|$|In {{countries}} such as Kiribati, where the fisheries sector is the main player in local and national economies — {{as well as the}} main source of food and protein — impacts on marine resources may have dramatic consequences for the local population. In her article on page 21, Vina Ram-Bidesi assesses the potential impact of a destructive fishing method called te ororo on coastal fisheries and community livelihoods in Kiribati. Te ororo is a method that involves gill nets in combination with sticks, metal rods and <b>crow</b> <b>bars</b> to scare or drive fish into nets — a small-scale fishing method that is, unfortunately, widely used in tropical reef fisheries. According to Vina: “The economic costs of destruction from te ororo fishing is estimated to be 5. 0 % of government revenue annually and approximately 3. 5 % of gross domestic product. The cumulative effects of this loss over time on the economy and people of Kiribati should be underscored for immediate action. ” In the second feature article (p. 28), Michel Sharp presents a cost-benefit analysis of fish aggregating devices (FADs).

5000|$|In 1971, {{the city}} was {{featured}} in a Marshall Frady article, [...] "Discovering One Another in a Georgia Town", in Life magazine. The portrayal of the city's school integration was relatively benign, especially considering the community's history of troubled race relations. Americus' nadir in this respect had occurred in 1913, when {{a young black man}} named Will Redding was lynched by a white mob. A group of young African Americans were standing on the corner of Cotton Avenue and Lamar street. One of those men was Will Redding. Police chief Barrow ordered them {{to move away from the}} corner, all complied except Redding. The chief tried to arrest Redding and a struggle ensued. Will Redding was then hit with the Chief's gun, afterwards, Redding grabbed the gun and shot the police chief. Will Redding was then chased down, shot, and put in jail. An angry mob went into the jail and tore down the door to Redding's cell. When the door was completely torn down, the mob dragged Will Redding out onto Forsyth street and beat him to death using <b>crow</b> <b>bars</b> and hammers.|$|R
50|$|The {{straight}} claw {{serves the}} dual purpose of removing nails and {{acting as a}} <b>crow</b> <b>bar</b> to pry apart (rip) lumber. It does not have as much leverage for removing nails as a curved claw hammer when using {{the face of the}} claw as the fulcrum, but the handle can be pulled to the side to greatly increase leverage by using a very short fulcrum. For pulling nails, a wooden block can be placed under the head of the hammer close to the nail to increase leverage.|$|E

40|$|In my {{collection}} titled Isolated Incidents: A Short Story Collection, I explore {{the themes of}} isolation and loneliness while using dark humor and a satirical voice as an undercurrent to move the narratives. Isolation and loneliness intrigue me, because they are triggered and motivated by contradictory emotions inside of us. Fear, love, hate, and even nonchalant attitude and happiness can all mix to make us feel isolated even when we are not alone. People can be isolated when surrounded by others at a dinner table, or in a <b>crowed</b> <b>bar,</b> or even a small office filled with co-workers. Loneliness is universally experienced by humans, but we all have different reactions when the isolation becomes {{too much of a}} burden. My collection explores the different extremes people take to avoid the pain of loneliness through a dark humored, satirical voice. I believe that comedy, especially satire, combats and reflects the beautifully chaotic world we live in, particularly in this digital age where we seem to be more connected than ever; yet, we isolate ourselves further by eliminating face-to-face connections. This collection reflects how we lash out at one another to stop the pain and anger when we feel alone, {{and the ways in which}} the internet has exacerbated these feelings and actions...|$|R
50|$|The rioting {{had spread}} to the slums of Canal Bank, Grandpass, Hattewatte, Kirilapone, Kotahena, Maradana, Modera, Mutwal, Narahenpita, Slave Island, and Wanathamulla by 10am. Mobs armed with <b>crow</b> <b>bars</b> and kitchen knives roamed the streets, attacking and killing Tamils. Wellawatte and Dehiwala, which {{contained}} {{the largest number of}} Tamils in Colombo, were the next target of the mob. Homes and shops were attacked, looted, and destroyed. Tamil shops on Main Street and Bo Tree Junction were also attacked. The riots then spread to the middle class residential areas of Anderson Flats, Elvitigala Flats, Torrington Flats, and Thimbirigasyaya. Tamil targets in the exclusive Cinnamon Gardens were also attacked as were those in the suburbs of Kadawatha, Kelaniya, Nugegoda and Ratmalana. The residence of the Indian High Commissioner was also attacked and ransacked. By lunchtime, virtually the entire city was on fire. The curfew was brought forward to 4:00 p.m. and then to 2:00 p.m., and it was extended to Gampaha District due to the violence spreading as far as Negombo. In Kalutara the TKVS Stores were set on fire. The owner jumped out of an upstairs window, but the mob threw him back into the fire. The curfew was extended to Kalutara District.|$|R

50|$|Colombo {{was still}} calm on 29 July. Tamil {{residents}} were visiting {{their friends and}} relatives who had taken refuge in the many refugee camps in the city. But at around 10:30 a.m. two Sinhalese youths were shot on Gas Works Street. A large crowd gathered at the scene, and soon rumours started circling that the youths had been shot by Tamil Tigers in the Adam Ali building. The building was surrounded by the army, navy, and police who proceed to fire at the building using submachine guns and semi-automatic rifles. A helicopter also fired at the building with a machine gun. The security forces stormed the building but found no Tamil Tigers, weapons, or ammunitions inside. Rumours began to spread around Colombo that the army was engaged in a battle with the Tamil Tigers. Panicking workers began to flee in any mode of transport they could find. Mobs started gathering in the streets, armed with axes, bricks, <b>crow</b> <b>bars,</b> iron rods, kitchen knives, and stones, ready to fight the Tigers. The Tigers never came, so the mobs {{turned their attention to}} the fleeing workers. Vehicles were stopped and searched for Tamils. Any Tamil they found was attacked and set on fire. A Tamil was burnt alive on Kirula Road. Eleven Tamils were burnt alive on Attidiya Road. The police found an abandoned van on the same road which contained the butchered bodies of two Tamils and three Muslims. Police shot dead 15 rioters.

40|$|Successful {{operation}} of the FAA’s Low-Level Windshear Alert System (LLWAS) depends largely on birds not perching on the wind-sensing units which are installed atop poles 40 - 45 m tall. Because new LLWAS units will be erected at airports throughout North America, anti- perching devices must deter numerous avian species ranging widely in body size and behavioral pattern. To determine the most promising devices, we conducted pen trials with brown-headed cowbirds, fish <b>crows,</b> <b>barred</b> owls, great horned-owls and black vultures. Birds were given free access to an unmodified sensor unit mounted on a tripod for 24 hours, during which the only alternative perch was a tree branch at ground level. This was followed by 24 h with a perching deterrent installed on the sensor unit. Trials were video-taped 10 hours daily and the sensors were connected to a computer so that failures in acquisition of wind data due to perching activity were continuously recorded. Smaller birds (cowbirds, crows) tended to perch on the 3 arms of the sensor units and were mostly deterred by “Bird Spinners”, metal bushings slipped onto the sensor arms that turned freely and prevented the birds from obtaining a stable perch. Owls and vultures were not affected by “Bird Spinners”, but “AgSpikes” (sharp, stout spikes emanating from a central base) reduced perching 95 - 98 %. With the “AgSpikes” or “AgCone” (a smooth, solid aluminum cone) installed, owls and vultures attempted to perch but departed {{when they were not}} able to obtain a comfortable, stable grip. Commercial bird spikes and a monofilament web attached to the sensor arms were each ineffective regardless of species. It appears that a single perch deterrent device will not suffice for all birds, but a combination of “Bird Spinners” with “AgSpikes” or “AgCone” should be appropriate for most situations. Verification of these findings with field testing is needed...|$|R
