40|$|Recently in the {{traditional}} ceramic industry {{there has been an}} increasing interest in the obtainment of inclusion pigments to stabilize at the firing temperature and towards the actions of molten glasses unstable cromophore such as hematite or <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphoselenide.</b> This work focuses on a new synthesis of hematite-zircon inclusion pigment obtained from sintering of non-conventional mixture of precursors. To this purpose a glass composition belonging to the Li 2 O-ZrO 2 -SiO 2 system that during the sintering/devetrification steps crystallizes zircon has been chosen. The employment of two different Fe precursors (oxide and goethite) have been also analyzed. Finally, a mechanism of pigment formation is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{ceramic industry}} has recently witnessed increasing {{interest in the}} obtainment of inclusion pigments to stabilize at firing temperature and in the action of molten glass unstable chromospheres such as hematite or <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphoselenide.</b> This work focuses in the introduction, before the calcination step, of a high energy milling step (mechanosynthesis) to improve the inclusionefficiency of hematite into the zircon matrix by solid state reaction. In particular the synthesis of hematite–zircon inclusion pigment was optimized through an accurate control of the raw material milling time and calcination temperature. The mechanical activation modifies {{the conditions in which}} chemical reactions usually take place changing the reactivity of as-milled solids by increase of reaction rates and lowering the reaction temperatures of ground powders...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{non-invasive}} study of historical and modern Zn-and Cd-based pigments with time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence multispectral imaging and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Zinc oxide and Zinc sulphide are semiconductors {{which have been}} used as white pigments in paintings, and the luminescence of these pigments from trapped states is strongly dependent on the presence of impurities and crystal defects. <b>Cadmium</b> <b>sulphoselenide</b> pigments vary in hue from yellow to deep red based on their composition, and are another class of semiconductor pigments which emit both in the visible and the near infrared. The Fluorescence lifetime of historical and modern pigments has been measured using both an Optical Multichannel Analyser (OMA) coupled with a Nd:YAG ns-laser, and a streak camera coupled with a ps-laser for spectrally-resolved fluorescence lifetime measurements. For Zn-based pigments we have also employed Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) for the measurement of luminescence. A case study of FLIM applied to the analysis of the painting by Vincent Van Gogh on paper - "Les Bretonnes et le pardon de Pont-Aven" (1888) is presented. Through the integration of complementary, portable and non-invasive spectroscopic techniques, new insights into the optical properties of Zn-and Cd-based pigments have been gained which will inform future analysis of late 19 th and early 20 th C. painting...|$|E
40|$|Samples of {{microplastic}} (n =  924) {{from two}} beaches in south west England have been analysed by field-portable-x-ray fluorescence (FP-XRF) spectrometry, configured in a low-density mode {{and with a}} small-spot facility, for the heavy metals, Cd and Pb, and the halogen, Br. Primary plastics {{in the form of}} pre-production pellets were the principal type of microplastic (> 70 %) on both beaches, with secondary, irregularly-shaped fragments representing the remainder of samples. Cadmium and Pb were detected in 6. 9 % and 7. 5 % of all microplastics, respectively, with concentrations of either metal that exceeded 10 (3)  μg g(- 1) usually encountered in red and yellow pellets or fragments. Respective correlations of Cd and Pb with Se and Cr were attributed to the presence of the coloured, inorganic pigments, <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphoselenide</b> and lead chromate. Bromine, detected in 10. 4 % of microplastics and up to concentrations of about 13, 000  μg g(- 1), was mainly encountered in neutrally-coloured pellets. Its strong correlation with Sb, whose oxides are effective fire suppressant synergists, suggests the presence of a variety of brominated flame retardants arising from the recycling of plastics originally used in casings for heat-generating electrical equipment. The maximum bioaccessible concentrations of Cd and Pb, evaluated using a physiological extraction based on the chemical characteristics of the proventriculus-gizzard of the northern fulmar, were about 50  μg g(- 1) and 8  μg g(- 1), respectively. These concentrations exceed those estimated for the diet of local seabirds by factors of about 50 and 4, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Interactions {{of light}} and {{electricity}} within matter have been known and studied {{for quite a long}} time. However, a systematic exploration of many relations among optical and electronic phenomena has a more recent history. Solid state optoelectronics is concerned with the technological exploitation of these relations. Photoconductivity studies illuminate the internal electronic processes in semiconductors and helps in the development of highly sensitive materials and devices. Photoconductivity is the increase in electrical conductivity of a material due to adsorption of radiation by it. Materials with special imperfections incorporated during preparation, give large signals. Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide are the II – VI compound semiconductors which are useful in the visible and near infrared range. For low levels of illumination (<= 301 x), cadmium sulphide is sluggish in response (response time 100 v m. sec.) while cadmium selenide has a faster response under similar conditions (30 m. sec.). Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide form a continuous series of substitution solid solutions and it is reasonable to expect some of these solid solutions might exhibit a broader spectral sensitivity coupled with faster response. Of the various methods available for the preparation of II – VI compound semiconductor layers, sintering of screen printed layers is, by far, the most flexible and inexpensive method for large scale preparation of highly sensitive layers. No systematic studies are reported on sintered <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphoselenide</b> layers, though quite a large numbers of patents and reports on these for specific purposes are available besides some published literature. Systematic studies on the preparation of photoconductive grade CdS and CdSe powders and sensitization and sintering of these powders to obtain optimum photosensitivity stability have been made. Analyses of the powders and sintered layers by AAS, polarography and EPMA as well as X-ray characterization for true solid solution formation have been made. The effect of various electrode materials like indium, silver, graphite, cadmium oxide and copper are examined and the effect of diffusion of the corresponding ions into the photoconductive layers on the current-voltage behavior both in the dark illumination are examined in detail. The optoelectronics properties like spectral distribution of sensitivity with composition, lux-ampere characterization and response time studies have been measured and correlated. An attempt has been made {{for the first time in}} the case of sintered layers to further enhance the sensitivity CdSxSe(1 -x) layers, by several methods, where such high sensitivity is called for, in specific applications. The possibility of using these CdSxSe(1 -x) layers in sintered CdSxSe(1 -x) : Cu 2 S/Cu 2 Se and CdSxSe(1 -x) : Tl 2 S photovoltaic solar cells has also been examined. Photoconductive CdSxSe(1 -x) cells will continue the interest of the solid state scientists and future applications may include image intensifiers and image storage panels in solar energy conversion and in electro photography. Logic flexibility can be incorporated into optoelectronic network using threshold of photosensitivity. Such devices will tend resemble more and more that of biological neural network such as neuro-retina in vertebrates, which will response only to inputs which are characteristic of some specific behavior. Intelligence coding, language transformation and automation of thought processes are some of the lines which will continue to interest the optoelectronic scientists. ...|$|E
