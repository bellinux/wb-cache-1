5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea {{has been the most}} {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's <b>codirector),</b> which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E

2500|$|Between {{the world}} wars, roles in musicals were usually filled by actors who could sing, but Rodgers and Hammerstein chose, conversely, to cast singers who could act. Though Theresa Helburn, <b>codirector</b> of the Theatre Guild, {{suggested}} Shirley Temple as Laurey and Groucho Marx as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director Rouben Mamoulian's support, insisted that performers more dramatically {{appropriate for the}} roles be cast. [...] As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step. The production was choreographed by Agnes de Mille (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show's most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often {{referred to as the}} dream ballet) depicting Laurey's struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} there is nothing {{anomalous}} about the flypaper effect. I develop a simple median voter model of government spending with costly tax collection that predicts the flypaper effect and provide a quantifiable measure of its magnitude. Using the model insights and previous estimates, I show that a tax rate between 8 % to 16 % would account for the flypaper effect observed in U. S. subnational governments. Keywords: flypaper effect, intergovernmental transfers, public finance, fiscal decentralization.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{consequences}} of creating and improving property rights so that fixed assets {{can be used as}} collateral. This has become a cause célèbre of Hernando de Soto whose views are influential in debates about policy reform concerning property rights. Hence, we refer to the economic impact of such reforms as the de Soto effect. We explore the logic of the argument for credit contracts, both in isolation, and in market equilibrium. We show that the impact will vary with the degree of market competition. Where competition is weak, it is possible that borrowers will be worse off when property rights improve. We discuss the implications for optimal policy and the political economy of policy reform.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIPre-Columbian {{populations that}} {{inhabited}} the Tarapacá mid river valley in the Atacama Desert in Chile during the Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate Period (AD 500 − 1450) show patterns of chronic poisoning due to exposure to geogenic arsenic. Exposure {{of these people}} to arsenic was assessed using synchrotron-based elemental X-ray fluorescence mapping, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectromicroscopy measurements on ancient human hair. These combined techniques of high sensitivity and specificity enabled the discrimination between endogenous and exogenous processes that has been an analytical challenge for archeological studies and criminal investigations in which hair {{is used as a}} proxy of premortem metabolism. The high concentration of arsenic mainly in the form of inorganic As(III) and As(V) detected in the hair suggests chronic arsenicism through ingestion of As-polluted water rather than external contamination by the deposition of heavy metals due to metallophilic soil microbes or diffusion of arsenic from the soil. A decrease in arsenic concentration from the proximal to the distal end of the hair shaft analyzed may indicate a change in the diet due to mobility, though chemical or microbiologically induced processes during burial cannot be entirely ruled out.

40|$|National Standards for United States History and National Standards for World History were {{published}} on October, 1994. They were developed {{under the supervision}} of the National Center for History in the Schools that was run by Gary B. Nash and Charlotte Crabtree, <b>codirectors</b> of the standards project. This project received funding from both the National Endowment for the Humanities and the United States Department of Education. The national standards for history have been developed over the course of two years, during which time only minor criticisms of the standards arose. However, upon their publication, an earlier supporter of the standards became their biggest critic. Namely, Lynne V. Cheney, former president of the National Endowment for the Humanities, published an article in the Wall Street Journal dramatically named “The End of History”. In this article she publically criticized the National Standards for United States Historyfor being politically correct, for giving too much emphasis to multiculturalism and for neglecting to mention some of the biggest names and events of American history. She was a supporter of the traditional view of history, according to which history in American classrooms should have a formative role and produce patriotic citizens. Even though L. Cheney was not the only critic of the Standards, she was the loudest and the most influential. However, when taking into account the political context surrounding the controversy about the Standards, Cheney’s arguments become rather thin. Lynne Cheney was the wife of Dick Cheney, a prominent politician and member of the Republican Party. The Standards {{were published}} in 1994 when American President was Bill Clinton, a Democrat. It is possible that L. Cheney was trying to undermine Bill Clinton’s administration in the wake of the upcoming presidential elections. Another Republican, Senator Slade Gorton, also contributed to the negative reception of the Standards. He proposed a non-binding resolution to the Senate that would condemn the Standards. The Senate passed the resolution with a nearly unanimous vote in January, 1995. However, the project was not dropped and in April 1996, after some changes of the content, a revised edition of the Standards was published. The most important change was deleting the examples of student achievement. Most of the criticism was focused on these examples, while ignoring the fact that they were completely voluntary and designed as guidelines for history 64 teachers. The omitting of the examples of student achievement significantly reduced the number of pages and the National Standards for United States History and the National Standards for World Historywere now published as one book, combined with the National Standards for History for Grades K- 4. With the publication of the revised edition of national standards for history, Basic Edition of the National Standards for History, the controversy over the National History Standards came to an end...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{exists to}} contextualise, document, and {{evaluate}} the knowledge contributed by the practice as research PhD project: The Development of Dialogic Music. The area of this project's investigation is expressed by the phrase 'experimental sonic performance', a term used to describe my own practice. This practice is historically positioned {{in relation to a}} broad selection of artistic activities, ranging from Luigi Russolo's (1913) The All of Noises to the relatively recent activities of musical groups such as AMM and Einsturzende Neubauten. Within this project I have primarily focused on the possibility of dialogue, as described by Martin Buber, and its actualisation within music making activities. The thesis attempts to clarify misconceptions regarding Buber's study of humanity's 'twofold attitudes' towards relation, whilst also exploring Walter Kaufmann's critique of dualism in an attempt to augment Buber's dialogic ontology. While partially relying on knowledge gained from such philosophizing as a starting point, my own understanding of dialogue has developed through a process of sonic experimentation through performance. The resulting five practical works, and their generative processes, have been recorded and summarised {{in the form of an}} audio-visual documentary, made available as part of this thesis. Interlaced with documentation of workshops, rehearsals, instrument construction and performances are extracts from a series of interviews that present the reflections of research participants including <b>codirectors,</b> performers, designers, and audience members. This practical work is presented in two parts. 'Documentation of Early Practical Investigations' presents material that was created during the preliminary stages of the project, prior to the written articulation of my theoretical framework. 'Documentation of Later Practical Investigations' provides a form of access to the work that was developed in parallel to this project's written components. In both parts the documentation is presented in a linear order clearly to illustrate the developmental process that took place during the project's realisation. Knowledge gained through feedback, conversations, and personal reflection on this body of work has been communicated in the form of an ethic of practice. It should be made clear that my use of the term 'ethic' relates more directly to its older relationship with the word 'ethos', rather than to a dogmatic set of rules, or maxims. This ethic has beendesigned to challenge dominant notions regarding how one should go about perceiving and making music. Further, in this section I hope to challenge and/or affirm individual artistic practitioners and active listeners who feel that a certain responsibility exists within their actions. Also included within this ethic is a workshop programme for directors of musical ensembles. This programme attempts to encourage the reader to take the 'idea of dialogue' presented by this thesis, and attempt the more meaningful leaming experience accessible in the actualisation of dialogue. The thesis concludes with an epilogue, which makes explicit the project's multiple contributions to knowledge, the relationships between these contributions, and their significance to the field. The epilogue continues to stress the importance of an approach that does not aim to generate definitive results, but rather emphasises the need for continual development. In light of this notion, the epilogue concludes by pointing to the possibilities for future research...|$|R
