40|$|Vacuum Interrupters (VIs) rely {{strongly}} on {{the vacuum}} level to be below 10 − 2 Pa {{to be able}} to operate safely. The vacuum status is normally tested during production to be well below this level (typically below 10 − 5 Pa) and then assumed to be sealed for life (fixed at 30 years). With a larger number of vacuum interrupters now reaching their end of life, there is a renewed interest in assessing their vacuum status in the field. The magnetron gauge principle can be applied for this. The basis for the principle is the formation of an electron trap by electric and magnetic fields across the VI. This article investigates the measurement principle using different modeling and simulation approaches. This allows getting insight into the working principle. Some basic design properties can be understood from the electron orbits. More important is the formation of a <b>closed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap,</b> which is investigated using an effective potential. More detailed calculations are done using a particle-in-cell approach. This allows the calculation of the build-up of the space charge of the electrons inside the trap, as well as the position and total numbers of electrons trapped. With this, one can determine the proportionality constant between the electrical current measured and the particle density in the VI. A comparison of the outcome of these simulations to own experimental findings and to results found in the literature is finally done...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} use a Tornado type <b>closed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> for {{creation}} of a source of mul-ticharged ions with plasma heating by microwave radiation. Plasma loss in closed traps is deter-mined by diffusion across the magnetic field, which increases substantially plasma confinement time {{as compared to the}} classical mirror trap [1]. We propose to extract ions with the aid of additional coils which partially destroy the closed structure of the magnetic lines in the trap, but don not influence the total confinement time. This allows for producing a controlled plasma flux that depends on the magnetic field of the additional coil. The Tornado trap also possesses merits such as an opportunity to produce high magnetic fields up to 3 T, which makes possible heating and confinement of plasma with a high density of electrons; plasma stability to magneto-hydrodynamic perturbations because the magnetic field structure corresponds to the "min B" configuration; and relatively low costs. All estimates and calculations were carried out for the Tornado 322 pulse installation [2]. The trap had the following parameters: maximal magnetic field 2. 8 T, trap diameter 350 mm, magnetic field pulse duration (halfwidth) 7 ms, and pulse repetition rate 0. 01. We propose a scenario of plasma heating using sequential switching on of two generators at the frequency of 2. 45 GHz for producing initial plasma and at the frequency of 30 GHz for its heating [3]. Ion distribution over charge states was calculated for Argon plasmas within the framework of a 0 -dimensional nonstationary set of differential equations for ionization balance, which took into account transverse plasma diffusion as well as recombination and charge exchange {{in the case of a}} uniform source of neutral gas. It is shown that, by the end of the magnetic field pulse, ion dis-tribution over charge states may reach a maximum at Ar+ 15 for the plasma density of 1013 cm- 3. To conclude, an ECR source of multicharged ions based on a Tornado type trap is a highly promising and feasible pulse source that may be fabricated in the near future...|$|E

40|$|We present {{studies on}} the {{modifications}} in temperature, number density and phase-space density when a laser cooled atom cloud from the optical molasses is trapped in a quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> Theoretically it is shown that for a given temperature {{and size of the}} cloud from the molasses, the phase-space density in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> first increases with magnetic field gradient and then decreases with it, after attaining a maximum value at an optimum value of magnetic field gradient. The experimentally measured variation in phase-space density in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> with the <b>magnetic</b> field gradient has shown the similar trend.

40|$|Quantum effects at {{motion of}} ultracold {{neutrons}} in a <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> are actively studied now. In particular, ”magnetic tube” traps [1] {{are used for}} investigation of such effects. According to [1], the periodic set of <b>magnetic</b> <b>traps</b> can be developed. Traps {{in the form of}} ”magnetic tube ” are used for focusing of atomic beams and described in details in [2] {{on the basis of the}} classic motion equations for a particle, possessing the magnetic moment, in a magnetic field. But quantum effects, which appear at neutron motion in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap,</b> can not be described by classic motion equations. The typical radius of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap,</b> which is being designed, is ρ ∼ 10 − 4 cm [1]. Thus, due to large wavelength (λ ∼ 10 − 5 ÷ 10 − 6 cm), motion of the ultracold neutron in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> in the direction, transversal to the axis of the magnetic tube, appears quantized. 1 Quantum effects were studied for neutron motion in a gravitational trap [3]. Neutron motion in such a trap is one-dimensional. But in contrast to [3], transversal motion of neutrons in the ”magnetic tube ” trap with respect to it axes is two-dimensional. As noted below, neutron motion in such a trap is determined by spinindependent effective potential energy, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength square. Thus, let us consider motion of the ultracold neutrons in the tubeshaped <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> The Schrödinger equation, which describes the ultracold neutron in such a trap, is as follows...|$|R
