50|$|As {{fungicides}} {{are largely}} ineffective, {{there are few}} options for managing Panama disease. <b>Chemical</b> <b>sterilisation</b> <b>of</b> the soil with methyl bromide significantly reduced incidence of the disease but {{was found to be}} effective for only three years after which the pathogen had recolonised the fumigated areas. Injecting the host plants with carbendazim and potassium phosphonate appears to provide some control but results have been inconclusive. Heat treatment of soil has also been tried in the Philippines but the pathogen is likely to reinvade the treated area. The greatest hope for managing this disease in infested soils is the development of genetic modifications that will provide resistant cultivars.Modified bananas developed in collaboration by Ugandan and Belgian scientists were reported in 2008 to be being grown experimentally in Uganda.|$|R

30|$|Currently, {{the major}} {{bottlenecks}} faced by industrial enzyme producers are low yield and high production cost. For instant, media {{used for the}} production of hydrolases such as lipase generally involve expensive complex carbon and nitrogen sources that are responsible for as much as 70 % raw material costs in extracellular enzyme fermentation (Jamrath et al. 2012). The exploitation of lignocelluloses materials including agroindustrial waste may hence serve as effective and cheap alternative in producing enzymes at appreciable level for commercial use. Furthermore, the use of agricultural residues for industrial purposes is more environmental friendly than other disposal methods commonly adopted nowadays. Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) has been grown in more than 85 countries worldwide with Indonesia, Philippines, India, Brazil and Sri Lanka being among the top producers (Siddiq 2012). Coconut dregs is basically a residue from coconut oil and milk processing plants. This lignocelluloses biomass is abundantly available at low or without cost and commonly used as fertiliser, animal feed or simply left to decay on the fields (Sulaiman et al. 2013). Nonetheless, the utilisation of this by-product has been recently extended to more refined applications including as a nutrient rich substrate for oyster mushroom cultivation (Vetayasuporn 2007) and biodiesel production (Sulaiman et al. 2013) owing to its high coconut oil content. The solid coconut waste from coconut milk extraction process was found to have up to 24 wt% oil content (Sarina et al. 2013). In addition, the coconut waste comprises high concentration of directly fermentable carbohydrates that can be converted into free sugar by a simple <b>chemical</b> pre-hydrolysis during <b>sterilisation</b> <b>of</b> the medium followed by enzymatic action of the bacteria during fermentation (Ding et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|The {{advantages}} of liposomes as delivery systems for peptide, protein and DNA vaccines is well-recognised, unfortunately their application has been stinted by their instability during storage and their limited shelf-life.

Work form our laboratory has investigated techniques {{that can be applied}} to particulate liposomal vaccines such that they can be prepared in a freeze-dried and sterile format. In this article, we describe techniques for the lyophilisation, cryoprotection and <b>sterilisation</b> <b>of</b> liposomal vaccines. Applying these methods allows for the retention of both the chemical integrity of the lipids and the key physico-chemical characteristics of the liposomes (e. g., particle size, zeta potential, and dynamic viscosity), thus supporting the enhanced transition of liposomal vaccines from the bench to the clinic. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|<b>Sterilisation</b> <b>of</b> parasites {{prevents}} host reproduction, thereby diverting host {{resources to}} their own benefit. Previous theory predicts that parasites should evolve maximum virulence, yet hosts are often incompletely sterilised. Whereas prior attempts to resolve this paradox have sought evolu-tionary explanations, we present theory and experiments showing that incomplete sterilisation can arise from ecologically driven fluctuations in parasite load. The African ant–plant Acacia drepa-nolobium reproduced more when occupied by small colonies of the sterilising symbiont Crematog-aster nigriceps. In nature, small colonies result from interference competition between ant colonies; these territorial conflicts thus provide intermittent windows of opportunity for host reproduction. Our mean-field model shows that numerical insufficiency of parasites can produce partial <b>sterilisation</b> <b>of</b> host populations, creating the appearance of reduced virulence even if ants have evolved to sterilise completely. This general framework helps explain both the apparent ubiq-uity <b>of</b> partial <b>sterilisation</b> parasitism {{and the ability of}} these symbiotic associations to persist...|$|R
