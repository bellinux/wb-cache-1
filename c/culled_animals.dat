40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to analyse the {{importance}} of longevity {{in relation to the}} welfare of production animals. I hypothesize that the concept of longevity helps to support the moral intuition that premature <b>culling</b> of <b>animals</b> is a moral wrong. The analysis shows that the interpretation of the concept of animal welfare is important for decisions on whether or not to <b>cull</b> <b>animals,</b> but also for the measures that should be taken to prevent premature culling. This is illustrated by two examples in animal production, one example relating to dairy cattle and the other to breeding sows. These two types of farming have in common that in these practices animals are necessary to produce products, yet this production does not require– the animal itself to be killed. My proposal is to accept the view on animal welfare according to which longevity is accepted as an independent moral argument. Acceptance of this view substantiates the intuition that premature <b>culling</b> of <b>animals</b> is a moral wrong, because it shows that we have additional reasons to give the interests of animals more weight. In order to respect this view, some common practices in animal farming will become the subject of debate, as illustrated in the two cases...|$|R

The main objective {{was to create a}} genetic model that is most appropriate to describe the longevity data. Survival analysis, using piecewise Weibull proportional hazards model, used all information on the length of productive life including censored as well as uncensored observations. Linear models considered <b>culled</b> <b>animals</b> only. The relative milk production within herd had a highest impact on cows’ longevity. In comparison of estimated genetic parameters among methods, survival analysis yielded higher heritability value (0. 075) than linear sire (0. 037) and linear animal model (0. 056). When linear models were used, genetic trend of Simmental bulls for longevity was slightly increasing over the years, unlike a decreasing trend in case of survival analysis methodology. Average reliability of bulls’ breeding values was higher in case of survival analysis. The rank correlations between survival analysis and linear models bulls’ breeding values for longevity were ranged between 0. 44 and 0. 46 implying huge differences in ranking of sires. ...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{cellular}} automata model, we simulate the British Government Policy (BGP) in the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in Great Britain. When clinical {{symptoms of the}} disease appeared on a farm, there is mandatory slaughter (culling) of all livestock on an infected premise (IP). Those farms that neighbor an IP (contiguous premise, CP), are also culled, aka nearest neighbor interaction. Farms where the disease may be prevalent from animal, human, vehicle or airborne transmission (dangerous contact, DC), are additionally culled, aka next-to-nearest neighbor iteractions and lightning factor. The resulting mathematical model possesses a phase transition, whereupon if the physical disease transmission kernel exceeds a critical value, catastrophic loss of animals ensues. The non-local disease transport probability can be as low as. 01 % per day and the disease can {{still be in the}} high mortality phase. We show that the fundamental equation for sustainable disease transport is the criticality equation for neutron fission cascade.

40|$|The Lesotho cattle {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} overstocking, range degradation, low marketed offtake, low fertility, and high mortality. The overstocking situation is paradoxically accompanied by an ownership pattern which leaves many households with an insufficient number of cattle for draught purposes, and the abscence of a large commercial beef sector.

Culling and yield records of 2617 animals during years 2000 - 2010 were evaluated. The effects of year, parity and milk yield classes on ratios of culling reasons were analyzed.

The proportions of <b>culled</b> <b>animals</b> were due mainly to involuntary culling (85. 8 %) with small proportion of voluntary culling (14. 2 %).

40|$|Preparing for and {{responding}} to outbreaks of serious livestock infectious diseases are critical measures to safeguard animal health, public health, and food supply. Almost all of the current control strategies are empirical, and mass culling or "stamping out" is frequently the principal strategy for controlling epidemics. However, there are ethical, ecological, and economic reasons to consider less drastic control strategies. Here we use modeling to quantitatively study the efficacy of different control measures for viral outbreaks, where the infectiousness, transmissibility and death rate of animals commonly depends on their viral load. We develop a broad theoretical framework for exploring and understanding this heterogeneity. The model includes both direct transmission from infectious animals and indirect transmission from an environmental reservoir. We then incorporate a large variety of control measures, including vaccination, antivirals, isolation, environmental disinfection, and several forms of culling, which may result in fewer <b>culled</b> <b>animals.</b> We provide explicit formulae for the basic reproduction number, R 0, for each intervention and for combinations.

Testes from eland (Taurotragus oryx) were collected and epididymides removed and maintained at 4 °C. Sperm motility, viability, morphology and membrane integrity were examined at 12 h intervals for 108 h. Sperm motility and viability were significantly lower {{at the end of the}} experiment than at the start (P < 0. 05) and there was individual variation in the rate at which motility and viability declined. The total number of normal sperm decreased significantly with prolonged storage at 4 °C. Midpiece defects were the most common and head and tail abnormalities were rare. A significant decrease in acrosomal and nuclear membrane integrity was observed with prolonged cold storage but there was no significant change in cell membrane integrity. However, about 30 % of epididymal sperm survived for 3 days at 4 °C and more than 10 % survived for 4 days, and it should be possible to use sperm from <b>culled</b> <b>animals</b> in some assisted reproductive technologies...|$|E

Sub-par or <b>cull</b> <b>animals</b> from other breeding goals (laboratory, exhibition/show, wool, pet) may also be used for meat (particularly in smallholder operations). However, dwarf breeds are rarely primarily used for meat production, due to the small size, slow growth, and low numbers of offspring per litter.

A semi-parametric analysis- for which the baseline hazard function is completely unspecified (Cox's regession) - showed that the assumption of proportional hazards is appropriate, that all the effects in the model are highly significant and that the baseline hazard function can be closely approximated by a Weibull hazard function of the form A(t) • Ap (At) P- 1.

Body and fur inspections indicated that 88. 4 % of the animals were infested {{with at least one}} of the following ectoparasite categories: lice (76. 0 %), ticks (57. 5 %) and fleas (19. 7 %). Nevertheless, the number of parasites was low, in average 2. 6 fleas, 4. 8 ticks and/or 17. 1 lice per infested animal. No significant intersexual and age-related differences (adults vs subadults, adults vs young) were found as concerns prevalence and abundance of ectoparasites. The lower, and more constant infection by fleas in the course of the year, is concordant with the hypothesis which proposes that badgers frequently switch sleeping places in order to avoid a build up of ectoparasites in the nest material. It remains unclear whether the low loads of ticks and lice recorded in both low and high density badger populations are due to the efficiency of auto- and allo-grooming in this species, to frequent replacement or aeration of the bedding material by individual badgers, or to another, yet to be discovered mechanism. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these results are therefore indicative of a limited role of Eurasian badgers as a potential reservoir of diseases transmitted by ectoparasites...|$|E

Simulations were performed to evaluate the applicability of such a statistical model to the collected data. As expected, ARR heterozygote sheep were less at risk of becoming infected than ARQ/ARQ individuals and had a greater age at clinical onset. Conversely, when compared with ARQ/ARQ, the VRQ haplotype was associated with an increased infection risk, but not a shorter incubation period. Considering the flock effect, we observed that a high incidence rate was not associated with shorter incubation periods and that the incubation period could be significantly different in flocks harbouring similar infection risks. These results strongly support the conclusion that other parameters, such as the nature of the agent or flock management, could interfere with epidemiological dynamics of the infection in scrapie-affected flocks...|$|E
