Although it is considered that Ag presentation may persist at high levels during chronic infections, we have previously reported that in mice infected with bacillus Calmette-Gu 9 rin, Ag presentation gets drastically <b>curtailed</b> during <b>the</b> chronic <b>stage</b> of infection despite antigenic persistence. In this report we evaluated the mechanism of this curtailment. Ag presentation declined precipitously as the T cell response developed, and Ag presentation was not curtailed in mice that were deficient in CD 8 + T cells or MHC class II, suggesting that T cells regulate Ag presentation. Curtailment of Ag presentation was reduced in IFN-y-deficient mice, but not in mice with a deficiency/mutation in inducible NOS 2, perforin, or Fas ligand. In hosts with no T cells (Rag 1 -/-), Ag presentation was not <b>curtailed</b> during <b>the</b> chronic <b>stage</b> of infection. However, adoptive transfer of wild-type, but not IFN-?-/-, CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells into Rag 1 -deficient hosts strongly curtailed Ag presentation. Increased persistence of Ag presentation in IFN-y-deficient hosts correlated to increased survival of dendritic cells, but not of macrophages, and was not due to increased stimulatory capacity of IFN-y-deficient dendritic cells. These results reveal a novel mechanism indicating how IFN-y prevents the persistence of Ag presentation, thereby preventing memory T cells from going into exhaustion...|$|R
