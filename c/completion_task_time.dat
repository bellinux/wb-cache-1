30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  9, the overall {{distribution}} of <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> in three cases is consistent although the <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> of ten subjects is slightly different. The guidance force will shorten the <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> in both two scenarios. In the case of the virtual robot scenario, <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> was reduced by 15.3 % at most and 8 % on average with 2  N guidance force compared with no guidance force. When 4  N guidance force was available, <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> was shortened by 20.3 % at most and 12.7 % on average. In the ball tracking scenario, <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> reduction was 10.77 % at most and 6.7 % on average with 2  N guidance force compared with no guidance force. When 4  N guide force was available, <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> was shortened by 16.60 % at most and 10.6 % on average. The result indicates that the guidance force can give the operator helpful hint to improve the operation efficiency and to shorten the <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time.</b> Although <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> is averagely shortened with 4  N guide force compared with 2  N guide force, further experiments should be carried out to study the optimal guidance force for different subjects and different tasks.|$|R

The proposed method is evaluated with the rearrangement problem of twenty movable objects, Comparison of the goal configuration with respect to the demanded <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> is shown in Fig. 2. The goal state is changed depending on the demanded time, which consists of the time for offline planning, that for online planning and that for task execution only. Balancing among the three classes is made adequately depending on the demanded time. The time for offline planning is very short (almost reactive) when the demanded <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> is short, and the ratio of the time for offline planning becomes large with respect to the realized <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> when the <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> is long.

40|$|User satisfaction, though {{difficult}} to measure, {{is the main}} goal of Information Retrieval (IR) systems. In recent years, as Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) systems have become increasingly popular, user effectiveness also has become critical in evaluating IIR systems. However, existing measures in IR evaluation are not particularly suitable for gauging user satisfaction and user effectiveness. In this paper, we propose two new measures to evaluate IIR systems, the Normalized <b>Task</b> <b>Completion</b> <b>Time</b> (NT) and the Normalized User Effectiveness (NUE). The two measures overcome limitations of existing measures and are efficient to calculate in {{that they do not}} need a large pool of search tasks. A user study was conducted to investigate the relationships between the two measures and the user satisfaction and effectiveness of a given IR system. The learning effects described by NT, NUE, and the <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> were also studied and compared. The results show that NT is strongly correlated with user satisfaction, NUE is a better indicator of system effectiveness than <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time,</b> and both new measures are superior to <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> in describing the learning effect of the given IR system. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Several factors extending the learning curve of laparoscopy include ergonomic and technical difficulties, such as the fulcrum effect and limited degrees of freedom. This study aimed to establish the impact of four variables on performance of two simulated laparoscopic tasks. Methods: Six subjects including novice (n= 2), intermediate (n= 2) and expert surgeons completed two tasks: 1) four running sutures, 2) simple suture followed by surgeon&#x 2032;s knot plus four square knots. Task variables were suturing angle (left/right), needle holder type (standard/articulating) and visualisation (2 D/ 3 D). Each task with a given set of variables was completed twice in random order. The endpoints included suturing <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time,</b> average and maximum distance from marks and knot tying <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time.</b> Results: Suturing <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> was prolonged by 45 -degree right angle suturing, articulating needle holder use and lower skill levels (all P &# 60; 0. 0001). Accuracy also decreased with articulating needle holder use (both P &# 60; 0. 0001). 3 D vision affected only maximum distance (P = 0. 0108). For the knot tying <b>task,</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> was greater with 45 -degree right angle suturing (P = 0. 0015), articulating needle holder use (P &# 60; 0. 0001), 3 D vision (P = 0. 0014) and novice skill level (P = 0. 0003).

40|$|The most of load {{balancing}} algorithms for heterogeneous computing system (HCS) is complicated design which compromises between the conflicting goals of <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time,</b> matching proximity (best mapping of task and nodes) and system utilization.

The proposed global scheduler (GS) {{load balancing}} algorithm eliminates the above weakness in adaptive distributed fashion by considering the following factors: (i) the number of non-faulty nodes with their <b>task</b> arrival and <b>completion</b> rates (ii) the relative computational powers of each node (iii) best mapping of tasks to the nodes and (iv) the expected average <b>task</b> <b>completion</b> <b>time</b> (EATCT).

The balancing instance is pre-defined by user and EATCT is calculated using the mathematical approximation method.

This paper compares results from a simulator [3] and an on-road [4] study to investigate whether motion simulation is a behaviourally valid tool for studying the impact of vehicle motion of the use of touch screen BMS. The studies examined the impact of “normal” and “high” levels of vehicle motion across a range of touch screen Battle Management System (BMS) task types (e. g. reading, writing, panning and zooming, and drawing).
