40|$|The new beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist <b>cicloprolol</b> {{acts as a}} {{beta-agonist}} at normal {{levels and}} as a beta-antagonist at high levels of adrenergic discharge. Treatment with <b>cicloprolol</b> should protect the heart against excessive stimulation, while providing a baseline level of sympathetic drive. The clinical interest of such a profile is, however, not yet established in heart failure. Accordingly {{this study examined the}} safety of oral <b>cicloprolol,</b> a step necessary before undertaking efficacy comparison with other compounds recently proposed to treat heart failure. Twenty-five patients were studied. <b>Cicloprolol</b> was given once a day for 2 weeks in a crossover double-blind placebo-controlled design. Follow-ups were obtained at baseline {{and at the end of}} each period. At baseline all patients had clear evidence of heart failure. <b>Cicloprolol</b> did not affect resting heart rate and blood pressure, but it reduced significantly peak exercise heart rate and peak rate-pressure product. The effect was especially significant in patients with sinus rhythm. The drug did not induce bradycardia or arrhythmias. Resting and exercise ejection rate were not affected. <b>Cicloprolol</b> improved the quality of life and the work capacity of 5 of 12 patients with congestive failure due to ischemic etiology. Side effects were few and similar with placebo and <b>cicloprolol.</b> Thus, short-term administration of <b>cicloprolol</b> is safe in moderate heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Two oral {{doses of}} <b>cicloprolol</b> (50 mg and 100 mg), a beta 1 -adrenoceptor partial agonist, were {{administered}} to nine healthy volunteers in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and exercise heart rate were reduced while the resting heart rate and blood pressure remained unchanged. The responses to the two different doses of <b>cicloprolol</b> were similar...|$|E
40|$|An anaesthetised dog {{preparation}} {{was used}} to examine the pharmacological profiles of xamoterol, <b>cicloprolol,</b> prenalterol and pindolol. The effects of these agents on heart rate and hind limb perfusion pressure revealed that xamoterol is highly cardioselective and has no significant agonist activity at Î² 2 -receptors and no membrane stabilising effect. These pharmacological properties are not complicated by the formation of active metabolites and may explain the clinical benefits in the long-term treatment of heart failure...|$|E
