5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling <b>castor</b> <b>beans,</b> which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E

The experiment consisted of the cultivation of <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> &# 8216;BRS Energia&# 8217; in a monocrop system and intercropped with peanut &# 8216;BR 1 &# 8217;.

The <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> photosynthetic and carboxylation efficiencies {{were higher in the}} intercrop system with a 25 -day interval between sowings. Peanut sowing at 0 to 10 days after <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> sowing in the intercropped system affected the photochemical efficiency of the latter, which resulted in its yield reduction.

5|$|Though Green was {{caring for}} Farrar {{in the family}} home while he {{recovered}} from his repeated bouts of illness, she was also continuing to drink heavily and, increasingly often, claiming to be contemplating suicide or to want Margaret Hacker dead. In late September, Farrar searched the house and her belongings. In her purse, he discovered seed packets labeled as <b>castor</b> <b>beans,</b> {{a copy of a}} supposedly-anonymous letter that had been sent to Farrar urging him to not divorce Green, and empty vials of potassium chloride.

Medical evidence was presented that Farrar's illness had not fit neatly within the parameters of any known disease, but that its presentation matched the symptoms of ricin poisoning. An FBI criminologist provided testimony that he had tested for ricin antibodies in Farrar's blood approximately two months after Farrar's last acute symptoms, and found antibodies there in such large amounts that he could confidently state that Farrar had been subjected to repeated exposures to ricin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> (Ricinus communis L.), a {{monotypic}} {{species in}} the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae, 2 n = 20), is an important non-edible oilseed crop widely cultivated in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate countries for its high economic value. Because of {{the high level of}} ricinoleic acid (over 85 %) in its seed oil, the <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> seed derivatives are often used in aviation oil, lubricants, nylon, dyes, inks, soaps, adhesive and biodiesel. Due to lack of efficient molecular markers, {{little is known about the}} population genetic diversity and the genetic relationships among <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> germplasm. Efficient and robust molecular markers are increasingly needed for breeding and improving varieties in <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> The advent of modern genomics has produced large amounts of publicly available DNA sequence data. In particular, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide valuable resources to develop gene-associated SSR markers. Results In total, 18, 928 publicly available non-redundant <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> EST sequences, representing approximately 17. 03 Mb, were evaluated and 7732 SSR sites in 5, 122 ESTs were identified by data mining. <b>Castor</b> <b>bean</b> exhibited considerably high frequency of EST-SSRs. We developed and characterized 118 polymorphic EST-SSR markers from 379 primer pairs flanking repeats by screening 24 <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> samples collected from different countries. A total of 350 alleles were identified from 118 polymorphic SSR loci, ranging from 2 - 6 per locus (A) with an average of 2. 97. The EST-SSR markers developed displayed moderate gene diversity (H e) with an average of 0. 41. Genetic relationships among 24 germplasms were investigated using the genotypes of 350 alleles, showing geographic pattern of genotypes across genetic diversity centers of <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> Conclusion <b>Castor</b> <b>bean</b> EST sequences exhibited considerably high frequency of SSR sites, and were rich resources for developing EST-SSR markers. These EST-SSR markers would be particularly useful for both genetic mapping and population structure analysis, facilitating breeding and crop improvement of <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Castor</b> <b>bean</b> is an {{important}} oil-producing plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its high-quality oil contains up to 90 % of the unusual fatty acid ricinoleate, which has many industrial and medical applications. <b>Castor</b> <b>bean</b> seeds also contain ricin, a highly toxic Type 2 ribosome-inactivating protein, which has gained relevance in recent years due to biosafety concerns. In order to gain knowledge on global genetic diversity in <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> and to ultimately help the development of breeding and forensic tools, we carried out an extensive chloroplast sequence diversity analysis. Taking advantage of the recently published genome sequence of <b>castor</b> <b>bean,</b> we assembled the chloroplast and mitochondrion genomes extracting selected reads from the available whole genome shotgun reads.

40|$|BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small RNAs that post-transcriptionally {{regulate}} {{gene expression}} and play essential roles in numerous developmental and physiological processes. Currently, little {{information on the}} transcriptome and tissue-specific expression of miRNAs {{is available in the}} model non-edible oilseed crop <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> (Ricinus communis L.), {{one of the most important}} non-edible oilseed crops cultivated worldwide. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed the identification of conserved and novel miRNAs in many plant species. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technologies to identify and characterize the miRNAs in <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> RESULTS: Five small RNA libraries were constructed for deep sequencing from root tips, leaves, developing seeds (at the initial stage, seed 1; and at the fast oil accumulation stage, seed 2) and endosperms in <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> High-throughput sequencing generated a large number of sequence reads of small RNAs in this study. In total, 86 conserved miRNAs were identified, including 63 known and 23 newly identified. Sixteen miRNA isoform variants in length were found from the conserved miRNAs of <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> MiRNAs displayed diverse organ-specific expression levels among five libraries. Combined with criteria for miRNA annotation and a RT-PCR approach, 72 novel miRNAs and their potential precursors were annotated and 20 miRNAs newly identified were validated. In addition, new target candidates for miRNAs newly identified in this study were proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The current study presents the first high-throughput small RNA sequencing study performed in <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> to identify its miRNA population. It characterizes and increases the number of miRNAs and their isoforms identified in <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> The miRNA expression analysis provides a foundation for understanding <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> miRNA organ-specific expression patterns.
