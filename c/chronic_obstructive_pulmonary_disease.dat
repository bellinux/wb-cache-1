The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease,</b> interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
40|$|The serine proteinase {{inhibitor}} alpha- 1 anti-trypsin (AAT) provides an antiprotease protective screen throughout the body. Mutations in the AAT gene (SERPINA 1) {{that lead to}} deficiency in AAT are associated with <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases.</b> The Z mutation encodes a misfolded variant of AAT that is not secreted effectively and accumulates intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and other AAT-producing cells. Until recently, {{it was thought that}} loss of antiprotease function was the major cause of ZAAT-related lung disease. However, the contribution of gain-of-function effects is now being recognized. Here we describe how both loss- and gain-of-function effects can contribute to ZAAT-related lung disease. In addition, we explore how SERPINA 1 heterozygosity could contribute to smoking-induced <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> and consider the consequences...|$|R

5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also {{correlates}} with disease prognosis. Increased levels of Hsp90A {{are found in}} leukemia, breast and pancreatic cancers {{as well as in}} patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease.</b> Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} and <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This {{limits the}} amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
50|$|Hypoxic hypoxia is {{a result}} of {{insufficient}} oxygen available to the lungs. A blocked airway, a drowning or a reduction in partial pressure (high altitude above 10,000 feet) are examples of how lungs can be deprived of oxygen. Some medical examples are abnormal pulmonary function or respiratory obstruction. Hypoxic hypoxia is seen in patients suffering from <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> (COPD), neuromuscular diseases or interstitial lung disease.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Smokers {{are prone}} to develop <b>Chronic</b> <b>Obstructive</b> <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Diseases</b> (COPD) than non-smokers. <b>Chronic</b> <b>Obstructive</b> <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Diseases</b> (COPD) {{includes}} <b>chronic</b> bronchitis, bronchial Asthma, and emphysema. Pulmonary function test is a routine procedure for assessment and monitoring diseases. OBJECTIVE To estimate the Pulmonary function test like Forced Vital Capacity(FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in one second(FEV₁), FEV₁/FVC ratio and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) among smokers and non-smokers. Also, to study the effect of age and body mass index (BMI) on the pulmonary function of these groups of people. MATERIAL AND METHOD It is a cross sectional study. The study was conducted among students and staff of Silchar Medical College and Hospital 121 subjects were selected, among them 60 were smokers and 61 non-smokers. Spirometric tests were carried out to assess pulmonary function. EXCLUSIONS CRITERIA Subjects having cardio <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases.</b> RESULT Mean FVC, FEV₁ and PEFR {{were found to be}} of lower value in smokers than non-smokers. There were significant differences between mean spirometric values among smokers and non-smokers. CONCLUSION Pulmonary function declines in smokers. ...|$|R
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effects of low {{molecular}} weight heparin on the function of blood coagulation and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-毩 (TNF-毩), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), C-reactive protein (CRP) of patients with acute exacerbations of <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> and respiratory failure. Methods: A total of 80 patients with acute exacerbations of <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> and respiratory failure in our hospital from June 2014 to October 2016 were enrolled in this study. The subjects were divided into the control group (n= 40) and the treatment group (n= 40) randomly. The control group were treated with conventional treatment, the treatment group were treated with the conventional treatment combined with low molecular weight heparin. The two groups were treated for 7 d. The D-dimer (D-D), fibrinogen (FBG), pro thrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), TNF-α, CK-MB and CRP of the two groups before and after treatment were compared. Results: There were no significantly differences of the blood levels of D-D, FBG, PT and TT of the two groups before treatment. After treatment, the blood levels of D-D and FBG of the two groups were significantly lower than before treatment, and that of the treatment group were significantly lower than the control group, the PT and TT of the two groups were significantly higher than before treatment, and that of the treatment group were significantly higher than the control group. There were no significantly differences of the serum levels of the TNF-α, CK-MB and CRP of the two groups before treatment. After treatment, the serum levels of the TNF-α, CKMB and CRP of the two groups were significantly lower than before treatment, and that of the treatment group were significantly lower than the control group. Conclusion: Low molecular weight heparin can significantly reduce the inflammatory factors of the patients with acute exacerbations of <b>chronic</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> and respiratory failure, can alleviath the patients conditions and reduce the myocardial damage...|$|R
