5|$|The IUCN has {{recommended}} co-operation between countries across the cheetah's range to minimise {{the conflict between}} cheetahs and human beings. A 2016 study showed that ecotourism can have a significantly {{positive impact on the}} conservation of the cheetah. Although the requirement of space for the habitat would have to be compromised in most cases, establishment of private reserves for cheetahs and ensuring the absence of predators and poachers could be a successful <b>conservation</b> <b>measure.</b> Additionally, the financial benefits accrued and the awareness generated can further aid the cause of the cheetah. At the same time, the animals should not be unnecessarily handled or disturbed, as cheetahs are particularly sensitive to human interference.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{sea otter}} populations became so depleted, {{commercial}} hunting {{was no longer}} viable. It had stopped the Aleutian Islands, by 1808, as a <b>conservation</b> <b>measure</b> imposed by the Russian-American Company. Further restrictions were ordered by the Company in 1834. When Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, the Alaska population had recovered to over 100,000, but Americans resumed hunting and quickly extirpated the sea otter again. Prices rose as the species became rare. During the 1880s, a pelt brought $105 to $165 in the London market, but by 1903, a pelt could be {{worth as much as}} $1,125. In 1911, Russia, Japan, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States signed the Treaty for the Preservation and Protection of Fur Seals, imposing a moratorium on the harvesting of sea otters. So few remained, perhaps only 1,000â€“2,000 individuals in the wild, that many believed the species would become extinct.|$|E
5|$|SOS Puffin is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and {{progress has been made in}} cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another <b>conservation</b> <b>measure</b> undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E
40|$|The EU Habitats Directive {{provides}} in Annexes II and IV a list {{of species}} needing to be conserved. Member States have implemented a variety of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> {{in response to this}} obligation. These measures include the rejection, modification or delay of land development plans, payments for landowners to perform <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> and management actions such as breeding programmes. The costs of the various <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> are not always apparent. There may be an underestimation of the resulting costs when land development plans are altered, because there is no visible flow of financial resources. Such a biased perception may result in selecting <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> with high but less visible costs, whereas <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> with low but more visible costs are neglected. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribute to avoiding a biased selection of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> by presenting a framework which captures a broad variety of costs relevant to the conservation of species protected by the Habitats Directive. We also demonstrate the relevance of a biased selection of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> by using the framework to empirically estimate the costs of protecting the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) in the region of Mannheim, Germany. We find that the less visible costs of changes in development plans are significantly higher than the more visible costs of payments to landowners and management actions. This result suggests that measures with visible costs should be given more attention in the future.

40|$|AbstractLoss {{of natural}} forests and decline in forest {{biodiversity}} {{has led to}} several policy initiatives in recent years. Despite this, the importance of smaller set-asides vs forest reserves for <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the importance of three different area-based <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> commonly used in north-European forests; retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest nature reserves. We did this for two contrasting ecological systems; fungi in late-decay spruce logs and beetles in early-decay aspen snags. Eight replicated sites {{for each of the}} three <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> were investigated in a total of four boreal forest landscapes in south-Norway. Fungi were surveyed on existent late-decay spruce logs in two landscapes, and beetles trapped on experimentally added aspen dead-wood units in three landscapes. Richness and species composition were analyzed separately for specialist and generalist species. We found larger differences in species composition between <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> for old-growth fungi specialists than generalists, although species richness patterns were less clear. The main contrast was found between nature reserves and retention patches. On the other hand, specialist beetles associated with early-decay aspen showed no difference between set-asides. The assemblage of aspen generalist beetles tended to be richest in the woodland key habitats and showed clear differences between the <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> There was considerable variation in response to <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> between landscapes, related to quality of the set-asides. Species specialized to an ephemeral, early-decay system were able to utilize such substrates in all of the <b>conservation</b> <b>measures,</b> while the smaller and more modified set-asides could not cater for the specialists dependent on stable, late-decay systems. Species with broader habitat demands in general responded to all <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> We conclude that retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest reserves fill complementary functions for wood-living species in boreal forest and should all be part of future forest conservation strategies...|$|R

Public support and acceptance of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> seems urgent to reach national and international conservation goals. This project analyses the psychological factors behind public acceptance of biodiversity <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> In an empirical study, perceptual and emotional responses to three types of broadleaf deciduous forests with different vegetation structure and species composition are studied. These responses, as measured by EEG and questionnaires, are related to acceptance of management and <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> for the biotopes...|$|R
25|$|The lagoon is a {{designated}} bass nursery area, and the species are frequently seen on an underwater camera {{connected to the}} Chesil Beach Visitor Centre. As such angling for the fish is only permitted in the lower Fleet area, from the Narrows to Ferrybridge and only from the shore. However this has also been discouraged by the Southern-IFCA (Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority) as a <b>conservation</b> <b>measure.</b> A shallow draft boat, named the Fleet Observer, featuring a transparent bottom, takes visitors around the lower Fleet to observe the wildlife {{above and below the}} water.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions, in the Canadian {{province}} of Manitoba, for example, catch and release is mandatory for some {{species such as}} brook trout. Many of the jurisdictions which mandate the live release of sport fish also {{require the use of}} artificial lures and barbless hooks to minimise the chance of injury to fish. Mandatory catch and release also exists in the Republic of Ireland where it was introduced as a <b>conservation</b> <b>measure</b> to prevent the decline of Atlantic salmon stocks on some rivers. In Switzerland, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and was banned in September 2008.|$|E
25|$|This stork may be {{especially}} vulnerable in the llanos of Venezuela. Its population declined strongly there in recent past decades starting from 1977 and less than 5000 individuals were estimated {{to live in this}} region through most of the 1980s. A potentially effective conservation strategy to help protect this stork's natural habitat in the llanos is the expansion and maintenance of cattle ranches in the savanna grassland matrix in preference to crop cultivation; because such ranches are similar in vegetation structure to natural grasslands. Another potentially useful <b>conservation</b> <b>measure</b> is the deployment of artificial nesting platforms to encourage nesting of maguari storks, as has been done for the white stork in Europe. Despite its relatively unthreatened overall status, the maguari stork should deserve closer global population monitoring to better safeguard it from future potential large-scale declines across its entire range.|$|E
