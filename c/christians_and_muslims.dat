5000|$|According to its constitution, Nigeria is {{a secular}} country. [...] The Constitution forbids the {{establishment}} of a state religion and guarantees the right to freedom of religion. Nigeria has a population roughly split in half, between Christians predominantly in the South <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> in the North, and with a minority population of traditional religion worshippers. [...] Despite the clear provisions in the Constitution, Nigerian public holidays honor <b>Christian</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslim</b> feast days, but not holidays of any other religion. The government subsidizes only <b>Christian</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslim</b> pilgrimages <b>and</b> allows <b>Christian</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslim</b> religious education in schools.|$|R
5|$|While castles {{were used}} to hold a site and control {{movement}} of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified. Castle architecture in the East became more complex around the late 12th and early 13thcenturies after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189–1192). Both <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> created fortifications, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a {{great number}} of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of the}} church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims,</b> who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E
5|$|The name of Calafia {{was likely}} formed from the Arabic word khalifa (religious state leader) {{which is known}} as caliph in English and califa in Spanish. Similarly, the name of Calafia's monarchy, California, likely {{originated}} from the same root, fabricated by the author to remind the 16th-century Spanish reader of the reconquista, a centuries-long fight between <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> which had recently concluded in Spain. The character of Calafia is used by Rodríguez de Montalvo to portray the superiority of chivalry in which the attractive virgin queen is conquered, converted to Christian beliefs and married off. The book was very popular for many decades—Hernán Cortés read it—and it was selected by author Miguel de Cervantes as {{the first of many}} popular and assumed harmful books to be burnt by characters in his famous novel Don Quixote.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} sizeable Tamil-speaking populations descended from colonial-era migrants in Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Mauritius, South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, and Vietnam. A large community of Pakistani Tamils speakers exists in Karachi, Pakistan, which includes Tamil-speaking Hindus {{as well as}} <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> – including some Tamil-speaking Muslim refugees from Sri Lanka. Many in Réunion, Guyana, Fiji, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago have Tamil origins, but {{only a small number}} speak the language. In Reunion where the Tamil language was forbidden to be learnt and used in public space by France it is now being relearnt by students and adults. It is also used by groups of migrants from Sri Lanka and India, Canada (especially Toronto), United States (especially New Jersey and New York City), Australia, many Middle Eastern countries, and some European countries.|$|E
5|$|During the Norman reign, several {{different}} religious communities coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. They were: Latin Christians (Roman Catholics), Greek-speaking Christians (Eastern Orthodox), Muslims and Jews. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, {{the fact that}} Latin Christians were in power tended to favor Latin Christianity (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Eastern Orthodox rite were obliged to recognize {{the claims of the}} Latin Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local emirs. Greek-speaking Christians, Latin <b>Christians,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other's lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Christians living in an Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names. In many cities, each religious community had its own administrative and judicial order. In Palermo, Muslims were allowed to publicly call for prayer in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by qadis, judges who ruled in accordance with Islamic law.|$|E
5|$|Drought {{conditions}} between 1175 and 1180 {{prompted the}} Crusaders {{to sign a}} two-year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the 1180s, raids by <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> into each other's territory became more frequent. In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, ravaging the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, and once he retreated the Hospitallers were able to revitalize their damaged lands. The Battle of Hattin in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders: Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the True Cross, a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards Saladin ordered {{the execution of the}} captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states. After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of Belmont, Belvoir, and Bethgibelin fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli. In May 1188 Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of Margat, which he also failed to capture.|$|E
