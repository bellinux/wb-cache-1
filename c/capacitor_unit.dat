This thesis presents a multiphysics model of a HVDC Light <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit</b> simulating electric currents and heat transfer under the conditions of a thermal stability test. A <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit</b> consists of capacitor elements made of metallized films with large difference in scales. To overcome this, a multiscale approach {{have been used to}} model the <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit.</b> Effective properties and losses are computed on a small scale (several layers of metallized film) and utilized on a large scale (<b>capacitor</b> <b>unit).</b> The performed calculations yield the impedance of the <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit</b> corresponding to the rated impedance with the effective properties implemented.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 86 - 88. The use of shunt {{capacitor}} bank equipment is essential if a utility wishes {{to control the}} flow of reactive power effectively. The most significant results stemming from this will be lower losses on the system and an increased power transfer capability. Thus {{it is important that}} the methods used to protect a {{shunt capacitor}} bank will ensure that the bank is available when required. While the more common shunt capacitor problems are related to <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit</b> failures, conditions such as bank over currents, surge voltages and harmonics can cause extended undesired conditions. Today's protection methods are able to remove a shunt capacitor bank from service before extensive damage is done, although the location of the faulty capacitor units will not be known (if this was in fact the reason for the protection tripping the bank). This thesis explores the subject of improving the protection of high-voltage shunt capacitor banks, specifically with respect to the detection of unhealthy fuseless capacitor units. An extensive literature search was carried out on the theory pertaining to the protection of shunt capacitor banks, and a model of a fuse less shunt capacitor bank was built in the laboratory to better understand the failing process of an element within a <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit.</b> The changes in the capacitor unit's current and voltage profiles, as well as those of the remaining healthy capacitor units, were monitored as an element failure was simulated (whereby the element forms a solid weld, or short circuit). Stemming from these experiments, it was found that where a bank consists of strings of units with no interconnection between the units of different strings, an element failure in a <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit</b> would cause a significant decrease in voltage across the affected unit. This voltage change could be used to identify when elements are failing in capacitor units, and the location of the unhealthy unit could also be determined. One potential method would be to have capacitor units with built-in voltage transformers attached across each element section in the unit. As element failures occur either send this information to ground level, where it can be read by a microprocessor relay device, or have a display on the outside of the <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit.</b> In the case of the change in unit current, it was found to be very small and thus had no function for detecting unhealthy capacitor units...|$|E

40|$|The {{viability}} of fixed type power capacitors for loss reduction in low voltage (400 V) distribution networks of power utilities was studied. Usually, reactive {{power of the}} load is compensated at high voltage levels by utility operators, which requires high investment on equipment. This study reveals an alternative low cost reactive power compensation method, which will reduce the capacity requirements of HV reactive power installations. Fixed type power capacitors had been used at the secondary of few of earlier 11 kV/ 415 V distribution transformers in Colombo City distribution system. Most of these units are in operation, even after 20 years of service. But the practice of having fixed capacitors at distribution transformers was not continued thereafter. It was identified through model simulation and field measurements that installation of fixed value power capacitors at feeder pillars of the power distribution network is more economical compared to the earlier practice in Colombo City. The expected minimum energy saving is approximately 300 kWh/month with a 40 kvar, 440 V rated capacitor installed at the feeder pillar. The main advantages of the proposal are low capital requirement and shorter payback period. The expected maximum payback period is 7 months. In the proposed method, the temperature of operation of capacitors was more critical. The reliability of capacitors is to ensure by adapting measures to reduce the operating temperature of capacitor units, housed in steel enclosures. Encloses, housing capacitor units reduces the case temperature of capacitors. This arrangement was superior {{to the use of}} outdoor type capacitors without enclosures. Use of light coloured enclosure with holes for ventilation and thermal insulation will reduce the temperature of operation of <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit</b> at least by 10 oC, compared to dark green finished enclosure with louvers for ventilation and without thermal insulation on the internal surface. Field measurements confirmed that the lifetime of capacitors are not affected due to load harmonics. The maximum harmonic current absorbed by capacitors was 50 % lower than the continuous over current rating of the <b>capacitor</b> <b>unit.</b> The simulation of the model with different fixed capacitor sizes shows that there is no risk that transformers would fall into resonance along with fixed capacitors under the toed harmonics due to the selected size of capacitors and level of load harmonics. The voltage rise due to fixed type capacitors at no load condition is insignificant for the sizes of capacitors proposed in this study, Hence there is no risk that the power transformers would not fall into ferroresonance due to fixed capacitors. Practical difficulties of usage of LV fixed type capacitors were identified and solutions were recommended so that a cluster of fixed value shunt capacitors can be installed and operated effectively at low voltage distribution level for achieving greater economical benefits...|$|E
