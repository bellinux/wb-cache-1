5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that as few as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to get started presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E
5|$|In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco {{encountered}} {{bad weather}} {{on its way}} from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish ships {{would be allowed to}} visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court.|$|E

On July 18, Walker ordered Dean to hold Taejon until July 20 so that the US 1st Cavalry Division and US 25th Infantry Division <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> defensive lines along the Naktong River, forming the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{function}} delegated by a public authority is crucial in determining whether such delegation offends the law. Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v. Race Relations Board, ex parte Selvarajan (1975), it was accepted that the Board <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> a committee in order to investigate and conduct preliminary inquiries, {{and that it was}} not practical for the whole body to be engaged in such a task. On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the campaign was {{the defeat of the}} approximately 40,000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as Viet Cong) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where Vietnamese communist forces <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, it sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the {{deregulation of the}} market in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition, since no new airlines <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, some rebels {{took over}} a {{civilian}} hospital; subsequently stormed by government soldiers, the rebels were rounded up, tortured and 22 were executed without trial. Those that had escaped, including Fidel and Raúl, assembled at their base where some debated surrender, while others wished to flee to Havana. Accompanied by 19 comrades, Castro decided to set out for Gran Piedra in the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains several miles to the north, where they <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> a guerrilla base. In response to the Moncada attack, Batista's government proclaimed martial law, ordering a violent crackdown on dissent and imposing strict censorship of the media. Propaganda broadcast misinformation about the event, claiming that the rebels were communists who had killed hospital patients. Despite this censorship, news and photographs soon spread of the army's use of torture and summary executions in Oriente, causing widespread public and some governmental disapproval.|$|E
5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s {{saw a few}} {{potsherds}} of Arikamedu site {{displayed in}} the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making {{their way down the}} hill to meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> their identity, but not hit. American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment quickly discovered the bodies of the American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound behind their backs.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{gathered}} 165 revolutionaries for the mission, ordering {{his troops}} not to cause bloodshed unless they met armed resistance. The attack {{took place on}} July 26, 1953, but ran into trouble; 3 of the 16 cars that had set out from Santiago failed to get there. Reaching the barracks, the alarm was raised, {{with most of the}} rebels pinned down by machine gun fire. 4 were killed before Castro ordered a retreat. The rebels suffered 6 fatalities and 15 other casualties, whilst the army suffered 19 dead and 27 wounded. Meanwhile, some rebels took over a civilian hospital; subsequently stormed by government soldiers, the rebels were rounded up, tortured and 22 were executed without trial.

5|$|In {{the time}} after myth, most gods {{were said to}} be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, their homes in the human world. There they {{inhabited}} the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They <b>could</b> <b>establish</b> themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god Montu and then Amun—to national prominence.|$|E
