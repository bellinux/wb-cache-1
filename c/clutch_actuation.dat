A breadboard electronic version complete with sensor amplifiers and large control modules consumed the entire back end of a station wagon.

40|$|Passive-dynamic walking robots are {{remarkable}} mechanical devices {{capable of}} maintaining dynamically stable walking gaits with no actuation or control. These systems, however, depend on ideal environmental conditions for stability. Robustness and control capabilities are increased with actuation, {{but so is}} the power consumption. Such actuated robots are designed to minimize the actuation requirement by exploiting the system natural dynamics system, but still need actuation to compensate for energy dissipated by friction and collision events, as well as for more control capabilities. A simple clutch mechanism is developed for such systems to allow intermittent control of otherwise passive joints, allowing controllers to exploit the passive or actuated control when desired. The clutch is tested on a hip actuated simple 3 D walker to evaluate the performance capabilities of clutched control. Preliminary tests of several control strategies suggest the <b>clutched</b> <b>actuation</b> may provide good performance at a higher efficiency compared to fully actuated systems.

[...] Some have criticized the PowerShift's rough starts and lack of smooth shifting, but Ford has continually released (but not publicized) upgrades, also known as under the table fixes, to transmission software and firmware designed to address these failures.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{increasing}} amount {{of greenhouse gases}} and diminishing of the existing petroleum minerals for future generations, has led the automotive companies to think of producing vehicles with less emissions and fuel consumption. For this purpose, Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) have emerged in the recent decades. HEVs with different configurations have been introduced by engineers. The simulation platform aim for a parallel HEV, where the intention {{is to reduce the}} emissions and fuel consumption. The simulation platform includes an Electric Motor (EM) in addition to an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). A new transmission system is modeled which is compatible with parallel configuration for the HEV, where the inertial effects of the gearbox, clutch and driveline is formulated. The transmission system includes a gearbox which is equipped with synchronizers for smooth change of gears. The HEV is controlled by a rule based controller together with an optimization algorithm as power management strategy in order to have optimal fuel consumption. Using the rule based controller, the HEV is planned to be launched by EM {{in order to have a}} downsized clutch and ICE. The clutch modeling is the main focus of this study, where the slipping mechanism is considered in the simulation. In the driveline model, the flexibility effects of the propeller shaft and drive shaft is simulated, so that the model can capture the torsional vibrations of the driveline. The objective of modeling such a system is to reduce emissions and fuel consumption with the same performance of the conventional vehicle. To achieve this goal first a conventional vehicle is modeled and subsequently, a hybrid vehicle is modeled and finally the characteristics of the two simulated models are studied and compared with each other. Using the simulation platform, the state of charge (SOC) of the battery, oscillations of propeller shaft and drive shaft, <b>clutch</b> <b>actuations</b> and couplings, energy dissipated by the clutch, torques provided by EM and ICE, fuel consumptions, emissions and calculation time are calculated and investigated.

50|$|A racing {{wheel is}} a method of control for use in racing video games, racing simulators, and driving simulators. They are usually {{packaged}} with a large paddle styled as a steering wheel, along {{with a set of}} pedals for gas, brake, and sometimes <b>clutch</b> <b>actuation,</b> as well as various shifter controls. An analog wheel and pedal set such as this allows the user to accurately manipulate steering angle and pedal control that is required to properly manage a simulated car, as opposed to digital control such as a keyboard.

Racing wheels have been developed for use with arcade games, game consoles, personal computers, and also for professional driving simulators for race drivers.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the XT {{was built}} in 600 {{different}} variants which, however, usually only look different. The most important change of the XT 600 which had only been using a kick starter was in 1990; the 600 E XT was presented as a new model with a more contemporary design, chrome-plated steel wheel instead of aluminum wheels, now without a tachometer, with the exhaust as the supporting frame member, a 13.9-liter tank and an electric starter. In addition, the oil tank, which was previously located under the left side cover, was moved forward behind the steering head between the frame and girder bridge. Due to high demand, the XT 600 K, which featured a kick starter, but was otherwise structurally identical to the XT 600 E model, {{was introduced to the}} market; the series ran until 1995. Due to more stringent emissions requirements, the power of the XT 600 E, which had become the only available model, was reduced by 4 kW to , and a tachometer was reintegrated in the cockpit. The <b>clutch</b> <b>actuation</b> on the engine body was moved from the left to the right side, and the muffler was no longer part of the rear frame. The reliability of the XT unit was not harmed, as mileages of over 100,000 km and unopened motor are not uncommon.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design, construction, and {{evaluation}} of a prototype two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interface, which takes advantage of Magneto-Rheological Fluid (MRF) based <b>clutches</b> for <b>actuation.</b> Haptic information provides important cues in teleoperated systems and enables the user to feel the interaction with a remote or virtual environment during teleoperation. The two main objectives in designing a haptic interface are stability and transparency. Indeed, deficiencies in these factors in haptics-enabled telerobotic systems has the introduction of haptics in medical environments where safety and reliability are prime considerations. An actuator with poor dynamics, high inertia, large size, and heavy weight can significantly undermine the stability and transparency of a teleoperated system. In this work, {{the potential benefits of}} MRF-based actuators to the field of haptics in medical applications are studied. Devices developed with such fluids are known to possess superior mechanical characteristics over conventional servo systems. These characteristics significantly contribute to improved stability and transparency of haptic devices. This idea is evaluated and verified through both theoretical and experimental points of view. The design of a small-scale MRF-based clutch, suitable for a multi-DOF haptic interface, is discussed and its performance is compared with conventional servo systems. This design is developed into four prototype clutches. In addition, a closed-loop torque control strategy is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme comes from the magnetic field acquired from embedded Hall sensors in the clutch. The controller uses this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior using an estimated model, based on Artificial Neural Networks. Such a control strategy eliminates the need for torque sensors for providing feedback signals. The performance of the developed design and the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control techniques are experimentally validated. Next, a 2 -DOF haptic interface based on a distributed antagonistic configuration of MRF-based clutches is constructed for a class of medical applications. This device is incorporated in a master-slave teleoperation setup that is used for applications involving needle insertion and soft-tissue palpation. Phantom and in vitro animal tissue were used to assess the performance of the haptic interface. The results show a great potential of MRF-based actuators for integration in haptic devices for medical interventions that require reliable, safe, accurate, highly transparent, and stable force reflection...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids {{devices are}} widely studied {{and used for}} various purposes. Among these MR fluids devices, the MR {{actuator}} has attracted increasing attention for last two decades. An MR actuator is usually made of an active component (motor) and MR clutches. Compared with the regular actuators, the MR actuator features compliance due {{to the existence of}} MR fluids, which is commonly consider as benefits at the aspect of safety. On the other hand, the MR actuator has advantages on controllable bandwidth, torque-mass and torque-inertia ratios compared with the other compliant actuators. In this study, a new closed-loop, Field-Programable-Gate-Array (FPGA) based control scheme to linearize an MR clutch 2 ̆ 7 s input-output relationship is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme is the magnetic field acquired from hall sensors within the MR clutch. The FPGA board uses this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior of the MR clutch using an estimated model of the clutch magnetic field. The local use of an FPGA board will dramatically simplify the use of MR <b>clutches</b> for torque <b>actuation.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated using an experimental platform that includes an MR clutch as part of a compliant actuation mechanism. The results clearly demonstrate that the use of the FPGA based closed-loop control scheme can effectively eliminate hysteretic behaviors of the MR clutch, allowing to have linear actuators with predictable behaviors. Moreover, a novel optimization design of MR clutches is proposed. Based on the optimization, the characteristics of MR clutches in three common configurations are discussed and compared. People can select suitable configuration of MR clutch before design. Lastly, a lightweight mobile robot is developed by using MR actuators. This mobile robot also has large driving force and can stop at any positions without running the motor...|$|R
40|$|Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has rapidly gained {{widespread}} utilization as an {{imaging device}} and micro/nano-manipulator during recent years. This thesis investigates the new {{concept of a}} dual stiffness scanning probe with respect to biological applications and determines the resulting requirements for the scanning of soft bio samples, such as low-pressure contact. On this basis, an in-plane AFM probe that is specifically tailored {{to the needs of}} biological applications is developed. It features a variable stiffness, which makes the stiffness of the probe adjustable to the surface hardness of the sample, and a very low overall stiffness, which is needed in order to achieve high resolution imaging. The switchable stiffness probe allows the scanning of biological samples with varying surface hardness without changing probes during scanning, and therefore prevents a loss of positional information, as is unavoidable with conventional devices. For the integration of the components into a MEMS device, the conventional cantilever-type design of AFM probes has been abandoned in favor of an in-plane design. The new design has an advantage in that it facilitates a high-density array of AFM probes and allows for easy surface micromachining of the integrated device. It also enables the future integration of micro-fluidic channels for reagent delivery and nanopipetting. For the scanning of nano-scale trenches and grooves, a multi-walled carbon nanotube, embedded in a nanopellet, is planned as a high-aspect-ratio tip. The variable stiffness is accomplished in a mechanical way by engaging or disengaging auxiliary beams to the compliant beam structure by means of electrostatically actuated <b>clutches.</b> (cont.) For <b>actuation,</b> an electrostatic combdrive is considered to move the probe tip up and down. The vertical displacement of the tip can be measured by a capacitive sensor, which can easily be integrated into the system. A scaled-up proof-of-concept model is manufactured with surface-micromachining processes. The clutch performance is successfully tested and the dual stiffness concept is verified by measuring the stiffness of the device with the clutches engaged and disengaged. by Clemens T.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper presents an investigation of the driveline torsional vibration behaviour, referred to as judder, which takes place during the clutch engagement process, particularly on small trucks with diesel engines. A non-linear multibody dynamic model of the clutch mechanism is employed to study the effect of various clutch system and driveline components on the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuation</b> performance. The paper demonstrates that judder is affected by driveline inertial changes, variation in the coefficient of friction, μ, of the friction disc linings with slip speed, v, and the loss of clamp load.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The suitability of electromagnetic actuating devices for application to machines with ever more demanding response time specifications is discussed, with the proposal that piezoelectric actuator technology can produce practical devices with faster response times than solenoids, for example. This thesis discusses and validates {{the proposition that the}} performance of piezoelectric ceramic actuators makes them viable devices for inclusion in high-speed machine applications, where rapid <b>clutching</b> using two-state <b>actuation</b> is required. Further, techniques are devised and explored for the design and application of these devices using displacement amplifying structures, which lead to the utilisation of engineering methods of relatively low precision. This is highly advantageous as to date, the piezoelectric multilayer actuator has usually been associated with high precision engineering. Applications of piezoelectric ceramic technology are reviewed, and the mechanical and electrical properties of these materials are discussed. Literature covering applications of piezoelectric actuators in relation to clutches, motors and positioners is also reviewed. This data search revealed many devices or systems where the displacement amplification of piezoelectric actuators was exploited in some way, but failed to show any devices where the high efficiency of these amplifying structures was either primary or even necessarily achieved. Indeed, it was concluded that in the absence of such applications or methodologies, a fruitful area of research might be to explore these methodologies. This work is a core element of this thesis. Using two basic topologies, devices producing efficient transformation of high-force, small movement two-state actuation, to larger movement with lower force, have been designed (using flexural hinge methods), manufactured, tested and analyzed. Hydraulic transformers have been briefly investigated and ultimately rejected on the grounds of comparative complexity. For any displacement amplifying or transforming device, applications for these systems are widely varying, but criteria for advantageous employment of the piezoelectric approach, as opposed to electromagnetic, are established. Design techniques which are partially analytical and partially experiential are proposed, which in practice exhibit adeptness for producing well-optimised designs. These methods are incorporated into special purpose structure-designer computer programs. Several design examples are detailed, and their performance analyzed in comparison with the modelling techniques and design program predictions. The application of these displacement amplifiers is discussed by example, to two discrete motion machines, both of which have been designed specifically to demonstrate the possibilities of using piezoelectric technology to regulate discrete motion drives. It is shown that the speed of response of the devices is such, that the concept of zero-velocity clutching with the intention of minimising wear, is feasible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Drivers are {{becoming}} more fatigued and uncomfortable as traffic densities increase, and so, can show slower reaction time. They then face the danger of traffic accidents due to their inability to cope with frequent shifting. To reduce this risk, some drivers prefer automatic transmissions to manual transmissions. However, automatic transmission requires both higher fuel consumptions and costs. For this reason, attention to automated manual transmission that can provide high efficiency, low cost and easy manufacturability has been increasing. In addition, the function and performance of the electronic control unit of automobiles has improved continually and rapidly with the growing electronics technology. The ECU is a representative embedded system in automobiles, which has to satisfy high performance and reliability under the constraints of size and cost.

Strict design specifications were defined with reference to available room, torque transmission, absence of axial loads and fail-safe operation. A magnetorheological clutch with permanent magnets was conceived to fulfil the technical requirements. Different clutch geometries were compared with particular reference to the fail-safe operation and torque capabilities.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 A {{feasibility}} and practicality {{study was}} made of an automotive-type surface vehicle that employed a centralized or unitized means of control. The control functions consisted of: steering, acceleration, deceleration, <b>clutch</b> <b>actuation,</b> gear changes, turn signal operation and horn actuation. These controls were arranged {{in such a manner}} that the driver used only his right hand and arm to effect total vehicle operation and control. The study was accomplished by three avenues of approach. They area (1) "historical", (2) analytical, (3) experimental. For the historical analysis, a survey of similar existing systems with their particular advantages and disadvantages was completed. The analytical portion took the form of an analog simulation of the steering response to a given input, The experimental aspects of the study dealt with both quantitative and qualitative information in that a test vehicle was constructed, instrumented and tested for steering response, sensitivity, stability, response time, and control transfer functions. The qualitative portion was achieved by utilizing different operators, (some of whom were physically handicapped) to evaluate the vehicle's handling characteristics and overall system acceptability. The control system concept demonstrated its feasibility, practicality and desirability by successful operation, quantitative testing and driver evaluation. Major advantages of this system concern improvements in the following areas: (1) Safety; more maneuverability, shorter response time, no distraction of remote switches, unimpaired view of instrument panel, crash protection, and reliable mechanical system.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2011. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Professor Zongxuan Sun. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvii, 239 pages, appendix p. 218 - 220. This thesis focuses on investigating the design, modeling and control methodologies, which can enable smooth and energy efficient power transmission for conventional, hybrid and future automotive propulsion systems. The fundamental {{requirements of the}} modern power transmission system are: (1). It {{should be able to}} shift the torque transmission ratio efficiently and smoothly to enable the fuel efficient operation of the power source. (2). It should be able to reject/damp out the power source torque oscillation in an energy saving fashion to avoid rough torque transfer to the driveline. Critical factors determining the successful power transmission include the appropriate control of the power transfer key components (clutches), the optimal power transmission coordination with the automotive driveline system, and the capability to smooth out the power source input oscillation in a fuel efficient fashion. To meet these resolutions, this thesis will investigate the enabling design and control methodologies for power transmission in three levels: the fundamental clutch level, the intermediate driveline level, and the entire propulsion system level. First, the clutch level design is investigated in two categories: open loop control and closed loop control. For the open loop, two key issues are addressed. One is to ensure the consistent initial condition with optimal valve structure design, and the other is the clutch fill process optimization using a customized dynamic programming with reduced computational cost for stiff hydraulic system. For the closed loop control case, the solutions are further divided into two groups. One is to enable feedback with pressure sensor measurement, and the other is to close the control loop without any sensor. Through experiments, both methods are shown to enable precise, fast and robust <b>clutch</b> <b>actuation.</b> Second, the driveline level design considers optimizing the power transmission coordination with the driveline. Optimal conditions to achieve efficient and smooth torque transfer are formulated. The nonlinear optimization is then solved using the Dynamic Programming. Finally, in the propulsion system level, the engine start/stop torque oscillation rejection problem for hybrid vehicle and future advanced combustion system is discussed. Through proper formulation, this problem can be treated as disturbance rejection for a linear parameter varying (LPV) system under the internal model principle. To experimentally implement {{the state of the art}} controller design, two problems should be solved. First, the vibration signal is periodic with changing magnitude, whose generating dynamics has not been studied before and needs to be derived. Second, the current linear time varying internal model control is lack of robustness, and the design method of a low order yet robust internal model stabilizer is still unavailable. This thesis proposes promising approaches to address this fundamental bottleneck issue in the time varying internal model control theory, which is one of the key contributions in this thesis. The proposed stabilizer synthesis method is treated in a general form, and can potentially be applied to other applications beyond the automotive field as well. Experimental results are also shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In summary, the contributions of this thesis span from the control applications to the fundamental control theory. Application wise, this thesis formulates the smooth and efficient power transmission design and control problem in three levels, and proposes design, dynamics analysis and control methodologies to address the critical challenges in each level respectively. For control theory, a robust and low order stabilizer synthesis method is proposed to enable reference tracking/disturbance rejection based on linear time varying internal model principle. This stabilizer design addresses one of the most critical issues in the linear time varying internal model control synthesis, which facilitates experimental investigation of the internal model controller in the LTV setting...|$|E
