5000|$|A small {{positive}} current applied {{to one of}} the two contacts had an influence on the current which flowed between the other contact and the base upon which the block of germanium was mounted. In fact, a small change in the first <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> caused a greater change in the second <b>contact</b> <b>current,</b> thus it was an amplifier. The first contact is the [...] "emitter" [...] and the second contact is the [...] "collector". The low-current input terminal into the point-contact transistor is the emitter, while the output high current terminals are the base and collector. This differs from the later type of bipolar junction transistor invented in 1951 that operates as transistors still do, with the low current input terminal as the base and the two high current output terminals are the emitter and collector.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} switch, the <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> (unrelated to the coil current) must not exceed a given value to avoid damage. In high-inductance {{circuits}} such as motors, other issues must be addressed. When an inductance {{is connected to}} a power source, an input surge current or electromotor starting current larger than the steady-state current exists. When the circuit is broken, the current cannot change instantaneously, which creates a potentially damaging arc across the separating contacts.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an improved method of modeling <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> {{distribution in the}} quasi-static and full-wave surface integral equation solver FastImp [1]. A significant shortcoming of FastImp is its lack of a single uniform approach to model <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> across different frequencies. Its method of computing <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> at high frequencies does not efficiently and optimally capture skin and proximity effects. Its method of computing <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> at low frequencies lacks accuracy due {{to the use of}} a centroid collocation scheme when evaluating fields on the contact surfaces. The method discussed in this thesis offers a unified, more accurate and more efficient method of computing <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> over a wide range of frequencies. It is shown in this thesis that the electric field on the conductor contact surfaces can be modeled effectively by only a few conduction modes as basis functions. These conduction modes were first introduced in [2] for a "volume " integral equation solver. In this thesis, we improved these basis functions and adapted them into a "surface" integral equation solver. On the non-contact surfaces, the electric field is modeled b...|$|E

40|$|As {{integrated}} circuits operate at increasingly higher speed, methods {{are needed to}} handle wideband quasi-static and full wave EM analysis of distributed RLC impedances for package and on-chip interconnects. One particular solver {{that is capable of}} this type of analysis is a surface-based integral solver called FastImp. This talk will present a method that addresses many issues currently plaguing FastImp. A significant shortcoming of FastImp is its lack of a single uniform approach to model <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> over a wide range of frequencies. In addition, FastImp's handling of <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> at high frequencies cannot optimally and efficiently capture skin effects and proximity effects while its handling of <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> at low frequencies lacks accuracy due to its use of a centroid-collocation scheme. The method discussed in this talk addresses the above difficulties by offering a unified mean of computing <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> over a wide range of frequencies. It will be shown that the electric field on the conductor contact surfaces can be modeled accurately and efficiently by only a few “partitioned” surface-based conduction modes as basis functions. The electric field on the non-contact surface of the conductor is modeled by a set of standard piecewise constant basis functions. The conduction mode basis functions, used in a Galerkin technique, and the piecewise constant basis functions, used in a collocation scheme, are utilized for the discretization of the integral formulation in FastImp. Examples will demonstrate the improvements on accuracy, efficiency and consistency of our method. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|E

40|$|Considering single-meson photo- and electroproduction off a baryon, it {{is shown}} how to restore local gauge {{invariance}} that {{was broken by}} replacing standard Feynman-type meson exchange in the t-channel by exchange of a Regge trajectory. This is achieved by constructing a <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> whose four-divergence cancels the gauge-invariance-violating contributions resulting from all states above the base state on the Regge trajectory. To illustrate the procedure, modifications necessary for the process γ +p → K^+ + Σ^* 0 are discussed in some detail.

The experimental measurement of this constant would give valuable information on the P odd πNN constant and on the s-quark content of nucleons. We calculate also in the same limit m_π→ 0 the deuteron P odd and T odd multipoles: electric dipole moment and magnetic quadrupole moment.

40|$|Exposure to <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> {{may occur}} when the body is in contact with two {{conductive}} surfaces with different electrical potentials. To date, no published data that describe such exposures or electrical conditions that may predispose to such exposures exist. Our investigation into <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> exposure included (i) {{a small sample of}} workers in a garment production facility with modern well-grounded equipment performing normal work tasks and (ii) a single individual simulating garment production tasks in a sewing machine repair facility with substandard equipment grounding. In both cases, we deployed a newly developed personal monitor that records <b>contact</b> <b>current</b> events at the power frequency of 60 Hz. The personal monitoring data suggested that more frequent exposure occurs in association with, and probably because of, poorer grounding practices. This preliminary conclusion was validated with controlled laboratory measurements of potentials to reference ground on specific locations of four sewing machines with different grounding characteristics. Propensity to exposure was greater in the two machines with inferior grounding characteristics, and increased in the other two when deprived of their grounding connections. Contact currents at or below threshold-of-perception levels can produce electric fields within tissues that may plausibly produce biological effects. On this basis, such exposures have been under-investigated relative to the far greater attention accorded to occupational electric and magnetic fields...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{discuss the}} effect of out-of-plane excess carrier density {{variations}} on <b>contact</b> recombination <b>currents</b> extracted from quasi steady state photoconductance (QSSPC) measurements on a dedicated test structure. The test structure features lattices of point contacts. The contacts are thick and non-transparent. Therefore, asymmetric test structures are generally used to ensure a homogeneous in-plane generation rate. As a result, the QSSPC measurements are relatively prone to out-of-plane excess carrier density variations. Their effect on the extracted contact recombination characteristic is discussed theoretically and the theory is confirmed by experiment. The resulting framework contributes to the set of design rules and best practices for <b>contact</b> recombination <b>current</b> characterization using QSSPC measurements on point contact lattice based test structures...|$|R
