5000|$|A {{draw-works}} is {{the primary}} hoisting machinery that is a component of a rotary drilling rig. Its main function {{is to provide a}} means of raising and lowering the traveling blocks. The wire-rope drilling line winds on the drawworks drum and extends to the <b>crown</b> <b>block</b> and traveling blocks, allowing the drill string to be moved up and down as the drum turns. The segment of drilling line from the draw-works to the <b>crown</b> <b>block</b> is called the [...] "fast line". The drilling line then enters the sheaves of the <b>crown</b> <b>block</b> and it makes several passes between the <b>crown</b> <b>block</b> and traveling block pulleys for mechanical advantage. The line then exits the last sheave on the <b>crown</b> <b>block</b> and is fastened to a derrick leg {{on the other side of}} the rig floor. This section of drilling line is called the [...] "dead line".|$|E

50|$|Capt. Anthony Francis Lucas, an {{experienced}} mining engineer and salt driller, drilled a well to find oil at Spindletop Hill. On {{the morning of}} January 10, 1901, the little hill south of Beaumont, Texas began to tremble and mud bubbled up over the rotary table. A low rumbling sound came from underground, and then, with a force that shot 6 tons of 4-inch (100 mm) diameter pipe out {{over the top of}} the derrick, knocking off the <b>crown</b> <b>block,</b> the Lucas Gusher roared in and the Spindletop oil field was born.

50|$|Starting in the 1920s, {{the works}} had the {{following}} divisions: blast furnaces; a coking plant; steelworks; rolling mills; a foundry; a forge; a factory for bridges and metal structures; a factory for mounted wheels; an old machine factory; a factory for petroleum extraction equipment; an armaments factory; a factory for electric machinery; and a locomotives factory with {{a capacity of}} 100 units per year. Among the main products generated were steam locomotives, including repairs; mounted wheels, including axles; wheel bandages, metal bridges, railroad switches and other rail equipment; metal frames for buildings and factories; moveable bridges; electric machinery and equipment such as motors, generators and transformers; petroleum extraction equipment, including pumpjacks, couplings, heavy drill bits, pump units, rotary engine parts, <b>crown</b> <b>blocks</b> and gear reducers; and armaments, such as artillery, gun carriages, 75 mm Vickers antitank and antiaircraft guns; coastal artillery; naval mines; and Brandt 60 and 120 mm LR Gun-mortars. In terms of revenue and number of employees, the company was the largest in Romania, with the latter figure reaching 22,892 in 1948. In 1939, following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Nazi regime took over Československá Zbrojovka's one-tenth share in Reșița.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{existence}} of the Archaic phase of the Temple of Zeus in the Labraunda Sanctuary. Previously, the earlier temple in antis was brought to light by the technical details which were discussed by Hellström and Thieme. Then Thieme published a short article about the architectural elements from the sanctuary and made much clear the connection of the ar-chitectural elements and the temple in antis. In spite of these studies the existence and the con-struction date of the temple in antis is still controversial. It is aimed in this paper to investigate all the evidences including previous research, existing remains, architectural elements and historical sources for the earlier temple. For this scope, not only the published ones but also some new un-published architectural fragments will be fully investigated and dated by the previously dated paral-lel examples. The architectural fragments consist of a column drum with 36 flutes, a column neck fragment, an Ionic capital fragment, 2 complete and 6 fragments of the <b>crown</b> <b>blocks</b> and 8 dentil blocks. Although, the architectural fragments, except the Ionic capital, are suggested very strongly as belonging to the Archaic temple of Zeus Labraundos, the historical sources for the temple is lacking: the terms hieron used by Herodotus and xoanon by Strabo are strong evidence for the ex-istence of the temple. This investigation suggests that all the evidence indicate that there was a temple to Zeus Labraundos from the late Archaic period and that was enlarged during the Heka-tomnid dynasty...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to API 4 F, SR EN ISO 14693 : 2004, {{the action}} of wind as a hurricane, with a speed of 120 km/h, {{represents}} a special load the drilling masts, which {{are a part of}} the drilling rigs, are submitted to. By their construction, the masts are multiple statically indetermined structures, made of many welded ends beams, and are designed as a component of the hoisting system, having some main purposes as supporting devices as the <b>crown</b> <b>block</b> at the top, the crane, the rotary swivel etc and providing support for the drill pipes to be stacked vertically during the round trips operations. In the present paper was analyzed, from this point of view, a drilling mast prototype made of rectangular pipes, rated for a maximum hook load of 300 kN. The authors calculated the wind pressures, in accordance with the formulae specified in the standards, and introduced this special loading as a distributed load, firstly on the transversal direction of the mast and then on the longitudinal direction, with respect to the spatial reference system attached to the analyzed mast. Using the Finite Element Method, the nodes displacements and mast’s elements stress were determined. The most important obtained values of the displacements and stress were graphically shown and commented and, also, interesting conclusions are presented concerning the drilling mast resistance in specific conditions that occur in case of the wind action as a hurricane, as a premiere contribution for this new design of mast...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Drilling, {{the act of}} {{creating}} a hole by removing material with a drill gloss tool is also {{carried out in the}} petroleum industry, but this is done {{with the aid of a}} drilling rig for the creation of a wellbore (hole) with the sole aim of the recovery of petroleum resources(oil and gas in this case). The drilling rig which is used to carry out this drilling operation is divided into 5 (five) systems they include: •	Hoisting system: This is the part of the drilling rig the helps increment in the wellbore depth they includes the hoisting tower structure i. e. the mast and derrick, the substructure, the draw works(hoist), the derrick line and its accessories and finally the travelling and <b>crown</b> <b>block.</b> •	Circulating system: This is the path in which mud and cuttings pass through during the drilling process so as to enhance a better rate of penetration (ROP) by suspension of cuttings ensuring that bit cuts a fresh surface while rotating, they include the stand pipe, Kelly hose, the drill stem, the annulus, the mud return line, the shale shaker, the mud pit. •	Rotary system: This system aids in the rotary action which aids drilling, ensuring a better rate of penetration (ROP), they include the swivel, Kelly, rotary drive and rotary table •	Power system: This system provides all the necessary power to carry out the drilling work; this is basically the Gen set and any other power generating equipment. •	Well control and monitoring system: this system basically helps to monitor the drilling operation, drilling a well is very dangerous, because the pressure in the reservoir could be significant high, which normally about couple thousands psi. The main part of this system is the blowout preventer(BOP) Drilling operation on the rig is carried out with the aid of drilling mud, the need for drilling mud in drilling operation cannot be over emphasized, and some of the uses of drilling mud include: •	Suspension/removal of cuttings from well, •	Control formation pressure, •	Seal permeable formations, •	Maintain wellbore stability, •	Minimize formation damage, •	Cool, lubricate, and support the bit and drilling assembly, •	Transmit hydraulic energy to tools and bit, •	Ensure adequate formation evaluation, •	Prevent inflow of formation fluid thereby preventing a kick, etc But the properties of drilling mud is dependent on the formation parameters, a drilling mud with a density of 8. 5 ppg despite being the API standard can’t be used to drill a formation of 10 ppg else caving in of the wellbore would occur thereby causing destruction of equipments, waste of time, and the need for a remedial operation such as sidetracking to be done which would require more funds for the operation, therefore the drilling mud used at any depth should be dependent of formation conditions at that depth. The properties of the drilling mud can be altered via the use of drilling mud additives, depending on the property needed to be increased. The mud weight/density can be increased to meet the well depth condition with the addition of weighter, example of a weighters include Haematite, Barite, etc these additives would help increase the mud weight to the needed weight, likewise, if the PH of our drilling mud needs to be increased in a case where by we are drilling through an acidic formation, additives which increase the ph of mud (PH Enhancers) can be used, examples of PH enhancers are potassium hydroxide(KOH), Sodium Hydroxide(NAOH), etc, there are also other parameters of drilling mud that can be altered such as viscosity, filtration, Gel strength etc...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Dental caries {{occurs as}} a result of demineralization-remineralization phases {{occurring}} alternately at the tooth surface. Fluoride varnishes have a caries-inhibiting effect on teeth through remineralization. The resulting enamel is resistant to acid dissolution. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess enamel surface microhardness (SMH) following varnish application with different fluoride concentrations. Materials and Methods: Ninety freshly extracted, caries-free premolar teeth were used. Teeth were sectioned to obtain enamel blocks from the buccal surface of <b>crown.</b> The <b>blocks</b> were serially polished and flattened, embedded in acrylic blocks and smoothened to achieve a flat surface. The samples were divided into three groups, namely, A, B, and C consisting of 30 enamel blocks each. In Group A, Fluor Protector® varnish and in Group B, Bi-Fluorid 10 ® varnish was applied. Group C served as controls. All samples were subjected to a demineralization-remineralization cycle for 7 days. The SMH of enamel was measured. Data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using the Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results: The mean values of enamel SMH of Groups A and B were 496. 99 ± 4. 81 and 449. 47 ± 7. 37 Vickers Hardness Number, respectively.

Lachmann analyzed the interactions of conflict at the national level (between the Crown, the Church and the magnates), and at the local level (between commercial farmers, landowners and tenants). During the Reformation, Henry VIII dealt a crushing blow to the church, secularized monastic lands and confiscated church property. Trying not to let the land, alienated from the Church, fell into the hands of magnates, the Crown limited their local power. This strengthened the gentry, who privatized common lands and extinguished tenant rights in order to <b>block</b> <b>crown</b> efforts to reclaim agrarian lands, power and income. The inadvertent results of these political maneuvers were the formation of a large landless class and an agrarian revolution that provided the resources for industrial capitalism.|$|R

60|$|Freetown lies upon {{a gentle}} declivity, a slope of {{laterite}} and diluvium washed {{down from the}} higher levels. The ground is good for drainage, but the soft and friable soil readily absorbs the deluging torrents of rain, and as readily returns them to {{the air in the}} shape of noxious vapours. The shape is triangular. The apex is 'Tower Hill,' so named from a ruined martello, supposed to have been built by the Dutch, and till lately used for stores. The barracks, which lodge one of the West India regiments, are six large <b>blocks</b> <b>crowning</b> the hill-crest and girt with a low and loopholed wall. In winter, or rather in the December summer, the slopes are clad in fine golden stubbles, the only spectacle of the kind which this part of the coast affords. Though not more than four hundred feet or so above sea-level, the barracks are free from yellow fever; and in the years when the harbour-town has been almost depopulated the only fatal cases were those brought up from below. Moreover, the disease did not spread. The officers' quarters, with cool and lofty rooms, twenty feet high, are surrounded by shady and airy piazzas or verandahs, where the wind, when there is any, must find its way. For many years they had jalousies and half-windows instead of glass, which forced the inmates to sit in outer darkness during tornadoes and the Rains. The garrison, like the town, owes an eternal debt of gratitude to Governor J. Pope Henessy. Seeing the main want of Sá Leone, he canalised in 1872, with the good aid of Mr. Engineer Jenkins, a fine fountain rising below 'Heddle's Farm,' enabling the barracks to have a swimming-bath and the townsfolk to lay on, through smaller pipes, a fair supply of filtered water. For this alone he amply deserves a statue; but colonies, like republics, are rarely grateful.|$|R

One of the famous traditional medicinedrinks in Indonesia is “kunyit asam”. People was make it with mixed both Curcuma domestica Val and Tamarindus indica L. Beside it has many advantages for health such as increasing stamina, {{it also has a}} good taste, so many people consumed it. However, the acid content in this drink maycause enamel erosion. Therefore the aim of this present study is to determine thein vitro effect of “kunyit asam” solution towards microhardness and roughness of human enamel tooth. The pH of solutionwas measure using a digital pH meter, while the calcium content measure using the Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). This study used 40 permanent maxillary first incisor that has been extracted from the patient who came to dental polyclinic of hospitals in Polewali Mandar regency, West Sulawesi Province during February 2015 -April 2015 period. The roots of the teeth were removed at the cementoenamel junction. Tooth <b>crowns</b> placed on <b>blocks</b> orthoplast with labial surface facing up. Samples were randomly divided into 2 groups equally andimmersed in aquadest solution pH 7. 0 (negative control) (Group I) or “kunyit asam” solution pH 3. 0 (Group II) for 14, 28, 42 and 56 minutes respectively. An Universal Hardness Tester (Affri® Universal Hardness Tester, Japan) was used to measure enamel surface microhardness, while to measure enamel surface roughness wasused a Roughness Tester (Surftest 301 Mitutoyo, Japan). Both measure were done before and after immersed in solution. Data were statistically analyzed using Levene, paired-t one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Least Significance Different (LSD) tests. The results of present study showed that {{there was no significant difference}} (p> 0. 05) microhardness but significant differences (p< 0. 05) for the roughness of tooth enamelbefore and after immersion in both group. In conclusion, pH (3. 0) “kunyit asam” decreased of microhardness, meanwhile it is calcium content (794. 23 µg) increased roughness of human enamel tooth in vitro...|$|R
5000|$|In the 18th century, {{areas of}} the south (or right bank) side of Mohawk Valley were sparsely settled {{in the face of}} the {{periodically}} warlike and always militant Iroquois peoples, who, while diminished by European diseases during colonial times still retained ample war powers after the French and Indian War ended in 1763. Reorganized by then as the Six Nations the tribes had conducted internecine war with other powerful eastern tribes until the 1770s, weakening or eliminating the power of the Delaware, the Susquehanna, and Shawnee tribes - [...] affecting Amerindian populations and power both East and West of the Alleghenies as far south as northern Kentucky in the west, and southern Maryland in the east. By the end of the French and Indian War, they were the one remaining group of eastern native peoples that retained sufficient military power to give even the British authorities pause. Consequently, those authorities cultivated political arrangements with the Iroquois and as a prelude to the revolution, the British <b>Crown</b> acted to <b>block</b> trans-Appalachian settlements before the opening of the American Revolution, one of the lesser known grievances of many held by the settlers. During the Revolution, farms in the valley acted as a breadbasket providing important food supplies to the Colonial forces. The lower Mohawk valley was a scene of uneasy native Amerindian - Colonial Settler contention throughout most of the 18th century until after the American Revolutionary War's Sullivan Expedition pacified the region by permanently weakening the Six Nations of the Iroquois. That campaign was a direct result of two atrocities in the region: The May 1778 Battle of Cobleskill (or Cobleskill Creek Massacre) signaled a new guerrilla war offensive by mixed troops of Loyalists and members of the four Iroquois tribes allied to the British in 1778. The incursions resulted in three major raids with major loss of life ranging from Southern New York to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.|$|R

The remains of the superstructure are the most extensive of any tomb at Aphrodisias. The outer walls (e-w 11. 55 m; n-s 8. 45 m) are preserved in up to four courses of large petit apareil masonry, with the largest stones in the lower courses (H: 0. 26 - 0. 32 m, W: 0. 56 - 0. 06 m, D: 0. 38 - 0. 45 m). The eastern end preserves elements of a tetrastyle façade including: euthenteria blocks (H: 0. 30 m, L: 0. 43 - 0. 70 m, D: 0. 51 m) and stylobate blocks (H: 0. 24 m), atop which are the two central pedestals (top 0. 60 m square; shaft: 0. 55 m square) with a further step (H: 0. 24 m, D: 0. 30 m) between them. Architectural blocks atop {{the eastern end of}} the tomb include a smoothly finished Attic Ionic column base (diam. : 0. 525 m) that would fit atop the pedestals, and an architrave (L: 2. 40 m) the same length as the intercolumniation between the two pedestals. In the field boundaries nearby to the southeast are further blocks that could pertain to the structure including a monumental <b>crowning</b> molded <b>block,</b> a second architrave, a doorjamb, a fluted double capital, wall blocks with dowel holes and swallow-tail clamp cuttings, and fragments of monolithic columns. The one accessible vaulted underground chamber (n-s 6. 95 m, e-w 1. 89 m) is well preserved to the south and partially collapsed to the north, and cleared to within 2. 60 m of the vault. It is the antechamber to the primary burial chamber, and was accessed by a doorway (W: 0. 76 m) through {{the south end of the}} west wall. The main tomb chamber was reached through a central doorway (W: 0. 76 m) also in the west wall (Th: 0. 80 m); both openings have flat lintels. The regularly coursed petit appareil blocks are heavily mortared, and the mortar beds are occasionally scored. The lower half of the vault appears to be built from corbelled petit appareil blocks, while the upper half is a mass of heavily mortared rubble and radially placed flat stones. Three evenly spaced windows pierce the east wall of the antechamber. The openings (H: 0. 45 - 0. 54, W: 0. 38 - 0. 43 m, D: 1. 13 m) extend from the intrados of the vault up through a slit in the center of the rising face of the stair blocks in the east façade. Also on the eastern wall are four small niches in the spaces between and below the widows; they are similar to put log holes, except that there are no corresponding holes in the western wall. They could have been shelves for small oil lamps. ** The immediate field boundaries are approximately aligned with the tomb; some pottery and tile fragments are seen in the field to the north.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar as características adesivas de dois tipos de geopolímero (G 1 e G 2) frente a cinco cimentos odontológicos de uso consagrado: dois convencionais fosfato de zinco (FZ), ionômero de vidro (IV) e três resinosos, sendo um deles fotopolimerizável Relyx Veneer® (RV), e os demais, dual - Relyx ARC® (RA) e Relyx U 200 ® (RU), este último, autocondicionante. Previamente à execução dos ensaios, quarenta e cinco molares hígidos foram selecionados para estudo. Os elementos dentários foram seccionados na linha cervical, e a coroa foi dividida no sentido mésio-distal, gerando noventa hemi-coroas, que foram posicionadas na luz de um cano de PVC de 25 mm de diâmetro. Nesse momento, elas foram incluídas em resina acrílica auto-polimerizável. Cada artefato foi desgastado, gerando um corpo de prova em forma de disco com 2 mm de espessura. Em seguida, foram feitos preparos cavitários cônicos em dentina. Para cada cimento comercial, dez amostras foram utilizadas, e para os geopolímeros, vinte. Os compostos foram inseridos nesses preparos, evitando-se o extravasamento. Arbitrou-se um tempo de estocagem de 24 horas em condições de umidade relativa em temperatura ambiente para os cimentos comerciais e uma amostra de cada geopolímero (G 1 u e G 2 u). Para efeitos comparativos, outras dez amostras de cada geopolímero (G 1 s e G 2 s) foram armazenadas em ambiente seco durante o mesmo período, de modo a se conhecer suas adesões sem influência da umidade. A partir daí, foram executados ensaios de {{push-out}} em uma máquina universal. Os resultados foram submetidos aos testes de ANOVA e Tukey, que mostraram que as melhores resistências adesivas foram apresentadas por G 2 s, seguida por G 1 s. Dentre os cimentos convencionais, RV teve o melhor desempenho. G 1 u e G 2 u mostraram os níveis de adesão mais baixos, não tendo diferenças estatísticas entre si. Conclui-se que as características mecânicas dos cimentos geológicos se mostraram promissores, apesar de bastante susceptíveis à ação da umidade. O uso odontológico mais racional dos geopolímeros deve passar pela correção de seu caráter hidrossolúvel, de modo a se alcançar uma aplicabilidade clínica mais efetiva. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the adhesive characteristics of two kinds of geopolymers (G 1 and G 2) among five well known cements used in Dentistry: two conventional self-cure cements zinc phosphate (FZ), glass ionomer (IV) and three resin -based cements, one of them with light cure RelyX Veneer (RV) whereas the other two are dual cements RelyX ARC (RA) and RelyX U 200 (RU), which is a self-adhesive product. Before the execution of the experiments themselves, forty-five non-carious molars were selected for afterwards analysis. The teeth were sectioned along the cervical line, and the crown was split along the mesial-distal line, creating 90 halves of teeth crowns. Each one was placed inside of the lumen of a segment of a regular 25 mm PVC pipe. Once that was done, self-cure acrylic resin was poured into the pipes until the full submersion of the half <b>crowns.</b> Each <b>block</b> was transversally sliced, creating specimens in the shape of 2 mm thick discs. Thereupon, conic cavities were drilled into the dentin using a diamond bur. Ten samples were used for each cement and each geopolymer was used in twenty samples. These materials were inserted into these cavities, avoiding their overfill. Randomized 24 h storage under relative wetness and room temperature for the selfcure cements and one sample of each geopolymer (G 1 u and G 2 u) was set. As a matter of comparison, other ten samples of the geopolymer (G 1 s and G 2 s) were stocked in a dry room, for the same period of time, so that it could be possible to analyze its adhesion without the wetness influence. Afterwards, the push-out experiments were made in a universal testing machine. The results were made under the ANOVA and Tukey tests, which showed that the best adhesive strength were showed by G 2 S and followed by G 1 S. Among the resin cements, RV obtained the best performance. G 1 u and G 2 u showed the lowest adhesive levels, without any relevant statistical differences between them. The conclusion is that the geological cements mechanical characteristics are promising, although they re very susceptible to wetness. The rational application of geopolymers in Dentistry must face an correction of is hidrosolubility, so that its clinical usage can reach a good effectiveness...|$|R
