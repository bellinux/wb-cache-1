40|$|By {{studying}} {{a group of}} organophosphorus compounds (PhOC), a system of methods for developing models of <b>chronic</b> <b>intoxication</b> was approved, the purpose of which was to establish safe levels of chemical pollutants in the water. The magnitudes of threshold doses (TD) and ineffective doses (MID) were obtained by using MAC, (maximum admissible concentrations of substances in the air of industrial plants) and TLV [indices of admissible levels of substances in the air of industrial plants (USA standards) ]. In compiling estimated and experimentally established MAC for 21 substances, variations were recorded {{within the range of}} 2 - 10 times. Forecasting on the basis of ED 50, Elim and other measures during 5 - 20 day experiments made it possible to estimate threshold and inactive doses of PhOC during <b>chronic</b> <b>intoxication,</b> as well as to determine a cumulative coefficient and distribute these compounds into two series, according to the degree of their hazard. This project made it possible to determine cumulative properties simultaneously and forecast the chronic toxicity of the PhOC group under investigation. The present report is the result of studies carried out in the development and evaluation of various methods for predicting the toxicity and hazard from environmental chemical pollutants entering by mouth, for the purpose of establishing safe levels for their action on the organism.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the role of}} <b>chronic</b> ethanol <b>intoxication</b> on the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an ethanol-containing diet for 1 week before intratracheal challenge with type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae and for 10 days after infection. Control rats were fed the same diet except that ethanol was replaced isocalorica 1 lywith carbohy-drate. Ethanol treatment increased pneumococcal bacteremia, levels of capsular polysaccharide antigenemia, and susceptibility to lethal pneumonia. Once dissemination occurred, ethanol-fed rats failed to eliminate pneumococci from the bloodstream. Ethanol-fed rats demonstrated a de-fect in late pulmonary clearance of pneumococci that wastemporally associated with a significantly higher pneumonia severity index. Pneumonia wascharacterized by an intense polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, severe edema, and a fibrous exudate.

40|$|Objectives: Gold miners use mercury {{to extract}} gold from ore adding liquid mercury to the milled gold-containing ore. This {{results in a}} mercury-gold compound, called amalgam. Miners smelt this amalgam to obtain gold, {{vaporizing}} it and finally inhaling the toxic mercury fumes. The objective was to merge and analyze data from different projects, to identify typical {{signs and symptoms of}} chronic inorganic mercury exposure. Material and Methods: Miners and community members from various artisanal small-scale gold mining areas had been examined (Philippines, Mongolia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Indonesia). Data of several health assessments were pooled. Urine, blood and hair samples were analyzed for mercury (N = 1252). Questionnaires, standardized medical examinations and neuropsychological tests were used. Participants were grouped into: Controls (N = 209), living in an exposed area (N = 408), working with mercury as panners (N = 181), working with mercury as amalgam burners (N = 454). Chi 2 test, linear trend test, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, correlation coefficient, Spearman’s rho, and analysis of variance tests were used. An algorithm was used to define participants with <b>chronic</b> mercury <b>intoxication.</b> Results: Mean mercury concentrations in all exposed subgroups were elevated and above threshold limits, with amalgam burners showing highest levels. Typical symptoms of <b>chronic</b> metallic mercury <b>intoxication</b> were tremor, ataxia, coordination problems, excessive salivation and metallic taste. Participants from the exposed groups showed poorer results in different neuropsychological tests in comparison to the control group. Fifty-four percent of the high-exposed group (amalgam burners) were diagnosed as being mercury-intoxicated, compared to 0 % within the control group (Chi 2 p < 0. 001). Conclusions: <b>Chronic</b> mercury <b>intoxication,</b> with tremor, ataxia and other neurological symptoms together with a raised body burden of mercury was clinically diagnosed in exposed people in artisanal small-scale mining areas.

40|$|Alcohol {{withdrawal}} {{refers to}} a cluster of symptoms that may occur from suddenly ceasing the use of alcohol after chronic or prolonged ingestion. These symptoms make alcohol abstinence difficult and {{increase the risk of}} relapse in recovering alcoholics. Our study was aimed at identifying novel candidate compounds, which might attenuate alcohol withdrawal signs in the rat. In previous studies, we demonstrated that allyphenyline, endowed with effective adrenergic α 2 C-agonism/α 2 A-antagonism and serotoninergic 5 -HT 1 A-agonism, significantly reduced morphine withdrawal syndrome and associated depression. Here, we evaluated the effects of allyphenyline on alcohol withdrawal signs in Wistar rats. For this purpose, animals were subjected to a 4 -day <b>chronic</b> alcohol <b>intoxication</b> (by intragastric administration), and at 24 hours following cessation of alcohol exposure, they were treated intraperitoneally (ip) with allyphenyline (0. 05 mg/kg and 0. 5 mg/kg). Somatic withdrawal signs were scored after ip treatment. In a subsequent experiment, to evaluate the effects of allyphenyline on alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety, another group of rats was subjected to ethanol intoxication and after 1 week was tested for anxiety behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and in the defensive burying tests. The blood alcohol levels were assessed on third and fourth day of <b>chronic</b> alcohol <b>intoxication.</b> Results showed that allyphenyline did not reduce the expression of somatic withdrawal signs but attenuated anxiety-like behaviors in defensive burying tests associated with <b>chronic</b> alcohol <b>intoxication.</b> Allyphenyline did not affect anxiety scores in EPM.
