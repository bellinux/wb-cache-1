5|$|Humour {{magazine}} Fuddle Duddle, {{named after}} a famous euphemism by then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was a short lived attempt at a Canadian Mad-style satirical magazine. It was the first comic book of Canadian <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available on newsstands since 1956. Two of its contributors, Peter Evans and Stanley Berneche, would soon go on to bring superheroes back to Canada {{for the first time}} since the demise of Nelvana in 1947, with Captain Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Richard Elfman {{entered into}} a {{licensing}} deal with the creative resource company, PANGEA, to provide licensees {{with the opportunity to}} create merchandise based on the cult film. According to articles that appeared in the media on May 3, 2016, the arrangement calls for <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> created that will include a Storyboard Book of the original film, featuring commentary and anecdotal notes from director. Shot glasses and sculpted pieces were among the list of immediate items that would be released. A fantasy novella series was also noted as being under development.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among a {{long list}} of minor changes to tax law {{contained}} a controversial clause that would give the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> objectionable. David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley argued it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was passed in the House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later said that they did not notice the controversial part and several Senators have said that they intend to send the Bill back to the House.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> added to their blacklists. This was implemented {{in order to prevent}} users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Most modern {{smartphones}} {{are capable}} of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video. Not all of YouTube's videos {{are available on the}} mobile version of the site. Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone. In July 2010, the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls. The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform. In September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system. According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.|$|E
5|$|On {{release of}} Guitar Hero 5, 35 {{of the songs}} from World Tour and 21 from Smash Hits are importable into Guitar Hero 5 for a small fee (approximately $0.10 per song), and are treated as {{downloadable}} content for the game playable in all game modes; the World Tour export was available on release, while the Smash Hits export was available a few days afterwards. Furthermore, 61 of the 65 tracks from Band Hero are importable into Guitar Hero 5. All transferred songs are also playable in Band Hero. However, Guitar Hero 5 is not backwards-compatible with World Tour. The transfer process requires the player to enter a unique code from the World Tour or Smash Hits manual {{to be able to}} redownload available songs in a pack (on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3) or individual songs (on the Wii) that have been updated to include the new features. Players on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 can delete individual songs after downloading the pack. Some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues—not technical issues—according to Bright. Tim Riley, the head of music licensing at Activision, stated that the company will continue to seek licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exported into Guitar Hero 5, but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future Guitar Hero games. While reviewers appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, they felt that the small number of tracks that were available at launch was at odds with the impression that Activision had made of the process before the game's release.|$|E

25|$|The {{very first}} EVP {{recordings}} may have originated {{from the use}} of tape recording equipment with poorly aligned erasure and recording heads, resulting in the incomplete erasure of previous audio recordings on the tape. This could allow a small percentage of previous <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> superimposed or mixed into a new 'silent' recording.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was {{introduction}} of a new pulp process, thermomechanical pulp (TMP), replacing the former grindstone mechanical pulping. TMP allowed for more long fibers to be retained, thus improving the strength. This allowed for cellulose <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dropped from fifteen percent, which would allow for cost-savings along with faster processing through the paper machines. The first TMP machine was installed in 1977, with a daily capacity of 120 tonnes.|$|E

25|$|Individuals low in reward {{dependence}} {{and high in}} norepinephrine levels are then hypothesized to be typically independent, non-conformist, practical, tough-minded, cynical, unwilling to share their intimate feelings with others, socially detached, irresolute, insensitive to social cues and pressures, and <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone. They are also minimally motivated to please others and act for immediate gratification. So being low in reward dependence is related to social withdrawal, with aggressive anti-social behavior, detachment, and coldness in social attitudes.|$|E
25|$|Although the IWF's {{blacklist}} causes <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> censored even if {{the content}} has not {{been found to be}} illegal by a court of law, IWF Director of Communications Sarah Robertson claimed, on 8 December 2008, that the IWF is opposed to the censorship of legal content. In the case of the IWF's blacklisting of cover art hosted on Wikipedia just a few days prior, she claimed that “The IWF found the image to be illegal”, despite the body not having any legal jurisdiction to do so.|$|E

However, 19 of its affiliates transmit the network's programming in 720p HD, while four others carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry NBC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed NBC affiliate has yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> presented in HD.|$|E

25|$|In 1624, Great Inquisitor Fernando Martins Mascarenhas created, {{with the}} help of Jesuit Baltasar Álvares, the first Index of the 17th century, which had a new feature: general {{guidance}} - the rules of the Portuguese Catalogue - besides the ones from the Universal Roman Catalogue. The Index consisted, therefore, of three parts: the Tridentine Index, the Index pro Regnis Lusitaniae, and a section detailing the <b>content</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed from any book published about the Scriptures, philosophy, theology, the occult, and even science and literature. This Index would be in use until the 18th century.|$|E
