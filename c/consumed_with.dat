According to interviews with China Central Television and Xinhua News Agency, Gui said that he had been <b>consumed</b> <b>with</b> guilt and had returned to China in October to face the consequences of his misdeed.|$|E

5|$|Many {{crustaceans}} {{are consumed}} by humans, and nearly 10,700,000tons were produced in 2007; {{the vast majority}} of this output is of decapod crustaceans: crabs, lobsters, shrimp, crawfish, and prawns. Over 60% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns, and nearly 80% is produced in Asia, with China alone producing nearly half the world's total. Non-decapod crustaceans are not widely <b>consumed,</b> <b>with</b> only 118,000tons of krill being caught, despite krill having one of the greatest biomasses on the planet.|$|E

5|$|Mephedrone {{is often}} <b>consumed</b> <b>with</b> alcohol. A study in mice {{investigated}} the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the psychostimulant and rewarding properties of mephedrone. It found that at low (non stimulant) doses alcohol significantly enhanced the psychostimulant effects of mephedrone. This effect was mediated {{by an increase in}} synaptic dopamine, as haloperidol, but not ketanserin, was able to block the potentiation by alcohol. Similarly, the rewarding properties of mephedrone were enhanced by a low non-rewarding dose of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} at the core has been <b>consumed,</b> <b>with</b> {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when <b>consumed</b> <b>with</b> alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E

5|$|A {{husband and}} wife who had lost their son {{as a result of}} the war offered {{themselves}} as the raw material of the final Master, but the woman's unknown pregnancy caused an imbalance that transformed the Masters into monsters. The husband and baby were rescued using the Oraclos Chain, but the wife became Zeron, a dark monster <b>consumed</b> <b>with</b> a want to reunite with her descendant and bring 'peace' to the land. The Vestra sealed the Masters in the Towers and guarded them, while the wife's child eventually became Aeron's ancestor. The wife's jealous want of her descendants caused her to curse people who grew close to them, with Elena being the latest victim of the curse. The Vestra brought each afflicted person to the Towers in the hopes that the Masters would be destroyed and Experiment Zero ended: Mavda was the latest guardian of the Towers. Four hundred and fifty years later, the Elyrian Army recreated the Masters as living weapons: without the knowledge and help of the Vestra, the Elyrians instigated a drastic geological upheaval that created the Scar, which acted as a portal to the netherworld.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consumed</b> <b>with</b> remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) would rule after him. Because of this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed over {{in the line of}} succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E

They argue, and he states that if Gwen is working to safeguard ordinary life then she has not been successful. Returning to Torchwood's headquarters, Gwen interrupts Jack and fellow Torchwood employee Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) during a sexual encounter. After apologising, she tells Jack that she wants to continue the investigation. Jack refuses to help, but Ianto later gives Gwen a GPS device with coordinates to a hidden location, leading Gwen to a facility on Flat Holm, a sort of care home for seventeen individuals taken by the riftwho have returned. Gwen finds Jack there, and demands access to Jonah. An older Jonah (Robert Pugh) is shown to have been physically deformed whilst on a burning planet {{in the midst of a}} burning solar system. Jack reveals that he set up the facility when he first took command of Torchwood, in order to care for the victims of the rift, who had previously been locked away in the Torchwood vaults.|$|E
5|$|Liu Kang {{appears in}} the 2013's second season of the web series , portrayed by Brian Tee. Liu Kang in Legacy is portrayed as an anti-hero and {{fighting}} {{on the side of}} Outworld rather than that of Earthrealm in the web series. In this version, he is shown to have left a monastery to live a normal life working at a diner with a fiancée. After watching a pair of thieves kill her in a robbery attempt, he becomes <b>consumed</b> <b>with</b> anger and revenge, and further distances himself from Kung Lao and the ideals that were taught to him. After working as a freelance assassin for a few years, he is approached by Shang Tsung, who convinces him that humanity is not worth protecting and asks him to join the realm of Outworld in the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament, which he agrees to. During the tournament, he easily subdues Johnny Cage and Kurtis Stryker before being confronted by Kung Lao, who is surprised at his old friend's change of allegiance.|$|E
5|$|The character's backstory is {{explored}} {{throughout the}} sixth season of Desperate Housewives. Angela de Luca lived in New York City with her mother, Rose De Luca (Suzanne Costallos). At age eighteen, she {{dropped out of}} college, where she was enrolled as an engineering major, and joined a band of eco-terrorists, led by Patrick Logan (John Barrowman), with whom she became romantically involved. Patrick asked her to build a bomb {{that would be used}} against a corporate company. On November 10, 1991, the eco-terrorist group bombed a building that was supposedly empty; however, they unintentionally killed a man named Shawn. Angela sustained a large scar on her back {{as a result of the}} explosion. <b>Consumed</b> <b>with</b> guilt over having killed an innocent man, Angela agreed to run away with a private investigator (Jeffrey Nordling) who had been pursuing the terrorist group. Later, Angie discovered she was pregnant with Patrick's child. She and the private investigator raised Patrick's son as their own and moved several times, living under various aliases, in an attempt to evade both Patrick and the FBI.|$|E

5|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still {{takes place in}} Casamance, {{which is one of}} three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are {{an important component of the}} family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and <b>consumed</b> <b>with</b> a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.|$|E
5|$|The novel then {{switches}} {{to the second}} plot strand, the story of Lucas Burch/Joe Brown's partner Joe Christmas. The surly, psychopathic Christmas {{has been on the}} run for years, ever since presumably killing his strict Methodist adopted father. Although he has light skin, Christmas suspects that he is of African American ancestry. <b>Consumed</b> <b>with</b> rage, he is a bitter outcast who wanders between black and white society, constantly provoking fights with blacks and whites alike. Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where Byron, and later Joe Brown, works. The job at the mill is a cover for Christmas's bootlegging operation, which is illegal under Prohibition. He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden, an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers. Though their relationship is passionate at first, Joanna begins menopause and turns to religion, which frustrates and angers Christmas. At the end of her relationship with Christmas, Joanna tries to force him, at gunpoint, to kneel and pray. Joanna is murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were <b>consumed</b> <b>with</b> suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.|$|E
