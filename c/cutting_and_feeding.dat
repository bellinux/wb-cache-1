40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} the {{unconfined compressive strength}} (UCS) of rocks from drilling data is a promising in-situ method and has been studied by many researchers. In most studies, experimental methods {{have been used to}} determine the relationship between UCS and drilling data. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to describe rock drilling processes using drag bits and rotary drills, and to deduce the relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke). In this model, a drilling process is divided into cycles, each of which includes two motions: feeding and cutting. Feeding is treated as an indentation motion. There is a linear relation between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). The cutting forces and friction forces of both the rake surface and the flank surface are examined. Also, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank surface of the bit and the rock. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts respectively generated from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running. Torque caused by friction and idle running is ineffective for drilling, whereas that caused by cutting and indentation is effective. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts respectively from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running. For the purposes of this study, effective specific energy is defined as the sum of specific energy consumed by <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding.</b> Effective specific energy is independent of the penetration rate. Since it is proportional to the UCS of the rocks, it is not influenced by the penetration rate, and is more useful in the evaluation of UCS than other parameters. Some laboratory and field tests were conducted, and the results verified the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|E
40|$|An {{extension}} program to control fasciolosis in cattle and buffalo was undertaken {{in collaboration with}} officers of the District of Livestock Services (DLS) and farmer organizations in the Surade district of West Java. Control strategies were based on results of extensive epidemiological studies on fasciolosis in this area over the past 4 years. Recommendations included: (1) preventing animals grazing harvested rice fields adjacent to a village or cattle pen; (2) feeding stock only the top two-thirds of freshly cut rice stalks; (3) mixing cattle or buffalo faeces with manure of ducks or chicken naturally infected with Echinostoma revolutum, before using them as fertilizer in rice fields; and (4) a single treatment with triclabendazole in July, about 6 weeks after harvest of the last seasonal rice crop. Farmers were surveyed in January 1996 to determine their level of knowledge about fasciolosis. The {{extension program}} commenced in February, soon after planting the second seasonal rice crop in four villages. At first, leaflets were distributed to farmers, and posters were displayed in each village to provide basic information. Following discussions with village leaders, groups of farmers met in each village to discuss the advantages they saw in each strategy, ways they could implement them, and to identify socio-economic constraints {{that needed to be}} overcome. Taped interviews were prepared for a local radio station and the farmer groups. In August, final survey was conducted to determine the change in knowledge and attitudes that had occurred {{as a result of the}} extension program. Bennett’s hierarchy was used at each stage to evaluate the effects of inputs and activities. Farmers adopted the techniques of <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> rice-stems 2 / 3 above water-level, and isolating cattle from rice-fields during harvest time, as these appeared to be beneficial in social and economic terms; but they rejected the two other practices where they perceived that socio-economic costs exceededbenefits...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} model for drilling process was proposed {{to describe the}} relations among physical properties of the rocks and mechanical data. Based on this model, a drilling system was developed. This drilling system can measure the mechanical drilling data and predict the geological conditions. 1) Development of the {{analytical model}} for rock drilling. In this analytical model, a drilling process is divided into continuous cycles, each of which includes two motions: feeding and cutting. Feeding is treated as an indentation motion. A linear relation exists between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). Cutting forces and frictions of both the rake face and the flank face are examined. Especially, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank face of the bit and the rock. Some relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke) were deduced. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts generated from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running respectively. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running respectively. For this study, the effective specific energy {{is defined as the}} sum of specific energy consumed by <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding.</b> It is more useful to evaluate uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) than other parameters are. 2) Development of the drilling system. The hardware of this system consists of a drilling machine (Trussmaster Series) and some instruments to measure mechanical data. The software can analyze the data from the mechanical data and predict the geostructure of roadways, rock physical properties and discontinuities of the strata. 3) Laboratory and field experiments. Some laboratory tests and field experiments were performed to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model and the drilling system. With the mechanical data, the rock physical properties were evaluated. Meanwhile, the specimens taken from the fields were tested in laboratory to get their physical properties. The predicted values were agreed with the measured values. 4) Visualization of the geostructure. An application of VRML (virtual reality modeling language) was developed to display the predicted geostructure of roadway in 3 D. The strata and the discontinuities (cracks, boundary faces, etc.) can be displayed. The results of this study show that the drilling system is useful and feasible. Our future work is to improve the prediction precision and to apply the drilling model to other types of drilling machines. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|E

In this work, the drilling was conducted using uncoated carbide tool with diameter of 4 ± 0. 01 mm with point angle of 135 ° and helix angle of 30 °. The drilling was done at different levels of spindle speed (18 and 30 mmin- 1) <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> rate (0. 03, 0. 045 and 0. 06 mmrev- 1). Austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L was the workpiece material.

The monitoring system uses the effects of turning variables on acoustic emission signal responses and factorial experimental design approach.

In this study, effects of <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> tool condition on the acoustic emission signal are investigated using acoustic emission’s energy, amplitude, and fre-quency response and 23 factorial design for turning operation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental measurements aimed at observing the effect of technological parameters (<b>cutting</b> speed vc <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> speed vf), type of wood (juvenile wood and mature wood) andwood species (aspen Populus tremula, L. and hybrid poplar Populus x Euramericana „Serotina“) on cutting power during plane milling of poplar wood. The results showed the reduction of cutting power with the decrease of <b>cutting</b> speed <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> speed. Lower <b>cutting</b> power was also measured in milling hybrid poplar than in milling aspen. The test also confirmed the effect of different anatomical and chemical structure of juvenile wood in relation to mature wood on different physical and mechanical properties of such wood and hence also on the cutting power in processing juvenile wood...|$|R
40|$|Carbide cutting tools, {{which are}} {{inexpensive}} and widely used by machine shops, are alternatives for performing hard machining, yet limitations {{due to their}} low strength requires performance evaluation as well as appropriate selection of cutting parameters. In this study, a carbide tool with TiAlN coating with wiper geometry {{at the cutting edge}} is proposed for performing mild range of hard machining of martensitic stainless steel (48 HRC). The tool's performance was evaluated based on its tool life and the resulting surface finish when hard machining at various <b>cutting</b> speeds <b>and</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>and</b> at constant depth of cut without using cutting fluid (dry machining). Response surface methodology was used to quantify the effect of <b>cutting</b> speed <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> to the tool life and proposing the optimum cutting parameters. Further observation was made on the worn tool, the machined surface, and the generated chip to observe the process. Results showed that the wiper coated carbide tool are capable of performing particular hard machining...|$|R
