It was built in the late tenth century by the Kyurikids, this branch of the Bagratunis originated from Gurgen (the name was pronounced Kyurikeh in the local dialect of Gugark). He was the son of the patrons of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries located not far from Akhtala, King Ashot III the Merciful and Queen Khosrovanush. Gurgen's brothers were King Smbat II the Conqueror and Gagik I Bagratuni, under whom the Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia reached the peak of its prosperity.|$|E

2500|$|Among Igbo <b>cultural</b> <b>items</b> in Jamaica {{were the}} Eboe, or Ibo drums popular {{throughout}} all of Jamaican music. Food was also influenced, {{for example the}} Igbo word [...] "mba" [...] meaning [...] "yam root" [...] was used to describe a type of yam in Jamaica called [...] "himba". Igbo and Akan slaves affected drinking culture among the black population in Jamaica, using alcohol in ritual and libation. In Igboland {{as well as on}} the Gold Coast, palm wine was used on these occasions and had to be substituted by rum in Jamaica because of the absence of palm wine. Jonkonnu, a parade that is held in many West Indian nations, has been attributed to the Njoku Ji [...] "yam-spirit cult", Okonko and Ekpe of the Igbo. Several masquerades of the Kalabari and Igbo have similar appearance to those of Jonkonnu masquerades.|$|E
5000|$|A {{concept that}} {{has often been}} {{mentioned}} in this regard, which may be framed in the evolutionary diffusionism model, is that of [...] "an {{idea whose time has}} come" [...] — whereby a new <b>cultural</b> <b>item</b> appears almost simultaneously and independently in several widely separated places, after certain prerequisite items have diffused across the respective communities. This concept was invoked with regard to the independent development of calculus by Newton and Leibnitz, and the inventions of the airplane and of the electronic computer.|$|R

2500|$|A {{significant}} change {{began in the}} establishment of Victorian society in Europe. In an attempt to civilize anything that seemed coarse or uncivil, much of Victorian society would adapt <b>cultural</b> <b>items</b> to suit their tastes. Ironically the British adopted the paper wrapped minced tobacco. Such an item, originally relegated to the poor in Spain, seemed at face value a contradiction; however, one must consider the need for human manipulation of tobacco, including, chopping it up, wrapping it in a man-made piece of paper, and then inserting it into a piece of cane for a mouth piece. One can then see that this was just another way of civilizing part of the coarser aspects of the British Empire. A feministic culture dominated smoking at this time as well as lots of tobacco, and this gave further rise to this [...] "dainty" [...] cigarette, bearing a feminine name.|$|E
2500|$|The Athabaskan Tradition flourished 1,300–800 years ago. Linguistic {{evidence}} suggests that the Athabaskan culture may have appeared in the Tanana Valley as early as 2,500 years ago. Through ethnography, oral history, and a broad array of <b>cultural</b> <b>items,</b> much has been learned about Athabaskan culture and history in the region. Artifacts associated the Athabaskan culture are exceptionally diverse and include bone and antler projectile points, fishhooks, beads, buttons, birch bark trays, and bone gaming pieces. In the Upper Tanana region, native copper (from trading with Ahtna people or [...] "Copper Indians") was available and used in addition to the traditional material types to manufacture tools such as knives, projectile points, awls, ornaments, and axes. A late prehistoric Athabaskan occupation is recognized at several sites in and around U.S. Army Garrison, Fort Wainwright's training lands. The Athabaskan Tradition includes late prehistoric and proto-historic cultures generally believed to be the ancestors of Athabascan tribes who currently inhabit Interior Alaska. Excavated Athabaskan sites are rare, but the limited body of evidence allows for several generalizations. Athabascan settlement patterns depended greatly on the availability of subsistence resources, and Interior bands lived a nomadic lifestyle.|$|E
2500|$|The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is a {{law that}} {{establishes}} the ownership of <b>cultural</b> <b>items</b> excavated or discovered on federal or tribal land after November 16, 1990. [...] The act also applies to land transferred {{by the federal government}} to the states under the Water Resources Department Act. [...] However, the provisions of the legislation do not apply to private lands. [...] The Act states that Native American remains and associated funerary objects belong to lineal descendants. [...] If lineal descendants cannot be identified, then those remains and objects, along with associated funerary and sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony belong to the tribe on whose lands the remains were found or the tribe having the closest known relationship to them. Tribes find the burden of proof is on them, if it becomes necessary to demonstrate a cultural relationship that may not be well-documented or understood. [...] Nowhere has this issue been more pronounced than in California, where many small bands were extinguished before they could be recognized, and only a handful, even today, have obtained federal recognition as Native Americans and descendants of Native American bands.|$|E

2500|$|The statute {{attempts}} to mediate a significant tension {{that exists between}} the tribes' communal interests in the respectful treatment of their deceased ancestors and related <b>cultural</b> <b>items</b> and the scientists' individual interests {{in the study of}} those same human remains and items. The act divides the treatment of American Indian human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony into two basic categories. [...] Under the inadvertent discovery and planned excavation component of the act and regulations, if federal officials anticipate that [...] activities on federal and tribal lands after November 16, 1990 might have an effect on American Indian burials—or if burials are discovered during such activities—they must consult with potential lineal descendants or American Indian tribal officials as part of their compliance responsibilities. [...] For planned excavations, consultation must occur during the planning phase of the project. [...] For inadvertent discoveries, the regulations delineate a set of short deadlines for initiating and completing consultation. [...] The repatriation provision, unlike the ownership provision, applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before the effective date of the act, whether or not discovered on tribal or federal land. [...] The act allows archaeological teams a short time for analysis before the remains must be returned. [...] Once it is determined that human remains are American Indian, analysis can occur only through documented consultation (on federal lands) or consent (on tribal lands).|$|E
