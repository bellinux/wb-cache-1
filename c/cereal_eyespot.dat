40|$|Simple, theoretical, {{physical}} {{principles and}} existing experimental data {{were used to}} derive an analytical model to describe thr incorporation of plant pathogen spores into splash droplets, Data were obtained from experiments on splash dispersal of spores of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides (<b>cereal</b> <b>eyespot),</b> Pyrenopeziza brassicae (oilseed rape light leaf spot) and Septoria nodorum (wheat glume blotch). In these experiments, incident drops of diameter 4 - 5 mm were allowed to fall onto spore suspensions 0. 5 mm deer with 1. 2 x 10 (5) to 6. 5 x 10 (5) spores:ml. The analytical model was constructed {{as the product of}} thr ee functions of droplet diameter which described, respectively, the frequency distribution of droplet diameters, the proportion of droplets carrying spores and the mean number of spores in spore-carrying droplets in each diameter category. The frequency distribution of droplet sizes was described by ii log-normal distribution, the proportion of droplets carrying spores was described by an exponential function and the adimensional spore concentration in spore-carrying droplets was described by a Fewer law. The cumulative proportions of spores in droplets in diameter categories of increasing diameter were calculated ii, compare observed and fitted data...|$|E
40|$|The {{bootstrap}} computer-intensive statistical {{technique is}} frequently applied to statistical analyses of phylogenetic trees. The widely used rule {{that a group}} is supported significantly if it appears in at least 95 % of bootstrap trees is conservative in most situations. This paper describes three ways of using the bootstrap to carry out statistical inference on phylogenies. The first method tests whether there is nonrandom support for a single group or tree. The second method compares the support for two groups or trees. The third method tests whether a single group or tree has better support than the set of all possible alternatives; {{this may be a}} replacement for the " 95 % rule. " These tests generally require fewer bootstrap trees to be estimated than do other methods of bootstrapping phylogenies. A simple, sequential statistical method can be used to increase the efficiency further. These methods can be applied to tests of multiple hypotheses about a single phylogeny. Parsimony analyses of 5 S rRNA sequences of plants and cluster analyses of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA bands in three pathotypes of the <b>cereal</b> <b>eyespot</b> fungus are used as illustrative examples. The tests can be used to analyze dendrograms in subjects other than taxonomy...|$|E
40|$|Sexual crosses {{were used}} to {{determine}} the genetic basis of resistance to the sterol 14 α-demethylase inhibitor fungicide prochloraz in the <b>cereal</b> <b>eyespot</b> pathogen Tapesia yallundae. Three different crosses between sensitive parental strains (22 - 432 and 22 - 433 [the concentration required to inhibit growth by 50 % {IG 50 } for each was ≤ 0. 03 mg/liter]) and field isolates from France and New Zealand with differing levels of resistance (PR 11 [IG 50 = 0. 5 mg/liter], PR 1 [IG 50 = 1. 0 mg/liter], and 11 - 3 - 18 [IG 50 = 2. 4 mg/liter]) yielded progeny showing a bimodal distribution, with an even number of sensitive and resistant progeny. This indicated the segregation of a single major gene for resistance in each cross, which was confirmed by the use of backcrosses, crosses between F 1 progeny, and control crosses between sensitive parents. However, there was also evidence of additional quantitative genetic components responsible for the increased IG 50 s of the more resistant isolates. A further cross was made between isolate PR 11 and an F 1 progeny arising from isolate 11 - 3 - 18, and this also yielded progeny which were entirely prochloraz resistant. This suggested that resistance genes were allelic in these two isolates, with resistance conferred by a gene at the same locus (or closely linked loci), {{despite the fact that the}} isolates (PR 11 and 11 - 3 - 18) originated from different continents...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Winter cereals (wheat, triticale, rye, barley) {{grown in}} {{experimental}} fields were assessed for sharp eyespot. Preceding crops (spring cereals and fallow) and weed control (herbicides application, no control) {{were taken into}} account. The health status evalua-tion was carried out at the stem elongation phase and at the milk maturity stage. The macroscopic estimation was accompanied by the analysis of fungal species identified on stem bases and roots, which showed various disease symptoms. The analysis of fungal species from the genus Rhizoctonia were especially noted. Mycological analysis of roots was carried out at the seedling growth and stem elongation phase, and stem bases at the seedling growth and milk maturity stage. Infection caused by Rhizoctonia spp. was confirmed by polymeraze chain reaction (PCR) assay. The highest infection was noted on wheat followed by triticale, rye and barley. Occurrence of sharp eyespot depended more on weed control than on what the preceding crop had been. At the milk maturity stage, lower severity of sharp eyespot of triticale, rye and barley was noted on plots not treated with herbicides, and on wheat with herbicide application. The research showed a significant effect of the preceding crop only on the health status of wheat. At the milk maturity stage, the highest infection was noted after spring triticale and the lowest after oats. Stems of <b>cereals</b> with sharp <b>eyespot</b> symptoms and healthy stems were settled mainly by Rhizoctonia cerealis (wheat – 25. 6 %, triticale – 12. 0 %, rye – 22. 2 %, barley – 11. 3 %), rarely by R. solani (respectively 6. 0, 4. 0, 2. 9 and 1. 8 %). Rhizoctonia solani was isolated more often from roots with true eyespot and Fusarium foot rot symptoms. It may suggest that R. cerealis was the main causal agent of sharp eyespot on all tested cereals. The preceding crop di...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) and other Fusarium {{diseases}} of wheat and other small-grain cereals cause yield reduction and grain contamination with harmful mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol (DON). Little {{is known about}} the mechanistic basis of resistance to Fusarium in cereals due to the large, polyploid and unsequenced genome of wheat. Host ethylene (ET) signalling was previously shown to be a factor of susceptibility to FHB. Chapter 2 uses wheat EMS mutant lines characterized for altered senescence to test for a relationship between ET-sensitivity, senescence and resistance to FHB. Candidate mutant lines displaying high level of resistance to FHB were identified and resistance was associated with delayed senescence, reduced ET-sensitivity, or developmental delay. Brachypodium distachyon (Bd) has the potential to serve as a model pathosystem relevant to small-grain cereals. Chapter 3 provides evidence of compatibility between Bd and the main causal agents of FHB and shows that symptom development mirrors closely that in wheat. Natural variation in disease resistance exists among Bd accessions and a novel route for initial infection is suggested. Bd is also compatible with other important pathogens of small-grain <b>cereals</b> causing ramularia, <b>eyespot</b> and take-all diseases. In Chapter 4, a preliminary study of Bd T-DNA mutant lines altered in phytohormone biosynthesis or response investigates alteration of Fusarium resistance. Mutation of the main brassinosteroid (BR) receptor (BRI 1) was characterized and validated. Other mutants defective in auxin or ET responsiveness and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis were investigated. Results suggest that JA and BRI 1 promote disease susceptibility. Finally, Chapter 5 uses a chemical and genetic approach to investigate the mechanisms of DON phytotoxicity using the Bd root system. Effects induced by the mycotoxin are compared with BRs, inhibitors of protein synthesis and compounds altering BR biosynthesis or signalling. Results suggest that DON may disrupt host BR homeostasis to promote disease susceptibility...|$|R

(2 n= 6 x= 42, AABBDD), {{has several}} {{relatives in the}} Triticum/Aegilops complex of the Poaceae family in the Triticeae tribe, which are valuable sources for broadening genetic diversity and may provide genes for disease and pest resistance and general wheat improvement. Other wild relatives of wheat also may be exploited for wheat improvement, such as Haynaldia villosa (L.) Schur. (2 n= 2 x= 14, VV). It is a diploid species with resistance to powdery mildew, wheat curl mite colonization, <b>cereal</b> <b>eyespot</b> disease, rust diseases, and wheat spindle streak mosaic virus. H. villosa may harbor many other as yet unidentified traits for wheat improvement. The polyploid nature of bread wheat allows tolerance to genomic changes, because homoeologous chromosomes from other genomes compensate for missing wheat chromosomes. In this experiment, we crossed the disomic alien addition line DA 4 V (2 n= 6 x= 44) {{with a pair of}} H. villosa chromosomes added to the wheat chromosome complement with wheat monosomic for chromosome 4 D (2 n= 41) to produce 4 D/ 4 V double monosomic plants. According to centric breakage-fusion mechanisms, univalents tend to break at their centromeres at meiotic metaphase I producing telocentric chromosomes with unstable or “sticky” ends that can fuse with the sticky ends of other newly formed telocentric chromosomes. This fusion results in Robertsonian whole-arm translocations that may be compensating if a short arm of one chromosome fuses with a long arm of another. Double monosomic plants were screened cytogenetically and further visualized by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). Five transfers were identified, including T 4 DS. 4 VL and T 4 VS. 4 DL translocations, and a T 4 VS-W. W transfer of unknown wheat origin. These results were confirmed by GISH. The T 4 DS. 4 VL and T 4 VS. 4 DL translocations are genetically compensating and should be exploited in wheat improvement...|$|E
