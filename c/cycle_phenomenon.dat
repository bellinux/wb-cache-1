We consider a dynamic, stochastic equilibrium business cycle model which includes deterministic seasonals and nontime-separable preferences. We show how to compute a perfect foresight seasonal equilibrium path for this economy. An approximation to the stochastic equilibrium is calculated. Using postwar U. S. data, GMM estimates of the structural parameters are employed in the perfect foresight and simulation analyses. As in Constantinides and Ferson [1990], the estimates of consumption preferences exhibit habit-persistence, but a local optimum also exists which exhibits local durability.; The nontime-separable model predicts most of the seasonal patterns found in aggregate quantity time series; notable exceptions are the seasonal patterns in investment and the fourth quarter seasonal in labor hours.

40|$|Abstract [...] Cascaded on-load {{tap changers}} (OLTC) {{are widely used}} for coarse voltage control in {{electric}} power systems. There could be an interaction between load dynamics and OLTC control under certain system operating conditions which may lead to OLTC limit <b>cycle</b> <b>phenomena</b> thereby resulting into long term voltage oscillations in the system. In the recent years, renewable and non-renewable local generation units have been getting interconnected in modern power systems. The existence of OLTC limit cycles {{in the presence of}} local generation units has not been addressed in the literature. In this paper, the OLTC limit <b>cycle</b> <b>phenomena,</b> which can occur due to interactions among load-voltage dynamics, OLTC controls and the local generation, has been investigated. Also, a strategy is proposed for mitigating the power system oscillations which can be induced by OLTC limit cycles, especially with local generation units in the network. The proposed mitigation strategy including detailed investigations and analyses have been verified for a two-bus system, and successfully tested on a multi-bus system with local generation units usin...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a Marxian {{model of the}} business cycle based on Hilferding's theory of disproportionality in capital accumulation in a two-sector economy. The disproportionality arises from the existence of time delays in production generated by the differential capital intensity in the two sectors. The time delays produce an asymmetric price structure that causes overproduction and crisis. The model is constructed using delay-differential equations. Numerical simulations show that the model produces an economy-wide business <b>cycle</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> The domain of the time delay parameter is investigated, and shows that the model produces {{a wide variety of}} dynamics from monotonic convergence to explosive oscillations. Moreover, the solution shows that intersectoral investment flows transmit the instability in capital accumulation and that longer time delays produce higher cycle amplitudes. ...|$|E

Moreover, the yearly differential responses of premi-ums and reserves to net investment income are coincident with the formation of cycles.

It has been demonstrated that algorithms actually keep overdrive atrial pacing, reduce atrial premature contractions, and prevent short-long atrial <b>cycle</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> with good patient tolerance. However, clinical studies showed inconsistent benefits on clinical endpoints such as atrial fibrillation burden. Factors which may be responsible for neutral results include an already high atrial pacing percentage in conventional DDDR, non-optimal atrial pacing site and deleterious effects of high percentages of apical ventricular pacing. Atrial antitachycardia pacing (ATP) therapies are effective in treating spontaneous atrial tachyarrhythmias, mainly when delivered early after arrhythmia onset and/or on slower tachycardias. Effective ATP therapies may reduce atrial fibrillation burden, but conflicting evidence does exist as regards this issue, probably because current clinical studies may be underpowered to detect such an efficacy. Wide application of atrial ATP may reduce the need for hospitalizations and electrical cardioversions and favorably impact on quality of life.

40|$|The generic {{features}} of an evolutionary theory which are {{identified in the}} conceptional discussion of the present paper can {{be shown to be}} present already in Schumpeter's 1912 work, The Theory of Economic Development. None the less, it is argued that Schumpeter fell short of a level of generality by which he would have succeeded in providing a true foundation for evolutionary economics. The reason is his eagerness [...] very clearly visible in the "lost" seventh chapter [...] to align his theory with the economic reasoning of contemporary "pure" economic theory that was moulded in an equilibrium-oriented heuristic and the methodology of comparative statics. Schumpeter's conception [...] which, in opposing the idea of borrowing from Darwinian thought, he called "development" [...] is rather a special theory of the unsteady capitalist growth process passing through booms and crises. Throughout all of Schumpeter's writings the notion of development is therefore closely related to the business <b>cycle</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> The paper argues that this special framing implies not only some arbitrary hypotheses which are difficult to accept in an evolutionary interpretation, but also some limitations in his understanding of (what he refused to call) economic evolution, particularly with respect to its driving forces. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects of {{disinflation}} on economic activity in"chronic inflation"countries [...] countries with a long inflationary history above the rates in industrialized countries, where labor and capital markets are adjusted to function in the inflationary environment. The sample is based on a number of Latin American countries and Israel. The main finding is that stabilization processes in chronic inflation countries do not normally follow the usual Phillips curve trade off in the medium run. Specifically, stabilization progams in these countries are often associated with a business cycle, beginning with a boom and ending with a recession. This finding relates to the programs which used the exchange rate as the main nominal anchor, referred to as"exchange rate based stabilization"(ERBS). This paper documents the main features of the business <b>cycle</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in ERBSs, and tries to understand its causes and to derive some policy implications for future stabilizations. It refers to relevant features of stabilizations in industrial low-inflation economies and in hyperinflationary episodes, and then turns to chronic inflation countries.
