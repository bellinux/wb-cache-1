[...] Rosales joined 14 others, {{two of them}} Asians, as {{the newest}} members of the College of Cardinals. Pope Benedict told the new cardinals: “I want to sum up {{the meaning of this}} new call that you have {{received}} in the word which I placed at the heart of my first Encyclical: caritas. This matches well the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> cardinal's robes. May the scarlet that you now wear always express the caritas Christi, inspiring you to a passionate love for Christ, for his Church and for all humanity.” A little later, he added: “I am counting on you, dear Brother Cardinals, to ensure that the principle of love will spread far and wide, and will give new life to the Church at every level of her hierarchy, in every group of the faithful, in every religious institute, in every spiritual, apostolic or humanitarian initiative.” ...|$|E

The tremendous success that Ah W Noss achieved, stabilized Ajram's position as an A-List star in the Arab music industry. In late April, Ajram opened for Enrique Iglesias's first concert in Egypt in 2004. Ajram then filmed [...] "Lawn Ouyounak" [...] (<b>Color</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes), which portrayed Ajram as a bride in a traditional Lebanese wedding. After the release of the album, Ajram Ajram signed-up with Coca-Cola to be their official celebrity spokesperson for the Levant, Arabia and North Africa regions. Her first Coke commercial featured her hit, [...] "Oul Tani Keda?" [...] (Say That Again?), which was filmed with the international Italian director Luca Tomassini. The commercial's success led to it being filmed as a music video behind the scenes of the commercial. The 4th hit single from the album, [...] "Inta Eyh?" [...] (What Are You?), was a slow composed by Samir Sfeir. Nadine Labaki directed another clip that featured Ajram as a wife who sees her husband cheating on her yet she hides it in torment to save their relationship. The music video received tremendous positive reviews and Ajram was greatly praised. Leading Egyptian actors and directors, like Faten Hamama praised Ajram's acting abilities and movie offers doubled for Ajram.|$|E

50|$|Born Steven Mark Archer in Mojave, California, US, {{the son of}} an Assemblies of God pastor, {{he began}} singing with his brother, Tim in their father's church in the {{northern}} San Joaquin Valley of California at age nine. They eventually branched out to other churches in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. Throughout the 1960s they toured with older brother, Gary, as The Archer Brothers. In 1970, Tim and Steve formed The Archers with Nancye Short and Billy Rush Masters in Southern California. They recorded and toured internationally from the 1970s through the early 1990s. Younger sister Janice replaced Short in 1977; Masters also left the band at this time. That year their album Fresh Surrender was nominated for a GMA Dove Award. They appeared at the Jimmy Carter White House in 1978 and on the Grammy Awards telecast twice, in 1981 and 1982 winning the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance, Contemporary or Inspirational and nominated for Best Gospel Performance respectively. The group suspended recording in 1985, and performed only on a limited schedule until 1991, when they re-entered the studio for a final project, <b>Colors</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Your</b> Love. They toured until 1993 when they permanently disbanded.|$|R

5000|$|Sanchez's first book, The Teachings of Don Carlos: Practical Applications of the Works of Carlos Castaneda (1995), {{provides}} in-depth {{techniques and}} commentary {{on a path}} of [...] "self-growth" [...] based on {{the wisdom of the}} Toltec descendants. His approach in this book is bringing the proposals of Castaneda down to the earth focusing on those parts of Castaneda's book that can be applied in everyday life and used for personal development, while discouraging the use of psychotropic plants, which was prominent in mostly in the first book of Castaneda [...] "The Teachings of Don Juan" [...] Sanchez has published four further books: Toltecs of the New Millennium (1996), providing an overview of and background on the author's experiences with the Wirrarika; The Toltec Path <b>of</b> Recapitulation: Healing <b>Your</b> Past to Free Your Soul (2001); and The Toltec Oracle (2004); and [...] "Los Colores de Tu Alma" [...] (The <b>Colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Soul - not yet translated into English) (2014). Sanchez's recapitulation technique bears some resemblance to Sandra Ingerman's soul retrieval technique, but is probably the most comprehensive approach to the subject that has been published so far. Other shamanic teachers using similar techniques include Michael Harner, PhD founder of core shamanism, and Ken Page, founder of Heart and Soul Healing. Some have associated Sanchez's work with Toltec author Don Miguel Ángel Ruiz, author of the Four Agreements. Sánchez usually respond to such association, that while he likes the general message of Ruiz´ book, they are not particular of the Toltec but could be found in many religions or world philosophies.|$|R
6000|$|When Peterkin, who is twelve, {{wrote to}} us {{that there was a}} {{possibility}} ("but don't count on it," [...] he said) of his bringing the captain of the school home with him for a holiday, we had little conception what it meant. The captain we only knew by report as the [...] "man" [...] who lifted leg-balls over the pavilion and was said to have made a joke to the head-master's wife. By-and-by we understood the distinction that was to be conferred on us. Peterkin instructed his mother to send the captain a formal invitation addressed [...] "J. Rawlins, Esq." [...] This was done, but {{in such a way that}} Peterkin feared we might lose our distinguished visitor. [...] "You shouldn't have asked him for all the holidays," [...] Peterkin wrote, [...] "as he has promised a heap of fellows." [...] Then came a condescending note from the captain, saying that if he could manage it he would give us a few days. In this letter he referred to Peterkin as his young friend. Peterkin wrote shortly afterwards asking his sister Grizel to send him her photograph. [...] "If you haven't one," [...] he added, [...] "what is the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> eyes?" [...] Grizel is eighteen, which is also, I believe, the age of J. Rawlins. We concluded that the captain had been sounding Peterkin about the attractions that our home could offer him; but Grizel neither sent her brother a photograph nor any account of her personal appearance. [...] "It doesn't matter," [...] Peterkin wrote back; [...] "I told him you were dark." [...] Grizel is rather fair, but Peterkin had not noticed that.|$|E

Supposing those scales <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> which I {{told you}} to prepare {{in order to show}} you the {{relations}} <b>of</b> <b>color</b> to gray, were quite accurately made, and numerous enough, you would have nothing more to do, in order to obtain a deeper tone in any given mass <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> than to substitute for each of its hues the hue as many degrees deeper in the scale as you wanted, that is to say, if you wanted to deepen the whole two degrees, substituting for the yellow No. 5 the yellow No. 7, and for the red No. 9 the red No. 11, and so on: but the hues of any object in Nature are far too numerous, and their degrees too subtle, to admit of so mechanical a process.
