40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the ongoing {{development}} of the TapTiles system, a low-cost, floor-interaction technology that overcomes problems found in previous overhead projector-based floor-interaction systems by using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) embedded into a <b>carpet</b> <b>tile.</b> Despite many advantages compared to projector-based floor interaction systems, LED-based systems could be criticized for lacking the resolution for a worthwhile interactive experience. User studies of both simulated and real hardware are reported on. This includes a comparison of tiles of different resolution that suggests that pixel density, over the range of tests, {{is less important than}} visual artifacts introduced by <b>carpet</b> <b>tile</b> edges. Contrary to initial expectations, denser LED spacing did not improve legibility or raise user preferences. Overall our studies suggest that LED-based floor interaction can be legible and effective in a walk-up and use situation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} improve the {{understanding}} of implementation processes that achieve corporate sustainability by providing explanatory knowledge {{about the role of}} change agents from a sensemaking perspective. The paper also aims to focus on the sustainability efforts of change agents in a multinational <b>carpet</b> <b>tile</b> manufacturer. Design/methodology/approach – The theoretical perspective of the paper is based on the concepts of sensemaking and emergent change. The paper examines sustainability sensemaking in the Dutch subsidiary of the US-based <b>carpet</b> <b>tile</b> manufacturer Interface over a period of ten years (2000 - 2010). Findings – The findings show that embedding sustainability by change agents is typically an emergent change process that consists of small steps and is not predictable. Research limitations/implications – This paper focuses on the emergent, unpredictable aspects of change. More research is needed on processes of adapting the general concept of sustainability to local organisational contexts. Originality/value – The paper examines sustainability sensemaking by change agents in one organisation...|$|R
