Racine sought to develop a model that quantified the severity of a seizure. Using animal testing (rat model), Racine was able to stimulate specific parts of the brain using slight electrical impulses. He used methods of deep brain stimulation in order to ensure the targeted areas of the brain were able to reach the specific threshold to see a reaction in the rats. Rats were separated into categories of the target area, duration of stimuli, and overall intensity of stimuli. He specifically targeted the hippocampus and the amygdala of the test animals. Each rat in the model was anesthetized and special probes were placed into specific parts of the brain according to the target area. Using an electrical stimulation at one second intervals and different intensities, Racine observed a change in muscle stimulation in the rats. [...] Once excited, the rats would demonstrate signs of a seizure. Racine was able to categorize the bodies' reaction to the stimuli into five different categories [...] He also observed that with the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> it was easier for the seizure to take place. These stages of increasing severity can serve as a way to quantify a seizure.|$|E

40|$|Background: Drug Utilization Evaluation (DUE) {{studies are}} {{designed}} to evaluate and improve the rational use of medications. DUEs have focused on drugs used in high risk patients such as critically ill cases in this study. Carbapenems are beta-lactam type antibiotics with broad-spectrum of activity which cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. The heavy use of carbapenems (imipenem or meropenm) could {{increase the risk of}} multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Methods: This study was a prospective and cross sectional study performed at three intensive care units (ICUs) of Shariati hospital, affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The study was conducted from April 2012 to May 2013. All of the patients were on imipenem or meropenem as an empiric treatment or based upon microbiology culture results included in the study. Results: Total of 68 patients in three ICU wards evaluated. The most common diagnosis was Central Nervous System (CNS) infections and meningitis (36. 8 %). The most common microorganism derived from the patient’s specimen was Acinetobacter spp. (28 %). Overall initial treatment for thirty five patients (51. 4 %) was justified versus nineteen cases (27. 9 %) of unjustified. For 14 patients (20. 5 %) empiric treatment was justified, but <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> was unjustified.

40|$|SETTING: Thyolo district, Malawi. OBJECTIVES: To {{report on}} 1) case {{fatality}} among {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) positive tuberculosis (TB) patients while on anti-tuberculosis treatment and 2) whether antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiated during the <b>continuation</b> phase <b>of</b> TB <b>treatment</b> reduces case fatality. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. METHODS: Comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> outcomes for TB patients registered between January and December 2004.

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} {{the limits of}} how end of life law can address threats to patient autonomy. The reluctance of physicians, patients and family to discuss end of life matters and to confront the certainty of death, together with a culture that actively denies the aging process itself, interferes with a patient’s ability to exercise choice as death approaches. Thus, patients often suffer needlessly from the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> and life-supportive measures that they would choose to decline if better informed about their choices {{and the importance of}} choosing. Advance directives, as a legal mechanism, often fail fully to protect a patient’s choices; however, they have inherent value in that they encourage patients to confront the dying process and to have meaningful conversations with their physicians, attorneys, and relatives.
