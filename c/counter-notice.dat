25|$|Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have criticised Flickr for its heavy-handed {{implementation}} of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA). Under OCILLA, a service provider such as Flickr is obliged to delete or disable access to content {{as soon as they}} receive an official notice of infringement, to maintain protection from liability. After having one of his own pictures taken down following an incorrect DMCA claim, British comedian Dave Gorman researched the issue and concluded that if the Flickr user was not based in the United States – or they were but the person filing the notice of infringement was not – Flickr deleted the disputed content immediately. Even if the user could successfully demonstrate that the content did not infringe upon any copyright, Flickr did not, according to Gorman, replace the deleted content. He argued that this was contrary to its obligations in responding to a <b>counter-notice.</b> Shortly afterward, Flickr changed its policy.|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, it was {{reported}} that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA <b>counter-notice.</b> When a dispute occurs, the uploader of the video has to contact UMG. YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe [...] "fair use" [...] laws apply.|$|E
2500|$|For {{registered}} land, {{adverse possession}} claims completed after 13 October 2003 follow a different procedure. Where land is registered, the adverse possessor may henceforth apply {{to be registered}} as owner after 10 years of adverse possession and the Land Registry must give notice to the true owner of this application. This gives the landowner a statutory period of time [...] to object to the adverse possession, object to the application {{on the ground that}} there has not actually been the necessary 10 years’ adverse possession, and/or to serve a [...] "counter-notice". If a <b>counter-notice</b> is served, then the application fails unless ...|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{there is}} no public record of {{takedown}} requests and <b>counter-notices.</b> This prevents the public from seeing how the process is used. (Chilling Effects has tried {{to make up for}} this shortcoming, but, so far, few OSPs besides Google submit their takedown notices.) ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, Geller {{issued a}} DMCA notice to YouTube {{to remove a}} video {{uploaded}} by Brian Sapient of the [...] "Rational Response Squad" [...] which was excerpted from an episode of the Nova television program titled [...] "Secrets of the Psychics". The video included footage of Geller failing to perform. [...] In response, Sapient contacted the Electronic Frontier Foundation, issued a DMCA <b>counter-notice,</b> and sued Geller for misuse of the DMCA. [...] Geller's company, Explorologist, filed a counter-suit. [...] Both cases were settled out of court; a monetary settlement was paid (but {{it is not clear}} by and to whom) and the eight seconds of footage owned by Explorologist were licensed under a noncommercial Creative Commons license.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of problems with the <b>counter-notice</b> procedure, arising from its complexity and also because ISPs {{are not required to}} inform users of its existence. According to Chilling Effects, while Google has taken hundreds of sites out of its index because of DMCA requests, not a single person has filed a <b>counter-notice</b> or received a <b>counter-notice</b> from any other OSP.|$|E
50|$|Section 512(g) {{contains}} the put back provisions described earlier and referenced by {{other parts of}} the act. OSPs are exempt from liability for the good faith removal of allegedly infringing material. This immunity is subject to their compliance with the notification and counter-notification procedure. Users must be informed of removed or disabled material. Similarly, copyright holders must be informed of the receipt of a <b>counter-notice,</b> and disabled material subject to a <b>counter-notice</b> must be enabled between 10 and 14 days after the receipt of the <b>counter-notice.</b>|$|E
50|$|ISP's {{may also}} {{disregard}} counter-notices. Section 512(g) of the DMCA shields an ISP from liability to its customer for a DMCA takedown, if the ISP restores removed content following a <b>counter-notice.</b> In practice, however, an ISP may disregard the <b>counter-notice,</b> and instead rely {{on its own}} terms of service to shield itself from liability to its customer. For example, since April 2013, YouTube refuses to restore some counter-noticed content, citing an agreement YouTube made with third-party music content owners.|$|E
5000|$|Alice now has {{the option}} of sending a <b>counter-notice</b> to YouTube, if she feels the video was taken down unfairly. The notice {{includes}} ...|$|E
5000|$|If Alice does file a valid <b>counter-notice,</b> YouTube notifies Bob, then waits 10-14 {{business}} days for a lawsuit {{to be filed}} by Bob.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, ISP's tend {{to remove}} {{allegedly}} offending material immediately, {{while there is}} a 10- to 14-day delay before the ISP re-enables access in response to a <b>counter-notice.</b> For example, if a website advertised an upcoming labor protest outside BlameCo, BlameCo could send a DMCA notice to the site's ISP alleging copyright infringement of their name or logo a week before the protest. The site would then be disabled; even if the site's owners immediately filed a <b>counter-notice,</b> access would not be re-enabled until after the protest, too late to be useful.|$|E
50|$|That {{is not to}} {{say that}} OCILLA {{functions}} perfectly in practice. There are several problems resulting from imperfect incentives created by the law, from the complexity and requirements of the <b>counter-notice</b> procedures, and from evolving Web Technology.|$|E
50|$|The DMCA states four safe harbors:(a) Transitory network communications(b) System caching(c) Information storage and(d) Information {{location}} tools. The {{last three}} have so called “notice & take down” rules for specificity in notice of infringement, <b>counter-notice</b> and put-back and liability if false notice has been given.|$|E
50|$|Texas Instruments sent a DMCA {{takedown}} {{notice to}} the Wikimedia Foundation because certain cryptographic keys were made {{public in the}} Texas Instruments signing key controversy article. A Wikipedia editor later filed a <b>counter-notice,</b> Texas Instruments did not reply in 10-14 business days {{as required by the}} DMCA, and the keys were restored to the article.|$|E
5000|$|Law {{professor}} Jason Mazzone wrote, [...] "Damages {{are also}} {{not available to}} the site owner unless a claimant 'knowingly materially' misrepresented that the law covers the targeted site, a difficult legal test to meet. The owner of the site can issue a <b>counter-notice</b> to restore payment processing and advertising but services need not comply with the counter-notice." ...|$|E
5000|$|In April 2013, it was {{reported}} that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA <b>counter-notice.</b> When a dispute occurs, the uploader of the video has to contact UMG.

50|$|On October 13, 2009, the EFF sent {{a letter}} to TI warning them that the posting of the keys did not violate the DMCA, and that it may be liable for misrepresentation. Despite the letter by the EFF, TI {{continued}} to send DMCA notices to websites that posted the keys, but stopped doing so after late 2009. The EFF filed a DMCA Section 512 <b>counter-notice</b> on behalf of three of the bloggers who received DMCA notices. When the EFF did not receive a response by the deadline, the bloggers re-posted the content that had been taken down.|$|E
5000|$|For {{registered}} land, {{adverse possession}} claims completed after 13 October 2003 follow a different procedure.

5000|$|In Coppin-Smith, the {{premises}} comprised Thames Ditton Lawn Tennis Club, which included ten tennis courts and a pavilion, together covering over 2 acre. The tenants, the {{trustees of the}} club, served a s26 request on the landlord, who served a <b>counter-notice</b> stating that he would resist {{a new lease on}} ground. Before the hearing, the landlord applied for planning permission for the site, which was refused on the ground of the loss of a recreational open space. The landlord then decided to demolish the buildings and courts on the basis that this would make it easier in the future to obtain planning consent.|$|E
5000|$|On May 2013, Hollywood studios such as Viacom, Paramount, Fox and Lionsgate {{started to}} censor Google Search links {{pointing}} to the documentary, an action criticized by {{the director of the}} film Simon Klose. On June, after the initial controversy, HBO and Lions Gate sent additional bogus DMCA takedown notices to Google requesting the removal of links related with the TPB AFK. In response, Simon Klose contacted Chilling Effects which recommended him to file a DMCA <b>counter-notice</b> where he explained that the purpose is [...] "to share the film as much as possible". Two months later, the censored links were reinstated only after public complaints made by the film director.|$|E

50|$|This {{may result}} from the {{inherent}} imbalance in prerequisites for the original complaint and the <b>counter-notice.</b> To get content removed, copyright holder Bob need only claim a good-faith belief that neither he nor the law has authorized the use. Bob {{is not subject to}} penalties for perjury. In contrast, to get access to content re-enabled, Alice must claim a good faith belief under penalty of perjury that the material was mistakenly taken down. This allows for copyright holders to send out take-down notices without incurring much liability; to get the sites back up, the recipients might need to expend considerably more resources. Section 512(f) makes the sender of an invalid claim liable for the damages resulting from the content's improper removal, including legal fees, but that remedy is not always practical.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{need for}} {{permission}} for a temporary event; the prospective premises user merely has to formally notify the council and police that the event will take place. So long as the criteria noted above are met (as well as any others that may apply, for example, if alcohol is being sold, that provisions are in place to stop under 18s from buying it) and the police have no objections, the event can go ahead. The council cannot impose any further conditions, limitations or restrictions. However, if the authority is convinced that any of the above limits will be exceeded, or they uphold a police objection (which can only be made on the grounds of crime prevention), they will issue a <b>counter-notice</b> which has the effect of cancelling the temporary event notice.|$|E
