Two investment incentive mechanisms - Capacity obligations and Reliability contracts - are analyzed and compared to the benchmark design, the energy-only market. We use the dynamic programming method and real option theory to develop two dynamic models that enable one to assess the optimal market design for ensuring sufficient generation capacity to meet future demand at efficient cost (the deterministic model) and to analyze the optimal timing of investments when uncertainties in future load and fuel prices are considered (the stochastic model). The effects of different factors on investment strategies, such as the pricing of CO 2 and differences between construction delays and cost structures of the new technologies, are also analyzed. The numerical results show that: (1) the reliability contract scheme would be the more cost-efficient mechanism, ensuring the long term system adequacy and encouraging earlier and adequate new investments in the system, compared to the <b>capacity</b> <b>obligation</b> method which would result in over-investment and price manipulations; (2) short lead time technology would be preferred with the <b>capacity</b> <b>obligation</b> design, while cost competitive technology would be chosen with the reliability contract scheme; (3) the pricing of CO 2 and the taking into account of uncertainties would affect investment strategies but would have {{no impact on the}} effectiveness of the reliability contracts scheme...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the supply of {{capacity}} during peak demand in restructured power systems. There {{are a number of}} reasons why there is uncertainty about whether an enegyonly electricity market (where generators are only paid for the energy produced) is able to ensure uninterrupted supply during peak load conditions. Much of the public debate in Europe has been about the present surplus generation capacity. However, in a truly competitive environment, {{it is hard to believe}} that seldom used capacity will be kept operational. This is illustrated by developments in Sweden. For this reason, the large surplus of generation capacity in the European Union may vanish much faster than generally assumed. In the USA, much of the debate has been about California. During the last three summers, California has occasionally experienced involuntary load shedding and prices have been very high during these periods. To some extent, the Californian situation illustrates the relevance of the subject of this thesis: in a deregulated system generators may not be willing to invest in peaking capacity that is only needed occasionally, even though prices are very high during these periods. A good solution to the problem of providing peaking power is pivotal to the success of power market restructuring. Solutions that fail to create the right incentives will result in unacceptable load shedding and can endanger the whole restructuring process. On the other hand, solutions that pay too much for investments in peaking power will lead to generation capacity surpluses and thus represent a societal loss. Why is peaking capacity a problematic issue in energy-only markets? Traditionally, probabilistic methods are applied to calculate the required generation capacity to obtain a desired level of reliability. In a centrally planned system, this level of generation capacity is developed in a least-cost manner. A single utility or central authorities can thus control the level of reliability directly. This is not possible in a market-based system, if suppliers are only paid for the energy produced. Under the assumption of certainty and continually varying prices, generators fully recover their variable and investment costs under ideal market conditions. When uncertainty is taken into account, generators will cover their expected costs. However, revenues will be extremely volatile, especially for peaking generators. Combined with a risk-averse attitude, it is unlikely that investments will be sufficient to maintain the traditional level of reliability in an energyonly market. Consequently, one would expect reserve margins to decline in such markets. This effect is very clear in Sweden that deregulated in 1996, and less explicit in a number of other cases like Norway, California and Alberta. Pricing and Consumer Preferences The theory of electricity pricing was originally developed for vertically integrated utilities, but elements from this theory are also valuable in a restructured context. Many authors have agreed on the presence of a capacity element in the optimal price during peak-load conditions, while price should equal marginal cost during low-load conditions. An important assumption is that prices have to be stable. More recently, spot pricing of electricity has been advocated. A number of papers have been written about how to efficiently include security considerations in the spot price. Because the availability of capacity cannot be directly controlled in an energy-only spot market, the probability of occasional capacity shortages increases. It is important to be prepared for this situation. The core of the problem is that demand is de facto inelastic in the short-term because of traditional tariff systems. It is shown that considerable economic gains are obtained when demand elasticity can be utilized, even if only minor shares of demand are elastic in the short-term. Better utilization of demand elasticity was also profitable in traditional systems, but after restructuring the gain is much larger: the alternative is not expensive generation but random rationing, which is unacceptable in modern society. It is possible to go one step further. Consumers have different preferences for the use of energy and reliability. Some consumers have a low tolerance about being disconnected, while others are more willing to accept this. This will be reflected by their willingness to pay for reliability. A better solution would emerge if consumers could buy electricity and reliability more or less as separate commodities, based on their preferences. In the context of pricing it should be pointed out that ”profile-based settlement” that allows small consumers to freely choose their supplier without hourly metering is detrimental with respect to the correct pricing of capacity. It should only be used in the initial phases of opening a market. Improved utilization of system resources Even in the short-term, demand and the availability of generation and transmission resources are uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to have reserves available in a power system. When capacity becomes scarce, it is difficult to satisfy the reserve requirements. If these requirements are strict, the only possibility is to resort to what can be called ”preventive loadshedding” to satisfy the reserve requirements. This is obviously an expensive solution, but there are no obvious ways of balancing the (societal) cost of preventive load shedding against reduced system security. In this thesis, a model is developed for unit commitment and dispatch with a one-hour time horizon, with the objective of minimizing the sum of the operation and disruption costs, including the expected cost of system collapse. The model is run for the IEEE Reliability Test System. It is shown that under conditions where there is not enough capacity available to satisfy the reserve requirements, large cost savings can be obtained by optimizing the sum of the operation and disruption costs instead of using preventive load-shedding. In the model, it is also possible to directly target reliability indexes like the Loss of Load Probability or Expected Energy not Served. It is shown that increased reliability (in terms of the values of the indexes) can be obtained at a lower cost by targeting the indexes directly instead of resorting to reserve requirements. This is especially the case if flexible load-shedding routines are developed, making it possible to disconnect and reconnect the optimal amounts of load efficiently. The use of alternatives to fixed reserve requirements as a means to maintain system security does not solve the problem about how to ensure the availability of peaking capacity. However, in a situation with occasional capacity shortages, it gives the System Operator a tool to find the optimal balance between preventive load shedding and system security, which can result in significantly lower disruption costs in such cases. More research and development in this area is necessary to develop methods and tools that are suitable for large power systems. Ancillary Services Investment in peaking capacity is insufficient in restructured systems because expected revenues are too low or too uncertain. If generator revenues are increased, the situation improves. One way to obtain this is to create markets for ancillary services. In the thesis, a model is developed for a central-dispatch type of pool. In this model, markets for energy and three types of ancillary services are cleared simultaneously for 24 hours ahead. Market prices are such that volumes and prices are consistent with the market participants. self-dispatch decisions. i. e. given these prices, market participants would have chosen the same production of energy and ancillary services as the outcome of the optimization program. With this model, it is shown that markets for ancillary services increase generator revenues, but this effect is partly offset by lower energy prices. This shows that markets for ancillary services can contribute to improving the situation, but given the remaining uncertainty, this is hardly enough to solve the problem. Capacity Subscription Because consumers have preferences for two goods: electricity and reliability, they should ideally have the choice of purchasing the preferred amount of each of these. Traditionally this is not possible. reliability is a public good, produced or obtained by a central authority on behalf of all consumers. Technological progress is presently changing this. Capacity subscription is a method that allows consumers to choose their individual level of reliability, at the same time creating a true market for capacity. It is based on the concept of selfrationing. Consumers anticipate (for example on a seasonal basis) their need for capacity at the instant of system-wide peak demand. Based on this anticipation, they procure their desired level of capacity in a market, where generators offer their available capacity. Demand is limited to subscribed capacity by a fuse-like device that is activated when total demand exceeds total available generation. In this way, the capacity payment only influences the market when demand is close to installed capacity, and does not distort the energy price in other periods. Demand is not limited when there is ample capacity. Demand will never exceed supply, because it can be limited in an acceptable way when this situation occurs. Moreover, both consumers and suppliers can adapt to situations with scarce or ample capacity, and the price of capacity will reflect this situation. There is one problem with the method: as consumers do not reach their subscribed capacity simultaneously, there will be a capacity surplus at the instant the fuse-devices are activated. Two methods to solve this problem are analysed, and it is shown that the problem can be solved optimally by giving consumers who prefer this the opportunity to buy power in excess of their subscription on the spot market. Policy evaluation Six alternative policies to assess the peaking power problem are analysed based on the following criteria: - Static efficiency: the welfare-optimal match of consumption and supply - Dynamic efficiency: the ability to create incentives for innovation - Invisibility: with invisible strategies, each market actor pursues his or her own objectives without worrying about anyone else. s - Robustness: a robust policy is less sensitive to deviations from assumptions - Timeliness: the ability of a policy to be employed at the right time - Stakeholder equity: the degree to which all the involved parties are treated equitable - Corrigibility: the extent to which a policy can be corrected once it is employed - Acceptability: the degree to which the policy is acceptable to all parties - Simplicity: ceteris paribus simple strategies are preferable over more complicated strategies - Cost: the cost of implementing the policy - System security: the policy. s ability to obtain an acceptable level of system security The policies are, in short (an example is given in parentheses) : - Capacity obligation: suppliers are obliged to keep sufficient capacity (PJM) - Fixed capacity payment: a fixed payment is offered for available capacity (Spain) - Dynamic capacity payment: capacity payment is based on the Loss of Load Probability (England and Wales) - Energy-only: no explicit payments or obligation (Scandinavia, California) - Proxy prices: very high administrative prices are used as a proxy to the Value of Lost Load when load shedding is necessary (Australia) - Capacity subscription: cf. the description above (not implemented) As could be expected, no single policy performs best on all criteria. The obligation and fixed payment methods do not perform well on market efficiency criteria, as essentially they are not market-based policies. The proxy prices policy is a reasonable policy on most criteria. It is easy, cheap and quick to implement. Because there is little experience with the method so far, there is some uncertainty with respect to if it is effective. One can anticipate that the threat of having to buy power at rationing prices will motivate market participants to avoid coming in a buying position in such cases, and that this will stimulate the adaptation of innovative solutions, especially on the demand side. The capacity subscription policy looks very promising on the issues of efficiency, robustness and system security. This is especially true for dynamic efficiency: consumers will weigh the cost of capacity against the cost of innovative load control devices, and if the price of capacity is high, a market for such technology will emerge. However, there is a considerable threshold prior to the introduction of capacity subscription, caused by the implementation costs and complexity. The conclusion on policies is thus that in an early stage after restructuring it may be appropriate to resort to the <b>capacity</b> <b>obligation</b> or payment method if the capacity balance is tight at the time of transition. For the medium-term, or if there is ample capacity initially, it is sensible to introduce proxy market prices to transfer the risk of a capacity deficit to market participants, with due attention being paid to the appropriate price level. Capacity subscription can be a long-term objective. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} of electricity markets {{has raised the}} fundamental {{question as to whether}} markets create the right incentives for the provision of the reserves needed to maintain supply security in the short-run, or whether some form of regulation is required.

Debate rages regarding the ability of energy-only electricity markets to ensure that such investors provide generation investment as and when needed to ensure "the lights stay on. "Many argue that despite theoretical predictions to the contrary energy-only markets will under-provide the requisite level of investment due to market imperfections that are either inherent (such as consumer resistance to real-time pricing) or imposed (such as price caps to curtail market power). Thenature of these imperfections is increasingly being debated with security of supply formerly being regarded as a public good but later analysis showing {{this is not the}} case (or even if it were why that need not necessitate intervention). Greater attention is now being paid to externalities associated with the provision of security of supply but evidence on the importance of such externalities is yet to be presented. Similarly lacking is evidence on the superiority of mechanisms often proposed or implemented to encourage investment in generation capacity where energy-only markets are thoughtto elicit inadequate investment. These mechanisms include <b>capacity</b> payments <b>capacity</b> <b>obligations</b> options-based <b>capacity</b> schemes and capacity subscriptions with load-limiting fuses. While the latter are argued to represent an elegant and non-distortionary means to encourage market-based securityof supply the other alternatives are shown to be conditionally optimal at best and in principle and practice subject to self-defeating features that can be bettered by refinements to energy-only market arrangements (greater demand-side responsiveness) and structural measures (vertical integration ofgeneration and energy retailing). By instead pursuing these alternative measures security of supply is more easily achieved electricity prices are less vulnerable to exploitation of generator market power and generation investment is more likely to arise. The need for price caps which then necessitate compensatory capacity mechanisms to elicit investment is then reduced. At the same time exposure to regulatory risk is lessened. Combining these measures with greater political and regulatory restraint is argued to provide a more stable and superior means to elicit the investment needed to provide the socially optimal security of supply addressing any market imperfections at source rather than introducing new mechanisms at least as much at risk of imperfection. The use of capacity mechanisms is argued to increase the risk that energy-only markets will fail to perform as expectedand required undermining the liberalisation process. As such they raise the prospect that governments and regulators concerned about security of supply will once again find themselves responsible for achieving it at consumers' and/or taxpayers' expense but with lesser prospect of success...|$|R

This evaluation is of development appraisal models in general and also their use in particular applications associated with estimating planning <b>obligation</b> <b>capacity.</b> The paper is organised into four themes: · The context and conceptual basis for development viability appraisal · A review of development viability appraisal methods · A discussion of selected key inputs into a development viability appraisal · A discussion of the applications of development viability appraisals in the planning system It is assumed that readers are familiar with the basic models and information needs of development viability appraisal rather than at the cutting edge of practice and/or academe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The Pacific Syndromic Surveillance System (PSSS), {{launched}} in 2010, provides a simple {{mechanism by which}} 121 sentinel surveillance sites in 21 Pacific island countries and areas perform routine indicator- and event-based surveillance for the early detection of infectious disease outbreaks. This evaluation aims to assess whether the PSSS is meeting its objectives, what {{progress has been made}} since a formative evaluation of the system was conducted in 2011, and provides recommendations to enhance the PSSS's performance in the future. Methods: Twenty-one informant interviews were conducted with national operators of the system and regional public health agencies that use information generated by it. Historic PSSS data were analysed to assess timeliness and completeness of reporting. Results: The system is simple, acceptable and useful for public health decision-makers. The PSSS has greatly enhanced Pacific island countries' ability to undertake early warning surveillance and has contributed to efforts to meet national surveillance-related International Health Regulation (2005) <b>capacity</b> development <b>obligations.</b> Despite this, issues with timeliness and completeness of reporting, data quality and system stability persist. Conclusion: A balance between maintaining the system's simplicity and technical advances will need to be found to ensure its long-term sustainability, given the low-resource context for which it is designed...|$|R
5000|$|During the 19th century, {{societies}} {{were becoming}} more and more democratic in their membership policies, while large groups of people were still being excluded. However, when the Progressive Era came, these historical societies finally started being seen as [...] "institutions with a <b>capacity</b> or <b>obligation</b> to serve the public." [...] There started to become significant growth in the public’s interest in local history when the 20th century came around, and this was apparent with the overall concern for historic preservation of cities that were going through architectural and demographic changes. In 1940, the increase in this appreciation was reflected once again by the founding of the American Association for State and Local History. Although the accomplishments of white men were the center of the mid-century historical societies, previously neglected groups, such as ethnic minorities and women, started to gain more attention within the academic circles as society progressed. The history of historical societies in the U.S. has often been responsive to the trends within the discipline of history, however they haven’t always responded to the evolution and changes in the same way and speed. The public inclusion movement is a great example of how the historical societies were sometimes challenged with juggling competing preservation priorities and liberal access policies.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of experimental and simulation procedures identify {{important factors in}} an Illinois cash grain farmer's machinery investment decisions. In an experiment setting, a panel of farmers based investment decisions on their own expectations, farm situations, and varying policy scenarios. In general, the results show investment levels statistically related to the tenure and leverage of operators, the economic conditions they faced, {{and the age of}} existing machinery. Alternative public policies of lower commodity price supports, tax reform, and interest rate subsidies influenced the timing of purchases but did not alter total investment amounts. Key words: expectations, experiment, farm policy, interest rates, investment, machinery, simulation. Most studies of machinery investment behav-ior have utilized aggregate time-series data to evaluate investment responses to machine costs, commodity prices, <b>capacity</b> deprecia-tion, tax <b>obligations,</b> interest rates, and othe...|$|R
40|$|What is the economy? Recent {{scholarship}} {{has demonstrated that}} “the economy” {{is a relatively new}} feature of economic discourse. Before 1930, economists theorized and measured markets, trade, inequality, and more, but did not bundle these objects together into a unified whole named “the economy. ” This dissertation offers a “formation story” for the economy, tracing the messy assemblages that constituted the economy and the consequences that flowed from the particular shape it took. Using a variety of historical data, I argue that the production of official, routine, timely macroeconomic statistics transformed the fuzzy conceptual space of “economic life” into a sociotechnical object, “the economy” in the 1930 s and 1940 s. I focus especially on national income statistics (GNP, GDP) as a key practice that enacted the economy as an object with a precisely-defined boundary and size. This dissertation contributes to research on the performativity of economics and the political power of economic expertise. I show how economists constructed “regimes of perceptibility” that focused attention on economic growth, and away from income and wealth inequality, which contributed to academics and policymakers overlooking increasing inequality. Similarly, macroeconomic statistics ignored unpaid housework, and thus defined much of women’s labor outside of the economy. The macroeconomic regime of perceptibility made visible small economic fluctuations that were invisible in earlier eras. This visibility made possible a new political rationality, “managing the economy,” which allowed policymakers to act on economic aggregates rather than individual industries or markets, while simultaneously obligating them to account for small deviations from precisely defined goals. Economic experts thus reshaped political dynamics by constructing new objects of governance and, in so doing, reshaping the <b>capacities</b> and <b>obligations</b> of the state...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{academic}} {{consensus on}} which market design provides the least distorting long-term investment incentives. Theoretical rationale and practical experience suggest that “energy-only markets ” with spot prices that {{are allowed to}} reflect scarcity rents can generate sufficient income to allow capacity cost recovery by generators. However, different market designs with separate payments for <b>capacity</b> or reserve <b>obligations</b> {{have the advantage of}} not relying on infrequent price spikes to remunerate reserve capacity. Three years after the controversial change of the British market design from the compulsory Pool with capacity payments to the decentralised energy-only New Electricity and Trading Arrangements (NETA) market framework, we contrast the two market designs in terms of investment incentives. We review the biases of the Pool capacity payments design, the drought of investment following the introduction of NETA, and the reaction of the market during the first “stress-test ” of NETA during the winter 2003. We recommend that NETA adopts a single marginal imbalance price as dual imbalance pricing distorts price signals in times of scarcity. ...|$|R
50|$|Advocacy {{concerning}} {{the right to}} water in New Zealand is centred upon the privatisation of the supply of water to households and opposing a 'user pay' approach to water consumption. Local government organisations that provide water services to communities are required to maintain their <b>capacity</b> to meet <b>obligations</b> such as retaining ownership and control of water services in their district/region. A local government organisation is allowed to enter into contracts concerning any aspect of providing water services, but they will remain legally responsible to provide such services and develop policy on the matter. In January 2015 the New Zealand Māori Council proposed the allocation of water rights be administered through a national water policy and an associated commission. The Council's co-chair, Sir Eddie Durie, stated Māori have a 'senior right' to water in New Zealand, but their rights should not override {{what is good for}} the general public. The Human Rights Commission stated in 2012 there was increasing concern in New Zealand over the quality of drinking water, the effects of the agricultural industries' consumption of water, Treaty of Waitangi considerations regarding rights to and ownership of water, and access to water.|$|R
