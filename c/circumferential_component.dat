This differs from other rotating compressors such as centrifugal compressors, axi-centrifugal compressors and mixed-flow compressors where the fluid flow will include a [...] "radial component" [...] through the compressor.

The axial component of the vector signal is measured by a sensor mounted orthogonal to the axis of the pipe, and the radial sensor is mounted to measure {{the strength of the}} flux that leaks out of the pipe. The <b>circumferential</b> <b>component</b> of the vector signal can be measured by mounting a sensor perpendicular to this field. Earlier MFL tools recorded only the axial component but high-resolution tools typically measure all three components. To determine if metal loss is occurring on the internal or external surface of a pipe, a separate eddy current sensor is utilized to indicate wall surface location of the anomaly. The unit of measure when sensing an MFL signal is the gauss or the tesla and generally speaking, the larger the change in the detected magnetic field, the larger the anomaly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The flow {{characteristics}} of a swirling jet flow impinging on a flat plate were investigated experimentally. Instantaneous Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) were employed to capture detailed information on the axial, radial and <b>circumferential</b> <b>components</b> of the turbulent velocity field. The configurations investigated corresponded to a Reynolds number of 21000 and jet-to-plate distances of 2 and 0. 25 times the jet diameter. Time-averaged distributions of the local heat transfer coefficient were also obtained for a constant heat flux thermal boundary condition. The mean and instantaneous velocity maps obtained for this configuration revealed that a vortical structure is present at the impinging surface for the highest value of the swirl intensity investigated, and for the larger spacing.

40|$|Eddy current testing (ECT) is a {{conventional}} inspection method of heat exchanger tubes. Many types of probes {{have been developed}} depending on such tube conditions as tube shapes and materials. However, the vicinity of a tube expansion is still a difficult area to inspect. This is {{because there is a}} step-shape variation circumferentially on the inside surface and there is a ferromagnetic tube sheet around the outside surface so that large noise is observed. A high signal to noise ratio (S/N) is required to inspect the area because fatigue cracks can occur near the tube expansion. In this study, we chose test pieces having an outside circumferential notch with a depth of 20 % tube thickness (20 %t) and set the target of the detection performance at S/N = 3. In order to realize this target, we utilized the difference of eddy current flows at a local notch and a tube expansion, and devised a new arrangement for exciting and pick-up coils. In our arrangement, the pick-up coil having a winding direction along the circumference is placed at the center of two exciting coils. The exciting coils induce an eddy current flow in the axial direction at the center and the pick-up coil can detect only a <b>circumferential</b> <b>component.</b> By using this probe, large noise having an axial component is suppressed and only a notch signal having a <b>circumferential</b> <b>component</b> can be detected. In order to confirm the probe performance, we compared it with a general bobbin type probe. In the sensitivity evaluation for an outside circumferential notch with 20 %t, the signal amplitude was improved 5. 7 times. In the noise evaluation test using a test piece with tube expansion, the noise amplitude was decreased 1 / 8 times. We could successfully detect the outside circumferential notch (20 %t) near a tube expansion at S/N= 3. 5, verifying the detection performance...|$|E

The decrease in volume of the liquid A and increase in volume of the gas B over time can be ignored for the purposes of solving the equations that describe the behaviour, and an assumption can be made that the instantaneous flux at any time is the steady state value. There are no radial or <b>circumferential</b> <b>components</b> to the concentration gradients, resulting from convection or turbulence caused by excessively vigorous flow at the upper mouth of the tube, and the diffusion can thus be treated as a simple one-dimensional flow in the vertical direction. The mole fraction of A at the upper mouth of the tube is zero, {{as a consequence of the}} gas flow. At the interface between A and B the flux of B is zero (because it is insoluble in A) and the mole fraction is the equilibrium value.|$|R

Our calculations elucidate properties of cross-polarized excitons, {{which lead to}} the transverse optical absorption of nanotubes and presumably couple to intermediate-frequency modes recently observed in resonance Raman excitation spectroscopy. We identify up to 12 distinct excitonic transitions below the second fundamental band associated with the E 22 van Hove singularity. Calculations for several chiral SWNTs distinguish the optically active “bright” excitonic band polarized parallel to the tube axis and several optically “weak” cross-polarized excitons. The rest are optically (near) forbidden “dark” transitions. An analysis of the transition density matrices related to excitonic bands provides detailed information about delocalization of excitonic wavefunction along the tube. Utilization of the natural helical coordinate system accounting for the tube chirality allows one to disentangle longitudinal and <b>circumferential</b> <b>components.</b> The distribution of the transition density matrix along a tube axis is similar for all excitons. However, four parallel-polarized excitons associated with the E 11 transition are more localized along the circumference of a tube, compared with others related to the E 12 and E 21 cross-polarized transitions. Calculated splitting between optically active parallel- and cross-polarized transitions increases with tube diameter, which compares well with experimental spectroscopic data...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of multi-sensor data fusion, which offers both {{quantitative and qualitative}} benefits, {{is to be able}} to draw inferences that may not be feasible with data from a single sensor alone. In this study, data from two sets of sensors are fused to estimate the defect profile from magnetic flux leakage (MFL) inspection data. The two sensors measure the axial and circumferential components of the MFL field. Data is fused at the signal level. The two signals are combined as the real and imaginary components of a complex valued signal. Signals from an array of sensors are arranged in contiguous rows to obtain a complex valued image. Signals from the defect regions are then processed to minimize noise and the effects of lift-off. A boundary extraction algorithm is used not only to estimate the defect size more accurately, but also to segment the defect area. A wavelet basis function neural network (WBFNN) is then employed to map the complex valued image appropriately to obtain the geometric profile of the defect.

40|$|Zeotropic {{refrigerant}} mixtures are {{of interest}} to the air-conditioning and refrigeration industry. In experiments on evaporators and condensers using zeotropic mixtures, heat transfer has been observed to be less than the ideal limit. The cause of this heat transfer reduction is explored in this work. In the experimental work, an optical technique for determining properties in liquid film flows is developed. The technique makes use of the total internal reflection at a liquid-vapor interface to determine the liquid film thickness and wave velocity in thin films. In the theoretical work, a circumferential film thickness model is developed based on work by Laurinat. Laurinat's momentum analysis is simplified to a balance between the normal Reynolds' stress in the circumferential direction and the <b>circumferential</b> <b>component</b> of the weight of the film. A model for the normal Reynolds' stress in the circumferential direction is proposed. A circumferential symmetry correlation is used to close the model. Using the circumferential film thickness model, a model for the evaporation and condensation of zeotropic refrigerant mixtures in horizontal annular flow is developed. Mass and energy are tracked locally to predict circumferential and axial composition and temperature gradients in the liquid film. Local heat transfer coefficients are determined using a resistance network in the liquid film. Model predictions include local wall temperature, pressure drop, local heat transfer coefficients, and local composition during evaporation and condensation. The model demonstrates the mechanisms which cause circumferential and axial composition and temperature gradients in the liquid film when zeotropic mixtures undergo evaporation and condensation. Heat transfer in mixtures is shown to be less than the ideal limit due to mass transfer resistance in the vapor. The mass transfer resistance causes bulk temperatures to differ from equilibrium bulk temperatures thus decreasing the temperature difference which drives heat transfer.
