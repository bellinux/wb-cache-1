5|$|Although in {{operational}} use the Vulcan typically carried various nuclear armaments, {{the type}} {{also had a}} secondary conventional role. While performing conventional combat missions, the Vulcan could <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 21 bombs inside its bomb bay. From the 1960s, the various Vulcan squadrons would routinely conduct conventional training missions; the aircrews {{were expected to be}} able to perform conventional bombing missions in addition to the critical nuclear strike mission the Vulcan normally performed.|$|E

5|$|The AgustaWestland AW101 is a {{medium-sized}} multi-role helicopter. Two versions are in service with the UK armed forces, {{where it is}} known as Merlin. The utility version can <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to twenty-four troops seated or sixteen stretcher patients and the HM2 anti-submarine warfare variant has a dipping sonar and sonar-buoys, and a complete electronic warfare suite.|$|E
5|$|The FB-22 was a {{proposed}} medium-range bomber for the USAF. The FB-22 was projected to <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to {{about twice the}} range of the F-22A, while maintaining the F-22's stealth and supersonic speed. However, the FB-22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments, in lieu of a larger subsonic bomber with a much greater range.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado GR1B was a {{specialised}} anti-shipping {{variant of}} the GR1. A total of 26 were converted, which were based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer. Each aircraft was equipped to <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to four Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the missile's seeker for target acquisition, later updates allowed target data to be fed from aircraft to missile.|$|E

5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
5|$|Courageous could <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 48 aircraft; {{following}} {{completion of}} her trials and embarking stores and personnel, she sailed for Spithead on 14 May 1928. The following day, a Blackburn Dart of 463 Flight made the ship's first deck landing. The Dart {{was followed by}} the Fairey Flycatchers of 404 and 407 Flights, the Fairey IIIFs of 445 and 446 Flights and the Darts of 463 and 464 Flight. The ship sailed for Malta on 2 June to join the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Females can <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 {{weeks into}} flat phyllosoma larvae. These feed on {{plankton}} before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths {{of up to}} , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The spiny lobster is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California spiny lobster {{is the subject of}} both commercial and recreational fishery in both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.|$|E
50|$|The funeral {{procession}} traditionally {{ends at the}} center steps on the east front of the Capitol. Exceptions were made for Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and Gerald Ford. Johnson's casket was <b>carried</b> <b>up</b> the Senate wing steps because the center steps were blocked with construction scaffolding from the second inauguration of Richard Nixon which occurred just days earlier. As a break with tradition, Reagan, as former Governor of California, requested that his casket be <b>carried</b> <b>up</b> {{the steps of the}} Capitol's West Front facing California. Ford, as {{a former member of the}} United States House of Representatives, requested that his casket be <b>carried</b> <b>up</b> the House wing steps.|$|R

5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the South Glamorgan County Council leased {{the island}} for the next 99 years. In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the Crown Estate {{starting}} on 12 December 1995. Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve, as stipulated in that lease. It is managed by the Cardiff Council as The Flat Holm Project. The project team operates the Lewis Alexander, a boat which was purpose-built for the crossing to Flat Holm and which is able to <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 45 passengers and essential supplies to the island. The work of the Flat Holm Project {{is supported by the}} registered charity the Flat Holm Society.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, Berlingske {{reported}} that from 2015 the enlarged harbour {{was expected to}} attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to only a dozen smaller ships at present. The larger vessels will <b>carry</b> <b>up</b> to 3,500 passengers. Port of Skagen was covering {{the cost of the}} work which amounted to DKK 226 million (US $41 million). The new harbour would provide new jobs increasing the workforce from some 2,000 today to 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, were reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town was also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of fish meal and fish oil.|$|E
