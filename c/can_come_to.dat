5|$|Peter is {{put under}} house arrest for assault and soon begins to miss his friends. Peter has {{a vision of the}} Pawtucket Patriot, a fictional ale mascot, from his ale can label and on his advice opens a bar in his {{basement}} so that his friends <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> visit. The basement bar soon becomes a local hotspot. Lois is upset about this, until she gets a chance to sing on stage before an appreciative crowd. As she savors the spotlight over the next few days, Peter becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the attention she is getting, especially from the male patrons. Peter demands that she quit singing, but she refuses.|$|E

25|$|According to constructivists, {{the world}} is {{independent}} of human minds, but knowledge of {{the world is}} always a human and social construction. Constructivism opposes the philosophy of objectivism, embracing the belief that a human <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know the truth about the natural world not mediated by scientific approximations with different degrees of validity and accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The National Park Service has {{restored}} eleven rooms, {{including the}} Red Cross offices, the parlors and Barton's bedroom. Visitors to Clara Barton National Historic Site can gain {{a sense of}} how Barton lived and worked. Guides lead tourists through the three levels, emphasizing Barton's use of her unusual home. Modern visitors <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> appreciate the site in the same way visitors did in Clara Barton's lifetime.|$|E
25|$|As the {{organism}} develops, it <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> possess organs that have {{different sets of}} chromosomes. For example, the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with {{a second set of}} chromosomes. This has occurred in humans, and at one time was thought to be extremely rare, though more recent evidence suggests {{that it is not the}} case.|$|E

25|$|I don't. I {{support the}} Hyde Amendment. I hate abortion. I wish people didn't have abortions. I {{believe that the}} Hyde Amendment should remain the law. States should make their decision. Some states decide to do it. Most states decide not to do it. And I think that's the {{appropriate}} way to have this decided. I supported it in New York, but I think, in other places, people <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a different decision.|$|E
25|$|Rock sects {{are also}} common. An iwakura {{is simply a}} rock {{formation}} where a kami is invited to descend, and is therefore holy ground. With time, {{through a process of}} association, the iwakura itself <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be considered divine. Archeological research in Japan confirms these sects to be ancient. In shrines, even today stones considered {{to be related to the}} shrine's kami are used to make food offerings to the kami.|$|E
25|$|The {{heaviest}} {{traffic congestion}} is on Taiwan Boulevard (台灣大道) (formerly Taichung Harbor Road (台中港路)), which <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a stand still not only during rush hour, {{but also on}} weekends or late evenings {{as many of the}} most popular shopping centers and movie theaters are on that stretch of road. Other busy stretches of road include Sanmin Road Section 3 near Chungyo Department Store and Yizhong Street, especially around 9:00pm, when local cram schools and baseball games typically let out.|$|E

25|$|Cultural capital {{refers to}} assets, e.g., competencies, skills, qualifications, which enable holders to {{mobilise}} cultural authority {{and can also}} be a source of misrecognition and symbolic violence. For example, working class children <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see the educational success of their middle-class peers as always legitimate, seeing what is often class-based inequality as instead the result of hard work or even 'natural' ability. A key part of this process is the transformation of people's symbolic or economic inheritance (e.g., accent or property) into cultural capital (e.g., university qualifications).|$|E
25|$|The {{manner of}} {{receiving}} the Eucharist differs throughout the world. In most American Lutheran churches, an older Latin Rite custom is maintained, where a cushioned area and altar rails {{sit at the}} front of the altar where the congregation <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> kneel down and receive the sacrament (as seen in the picture below). Traditionally, only those within the holy office of the ministry distributed both of the communion elements, but it is now the prevailing practice that the Pastor distributes the host and an assistant then distributes the wine. The congregation departs and may make the sign of the cross.|$|E

25|$|The idealist {{perspective}} {{on the number of}} the beast rejects gematria, envisioning the number not as a code to be broken, but a symbol to be understood. Because there are so many names that <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> 666 and that most systems require converting names to other languages or adding titles when convenient, it has been impossible to come to a consensus. Given that numbers are used figuratively throughout the book of Revelation, idealists interpret this number figuratively as well. The common suggestion is that because seven is a number of completeness and is associated with the divine, that six is incomplete and the three sixes mean completely incomplete.|$|E
25|$|The author {{analyzes}} the strategies {{available to the}} U.S. {{to deal with the}} Iran nuclear situation both diplomatically and militarily, and argues combat would not be feasible. Nance warns that war with Iran in order to potentially limit their nuclear capabilities would lead to financial ruin in America, retaliatory strikes against Israel, increased oil values, conflict by Iran with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and closure of shipping lanes for oil. Nance acknowledges that Iran contributes significantly to supporting terrorists activities around the planet, {{but at the same time}} argues that a peaceful resolution to the nuclear issue with the country is worthy of seeing if it <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Estragon dozes off and Vladimir rouses him {{but then}} stops {{him before he}} can share his dreams another {{recurring}} activity between the two men. Estragon wants to hear an old joke, which Vladimir cannot finish without going off to urinate, since every time he starts laughing, a kidney ailment flares up. Upon Vladimir's return, the increasingly jaded Estragon suggests that they hang themselves, but they abandon the idea when the logistics seem ineffective. They then speculate on the potential rewards of continuing to wait for Godot, but <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> no definite conclusions. When Estragon declares his hunger, Vladimir provides a carrot (among a collection of turnips), at which Estragon idly gnaws, loudly reiterating his boredom.|$|E

25|$|When the Committee {{releases}} {{its view}} (or decision) it will outline {{the merits of}} the case or the reasons why it did or did not find that a violation had taken place. It will also include any conclusions drawn by Members whose findings differed from those of the Committee generally. This will be decided on the facts presented in the original complaint as well as taking into account the laws of the State party in conjunction with the rights contained in the ICCPR. If the State had made a reservation to the right in question when acceding to the ICCPR then generally the Committee will respect this, however, in some exceptional cases, they <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion that the reservation itself is not acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The Village of Wish: This is {{the tiny}} town of Wish, where Lyra lives with her parents, Fidget and Faye, and her grandparents, Tangle and Aeval. It’s an insular place, far from cities and civilization. The town is {{surrounded}} by tall walls, not to keep the residents inside, for they have no desire to leave the safety and warmth of their community. The walls are there to keep the outside world outside, and are secured with complex weighted locks first seen in Dream Chronicles. The streets are cobbled, lined with colorful dwellings and stores. Beyond the walls of Wish lie lush forests and winding roads that, eventually, lead to other larger towns. But the folk of Wish have little desire to visit those distant places. Their homes are secure in their beloved village where, they believe, no harm <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E
25|$|Performance jobs include {{playing as}} a freelancer in small groups, {{playing in a}} chamber music group, large ensembles, or {{performing}} solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players {{to be able to}} find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.|$|E
