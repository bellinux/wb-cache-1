This paper models the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times by the Erlang distribution (a generalization of the exponential distribution) to investigate the effect of the variance of the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times on the call completion probability.

40|$|The <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time {{distribution}} in cellular systems {{is one of}} the main parameters that are used to study and analyze several system performance measures.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that due to the {{mobility}} of a portable and limited channel availability, calls of portables may not be completed due to being blocked or terminated during the call initiation or the handover process. The characteristics of the call completion and <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times for both a complete call and an incomplete call, are of critical importance for establishing the actual billing process in the PCS network. In this paper we derive the effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time distributions for complete/incomplete calls with a general cell residence times and a general <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times are analyzed and general computable formulae are obtained.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{personal}} communication service (PCS) network, the call completion probability and the effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times for both complete and incomplete calls are central parameters {{in the network}} cost/performance evaluation. These quantities {{will depend on the}} distributions of <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times and cell residence times. The classical assumptions made in the past that <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times and cell residence times are exponentially distributed are not appropriate for the emerging PCS networks. This paper presents some systematic results on the probability of call completion and the effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time distributions for complete and incomplete calls with general cell residence times and <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times distributed with various distributions such as Gamma, Erlang, hyperexponential, hyper-Erlang, and other staged distributions. These results provide a set of alternatives for PCS network modeling, which can be chosen to accommodate the measured data from PCS field trials. The application of these results in billing rate planning is also discussed.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the arrival}} of calls (i. e., new and handoff calls) in a {{personal}} communications services (PCS) network is modeled by a Markov arrival process (MAP) in which we allow correlation of the interarrival times among new calls, among handoff calls, {{as well as between}} these two kinds of calls. The PCS network consists of homogeneous cells and each cell consists of a finite number of channels. Under the conditions that both cell’s residence time and the requested <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time possess the general phase type (PH) distribution, we obtain the distribution of the channel holding times, the new call blocking probability and the handoff call failure probability. Furthermore, we prove that the cell residence time is PH distribution if and only if • the new <b>call</b> channel <b>holding</b> time is PH distribution; or • the handoff <b>call</b> channel <b>holding</b> time is PH distribution; or • the <b>call</b> channel <b>holding</b> time is PH distribution; provided that the requested <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time is a PH distribution and the total call arrival process is a MAP. Also, we prove that the actual <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time of a non-blocked new call is a mixture of PH distributions. We then developed the Markov process for describing the system and found the complexity of this Markov process. Finally, two interesting measures for the network users, i. e., the duration of new call blocking period and the duration of handoff call blocking period, are introduced; their distributions and the expectations are then obtained explicitly...|$|R

40|$|The Guard Channel (GC) {{scheme is}} an {{extensively}} deployed handover prioritization policy in wireless mobile networks {{due to its}} appealing properties of easy implementation and flexible control. Self-similar traffic has been demonstrated to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in modern communication networks and many measurement {{studies have demonstrated that}} the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times in wireless mobile networks follow heavy-tailed lognormal distributions.
