40|$|Fracture of {{bilateral}} <b>capitulum</b> <b>humeri</b> {{is a very}} rare injury. We present {{a case of a}} 38 -year-old woman, affected by a shear fracture {{of bilateral}} capitellum after a motorcycle accident. Intervention was carried out through a lateral approach on both sides and direct fixation of the fragment with headless screws. Consolidation was achieved and no signs of avascular necrosis occurred at 24 months of follow-up. The patient returned to her previous activities with no functional limitations. To the best of our knowledge, only four cases are reported describing different types of treatment and postoperative period of cast immobilization. According to our review of the literature regarding capitellar fractures, we preferred an immediate postoperative rehabilitation of the elbow, following the stable osteosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{results in}} {{treating}} fractures and dislocations about the elbow may be avoided if the surgeon {{is aware of}} the possible injuries, examines good radiographs of both elbows, and treats the injury promptly and appropriately. A displaced fracture of the lateral or medial condyle of the humerus should be suspected if there is a flake fracture of the adjoining metaphysis; open reduction and internal fixation give better results than closed reduction. A shear fracture of the <b>capitulum</b> <b>humeri</b> can only be seen on a lateral radiograph; excision of the fragment, followed by mobilization, is sufficient for a good functional result. Dislocation of the elbow in a child may avulse the medial epicondyle, which sometimes lodges in the joint; it is essential to recognize this and remove the fragment without delay to avoid early degenerative arthritis. An apparently isolated fracture of the ulna should alert the surgeon to the possibility of a dislocation of the radial head; the dislocation and the fracture must be reduced and stabilized to conserve elbow function...|$|E
40|$|Hypoplasia of the troehlea of the humerus. {{hitherto}} {{seen only}} in Japanese patients and described {{only once in}} the English literature 7, is a rare deformity that sometimes results in ulnar-nerve palsy or cubitus yams, or both. In this covery. We are reporting some interesting roentgenographic and computerized tomographic findings along with an anal ysis of the eases of the other twenty-five patients reported so far in Japan. Fio. I Case I. Anteroposterior roentgenogram of both elbow joints. Note the marked hypoplasia of the trochlea and medial epicondyle. with an oblique humero-ulnar articulation in the left elbow. Inset: Superposed tracings of the distal end of each elbow. The outline of the right humerus has been reversed and overlaps {{the outline of the}} left humerus. The arrow points to a notch between the <b>capitulum</b> <b>humeri</b> and the trochlea. Definite hypoplasia of the medial portion of the distal end of the left humerus is evident. including the medial epicondyle and the trochlea. There is also some enlargement of the lateral portion of the humerus. paper, we report the eases of two patients in whom there was unilateral involvement, in one accompanied by ulnar nerve palsy. That patient was treated by anterior translo cation of the ulnar nerve, with favorable neurological r...|$|E
