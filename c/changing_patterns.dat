5|$|She {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the transposition of Ac and Ds by the <b>changing</b> <b>patterns</b> of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E

25|$|Scallops have a {{large number}} (10–100) of small (about 1mm) eyes {{arranged}} {{along the edge of}} their mantle. These eyes represent a particular innovation among molluscs, relying on a concave, parabolic mirror of guanine crystals to focus and retro-reflect light instead of a lens as found in many other eye types. Additionally, their eyes possess a double-layered retina, the outer retina responding most strongly to light and the inner to abrupt darkness. While these eyes are unable to resolve shapes with high fidelity, the combined sensitivity of both retinas to light entering the eye and light retro-reflected from the mirror grants scallops exceptional contrast definition as well as the ability to detect <b>changing</b> <b>patterns</b> of light and motion. Scallops primarily rely on their eyes as an 'early-warning' threat detection system, scanning around them for movement and shadows which could potentially indicate predators. Additionally, some scallops alter their swimming or feeding behavior based on the turbidity or clarity of the water, by detecting the movement of particulate matter in the water column.|$|E

500|$|The {{philosophy}} of mind also has important {{consequences for the}} concept of self. If by [...] "self" [...] or [...] "I" [...] one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the person, some modern philosophers of mind, such as Daniel Dennett believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered an illusion. The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives {{from the idea of}} an immaterial soul. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of [...] "self" [...] as postulated by David Hume, who could never catch himself not doing, thinking or feeling anything. However, in the light of empirical results from developmental psychology, developmental biology and neuroscience, the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over <b>changing</b> <b>patterns</b> of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.|$|E

500|$|Jasmine {{demonstrates}} several traits, {{beliefs and}} ideologies associated with feminism, exercising much [...] "feminist potential", although notably less explicit than Belle's. Nonetheless, the character still adheres to traditional romance-oriented aspirations {{commonly associated with}} Disney's princess characters despite [...] "her modern, feminist attitude", although her yearning for romance is much more subdued in comparison. Steve Daly of Entertainment Weekly identified Jasmine as [...] "a sexually aware, proto-feminist princess". [...] "New" [...] Exoticisms: <b>Changing</b> <b>Patterns</b> in the Construction of Otherness author Isabel Santaolalla wrote that Jasmine appears to have inherited [...] "the legacy bequeathed by the 1960s Women's Movement." [...] Having [...] "stepped out of the 90s" [...] according to The Washington Posts Desson Howe, Jasmine is appropriately opposed to the glass ceiling." [...] Defying marriage laws and arranged marriages are also among Jasmine's central themes. Larkin believes that her character is responsible for inspiring a change in her kingdom's marriage laws, explaining, [...] "Jasmine didn't just believe in something, she fought against something that she saw was an injustice... She actively sought change and made it happen." [...] Musker agreed that the princess [...] "rebel against the social structure in choosing to marry someone of her own free will". According to singer Brad Kane, who provides Aladdin's singing voice, [...] "Aladdin is a stealth feminist movie" [...] because Jasmine is [...] "willing to give up being a princess to not get stuck marrying someone." [...] Jasmine's defiance eventually successfully convinces her father to change the constitution.|$|E

Slim in stature, Jasmine also lacks obvious character flaws in both her personality and speech Jasmine. Uprooting Racism: How White People Can Work for Racial Justice Ð 3rd Edition author Paul Kivel dubbed this [...] "racial coding", a practice also {{believed to have been}} used to differentiate the good from bad characters in Disney's The Lion King (1994). According to Debating Disney: Pedagogical Perspectives on Commercial Cinema author Douglas Brode, Aladdin [...] "perpetuates the same racial pyramid" [...] present in most of Disney's films, observing that Jasmine, Aladdin and the Sultan – characters at high up on the social hierarchy – appear to be the film's [...] "whitest" [...] characters, while the villainous Jafar speaks with a thick accent and exhibits far more Arabian features. Brode accused Jasmine of [...] "perpetuat damaging stereotypes." [...] Observing that [...] "underneath their multicultural skin [...] all conform to the white, middle-class, thin, feminine ideal of beauty", Gary Burns, author of A Companion to Popular Culture, accused Jasmine of being [...] "an American-accented girl... who battles the traditions of older, heavily accented, traditional Arabs." [...] Despite Disney's attempt to accurately portray the culture of the time period during which the film is set such as a lack of women in powerful positions, Isabel Santaolalla, author of [...] "New" [...] Exoticisms: <b>Changing</b> <b>Patterns</b> in the Construction of Otherness, agreed that Jasmine remains [...] "a vehicle for contemporary gender politics in America" [...] despite her Middle Eastern appearance, explaining, [...] "the film's PC credibility is reserved for Jasmine, but this feistiness probably reflects developments in America more than the realities of 1990s Basrah or Baghdad." [...] Critics also did not appreciate the scene in which Jasmine nearly gets her hand cut off by a merchant as punishment for unintentionally stealing an apple.|$|E

2500|$|They {{are held}} {{to have been the}} land-lords and head-men of the Brahmin villages called agraharams. Sociologist Andre Beteille, in his thesis Caste, class, and power: <b>changing</b> <b>patterns</b> of {{stratification}} in a Tanjore village, describes them as the biggest mirasidars among the Iyer community. They may also have organised the agraharams' defence in turbulent times for though there were not many who joined the army, they were not specifically forbidden to take to arms. A proverb still prevalent amongst the Iyers indicating the supposed short-temper of Vadama Brahmins, may be indicative of their martial past. [...] They were among the Brahmin nobles and administrators under the Nayaka, Travancore and Vijayanagar rulers. Administrative practices adopted by them were strictly in accordance with those prescribed in the Hindu Dharma-Shastras, as may be observed from the records of the kings themselves.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with other}} racial and {{ethnicity}} based terms, formal and common usage have changed markedly through the {{short history of}} this term. Prior to the late 1960s, people of Asian ancestry were usually referred to as Oriental, Asiatic, and Mongoloid. Additionally, the American definition of 'Asian' originally included West Asian ethnic groups, particularly Afghan Americans, Jewish Americans, Armenian Americans, Assyrian Americans, and Arab Americans, although these groups are now considered Middle Eastern American. The term Asian American was coined by historian Yuji Ichioka, who is credited with popularizing the term, to frame a new [...] "inter-ethnic-pan-Asian American self-defining political group" [...] in the late 1960s. <b>Changing</b> <b>patterns</b> of immigration and an extensive period of exclusion of Asian immigrants have resulted in demographic changes that have in turn affected the formal and common understandings of what defines Asian American.

2500|$|Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way {{we learn}} and process new {{information}} in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. In our work environments, {{we are forced to}} focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. [...] "When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different.
