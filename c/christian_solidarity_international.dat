Khojaly Massacre, for example, was confirmed by both Human Rights Watch and Memorial. Maraghar Massacre was testified by British-based organization <b>Christian</b> <b>Solidarity</b> <b>International</b> and by the Vice-Speaker of the British Parliament's House of Lords Caroline Cox in 1992.

50|$|AASG, in {{partnership}} with <b>Christian</b> <b>Solidarity</b> <b>International</b> (CSI), participated in a practice known as slave redemption, whereby aid organizations purchase slaves’ freedom with money from donations. As of 1999, AASG was a fundraiser for CSI. AASG’s and CSI’s slave redemption policy was opposed by UNICEF, which argued that the practice was “intolerable.” Jacobs responded on behalf of AASG that “what is intolerable is to leave these {{women and children in}} the hands of brutal captors” and also disputed UNICEF’s allegations that redemption encourages the purchase of weaponry by injecting US dollars into the Sudanese economy. He has further claimed that slave redemption does not incentivize the slave trade, although he characterized the policy as a “temporary solution” that AASG would abandon if it were deemed counterproductive by the people of Sudan.|$|E
