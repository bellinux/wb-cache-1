5|$|The third door is a vestry door further right, {{leading to}} the small gabled north priests' vestry. It is of {{uncertain}} age and could be of nineteenth century origin. It now includes a modern brick <b>chimney</b> <b>stack.).</b> The priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir sacristy or vestry. This is a slight lean-to structure, with timber glazing to the roof in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between {{the east end of}} the north transept and the original priests' vestry.|$|E
5|$|The central <b>chimney</b> <b>stack</b> exists, but the {{back-to-back}} fireplaces {{have been}} blocked. The staircase may have originally been located {{to one side}} of the back-to-back fireplaces, but no evidence of this remains. There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the attic complete with modern fittings. The first floor and attic was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the first floor, and two bedrooms in the attic. The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E
25|$|In 1879 {{the mine}} was once more reopened, this time under the {{ownership}} of St Just United. The chimney draught of the 1864 chimney was causing problems, and in 1880 the chimney was abandoned and replaced with a new <b>chimney</b> <b>stack</b> further downhill. The 1864 <b>chimney</b> <b>stack</b> was considered a valuable navigational aid, and was not demolished.|$|E

25|$|The fire-tube boiler is characterised by {{internal}} tubes {{connected to the}} firebox that guide the smoke and hot combustion gases through the pressurised wet area of the boiler. These tubes greatly increase the contact area between the hot and the wet areas of the boiler, increasing {{the efficiency of the}} thermal conduction and thermal radiation processes of heat transfer between the two. The combustion gases emerge from the ends of the fire-tubes {{at the front of the}} boiler and are discharged via the smokebox to the <b>chimney</b> (<b>stack</b> or smokestack in the US).|$|E
25|$|The chapel is a plain structure, {{built of}} gritstone with quoins {{at the corners}} and a slate roof. It has a small, {{hexagonal}} bellcote on the west gable. The side walls have two cross-windows with rectangular panes of glass and the gable walls have windows with small diamond-latticed panes of glass. On the south side are two doorways with chamfered surrounds; over one door is a lintel dated 1703. At the north-west corner is a two-storey wing with a tall <b>chimney</b> <b>stack,</b> which was the school house. The building {{is surrounded by a}} drystone wall and the chapel's original cast iron gates survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclined}} plane at Hay, which was last used in 1894, was restored in 1968 {{and again in}} 1975, including the reinstatement of rails. There are {{the remains of a}} building with a <b>chimney</b> <b>stack</b> {{at the top of the}} incline, which was probably the engine house. A grade II listed bridge carries a road over the bottom of the plane. In 1967, the Dawley Development Corporation, who were responsible for Dawley New Town, later renamed Telford, decided that important industrial sites at Coalbrookdale, Coalport, Blists Hill, and several others, should be preserved and restored. Blists Hill Open Air Museum was opened to the public in 1973, and has since become the Blists Hill Victorian Town.|$|E

The {{front of}} the house has an attic behind a parapet with symmetrical castellated <b>chimney</b> <b>stacks</b> at the ends of the building. The crenellated two-storey front porch projects from the facade and is two bays wide.

25|$|Consequently, when Bradley and Samuel Molyneux {{entered this}} sphere of {{research}} in 1725, there was still considerable uncertainty as to whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not, and {{it was with the}} intention of definitely answering this question that they erected a large telescope at Molyneux's house at Kew. They decided to reinvestigate the motion of γ Draconis with a telescope constructed by George Graham (1675–1751), a celebrated instrument-maker. This was fixed to a vertical <b>chimney</b> <b>stack</b> in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of the eyepiece, the amount of which (i.e. the deviation from the vertical) was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a plumb line.|$|E
25|$|Architectural {{punctuation}} of the terraces' front elevations {{was provided}} by tall gables to the terminal and central houses. In the north section the outer terraces had gables intermediate between the central and terminal houses. Different designs of gable window were used in different terraces. Left and right handed houses were used to provide symmetry. In a left-handed house {{the front door was}} {{to the left of the}} ground floor window. In a-right handed house it was to the right. The handedness changed in the centre of the terrace and was marked by a gable house. Between the gable house and its partner was a double <b>chimney</b> <b>stack.</b> Thus there were no chimney stacks on the terminal walls of the terrace and each terminal wall had a front door adjacent to it.|$|E
25|$|The teacher's {{house had}} three levels {{and apart from}} ornate {{external}} stone carving was similar in size and features to the workmen's cottages. The basement contained a storage cellar, pantry and space for a WC. As with the houses and school building it is not certain that any WC's were actually installed. The ground floor contained two living rooms, one with a sink, range and access to a private yard. An entrance hall opened to the stair hall. At the mezzanine landing of the stair was a door into the school corridor. On the first floor there were two bedrooms, each with a fireplace, and a smaller bedroom in the clock tower. Flues from the four fireplaces were carried to a single central <b>chimney</b> <b>stack</b> supported by an arch (hidden in the roof space) across the stair hall. This was unusual and expensive form of construction, but visually impressive.|$|E

500|$|Several years later, Dibnah and {{his family}} went on holiday, to Blackpool. The trip was filmed for {{television}} and showed Dibnah's preference for working rather than holidaying. He did however manage to undertake the removal of a small <b>chimney</b> <b>stack</b> from a business in the town, under a distinctly grey sky and aided by his wife, Alison. His payment for the job was a new front plate for the boiler of his traction engine. Dibnah, however, refused to take any more holidays and, after 18years of marriage, Alison booked and paid for a holiday to Greece, taking their three children (Jayne, Lorna and Caroline) with her. Dibnah remained at home and was surprised when, upon her return, she asked for a divorce. One day in October 1985, Dibnah attended a solid fuel exhibition in nearby Bury. Upon his return he discovered that Alison had left the house, taking with her their three children, the dog and some items of furniture. Short of money, {{he was forced to}} sell his antique AJS motorcycle. He found life without his family difficult but defended his wife: [...] "There is no doubt whatsoever, she were a good help to me and I'm going to miss her. It was just that all the pressure got too much for her." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{first job}} that {{involved}} ladders {{was given to}} him while he still worked as a joiner. [...] He was asked to point a garden wall and then the gable end of the customer's house. [...] He used several short ladders, lashed together with rope and hardboard. [...] This gave Dibnah valuable experience and his employer expanded the business to include property repairs. [...] Aged about 17–18 he climbed the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge, for a 10shilling bet. During the night he took two Union flags {{to the top and}} secured each to the lightning conductors there. The Bolton Evening News reported the incident, with a photograph of Dibnah's feat, but attributed it to the activities of students from Manchester University. At about the same time, Dibnah decided to replace the <b>chimney</b> <b>stack</b> at his mother's house on Alfred Street with one of his own design, as his mother used only one fireplace—leaving four of the five chimney pots redundant. As the single opening {{at the top of the}} new stack was only about [...] wide, the flue needed regular maintenance. On one occasion, he was cleaning the flue using a sack of bricks tied to a rope when the sack ripped open, breaking several lead pipes and flooding his mother's kitchen. After the death of his mother, the house was sold and the council placed a preservation order on the chimney, which remains to this day.|$|E

2500|$|These early towers were {{positioned}} {{either on}} the rooftops of buildings or as free-standing structures, supplied with air by fans or relying on natural airflow.
