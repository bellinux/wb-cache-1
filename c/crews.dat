In the same way b-boy <b>crews</b> were active {{on the east coast}} of the United States spreading breaking throughout New York, funk <b>crews</b> were also active on the west coast spreading the funk styles throughout California. Aside from The Lockers and The Electric Boogaloos, other funk styles <b>crews</b> such as Medea Sirkas/Demons of the Mind, Black Messengers, The Robot Brothers, The Go-Go Brothers, Granny and Robotroid, and Chain Reaction were active during the 1970s performing on stage.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew's effectiveness and competence. The study showed that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulker <b>crews,</b> the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships. <b>Crews</b> on better-maintained ships performed better, as did <b>crews</b> on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced <b>crews</b> were siphoned off to Malta, {{to undertake}} ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The leftover <b>crews,</b> some 75 percent, were {{far off the}} 200 operational hours considered for a pilot to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons. The mixing of experienced <b>crews</b> and the inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced <b>crews</b> to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific <b>crews</b> who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This {{was due to the}} relatively few locomotives in the class for <b>crews</b> to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the <b>crews</b> would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor <b>crews</b> would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor <b>crews</b> typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E
5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive {{for the protection of}} civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight <b>crews</b> and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test <b>crews</b> involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground <b>crews</b> perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great cost to the Stuka <b>crews.</b>|$|E

The <b>Crew</b> Chief is expected to supervise the <b>Crew</b> Members, ensure the scene functions smoothly and make all transport decisions. The Reserve <b>Crew</b> Chief is the on duty shift commander and is expected to oversee the operations of the shift, including responding to calls as necessary. HERU operates 3 shifts per day: the A shift from 0000 to 0800, B shift from 0800 to 1600 and C shift from 1600 to 0000. <b>Crew</b> Members are expected to take 1 shift weekly while <b>Crew</b> Chiefs and Reserve <b>Crew</b> Chiefs take 3 shifts per week.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crew</b> {{committee}} {{is a group}} of adults, led by the <b>crew</b> committee chair, who guide the <b>crew</b> program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment, and registration. The <b>crew</b> must have at least five adults registered with the <b>crew</b> to become a legitimate <b>crew.</b> The <b>crew</b> is led by youths who are elected to the positions of president, one or more vice-presidents, secretary, treasurer, quartermaster, guide, and historian. Other positions in the Venturing <b>crew</b> may exist, such as activity chair. The adult adviser and associate advisers provide guidance while allowing the youth to lead the <b>crew.</b>|$|R
5|$|By late 1942, {{training}} became sufficient {{in quality}} {{and the number of}} <b>crews</b> increased. For example, No. 17 Group RAF produced 238 trained <b>crews</b> in August 1943, using the 1,007 aircraft available. During that year, 1,863 <b>crews</b> totalling some 11,482 men, were trained on 14 different types of aircraft in 255,800 hours. A combination of changed requirements and the formation of more specialist and advanced training overseas reduced the need for further expansion in 1944. The figures in 1943 proved to be the highest annual out put of trained <b>crews</b> in wartime. With sufficient manpower now available, four OTUs were closed in 1944. By July 1944 the 26 syllabuses increased to 38 and the course hours increased to 12 weeks and 87 hours. A/S training was soon set in two stages; conversion training taking five to six weeks and 32 day and night flying training and then an operational phase, in which another 55 hours and 30 sorties were flown in five weeks. This phase included ten flights on radar and gunnery training.|$|E
5|$|<b>Crews</b> still form {{based on}} friendships and neighborhoods. For example, dance crew Diversity—formed in 2007—consists of {{brothers}} and friends from Essex and London. <b>Crews</b> also form {{for other reasons}} such as theme (Jabbawockeez), gender (ReQuest Dance Crew), ethnicity (Kaba Modern), dance style (Massive Monkeys), and age (Hip Op-eration). In 2013, Hip Op-eration performed an exhibition routine at the World Hip Hop Dance Championships in Las Vegas. At the time, their youngest member was 66.|$|E

50|$|Subsequent to the {{decision}} to assign Schmitt to Apollo 17, there remained the question of which <b>crew</b> (the full backup <b>crew</b> of Apollo 15, Dick Gordon, Vance Brand, and Schmitt, or the backup <b>crew</b> of Apollo 14) would become prime <b>crew</b> of the mission. NASA Director of Flight <b>Crew</b> Operations Deke Slayton ultimately assigned the backup <b>crew</b> of Apollo 14 (Cernan and Evans), along with Schmitt, to the prime <b>crew</b> of Apollo 17.|$|R

5|$|Developed {{in tandem}} with the single-player mode, the online {{multiplayer}} mode Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. Up to 30 players freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes). The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points. Players may band together in organised player teams called <b>crews</b> to complete jobs together. Rockstar Games Social Club extends <b>crews</b> formed in Max Payne 3 multiplayer mode to those of Grand Theft Auto Online.

5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} try every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing a large number of <b>crews</b> produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When <b>crews</b> of NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The <b>crews</b> were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the average operating height of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared dossiers for <b>crews</b> to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the lighting systems, such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. <b>Crews</b> were warned about RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber <b>crews</b> of a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E
