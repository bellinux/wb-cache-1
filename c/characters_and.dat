Notwithstanding all this vast amount of data and all of this work that has been done, we find but comparatively little in regard to the individual ear and its various characteristics. Not only was it decided to study the various ear characters in regard to their effect upon the shelling percent, but several other problems were included. The investigations carried on in the study of this problem may be said to cover six lines of investigation as well as various closely associated considerations. These main lines of investigations include the relation existing between: I. Ear <b>character</b> <b>and</b> shelling percent. II. Kernel <b>character</b> <b>and</b> shelling percent. III.
