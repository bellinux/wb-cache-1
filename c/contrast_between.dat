5|$|A {{secondary}} {{division of}} the poem occurs, Tolkien writes, at line 1887, after which all the earlier story is summarized, so a complete account of Beowulf's tragedy is given between 1888 and the end, but without {{the account of the}} gloomy court of Heorot, or of the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> the young Beowulf and the old Hrothgar.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cloth}} is dry, the resist is removed by boiling or {{scraping}} the cloth. The areas treated with resist keep their original colour; when the resist is removed the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern. This process is repeated {{as many times}} as the number of colours desired.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E

5|$|Further aspectual distinctions are encoded {{by the use}} of {{auxiliary}} verbs, primarily {{have and}} be, which encode the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> a perfect and non-perfect past tense (I have run vs. I was running), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (I had been running) and present perfect (I have been running).|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often {{in the spring and}} early summer because of the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> sea and air temperatures. Argentia has 206 days of fog per year. Fog in Newfoundland is {{frequently}} accompanied by strong onshore winds; while usually winds disperse fog, here the fog is too widespread for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|Shakespear has, {{as it were}} by design, {{drawn off}} from Caliban the {{elements}} of whatever is ethereal and refined, to compound them in the unearthly mould of Ariel.

5000|$|Although a phonological {{parallel}} {{exists between}} [...] and , {{the production and}} perception of phonetic <b>contrasts</b> <b>between</b> the two is much weaker, likely because of lower lexical load for , which is limited largely to loanwords from French, and a difficulty in maintaining <b>contrasts</b> <b>between</b> two back rounded semivowels in comparison to front ones.|$|R

5|$|The <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> the Terran {{relationship}} to the planet and the Athshean one is the major example of a larger dialectical structure within the novel, a comparison of opposites. Throughout, the Athsheans are shown as living in balance with their world, while the Terrans despoil it. The Athsheans are shown as a gentle people, in contrast the violence and aggression of the Terrans.|$|E

5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell {{and colleagues}} in their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and monotremes, but argued that Ambondro was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> the talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E
5|$|Arp and Janco {{drifted away}} from the {{movement}} ca. 1919, when they created the Constructivist-inspired workshop Das Neue Leben. In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity. When Vinea submitted his poem Doleanțe ("Grievances") {{to be published by}} Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.|$|E
5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>between</b> arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|E

5|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} early adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Sullivan's play influenced subsequent versions. Later adaptations followed his simplification of the narrative, addition of women characters (especially a romance for Jekyll) and highlighting of the moral <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> Jekyll and Hyde. Most versions retain the practice of having one actor play Jekyll and Hyde, with the transformation seen by the audience. Several early film versions relied more on Sullivan's play than Stevenson's novella.|$|E
5|$|Duncan and Fogarty (1984) {{argued that}} the key {{difference}} lies in the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> the stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E
5|$|In that time, the Christian {{faith was}} {{shaken by the}} <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> Miaphysites and Chalcedonians. These were two {{opposing}} christological positions; the Chalcedonians claimed that Christ had both human and divine natures, while the Miaphysites claimed he had only one single united nature. The Council of Chalcedon, convoked by Emperor Marcian in 451, had ruled out Miaphysitism, {{with the support of}} the pope in the West and many bishops in the East. However, the Miaphysite position was still strong: the two Miaphysite Patriarchs Timothy Aelurus of Alexandria and Peter the Fuller of Antioch were deposed.|$|E
