40|$|Nowadays {{most of the}} {{confidential}} {{works are}} carried under surveillance like Bank affairs, Research works, Enterprise projects etc. In this case, there is threat of capturing the confidential password of a user through surveillance cameras. Thesepasswords can also be captured through human surveillance (i. e. keen human observation) {{as well as a}} malicious program that run in background without user’s knowledge. Serious problem arises if these confidential credentials go into wrong hands. Just typing the password in form of hidden characters does not avoid this problem. For this purpose, a security system has to be used that willprovide privacy to passwordseven under surveillance. Time based dynamic password system (TBDP) provides privacy <b>to</b> the user’s <b>login</b> credentials by accepting varying password time to time. Password at particular time can’t be accepted later. Users will be given privilege to define their own transformation logic using clock values that generates a time dependant password from a constant string (i. e. basic password declared by user). Here, transformation logic is based on variable insertion technique. At the time of login, users estimate their current password by collaborating the basic password and transformation logic defined over it and tries <b>to</b> <b>login</b> the system with those estimated credentials. Simultaneously, authentication system generates time varying password from Basic password and Transformation logic defined by user. Access is granted if the credentials are found to be valid at that time. In this way, this password system provides privacy <b>to</b> <b>login</b> credentials even under surveillance...|$|R

Second, the attacker may obtain the victim’s keystroke timing data and imitate the victim’s keystroke as shown in (Meng et al. 2013).

To address this problem, we propose a modification of the protocol, by adding a message authentication mechanism; this protocol has been verified with AVISPA to be safe from the masquerade attack. Finally, we sketch a JavaScript implementation of the modified protocol. ...|$|R
