The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, occurred from June to October, attacking Kenaf for a long period. The scarabeid beetle, Anomala albopilosa albopilosa, occurred from mid-June to end of September and also at tacked long period, too. The beetle fed so many leaves per capita that the kenaf plant was made to be perished. It was from August to September that the other three pests of caterpillers occurred densly.

40|$|The <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roller,</b> Sylepta derogata, is a silk-producing insect pest. While young larvae {{feed on the}} {{underside}} of leaves, the older ones roll cotton leaves and feed on the leaf edges, which defoliates cotton plants. The larvae produce silk to stabilize the rolled leaf and to balloon from used to new leaves. Despite the significance of silk in the biology of pest insect species, there is virtually no information on the genes involved in their silk pro-duction. This is a substantial knowledge gap because some of these genes may be valu-able targets for developing molecular pest management technologies. We addressed the gap by posing the hypothesis that silk gland gene expression changes during the transition from larvae to pupae. We tested our hypothesis using RNA-seq to investigate changes in silk gland gene expression at three developmental stages, 5 th instar larvae (silk producing; 15, 445, 926 clean reads), prepupae (reduced silk producing; 13, 758, 154) and pupae (beyond silk producing; 16, 787, 792). We recorded 60, 298 unigenes and mapped 50, 158 (larvae), 48, 415 (prepupae) and 46, 623 (pupae) of them to the NCBI database.

40|$|The {{importance}} of mutualism is receiving more attention in community ecology. In this study, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta {{was found to}} take advantage of the shelters constructed by the <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Sylepta derogata to protect mealybugs (Phenacoccus solenopsis) against their natural enemies. This protective effect of fire ant tending on the survival of mealybugs in shelters was observed when enemies and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> were simultaneously present. Specifically, fire ants moved the mealybugs inside the shelters produced by S. derogata on enemy-infested plants. Compared with that in plants without ants, the survival of mealybugs in shelters in the presence of natural enemies in plants with ants markedly improved. Both the protection of ants and the shelters provided by <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> did not affect the survival of mealybugs in the absence of enemies in plants.

40|$|<b>Cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl disease (CLCuD) causing viruses {{belong to}} the Begomovirus genus of the family Geminiviridae. Most begomoviruses are bipartite with two {{molecules}} of circular single stranded DNA (A and B) encapsidated in icosahedral geminate particles. However, the begomoviruses associated with CLCuD have DNA-β instead of DNA-B. In this communication we report the complete genomic sequence of DNA-A component of two CLCuD-causing begomoviruses, <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Kokhran virus-Dabawali (CLCuKV-Dab), tomato leaf curl Bangalore virus-Cotton [Fatehabad] (ToLCBV-Cotton [Fat]) and partial sequences of two other isolates <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Rajasthan virus-Bangalore (CLCuRV-Ban) and <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curlKokhran virus-Ganganagar (CLCuKV-Gang). A phylogenetic analysis of these isolates along with other related begomoviruses showed that ToLCBV-Cotton [Fat] isolate was closest to the tomato leaf curl Bangalore virus- 5 (ToLCBV-Ban 5) where as CLCuKV-Dab isolate {{was close to the}} <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Kokhran virus-Faisalabad 1 (CLCuKV-Fai 1), <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Kokhran virus- 72 b (CLCuKV- 72 b) and <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Kokhran virus- 806 b (CLCuKV- 806 b) isolates from Pakistan. The phylogenetic analysis further showed that the ToLCBV-Cotton [Fat] and CLCuKV-Dab isolates along with CLCuKVFai 1, CLCuKV- 72 b andCLCuKV- 806 b are closer to theToLCBV, tomato leaf curl Gujarat virus (ToLCGV), tomato leaf curl Gujarat virus-Varanasi (ToLCGV-Var) and tomato leaf curl Sri Lanka virus (ToLCSLV) isolates, where as <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Alabad virus- 804 a (CLCuAV- 804 a), <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Multhan virus (CLCuMV) cluster with the isolates from <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Rajasthan virus (CLCuRV) and okra yellow vein mosaic virus (OYVMV). These results demonstrate the extensive variability observed in this group of viruses. TheAC 4 ORF is the least conserved among these viruses. In order to further asses the variability in the CLCuDcausing begomoviruses, the region showing minimum similarity in the DNA-A sequence was first determined by a comparison of segments of different lengths of the aligned sequences. The results indicated that region 2411 – 424 (771 nt) was the least conserved. A phylogenetic tree constructed using the sequences of all the CLCuD causing begomoviruses, corresponding to the least conserved region showed that they form two distinct clusters...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl disease (CLCuD) is {{a severe}} disease of cotton {{that occurs in}} Africa and Pakistan/northwestern India. The disease is caused by begomoviruses in {{association}} with specific betasatellites that differ between Africa and Asia. During survey of symptomatic cotton in Sindh (southern Pakistan) <b>Cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Gezira virus (CLCuGV), the begomovirus associated with CLCuD in Africa, was identified. However, the cognate African betasatellite (<b>Cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Gezira betasatellite) was not found. Instead, two Asian betasatellites, the CLCuD-associated <b>Cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB) and Chilli leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) were identified. Inoculation of the experimental plant species Nicotiana benthamiana showed that CLCuGV was competent to maintain both CLCuMB and ChLCB. Interestingly, the enations typical of CLCuD were only induced by CLCuGV {{in the presence of}} CLCuMB. Also in infections involving both CLCuMB and ChLCB the enations typical of CLCuMB were less evident.

40|$|Background <b>Cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl {{disease in}} the Indian subcontinent is {{associated}} with several distinct begomoviruses that interact with a disease-specific DNA satellite named <b>Cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB). However, we have recently reported that Chili leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) is also occasionally found associated with the disease in Pakistan. The {{question as to whether}} ChLCB contributes to the development of disease symptoms such as leaf curling and enations remain to be answered. We have previously shown that the expression of βC 1 of CLCuMB develops all symptoms of <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl disease in Nicotiana benthamiana when expressed from PVX vector. Findings The role of ChLCB in the induction of typical disease symptoms was studied by its expression from PVX vector in N. benthamiana. The expression of βC 1 from PVX vector developed severe leaf curl symptoms and leaf-like enations that resemble the phenotype induced by βC 1 of CLCuMB. Conclusions The results presented here show that the expression of βC 1 of ChLCB from PVX vector exhibit phenotype typical of <b>cotton</b> <b>leaf</b> curl and therefore ChLCB may contribute to the disease symptoms. </p...|$|R
