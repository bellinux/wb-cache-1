40|$|ObjectiveEffects of {{ventricular}} restraint on {{the left}} ventricle are well documented, but effects on the right ventricle are not. We hypothesized that restraint affects {{the right and left}} ventricles differently. MethodsWe studied acute effects of restraint on left and right ventricular mechanics in healthy sheep (n = 14) with our previously described technique of adjustable and measurable restraint. Transmural pressure, myocardial oxygen <b>consumption</b> <b>indices,</b> diastolic compliance, and end-systolic elastance were assessed at 4 restraint levels for both ventricles. We then studied long-term effects of restraint for 4 months in an ovine model of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 6). Heart failure was induced by coronary artery ligation, and polypropylene mesh was wrapped around the heart to simulate clinical restraint therapy. All subjects were followed up with serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess left and right ventricular volumes and function. ResultsRestraint decreased left ventricular transmural pressure (P <. 03) and myocardial oxygen <b>consumption</b> <b>indices</b> (P <. 05) but not left ventricular diastolic compliance (P =. 52). Restraint had no effect on right ventricular transmural pressure (P =. 82) or myocardial oxygen <b>consumption</b> <b>indices</b> (P =. 72) but reduced right ventricular diastolic compliance (P <. 01). In long-term studies, restraint led to reverse left ventricular remodeling with decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (P <. 006) but did not affect right ventricular end-diastolic volume (P =. 82). ConclusionsVentricular restraint affects the left and right ventricles differently. Benefits of restraint for right ventricular function are unclear. The left ventricle can tolerate more restraint than the right ventricle. With current devices, the right ventricle may limit overall therapeutic efficacy...|$|R

50|$|China {{has passed}} much more {{legislation}} for pangolin protection than other countries, because the species' population has drastically declined in China {{over the last}} few decades. This is the direct result of extreme poaching for pangolin scales and meat. Clearly, though, legislation is not enough and alternatives to laws need to be considered. The IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group made a proposal in July 2014 to increase awareness, funding, and research for pangolin conservation. Some of the plan's highlights include making protocols to monitor pangolin populations, establishing a <b>consumption</b> <b>index</b> of pangolin products, using DNA analysis to determine variation between and within species, and identifying species strongholds to determine best allocation of resources. Furthermore, the conservation plan aims to increase patrol-based monitoring around stronghold populations, increase awareness and education about the severity of the problem, and, most importantly, implement a demand reduction strategy for pangolin meat and scales.|$|E
