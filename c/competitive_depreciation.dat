40|$|Although most CIS and East Asian {{countries}} are de jure classified as free floaters, they de facto pursue (tight) dollar pegs. This paper emphasizes dollar denomination of short-term and long-term payment flows as reasons for exchange rate stabilization. Based on {{the analysis of}} "competitive depreciations" and "competitive appreciations" among the CIS and East Asian currencies {{it is argued that}} the adherence to a common external anchor currency enhances macroeconomic stability. Finally, the potential of euro and ruble (CIS) as well as yen and yuan (East Asia) to challenge the dollar as anchor currencies in the respective regions is explored.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} a {{regional}} bias resulting from trade integration alters the transmission of a country’s monetary policy by shifting {{the burden of the}} exchange rate adjustment towards the less integrated trading partners. I first develop a simple model which illustrates how a concentration of trade flows among regional trading partners affects the sensitivity of the trade balance to the terms-of-trade. In particular, the trade balance becomes less sensitive to the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis regional partners and more sensitive to the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis the other country. I then test the implication of the model using a panel of 133 countries between 1985 - 2010 that includes information on Regional Trade Agreements (RTA). I find that movements in the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis non-RTA members affect a country’s trade balance, while movements vis-a-vis RTA partners do not. trade balance, regional trade agreements, <b>competitive</b> <b>depreciation,</b> economic integration, terms-of-trad...|$|E
40|$|The 2010 European {{debt crisis}} has revived the {{discussion}} concerning the optimum adjustment {{strategy in the}} face of asymmetric shocks. Whereas Mundell's (1961) seminal theory on optimum currency areas suggests depreciation {{in the face of}} crisis, the most recent emergence of <b>competitive</b> <b>depreciations,</b> <b>competitive</b> interest rate cuts or currency wars questions the exchange rate as an adjustment tool to asymmetric economic development. This paper approaches the question from a theoretical perspective by confronting exchange rate based adjustment with crisis adjustment via price and wage cuts. Econometric estimations yield a negative impact of exchange rate flexibility/ volatility on growth, which is found to be particularly strong for countries with asymmetric business cycles and during recessions. Based on these findings we support a further enlargement of the European Monetary Union and recommend more exchange rate stability {{for the rest of the}} world.

40|$|The Asian {{currency}} crisis {{led to a}} hit on China's export growth and the economic growth. This paper provides a small open economy with both a fixed exchange rate and capital controls to analyze what kind of macroeconomic policy can contribute to China's export growth and the economic growth. We find that, an unanticipated permanent devaluation in the nominal exchange rate and reduction in the nominal money supply under the capital controls can make chinese economic growth and export growth compatible. However, the latter will {{be better than the}} former since the former may trigger <b>competitive</b> <b>depreciations</b> of exchange rates in the near neighbor countries. On the other hand, fiscal policies cannot bring the compatible growths...|$|R
40|$|Abstract * This paper evaluates how {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis emanating from the U. S. was transmitted to emerging markets. Our {{focus is on the}} extent that the crisis caused external market pressures (EMP), and whether the absorption of the shock was mainly through exchange rate depreciation or the loss of international reserves. Controlling for variety of factors associated with EMP, we find clear evidence that emerging markets with higher total foreign liabilities, including short- and long-term debt, equities, FDI and derivative products—had greater exposure and were much more vulnerable to the financial crisis. Countries with large balance sheet exposure [...] high external portfolio liabilities exceeding international reserves—absorbed the global shock by allowing greater exchange rate depreciation and comparatively less reserve loss. Despite the remarkable buildup of international reserves by emerging markets during the period prior to the financial crisis, countries relied primarily on exchange rate depreciation rather than reserve loss to absorb most of the exchange market pressure shock. This could reflect a deliberate choice (“fear of reserve loss ” or <b>competitive</b> <b>depreciations)</b> or market actions that caused very rapid exchange rate adjustment, especially in emerging markets with open capital markets, overwhelming policy actions...|$|R
40|$|After a 30 -year absence, {{calls for}} {{international}} coordination of macroeconomic policy are back. This time the issues go by names like currency wars, taper tantrums, and fiscal compacts. In traditional game theory terms, {{the existence of}} spillovers may imply that countries are better off if they coordinate policies than under the Nash non-cooperative equilibrium. But {{what is the nature}} of the spillover and the coordination? The paper interprets recent macroeconomic history in terms of four possible frameworks for proposals to coordinate fiscal policy or monetary policy: the locomotive game, the discipline game, the <b>competitive</b> <b>depreciation</b> game (currency wars) and the competitive appreciation game. [The paper also considers claims that monetary coordination has been made necessary by the zero lower bound among advanced countries or financial imperfections among emerging markets. ] Perceptions of the sign of spillovers and proposals for the direction of coordination vary widely. The existence of different models and different domestic interests may be as important as the difference between cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria. In some cases complaints about foreigners’ actions and calls for cooperation may obscure the need to settle disagreements domestically...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{regional}} trade integration shifts {{the burden of the}} exchange rate adjustment towards the less integrated trading partners. Thus, they bear the cost of trade balance expansion, while competitive exchange rate moves vis-a-vis RTA trading partners result in no expansion or deterioration of the overall trade balance. First, using the data on 138 countries since 1990 that have been envolved in {{regional trade integration}} through signing regional trade agreements (RTAs), this paper shows that upon a 10 % depreciation towards non-RTA trading partners results in a 4. 4 % improvement of the aggregate trade balance. A similar <b>competitive</b> <b>depreciation</b> towards RTA trading partners has resulted on average 3. 7 % deterioration of the aggregate trade balance. Second, I confirm that RTA participation can act as a good proxy for trade integration, and test the results with alternative measures of trade balance. Third, I use a simple model framework based on the current account adjustments to put the empirical findings into the theoretical frame. Altogether, this paper indicates that regional trade integration in the form of RTA should be taken into account in questions related to the competitive exchange rate effects and trade balance adjustment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the novel fact that Regional Trade Agreements (RTA) decrease bilateral trade imbalances {{as measured by}} conventional measure of the net export share in gross trade. While on average an RTA decreases bilateral trade imbalance by 7 %, greater trade integration through a deeper RTA {{is associated with a}} reduction of up to 50 % among the sample of over 160 countries since 1960. This implies, that the recent surge in net trade balances has appeared on behalf of the trade between countries that are not involved in RTA integration. The driving channel is the enhancement of cross-border activity and increase in the global value chain integration among RTA members. Overall, this paper implies that the levels of RTA integration should be accounted for in the assessment of aggregate trade balances as the share of GDP, as trade flows bounded by different level of RTA integration will have different reactions to the same shocks. Additionally, I show that RTAs made trade more balanced among its members, and that global increase in the global trade imbalances happened on the expense of the non-RTA trading partners. trade balance, regional trade agreements, <b>competitive</b> <b>depreciation,</b> economic integration, terms-of-trad...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent <b>competitive</b> <b>depreciations,</b> {{excessive}} inflows of foreign capital and crisis contagion in the region, cooperation in exchange rate and monetary policy is very desirable, {{considering the fact that}} countries in East Asia have high trade dependence among them and similar trade patterns with each other. The BBC system proposed will be examined and the new BBC system will be suggested. The BBC system is desirable as a new exchange rate system in Korea. Singapore has been successful with the BBC system since the early 1980 s. It would be more desirable that East Asia adopt the flexible BBC (basket, band, crawl) exchange rate system jointly. Participating countries of East Asia including Japan link their exchange rates to their currency basket (ACU) with bands and the ACU is linked to the basket of the dollar and euro by a regional agency. It will stabilize real effective exchange rates of East Asian countries and reduce excessive short term capital flows into developing East Asian countries. In addition to the above flexible BBC exchange rate system the U. S. and Japan can fix the yen/dollar exchange rate within a band in the short- and medium-run and fix the rate in the long-term. It will further reduce excessive capital inflows into developing countries in the region. Without stabilizing the yen/dollar exchange rate, interest rates of Japan will continue to be lower than those of the U. S. and emerging East Asian countries, and yen-carry trade and excessive capital inflows in developing East Asia will appear when the expected exchange rate of the yen is uncertain or weak. And sudden outflow of short-term capital will follow later. The ACU is linked to the basket of the dollar and yen, and participating countries in the region link their exchange rates to the ACU with bands. The yen is included in the outside basket, but not in the regional basket in this alternative scheme. This scheme will stabilize exchange rates of emerging East Asian countries against the yen and dollar more effectively. When they crawl their central rates within bands, real effective exchange rates (REERs) using unit labor cost indices need to be used to keep their export competitiveness constant. Sound and consistent economic policies are essential for success of the BBC system. Singapore experiences with the BBC system provide good lessons. Prudential fiscal policy, flexible prices of goods and productive factors, proper interest policy and effective use of foreign reserves are needed. Joint or independent capital control could be helpful in the face of excessive capital inflows. Other measures for financial cooperation are discussed also. exchange rate cooperation, asset inflation, currency basket, yen-carry trade...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{difficulties}} {{created by the}} economic crisis, many exporters have criticized the National Bank of Romania (NBR) ’s policy regarding the exchange rate evolution. They argue that depreciation is {{a necessary condition for}} recovery and not financial stability. On the contrary, Romania cannot afford a shock in the exchange rate level. The risk associated with such a measure is too high for an emerging country and it annihilates any export <b>competitive</b> advantages. Therefore, <b>depreciation</b> may delay the imperative of Romanian economic recovery. A solid economic recovery should have as starting point a financial system sound and stable. Excessive exchange rate depreciation jeopardizes the financial soundness of banks and the borrower’s ability to repay their loans. Therefore, it creates inflationary flare-ups, particularly dangerous for the economy of any state. exchange rate, economic growth, Romania, euro, leu, depreciation, appreciation...|$|R
