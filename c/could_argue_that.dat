The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone.

He also restored nunneries, working with his ally, Queen Ælfthryth. He did not merely attempt to revive the historical church, but also to improve it by inventing dubious pedigrees for his houses. He was the main propagandist for the movement, and wrote all the major works supporting it in England during Edgar's reign.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} race, a superior–inferior {{relationship}} with valuation is also accordingly implied, {{as it is}} unmistakable in virtually all interactions between whites and blacks in the Tarzan stories, and similar relationships and valuations {{can be seen in}} most other interactions between differing people, although one <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> such interactions are the bedrock of the dramatic narrative and without such valuations there is no story.

25|$|Because of the unorthodox {{nature of}} hand and body position, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to get a lot of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch hitting, is adept at this, but one <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan's six off Robin Peterson. South Africa's AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays reverse sweep.|$|E
25|$|In 1198 (or 1199) Vladimir II Yaroslavich of Halych died, and {{his death}} created a {{political}} vacuum {{that a number}} of claimants were eager to fill. Ryurik Rostislavich could now claim that, after the dynasty of Halych became defunct, the territory reverted to the jurisdiction of the prince of Kyiv; the princes of the two branches of the Olgovichi (the princes of Chernigov) <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> their marriage ties with the defunct dynasty gave them the right to rule Halych; and the Hungarians had already made a bid for the domain ten years earlier. The Galicians asked Ryurik Rostislavich for his son Rostislav Ryurikovich, but Roman rode to Duke Leszek I of Poland (1194–1227), promising to be at his beck and call if the Polish ruler helped him to win Halych. When the citizens refused to welcome Roman, Duke Leszek I besieged the town, and after capturing it, he forced the townspeople to accept Roman as prince. Roman promised to be subservient to the duke of Poland and to live in peace with his new subjects.|$|E
25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Sweden was instigated by King Gustav I (1523–60) {{and within}} the half century {{following}} his death had become established as a Lutheran state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself {{under the control of}} the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of Gustav III (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in praxis means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of cuius regio, eius religio one <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.|$|E
25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by Aneurin Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course could say the same thing; he <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he is saying, and he may be, then he is too stupid to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to exploring {{the trials and}} tribulations of achieving the great American dream during the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme, exemplifying in Daisy Buchanan's character the marginalization {{of women in the}} East Egg social class that Fitzgerald depicts. As an upper-class, white woman living in East Egg during this time period in America, Daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations, including but certainly not limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife, mother, keeper of the house, and charming socialite. As the reader finds in the novel, many of Daisy's choices, ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved, can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a [...] "beautiful little fool" [...] who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. For instance, one <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Daisy's ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby {{can be attributed to the}} status, security, and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides.

500|$|O'Hara {{made her}} screen debut in Walter Forde's Kicking the Moon Around (1938), {{although}} she did not consider it {{a part of her}} filmography. Richman had introduced her to Forde at Elstree Studios, but as she was not cast in the film in a notable role, she agreed to deliver one line in it as a favor to Richman for helping with her screen test. Laughton arranged for her to appear in the low-budget musical My Irish Molly (1938), the only film she made under her real name, Maureen FitzSimons. In the film she plays a woman named Eiléen O'Shea who rescues an orphan girl named Molly. Biographer Aubrey Malone stated of it: [...] "One <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> O'Hara never looked as enticing as she does in Little Miss Molly, even if she isn't 'Maureen O'Hara' quite yet. She wears no makeup, and there's no Hollywood glamour, but despite (or because of?) that, she is rapturously beautiful. Her accent is thick, which is perhaps why she didn't mention the film much. It also looks as if it were made in the 1920s rather than the 1930s, so primitive are the sets and characters". Malone added that though the lot was [...] "ham-fisted", it is a [...] "quaint film which O'Hara scholars should view if only to see early evidence of her natural instinct for dramatic timing and scene interpretation".|$|E
500|$|Doug Pratt, a DVD {{reviewer}} and Rolling Stone contributor, {{thought the}} episode's story was [...] "nicely composed, so you don't {{have to recognize}} the Citizen Kane references to appreciate the effort, but it adds to the fun."

[...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk thought both Lisa's [...] "tremendous intellect" [...] and Marge's [...] "moral compass" [...] were [...] "probed" [...] in the episode, and he thought one [...] "clear highlight" [...] of the episode was Burns's attempts to explain away Blinky's mutation by turning to an actor portraying Charles Darwin who proceeds to give a speech suggesting that Blinky is merely advanced. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "The episode took an unusual approach for an early show, as it focused largely on a secondary character. One <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> season one’s 'Krusty Gets Busted' did the same, but 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish' provided a heavier emphasis on Burns than that prior program did Krusty. This helped make it a fairly good episode. It fleshed out Burns’ character a little better and gave us a reasonably entertaining experience. The episode fell short of greatness, but it worked nicely for the most part." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "masterful".|$|E

[...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons of}} the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy will be hard to match." ...|$|E
