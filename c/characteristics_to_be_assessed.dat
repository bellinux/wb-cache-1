In short, in the synthetic approach, the assumption is that those with authoritarian personality characteristics are assessed with researcher's intuitive model of what characteristics fit the criterion role requirements of the predicted situation (support of Fascism). Hence, it is not a completely empirical approach to prediction, but rather based on [...] "arm chair" [...] situational analysis of the criteria, and intuited psychological <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> that fit the situation. More recently, Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003) have presented how the traditional research in authoritarianism or conservatism has confounded the psychological variables (e.g., personality characteristics) with the political criteria (conservative attitudes). Hence the scales measuring individual differences on authoritarianism often include the criteria attitudinal statements of political ideologies.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a valid and {{reliable}} instrument to assess the problem solving skills of five-year-old children receiving environmental education. The study included 156 children selected from the study population using the simple random sampling method. The literature was reviewed for Turkish and foreign studies on environmental education for children, improvement of problem solving skills, environmental education and problem solving skills to develop the Scale for Problem Solving in Environmental Education (SPSEE). Specialists' opinions were obtained, exploratory factor analysis was performed, and total item correlation, bottom and top group mean difference, Cronbach's Alpha internal consistency coefficient and test-retest correlation coefficients were calculated. The data were analysed using the SPSS 22 package. The exploratory factor analysis showed that the scale has 14 questions and two factors. Questions were prepared for each activity and the answers for these questions were formed in a three-point Likert-type scale. One of the researchers applied this scale to each child. The researchers prepared a guidebook, activities, a CD including these activities and a booklet including pictures to apply the scale. The pictures in the booklet were obtained from various activity books used in preschool education. The first researcher applied the scale by asking the questions in the booklet. The items of the SPSEE <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> sufficiently discriminate the individuals according to the scale's factor loads and total item correlation, and the study sample <b>was</b> determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appropriate and sufficient for factor analysis. The significant difference (p< 0. 01) between the mean scores of the bottom 27 % and top 27 % groups <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> determine how the SPSEE subscales discriminated the individuals who have the <b>characteristic</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> at a higher and lower level.

Environmental concerns, such as the ozone depletion effect of chlorofluorocarbons, have led to an international agreement on the reduction and eventual elimination of these refrigerants. Alternative, ozone-safe refrigerants have been developed and their evaporation <b>characteristics</b> need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> A single-tube evaporation test facility has been designed and built <b>to</b> measure these <b>characteristics.</b> An instrumented, eight-foot long (2. 44 m), 0. 402 -inch (10. 21 mm) inside diameter evaporation test section equipped with SCRcontrolled, surface wrapped heaters is the main feature of the design. Leak testing and a preliminary system shakedown have been successfully completed. Baseline testing using CFC- 12 as the reference fluid has been conducted. Mass fluxes were tested over the range of 100, 000 Ibmlhreft 2 (135 kg/sem 2) to 400, 000 Ibmlhreft 2 (540 kg/s??m 2), and heat fluxes were varied from 1600 Btulhreft 2 (5. 1 kW/m 2) to 6400 Btulhr??ft 2 (20. 4 kW/m 2). Evaporation temperatures were between 40 OF (4. 4 OC) and 52 OF (11. 1 OC) with inlet qualities of 20 to 60 percent. Expected trends in the data were observed. Average heat transfer coefficients compared closely with average heat transfer coefficients calculated from correlations of Chaddock-Noerager, Kandlikar, Shah, and Pierre. However, uncertainty in both temperature and heat input measurements require further improvements to the system.

While the previous curriculum learning orientation was partially in accordance to the the subjects or competencies characteristics to be achieved.

The result of study illustrates that the teacher‘s readiness to the curriculum implementing in accordance to the learning assessment can be divided into two aspects, namely: assessment planning, and assessment implementation. The results of the study by Amat Jaedun et al.

40|$|Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy {{were used}} {{systematically}} {{to investigate the}} morphology, uniformity, coverage {{and structure of the}} thin films of several commercially important insulating polymers. Despite the poorly conducting nature of the polymer sample, detailed and convincing images of this class of materials were achieved by STM without the need to coat the samples with a conductive layer. The polymer regions of the sample were further investigated by the use of surface profiling with 'line scans'. The fluctuations of the amplitude therein enabled important film <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> An environmental stage was designed for the STM to enable the effect of various vapour-sample interactions to be observed during the imaging process. Using the data from the environmental stage in addition to the surface profiling with line scans, an insight into the conduction mechanism and image interpretation was gained. Results suggest that the water content of the sample and its immediate surroundings {{is an important factor in}} achieving reliable STM images in air. The initial study culminated with the observation by STM alone of the plasticizer induced crystallization of uncoated PC thin films. The 'amorphous' PC films were observed before crystallization and small ordered regions in roughly the same proportion as that predicted by diffraction studies [Prietschk, 1959 and Schnell, 1964] were imaged. This has never been observed by a microscopy technique. Furthermore, images of the crystalline film contained elongated units that were attributed to the lamellae formations that form the basic building blocks of polymer spherulites. The study continued with the AFM imaging of the growth of crystalline entities in a PC film, without the need for harsh sample treatment or metal coating. A method of casting and crystallizing the films was developed such that the growth was predominantly in two dimensions and consequently ideal for observation by AFM. Different stages of crystalline growth were observed, starting with pre-spherulitic material and finishing with fully developed spherulites; a process giving a broad insight into the crystallization process at a resolution unobtainable by most other microscopy techniques. The kinetics of growth of the spherulites within the two dimensional film can be gained from the Avrami exponent 'n'. The results presented here show that SPM can be used not only to provide a value of n (from uncoated samples), but in doing so provide very high resolution images of the film at key stages of development. In addition the size of the spherulites was controlled by the 'seeding' of the film by a suitable nucleating agent. The analysis indicates that the predominant nucleation process occurs at heterogeneities and not homogeneities in the film. Further to the size and growth rate of the spherulites, Daniewska et al [1986] suggested (although were unable to substantiate) that the structure of the spherulites fibrils was influenced by the chemical nature of the solvent Results reported here confirm that the fibril structure and spherulite size was significantly affected by the chemical nature of the plasticizing solvent. Detailed observations of the spherulites are included herein. A tapping mode AFM was used in conjunction with the usual contact mode AFM to image the fine spherulitic lamellae structure. It was found that the AFM operated in the tapping mode was less destructive than when operated in the contact mode and gave higher resolution images of the lamellae structure. The lamellae were found to be structurally very similar to the features observed in the study using STM indicating that under certain circumstances, the STM was less destructive over the 'insulating' polymer than the contact mode AFM.

40|$|The study <b>was</b> {{designed}} <b>to</b> {{facilitate the}} development of a set of guidelines which could be used by administrative personnel at Kokomo-Center Township Consolidated School Corporation (KCTCSC) in planning and implementing a program of administrative evaluation. A review of literature and research concerning administrative evaluation programs <b>was</b> made <b>to</b> identify principles and desirable practices relative to {{the development of}} evaluation philosophy and activities. The review of literature also <b>was</b> intended <b>to</b> focus upon the purpose of evaluation, responsibilities for making evaluations, criteria for evaluation, and acceptance of evaluation procedures and techniques by the administrative team members. The study included a review and analysis of evaluation programs conducted within the nineteen member school systems of the Indiana Public School Study Council as of January 1979. Twelve superintendents of the member school systems provided written descriptive materials. Selected materials were analyzed {{in order to determine the}} nature, scope, and procedural characteristics of practical, ongoing evaluation programs. The study also included a KCTCSC team survey. The survey was designed by a committee of representative administrators to solicit the opinions of all administrative team members of KCTCSC on eight specific areas affecting an evaluation program. Conclusions drawn from the findings of a review of the literature, the Indiana Public School Study Council Member Superintendent's Questionnaire, and the Kokomo Administrative Team Evaluation Survey Questionnaire were as follows. A. Administrative performance can and should be evaluated on a regular basis. B. Authorities are not in agreement that only one process of evaluation is correct. C. Evaluation may include two main purposes: the first, to help the evaluatee establish relevant performance objectives and work systematically toward objective achievement; and secondly, to assess the evaluatee's present performance in accordance with prescribed standards. D. Evaluation should require the evaluator(s) to assess the. performance of the evaluatee by rating the evaluatee on a value scale that may have varying degrees of excellence. E. Management by Objectives (MBO) should <b>be</b> a supplement <b>to</b> evaluation procedures that stress rating. Self-evaluation should always be encouraged. F. Formal evaluation of administrative team members should be conducted annually within the time framework of individual state laws. Informal evaluation should be a continuous process, on a day-to-day basis supplementing the formal process. G. The superior or supervisor should conduct the formal evaluation with informal documented evaluation input from peers, staff, students, parents, community, and evaluatee as situations and/or time warrants. H. Particular attention should <b>be</b> paid <b>to</b> amassing specific documentary evidence regarding each behavioral <b>characteristic</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> I. Evaluation should be supported by data, records, commendations, and critical comments, work achieved, spotchecks, special activities and awards. J. Little new information, if any, should be saved for the formal appraisal. Evaluation should concentrate on guidance and counseling, not solely on checking up on the evaluatee. K. The evaluator should enter the evaluation process with a mutual, unprejudiced, and unbiased attitude with respect to the evaluatee. L. The best evaluation system is of no value if the information is simply gathered and stored or ignored. M. Improvement of evaluatee performance involved two processes, assessment of evaluatee and in-service or job development. Guideline recommendations for planning and implementing an administrative evaluation program touch on the following considerations: the responsibilities of the board of school trustees, the superintendent of schools, and the evaluation committee which has been established by the superintendent of schools. Implementation and follow-up recommendations are also a part of the guideline recommendations made as a result of the study. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

To {{evaluate}} whether serum titers of second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP 2) {{are associated with}} the severity and extent of interstitial lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA-ILD).

However, existing data were mixed and primarily conducted among early-onset young patients. We examined duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and its clinical and sociodemographic correlates in a large cohort of adult-onset patients with psychosis. Methods: A total of 360 patients with first-onset psychosis aged 26 - 55 years were recruited consecutively as part of a controlled study of an early psychosis intervention service in Hong Kong Chinese. Demographic, sociodemographic and clinical <b>characteristics</b> relating <b>to</b> DUP <b>were</b> <b>assessed</b> within 4 months of onset. Results: The population had a mean onset age of 36. 6 years (SD= 8. 7). The mean and median DUP were 515 days (SD= 1091) and 93 days (inter-quartile range from 20 to 382. 3), respectively. Multivariate regression analysis suggested that insidious mode of onset, hospitalization, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, poorer insight and younger age at onset significantly prolonged DUP. DUP <b>was</b> not related <b>to</b> premorbid functioning, family involvement during help seeking and living alone. Conclusions: The initial period of untreated psychosis is determined by multiple factors. Whether family involvement is considered a kind of social support in shortening or prolonging DUP needs further examination. Local early intervention program for psychosis should take reference from these findings when formulating personalized plans to reduce delay. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In Part 1 of this thesis, {{reclaimed}} {{cement concrete}} (commonly {{referred to as}} recycled concrete aggregate or RCA) and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) are investigated as potential alternative construction materials for Granular B Type II subbase fill. Ontario Provincial Standard Specification (OPSS) 1010 currently allows the common use of processed reclaimed construction materials {{in a variety of}} road base, subbase and asphaltic concrete layers, with the notable exception of Granular B Type II, which at present may only include 100 % crushed bedrock, talus, iron blast furnace slag or nickel slag. As more restrictions are placed on zoning and approvals for new natural aggregate extraction sites in Ontario, {{there is a need to}} better understand the performance of materials such as RCA and RAP as economically beneficial potential aggregate sources for granular base and subbase fill layers. An experimental program was created to assess and analyze the performance characteristics of a series of different subbase test mixtures incorporating RCA and/or RAP, either pure or blended with crushed bedrock, and the impact of the inclusion of these materials when compared to a conventional 100 % crushed bedrock test mix meeting OPSS 1010 requirements for Granular B Type II. The performance <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> were field compactibility, gradations before and after field compaction, physical properties, standard and modified Proctor tests, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), permeability, resilient moduli and lightweight deflectometer (LWD) resilient moduli. Field testing programs conducted at Quarry 1 in Ottawa, Ontario and Quarry 2 in Burlington, Ontario indicate that the subbase test mixtures meeting OPSS Granular B Type II gradation requirements and incorporating different proportions of crushed rock, RCA and/or RAP exhibit similar field rolling compactibility relative to 100 % crushed rock. Grain size analysis testing showed some aggregate breakdown in multiple test mixes, with only minimal increases in material passing the 75 µm sieve, which is crucial to preserving permeability and drainage characteristics. Tests using a lightweight deflectometer (LWD) were subject to substantial variability but indicated that mixes using elevated levels of RCA (50 % and 100 %) can potentially have lower in-situ moduli compared to the other blends tested. Laboratory tests indicate that high replacement levels of RCA can be used in subbase materials as a substitute for 100 % crushed rock while maintaining good water permeability characteristics and similar or higher resilient moduli in blends incorporating RCA and/or RAP. CBR testing results were similar across all test blends incorporating crushed rock and RCA, but also indicated that the inclusion of 30 % RAP can potentially reduce the bearing capacity of the granular material by approximately 30 - 40 % in comparison to all other blends which do not contain RAP. Based on the overall results of this study, RCA and RAP appear to be capable of successfully substituting for natural aggregates in Granular B Type II in a range of compositional proportions. It is recommended that test sections should be completed on highway contracts with subbase mixture blends incorporating RCA and/or RAP in order to verify their performance in pavement structures in the field. In Part 2 of this thesis, foam glass lightweight aggregates (LWA) are investigated as a potential pavement engineering design alternative in order to mitigate roadway loading impacts upon underlying subgrade soils while promoting the sustainable and economical use of recycled waste glass. Foamyna Canada Inc. supplied the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT) with two foam glass lightweight aggregate materials, designated in this thesis as LWA-A and LWA-B. Physical properties testing was carried out by CPATT, including grain size analysis, crushed particle content, flat and elongated particle content, Micro-Deval abrasion resistance, cyclic freezing-and-thawing resistance and resilient modulus testing procedures. These procedures were conducted in order to evaluate the LWA materials against locally applicable standards, namely Ontario Provincial Standard Specification document OPSS 1010 as currently used by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The laboratory testing detailed in Part 2 indicates that both LWA-A and LWA-B have a very consistent and repeatable gradation with a high percentage of coarse aggregates. Both foam glass materials have very high crushed particle contents and very low flat and elongated particle contents. Micro-Deval abrasion resistance, freeze-and-thaw resistance and resilient moduli were also excellent for both materials, while relative density testing indicated LWA material specific gravity values which were substantially lower than that of water. However, it was found that the gradations of these two tested materials do not satisfy the existing requirements of OPSS 1010, which were developed for natural aggregates and, as currently constituted, may not be appropriately adapted to artificial lightweight aggregates. The coarse nature of the LWA materials would be highly beneficial to ensure the stability of the granular layers and prevent upward capillary water movement into other layers of the pavement structure. Pavement design calculations were carried out using the AASHTO 1993 empirical design procedure and found that utilizing foam glass LWA as a lightweight subgrade replacement fill material can result in substantially leaner pavement structures as compared to the use of conventional expanded polystyrene (EPS) geofoam blocks as an artificial subgrade. A life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) procedure carried out on these pavement designs showed that the use of foam glass LWA as a lightweight fill material underlying pavement can result in overall cost savings of over 30 percent relative to pavement structures which are underlain by EPS geofoam. Overall, the two tested LWA materials showed excellent physical and mechanical characteristics, and would be suitable for use in pavement structures as innovative lightweight and environmentally friendly alternatives to natural aggregate materials...|$|E

The statistical data reveals that gear box is the most critical component reducing dependability caused by increased failure rate, downtime, and high repair cost (J. Ribrant and L. Bertling, 2007). Gear box failures in wind farms reveal a staggering 19. 4 % of downtime of operation (J. Ribrant and L. Bertling, 2007). A significant reduction in the failure rate has been observed in the recent years, but downtime of operation and high repair investment still remains a bottleneck.

At present, however, there is no widely accepted approach for assessing the vulnerability of coastal foredunes to erosion and overtopping hazards. Because different coastal regions have distinct storm and geomorphic <b>characteristics,</b> models need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> and possibly adapted before they can <b>be</b> successfully applied <b>to</b> each unique region. In this study, we apply a total water level model and three simple foredune erosion models and assess their suitability for U. S. west coast vulnerability analyses. The erosion models include a geometric model, an equilibrium profile model, and a wave impact model. We discuss the assumptions required to implement each model and force them with hydrodynamic conditions associated with a large-scale laboratory dune erosion experiment and a major winter storm approximately equivalent to the 30 -yr return period total water level event in the U. S. Pacific Northwest. The models are each applied with beach and foredune characteristics extracted from airborne topographic LiDAR data collected along the coasts of Oregon and Washington. Sensitivity tests reveal distinct differences in model dependence on beach slope, a critical parameter in determining storm water level elevations and ultimately the extent of foredune retreat. Without detailed, reliable field observations of storm-induced dune erosion from the region, the accuracy of each model is determined using results of the dune erosion experiment. Estimates of both overtopping and erosion extent are normalized by foredune dimensions enabling comparisons of relative vulnerability between different reaches of coast...|$|R

The aim of this study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the long-term prognosis of PI-FD and to identify factors influencing outcome. Methods: FD patients of presumed PI origin (acute onset with symptoms suggestive of infection) were prospectively followed and evaluated by telephone interview and mailed questionnaires. Patients underwent a full pathophysiological investigation (gastric emptying, barostat, H. pylori status) at inclusion, and follow-up data included FD symptom status, changes in body weight, quality of life (using NDI questionnaire) and trait and state anxiety and depression (using STAI and HADS). Correlation of these <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> FD status <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> using Chi-square, parametrical or non-parametrical tests, and logistic regression. Results: Ninety-four PI-FD patients (mean age 46. 1 ± 1. 4 y, 66 women), with a mean weight loss at presentation of 7. 0 ± 0. 8 kg were recruited. After a mean follow-up of 63 ± 3 months, FD symptoms had resolved in 30 % of the patients. There was an increase in weight of 3. 0 ± 1. 1 kg during follow-up, resulting in a residual net loss of 3. 5 ± 1. 1 kg compared to symptom onset. Persisting FD symptoms during long-term follow-up were not influenced by any of the pathophysiological variables <b>assessed,</b> but <b>were</b> significantly associated with body weight at presentation and STAI scores. FD symptom status was also significantly associated with the NDI and the HADS-depression and -anxiety scores. In multivariate logistic regression, only STAI-trait was significantly associated with long-term FD outcome. Conclusion: Five years after the onset PI-FD, the majority of patients are still symptomatic and body weight has not fully recovered. Persisting symptoms are highly associated with a decreased quality of life, anxiety and depression. Trait anxiety is the main determinant of outcome of long-term prognosis in PI-FD. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Movement ecologists study animals' {{movement}} to help understand their behaviours and interactions {{with each other}} and the environment. Data from GPS loggers are increasingly important for this. These data need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> processed, segmented and summarised for further visual and statistical analysis, often using predefined parameters. Usually, this process is separate from the subsequent visual and statistical analysis, making it difficult for these results to inform the data processing and to help set appropriate scale and thresholds parameters. This paper explores the use of highly interactive visual analytics techniques to close the gap between processing raw data and exploratory visual analysis. Working closely with animal movement ecologists, we produced requirements <b>to</b> enable data <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> determined, initial research questions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> investigated, and the suitability of data for further analysis <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> We design visual encodings and interactions to meet these requirements and provide software that implements them.
