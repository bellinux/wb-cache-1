40|$|We are {{studying}} the combined problem of generating a timetable and student schedules from initial data that includes student <b>course</b> <b>requests,</b> the number of sections allowed of each course, {{the maximum number of}} students allowed into each course, and the maximum number of times available in the timetable. Our approach extends to handle issues of time constraints for instructors, time requests for students, and limitations on room availability but we do not consider these in this paper. The goal, given the initial input, is to develop a timetable indicating the time at which each section of a course will be offered as well as a schedule for each student indicating the times at which the <b>courses</b> <b>requested</b> are scheduled. The timetable and schedules should be constructed to minimize the number of conflicts experienced by the students. 1. 2 Metric for counting conflicts Initial input to this problem is a set of <b>course</b> <b>requests</b> from each student.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{solution}} {{to the problems of}} computer scheduling of students based on <b>course</b> <b>requests</b> rather than section requests is discussed. The solution involves keeping all course data in core during the scheduling process to enable the scheduling program to run as fast as possible and using a scheduling algorithm which tries all possible combinations of sections for the <b>requested</b> <b>courses</b> until a conflict-free schedule is found, or until it is determined that the remaining conflicts are unresolvable. The algorithm schedules recitations and labs where required and maintains section balancing in terms of the percentage of scheduled stations for lecture, lab, and recitation sections within a course. Several methods of giving the student more choice in the sections he will be scheduled for are discussed. These include instructor preference and <b>course</b> <b>request</b> alternates.

40|$|Working with course catalogs, the DAPR system, {{the course}} {{shopping}} cart, and the <b>course</b> <b>request</b> system is confusing for most students. With these resources {{it is difficult}} for students to make good decisions about which courses to enroll in, the order in which to take a sequence of courses, which minor to choose, and to which major or option to switch. CurricVis is a system that utilizes curriculum visualizations to help students build more accurate mental models of curricular programs, allowing them to make more informed curricular decisions. The {{purpose of the study was}} to measure the effects a curriculum visualization tool has on students' abilities to make decisions. We compared those findings with the effects of using only traditional, text-based curricular data. The hypotheses tested in this study were: students build more feasible plans with the aid of the curriculum visualization tool; students are more confident about their decisions with the tool; and students make their decisions more quickly with the tool. This study shows that CurricVis functions as a positive aid to the decision making process among students. No other research on curriculum visualization has included such a study on usability.
