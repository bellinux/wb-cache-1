5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such teleology describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The efficient <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> not {{completely}} understood, but involves a T cell-mediated immune response {{triggered by a}} variety of factors. Different individuals have different triggers, which may include nutritional deficiencies, local trauma, stress, hormonal influences, allergies, genetic predisposition or other factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> still debated. The visible orange flames in that incident {{were the result of}} a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the airship skin.|$|E
5000|$|The causative {{morpheme}} {{can also}} be used recursively to generate indefinitely long words that are grammatically valid. This morpheme shows quite some irregularity, taking one of six forms depending on the verb root. Otherwise it alternates between -DIr (D=d or t, I=ı,i,u or ü) and -t depending on the preceding letter. piş-ir-di-ler = they cooked it piş-ir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> cooked (they had it cooked) [...] piş-ir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have someone have someone have it cooked)Multiple usage of this suffix is rare, but there is no theoretical reason to put a limit to its use.|$|R

5|$|Because {{judicial}} decisions {{are subject to}} the sometimes arbitrary assessments of the CCP, citizens who attempt {{to make use of the}} legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed. Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense.|$|E
5|$|Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is {{the largest}} {{surviving}} single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.|$|E
5|$|Croup is a {{relatively}} common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point. It most commonly occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age but may rarely be seen in children as old as fifteen. It is slightly more common in males than females. It occurs most often in autumn. Before vaccination, croup was frequently caused by diphtheria and was often fatal. This <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> now very rare in the Western world due {{to the success of}} the diphtheria vaccine.|$|E
50|$|The {{immediate}} <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> {{the extreme}} optimism and subsequent disappointment at the Nivelle offensive {{in the spring}} of 1917. Other <b>causes</b> <b>were</b> pacificism, stimulated by the Russian Revolution and the trade-union movement, and disappointment at the nonarrival of American troops.|$|R

5000|$|An Instance <b>Cause</b> <b>was</b> a type {{of legal}} process in the English church courts. Legal action in these ecclesiastical courts was either instigated as an Instance Cause or an Office Cause (Office Jurisdiction). An Instance <b>Cause</b> <b>was</b> pursued by a {{particular}} plaintiff against a particular defendant whilst in an Office Cause the court acted as plaintiff. Instance <b>causes</b> <b>were</b> taken between parties in marital disputes, or between members of a community in pew disputes or defamation litigation.|$|R
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} both genetic and {{acquired}} causes, with interaction {{of these factors}} in many cases. Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours and problems in the brain {{as a result of}} a previous infection. In about 60% of cases the <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Epilepsies caused by genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are more common among younger people, while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people.|$|E
40|$|Elevated transaminases in {{asymptomatic}} {{patients can}} be detected in more than 5 % of the investigations. If there are no obvious reasons, the finding should be confirmed within the next 3 months. Frequent <b>causes</b> <b>are</b> non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol, hepatitis B or C, hemochromatosis and drugs or toxins. Rarer <b>causes</b> <b>are</b> autoimmune hepatitis, M. Wilson and α 1 -antitrypsine deficiency. There <b>are</b> also non-hepatic <b>causes</b> such as celiac disease or hemolysis and myopathies {{in the case of}} an exclusive increase of ASAT. I recommend a two-step investigational procedure; the more frequent <b>causes</b> <b>are</b> examined first before the rare <b>causes</b> <b>are</b> studied. The value of the proposed investigations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Environmental losses, each {{described}} {{along with}} its <b>cause,</b> <b>were</b> judged for seriousness. Four types of <b>cause</b> <b>were</b> studied: illegal behavior, carelessness, economic and population growth, and natural events. Environmental losses were considered most serious when caused by illegal behavior or carelessness, and only slightly less serious when caused by growth. Losses due to these three types of human <b>causes</b> <b>were</b> considered much more serious than when the same losses <b>were</b> <b>caused</b> by natural events. Naturally <b>caused</b> environmental losses <b>were</b> probably considered least serious {{because they do not}} provoke the sense of violation or responsibility commonly associated with human-caused losses, and because naturally <b>caused</b> losses <b>are</b> often considered unavoidable and in the natural scheme of things. Key words: human and natural causes, environmental loss, paired comparisons...|$|R

5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> {{less likely to be}} viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E

5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E
5|$|Many topical {{treatments}} for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
