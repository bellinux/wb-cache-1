40|$|Influence of fish {{processing}} methods on changes of chlordane and toxaphene residue concentrations were studied in various fishery products. Investigation included smoking, marinating and <b>canning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> Smoking of Greenland halibut and ocean perch {{led to an}} increase in chlordane and toxaphene residue amounts in the edible part in relation to the raw material. A similar increase was observed during the marinating process of herring fillets. In both cases, loss of water was responsible for the observed changes in residue contents. The fat and thus the lipophilic organochlorine compounds remained completely in the products. Canning of herring fillets in tomato sauce reduced the residue concentration of the final product due to dilution by the tomato sauce. The concentrations in the fillets kept nearly unchanged even after storage of cans for six months. No equilibration was observed between residue concentrations in fillets and sauce...|$|E

In this context, there is the proposal to use the matrinxã (Brycon amazonicus) {{as an alternative to}} sardines (Sardinella brasiliensis) for the <b>canning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> industry. This work aimed to evaluate the nutritional and sensory quality and matrinxã cans in vegetable oil. To evaluate the acceptance we used three canned fish samples with vegetable oil coverage, as follows: matrinxã, freshwater and saltwater sardine sardines. A preference test and an acceptance hedonic scale of nine points was applied. There {{was no significant difference in}} preference between the matrinxã and freshwater sardines, however, the matrinxã and saltwater sardines differ significantly, and canned matrinxã was the most preferred. For the color attribute, flavor and overall impression there was no significant difference between the three fish, as for the taste attribute, matrinxã presented higher acceptance significantly differing from saltwater sardines. In the chemical composition, the matrinxã showed a protein content of 28. 67 %, moisture 51. 67 %, 15. 67 % and total lipids 2. 67 % minerals. Therefore, it is concluded that the matrinxã is a good option for canned fish industry, as presented good nutritional quality and high acceptance compared to traditional canned fish.
