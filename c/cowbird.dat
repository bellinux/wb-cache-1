5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed <b>cowbird</b> and the giant <b>cowbird</b> — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed <b>cowbird</b> is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant <b>cowbird</b> is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed <b>cowbird</b> eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed <b>cowbird</b> eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed <b>cowbird</b> chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is known}} to be a rejecter of <b>cowbird</b> eggs, so brood {{parasitism}} by the brown-headed <b>cowbird</b> is rare. Even when it occurs, the parasite's chick does not normally survive to fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% were infected with one or more species of endoparasite, with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered, found in 57.1% of the birds.|$|E
40|$|Your {{attitude}} toward <b>cowbirds</b> and other brood parasites may be largely {{influenced by the}} nature of your experience with them. If your primary contact with brood parasites occurs when they appear with the host species you are watching, studying, or researching, it is easy to side with those who have characterized <b>cowbirds</b> as feathered wretches, social outcasts, arch villains, or pests of the highest order. If the focus of your attention is on <b>cowbirds</b> themselves, however, you {{may be more likely to}} view them as highly adapted, fascinating components of the ecosystem. If you are not already in the second category, you should be after reading Catherine Ortega 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Cowbirds</b> and Other Brood Parasites...|$|R
40|$|Parasitic <b>cowbirds</b> and cuckoos {{generally}} {{reduce the}} clutch {{size of the}} hosts they parasitize by removing or destroying some of their eggs. Shiny <b>cowbirds</b> (Molothrus bonariensis) puncture their hosts' eggs both when parasitizing the nests and also {{when they do not}} parasitize them. We propose that, by puncturing the host's eggs, shiny <b>cowbirds</b> gain an informational benefit. They assess the degree of development of the host's embryos and so avoid laying in nests that would not provide enough incubation time for the parasitic eggs to hatch. Two predictions follow: (i) punctures should occur in advance or immediately before parasitic events, and (ii) the occurrence of parasitism should depend on the degree of development of the host's embryos when punctures occurred, i. e. on the stage of incubation. Both predictions are supported by our data of shiny <b>cowbirds</b> parasitizing yellow-winged blackbirds (Agelaius thilius). Egg punctures are not used to reset the host's nesting attempt when shiny <b>cowbirds</b> do not parasitize the nests. We discuss the potential mechanisms implicated in egg development assessment and propose a critical experiment to test this hypothesis...|$|R

5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of Carolina wren nests {{being affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. <b>Cowbird</b> parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of <b>cowbird</b> eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may {{have a significant impact}} on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for <b>cowbird</b> nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The adult robin is preyed upon by hawks, cats, and snakes, {{but when}} feeding in flocks, {{it can be}} {{vigilant}} and watch other birds for reactions to predators. Brown-headed cowbirds lay eggs in robin nests (see brood parasite), but robins usually reject the <b>cowbird</b> eggs.|$|E
5|$|The primary predators of {{this species}} are diurnal birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, corvids, grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs. Cowbirds rarely parasitize {{mourning}} dove nests. Mourning doves reject slightly under a third of <b>cowbird</b> eggs in such nests, and the mourning dove's vegetarian diet is unsuitable for cowbirds.|$|E

5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} are not brood parasitised by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed <b>cowbird,</b> another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternate}} definition {{often used}} by biologists is any species, not just plants, that can quickly adapt to any environment.

Such species often do well in human-dominated environments as other species are not able to adapt. Common examples include the common pigeon, brown rat and the raccoon. Other weedy species have been able to expand their range without actually living in human environments, as human activity has damaged the ecosystems of other species. These include the coyote, the white-tailed deer and the brown headed <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E

40|$|Animal–vehicle {{collisions}} cause {{high levels}} of vertebrate mortality worldwide, and what goes wrong when animals fail to escape and ultimately collide with vehicles is notwell understood. We investigated alert and escape behaviours of captive brown-headed <b>cowbirds</b> (Molothrus ater) in response to virtual vehicle approaches of different sizes and at speeds ranging from 60 to 360 km h- 1. Alert and flight initiation distances remained similar across vehicle speeds, and accordingly, alert and flight initiation times decreased at higher vehicle speeds. Thus, avoidance behaviours in <b>cowbirds</b> appeared {{to be based on}} distance rather than time available for escape, particularly at 60 – 150 km h- 1; however, at higher speeds (more than or equal to 180 km h- 1) no trend in response behaviour was discernible. As vehicle speed increased, <b>cowbirds</b> did not have enough time to assess the approaching vehicle, and <b>cowbirds</b> generally did not initiate flight with enough time to avoid collision when vehicle speed exceeded 120 km h- 1. Although potentially effective for evading predators, the decision-making process used by <b>cowbirds</b> in our study appears maladaptive in the context of avoiding fast-moving vehicles. Our methodological approach and findings provide a framework to assess how novel management strategies could affect escape rules, and the sensory and cognitive abilities animals use to avoid vehicle collisions...|$|R
500|$|The {{range of}} the black catbird is small and dwindling further due to habitat loss. In 2008, the world {{population}} {{was estimated to be}} less than 50,000 and decreasing.

The late 20th century arrival of the shiny <b>cowbird,</b> a brood parasite, into the Yucatán may cause problems for the black catbird as (based on past host choices) the catbird may become a target of the <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E
500|$|Other {{invasive}} species also {{have affected the}} Santa Ana River. One {{of the most prominent}} is the brown-headed <b>cowbird,</b> which feeds off parasites and insects identified with cattle, which were brought to Southern California during the Spanish Rancho period. The brown-headed <b>cowbird</b> is a [...] "brood parasite", or a bird that lays its eggs in another bird's nest. One of the most afflicted birds is the least Bell's vireo, whose population also suffers from the loss of riparian habitat. The least Bell's vireo is considered an endangered species, as is the southwestern willow flycatcher, whose habitat is often shared with the other bird. The saltcedar is another invasive large weed that also, like the giant reed, uses large amounts of water. Unlike giant reed, the saltcedar has deeper roots, not only making it more difficult to remove but allowing it to access and use up deep groundwater. However, the saltcedar is similar in that it also provides little usable habitat for native animals.|$|E

500|$|While it is {{not known}} when {{precisely}} the breeding season starts, the earliest that a sparrow has been observed carrying nesting material was on March 2 in southern California. The female bird builds a bulky, thick-walled open-cup nest typically on the ground, though occasionally in a low bush up to [...] above it, from dried grasses and rootlets, sometimes with strips of bark, small twigs, and weed stems. Nests are well hidden, as they are built near bushes or tall grasses or overhanging rock with concealing vegetation. Once a sparrow chooses a nesting site, it tends to return to the site for many years. It lays between two and five eggs at a time and typically only raises one brood a year, though some birds in California have been observed raising two or even three broods a year. In case of a nesting failure, replacement clutches may be laid. The eggs are an unmarked, pale bluish-white. Broods of the rufous-crowned sparrow have very occasionally been observed to be parasitized by the brown-headed <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E

The summer tanager will remove the bee's stinger before ingesting by rubbing the bee on a branch. The least Bell's vireo is a species that will hopefully reestablish nesting in the South Fork Kern River Valley. It is one of four subspecies of Bell's vireo, which disappeared from California's Central Valley by the 1960s, and has been federally listed as endangered since 1986. The US Fish and Wildlife Service's 5-year review of least Bell's vireo, dated September 2006, attributes the primary cause of population declines to loss of riparian habitat in California. Another threat listed by the review is from the brown-headed <b>cowbird</b> which lays its eggs in other birds' nests, called brood parasiteism.

40|$|Considerable {{geographic}} variation often {{exists in}} behaviors of different populations of a species. Of key interest are the mechanisms generating this variation, {{and the impact}} this variation may have on gene flow between two populations. Here, we review two sets of studies of brown-headed <b>cowbirds,</b> Molothrus ater, indicating that the social background of an individual can impact its ability to court, pair, and mate with individuals of one behavioral tradition/population relative to individuals of another behavioral tradition/population. The first studies involved two populations with extant differences in mating behaviors and found that young <b>cowbirds</b> of one population that interacted over ontogeny with members of a behaviorally-distinct population developed courtship behaviors and mating patterns similar to members of that ‘foster’ population. The second set of studies tested the possibility of generating distinct systems of mating behavior within one population and found that young <b>cowbirds</b> that interacted over ontogeny with different age-structured social groups developed effectively distinct mating patterns. Thus, social traditional processes in <b>cowbirds</b> can create, maintain, or dissolve population-level differences in courtship and communication.
