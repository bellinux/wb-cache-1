50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder {{steam engine}} (also {{known as a}} wobbler in the US) is a simple steam-engine design that requires no valve gear. Instead the cylinder rocks, or oscillates, as the crank-shaft moves the piston, pivoting in the mounting trunnion so that ports in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>line</b> up with ports in a fixed port face alternately to direct steam into {{or out of the}} cylinder.|$|E
50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder {{steam engine}} is {{a variant of}} the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam {{into and out of the}} cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>line</b> up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting (trunnion). These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This study {{examined}} the effects of Al 2 O 3 -TiO 2 surface coating on the combustion chamber components of a diesel engine. The piston surface, cylinder head, exhaust and inlet valves of a single cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine were coated with Al 2 O 3 -TiO 2 (87 - 13) oxide based ceramic composite. The surface coating was applied to a thickness of 250 µm using an atmospheric plasma spray method. NiAl (50 µm thickness) was employed as bond layer for the piston and the valves. Coated and uncoated surfaces were tested under the same conditions for 150 hours. After testing, the surface treatments were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical microscope. According to test results, coated samples have showed fewer deformations, wear lines and less erosion in comparison to uncoated samples. A positive effect was also observed on the cylinder bore and piston rings. The results indicate that coating the pistons and valves with oxide based ceramics contributed to increasing the mechanical lifespan of the samples.

The research culminated with Nigusil, a nickel-silicon alloy applied to the cylinder through special procedures. This innovation allowed lower friction coefficient in the engine, significantly lower levels of mechanical parts wear, and considerable savings of lubricant. Treatment of cylinders through Nigusil was also used by many manufacturers, Maserati among them, and generally on racing engines.|$|R

Average heat transfer coefficients of individual cylinders and whole cylinder arrays were measured in order to clarify dependabilities of those coefficients upon the geometric figures including spacing and off-set distance between two <b>cylinder</b> <b>lines,.</b> Visualization of flow fields around the array has also been tried to explain the heat transfer behavior of cylinders in array. The experiments showed that there exist some optimum values of cylinder spacings and the off-set distances to increase the heat transfer coefficients and that the promoting effect in heat transfer can be expected especially when the array is set between parallel walls...|$|R
50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder engine {{cannot be}} reversed {{by means of}} the valve linkage (as in a normal fixed cylinder) because there is none. Reversing of the engine can be achieved by reversing the steam connections between inlet and exhaust or, in the case of small engines, by shifting the trunnion pivot point so that the port in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>lines</b> up with a different pair of ports in the port face. In the latter case, the fixed port face is usually provided with three ports, the central one being the steam feed and the outer two being exhausts, only one of which being in use at any time, depending on the required direction of running.|$|R

50|$|A {{cylinder}} lens {{consists of}} several cylinders whose sides are thin walls. Each <b>cylinder</b> <b>lines</b> up {{parallel to the}} optical axis into which electrons enter. There are small gaps put between the cylinders. When each cylinder has a different voltage, {{the gap between the}} cylinders works as a lens. The magnification is able to be changed by choosing different voltage combinations. Although the magnification of two cylinder lenses can be changed, the focal point is also changed by this operation. Three cylinder lenses achieve the change of the magnification while holding the object and image positions because there are two gaps that work as lenses. Although the voltages have to change depending on the electron kinetic energy, the voltage ratio is kept constant when the optical parameters are not changed.|$|R

The rebuilds subsequently had their <b>cylinders</b> <b>lined</b> down to 19 in.

2500|$|The {{crankcase}} was an aluminium casting and {{in later}} models contained a fuel mixing chamber. [...] These later versions also used long bolts {{to attach the}} cylinders to the crankcase. [...] The engine used a single, kinked crankweb, coupled to slim but broad connecting rods in order to minimise the axial displacement between the two rows. [...] This was less than in more recent double row radials, the rear face of the front row falling on the centre plane of the back row. The engine was not strictly a radial, as the crankweb geometry slightly offset the centres of the two rows, an arrangement best seen {{from the back of}} the engine, where the superimposed inlet tubes and push-rods of the later engine highlight the <b>cylinder</b> centre <b>lines.</b> Such an offset between <b>cylinder</b> centre <b>line</b> and crankshaft is often termed désaxé.|$|R
