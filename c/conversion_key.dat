40|$|Incomparability of {{information}} is the key problem in international comparisons. The usual way to improve comparability is to harmonise data collection efforts. However, harmonisation fails if the data have already been sampled, or if appropriate harmonisation cannot be achieved for whatever reason. This normally leaves no other option than to either make strong unwarranted assumptions about the data, or abandon any comparative work. This article proposes an approach that, under certain circumstances, might provide useful comparative analyses from existing incomparable data. The method, termed Response Conversion (RC), addresses the problem of divergent formulations of survey questions. RC attempts to transform responses obtained on different items (questions) onto a common scale. Where this can be done, comparisons can be made using the common scale. The method consists of two steps. The first step is {{the construction of a}} <b>conversion</b> <b>key</b> by means of a statistical model, in our case the polytomous Rasch model.

Genes encoding MSGs are repeated, highly polymorphic, and distributed among all of the 14 - 15 chromosomes. Here we show, by BAL- 31 exonuclease cleavage and DNA cloning experiments, that the unique expression site (previously termed UCS) of MSG genes located in the 500 -kb chromosome is telomeric. The 11 -kb genomic UCS fragment isolated and sequenced in this study contained one MSG coding sequence (termed msglO 5), subtelomeric repetitive sequences and telomere-specific tandem repeats of TTAGGG oriented 5 ' to 3 ' towards the DNA end. Despite the N-terminal polymorphism, the C-terminal one-third sequence of MSG 105 was identical to one of the known MSG-cDNAs, suggesting homologous recombination within the MSG coding sequences. These features closely resemble the Variant Surface Glycoprotein system of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, suggesting that the genetic heterogeneity of MSGs is generated by recombination between the UCS expression site and multiple MSG genes by means of reciprocal exchange or gene <b>conversion.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Pneumocystis carinii; major surface glycoprotein; expression site; telomere 1...|$|E

40|$|Background: Comparability {{of health}} data {{is a major}} {{challenge}} {{within the context of}} the Health Monitoring Programme of the European Commission. A common problem in surveys is that many variations of essentially the same question exist. Methods: Response conversion is a new method for improving comparability by scaling the data onto a common scale. Comparisons between member states can then be made in terms of the common scale. A first step is the construction of a <b>conversion</b> <b>key.</b> This is a relatively complex activity, but needs to be done only once. The second step is the actual data transformation. This is simple, and can be repeatedly done on a routine basis as new information arrives. Construction of the key is only possible if enough overlapping information can be found. Results: The method is illustrated for dressing disability from five European countries. Differences occur between countries, between sexes and between age groups. These were similar in magnitude. Conclusion: Response conversion is a new method for enhancing comparability among existing data. Conversion can only be done if a key is available. More work is needed to establish the technique. Future implications within the Health Monitoring Programme are discussed...|$|E

Weight loss (4. 0 – 33. 5 %) of the wheat straw could be predicted (RMSEP = 3. 5 %, R²test = 0. 75) from the entire FT-NIR spectra (10000 – 4000 cm- 1).

For the 29 to 40 day experiment, 384 poults, were weighed, sorted, and assigned to a treatment with 8 poults per pen. In both trials, poults were fed experimental diets with the digestible lysine levels ranging from 1. 08 to 1. 43 % in the 4 to 15 day period and 0. 88 to 1. 30 % in the 29 to 40 day period.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{continuous}} {{conversion of}} smectite to illite in {{samples from the}} Shinzan hydrothermal alteration area of Japan has been examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and transmission (TEM) and analytical transmission electron microscopy (AEM). TEM shows that randomly interstratified illite/ smectite (I/S) containing 100 - 50 % expandable layers exhibits a flakey shape, whereas regularly and partially ordered interstratified I/S having 50 - 0 % expandable ayers exhibits a lath-like habit. An early-formed lath of regularly interstratified I/S is typically < 35 /k in thickness and 300 - 500 ~ in width; these dimensions gradually increase with decreasing percentage ofexpandable ayers. XRD shows that he lath-shaped I/S has a 1 M polytype mica structure. AEM shows that the interlayer K content of flakey I/S increases monotonously with decreasing percentage of expandable layers in the range 100 - 50 % expandable layers, whereas the interlayer K content of lath-shaped I/S increases along a different trend from that for the flakey I/S in the range 50 - 0 % expandable ayers. These observations suggest that randomly inter-stratifed I/S is fundamentally smectite that is undergoing K-fixation and dissolution and that regularly and partially ordered interstratified I/S are immature illite which is still growing. Consequently, they suggest a mechanism for the hydrothermal smectite-to-illite conversion {{that is based on}} the K-fixation in and dissolution of smectite and the precipitation a d growth of thin illite particles. Furthermore, these data suggest that the kinetics of smectite dissolution and illite growth are the most important factors controlling the smectite-to-illite <b>conversion.</b> <b>Key</b> Words [...] Diagenesis, Expandable layers, Illite, K-fixation, Smectite, X-ray powder diffraction...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to report {{the results of an}} {{investigation}} into the design and fabrication of a polarisation independent optical ring resonator in the silicon-on-insulator material system. By separating the resonator into its fundamental components and investigating each one in terms of its polarisation properties, it is hypothesized that a ring resonator can be constructed that functions as desired regardless of the input polarisation state. Two test chips were therefore fabricated which are based on experiments designed to validate this hypothesis. A polarisation independent ring resonator has been realised on the first designed test chip which has a TE/TM resonance minimum alignment of better than 5 pm, a Finesse of ~ 11 for both polarisations, and a calculated Q value of ~ 95, 000. A second test chip was fabricated to quantify improvements to the first test chip. It yielded a resonator with a Finesse of 28 and a Q value of ~ 170, 000. Several other effects critical to the functionality of a polarisation independent resonator were also observed on devices from the second test chip. Polarisation conversion, with values as high as 45 %, was observed on deep-etched bent waveguides with a bend radius of 100 ?m. Evidence of higher order modes as well as coupling outside the defined coupling were observed in the experimental results of a directional coupler experiment. Secondary resonance minima were observed in the resonator devices. It is likely that either higher-order modes or polarisation conversion are the cause. Overall, the results of this work imply that the method of designing a polarisation independent racetrack resonator is valid.

40|$|Abstract — Under proper {{injection}} of an incoming optical signal to be format-converted, a semiconductor laser can be driven at period-one dynamics {{due to the}} dynamical competition between the injection-imposed laser oscillation and the injection-shifted cavity resonance. Equally separated spectral components therefore emerge, the intensity and frequency of which strongly depend on the intensity and frequency of the incoming optical signal. Optical modulation format <b>conversion</b> between amplitude-shift <b>keying</b> (ASK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) can thus be achieved by applying such a mechanism. The conversion depends solely on {{the property of the}} incoming optical signal for a given laser and therefore only a typical semiconductor laser is necessary as the <b>key</b> <b>conversion</b> unit. Due to the unique underlying mechanism, both ASK-to-FSK and FSK-to-ASK conversions can be achieved using the same system. The bit-error ratio at 10 Gb/s is observed down to 10 − 12 with a slight power penalty for both conversions. Simultaneous frequency conversion of the incoming optical carrier is also possible.
