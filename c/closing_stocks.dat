40|$|Modelling food {{commodities}} prices {{has become the}} area of interest in financial time series. This study aims to model Malaysian average monthly prices of crude palm oil using dynamic regression approach. The sample period covers from January 2000 until December 2013. The model investigated is Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. The model uses multivariate analysis with monthly prices, productions, imports, exports and <b>closing</b> <b>stocks</b> of crude palm oil as the variables. The ARDL model is selected using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Schwartz-Bayesian Criteria (SBC). The capabilities of this model in estimating the crude palm oil prices is compared to Box-Jenkins Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model by using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The process of modelling is done by using Eviews and Microfit statistical software. This study concluded that ARDL model is a better model in modelling the palm oil prices. The ARDL model selected by using AIC produce better estimation than the ARDL model selected by using SBC. Furthermore, there exist long-run relationship between crude palm oil prices and its determinants...|$|E
40|$|MMRF-Green is a bottoms-up {{model of}} the economies of Australia’s six states and two territories. It models each region as an economy in its own right, with region-specific prices, region-specific consumers, region-specific industries, and so on. This {{theoretical}} structure {{is supported by a}} database containing explicit representations of intra-regional, inter-regional and international trade flows based on regional input-output data developed at the Centre of Policy Studies. Each solution of MMRF-Green produces pictures of Australia’s regions at a high level of detail for a particular year. The model can also produce a sequence of annual solutions, linked together by ensuring, for example, that the quantities of opening capital stocks in any year equal the quantities of <b>closing</b> <b>stocks</b> in the previous year. This allows the model to make forecasts for the regional economies at a high level of detail over periods of policy relevance (say up to 10 years). The starting point for these forecasts is a set of scenarios for the macro economy supplied by a specialist-forecasting agency. The role of MMRF-Green is to forecast a microeconomic picture consistent with the macroeconomic scenarios and other inputs. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the latest set of forecasts for energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions derived from the model. These forecasts have been made for the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO), which is the sponsor of the work. Three scenarios are reported and discussed. Most attention is given to the central case, which is our preferred scenario. The other two cases are upper and lower scenarios that provide plausible ranges for the forecast values of critical variables...|$|E
