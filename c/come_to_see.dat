5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, {{especially since he}} is not financially well off. Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for her marriage to Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a neighbouring country. Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a gounder custom).

5|$|Chnodomar {{could not}} ignore Julian's {{fortification}} of Saverne, as it threatened his control of Alsace and blocked his main access route {{into the interior}} of Gaul. He had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this region as Alamanni territory by right of conquest after occupying it for several years. He also claimed to possess letters from Constantius granting the Alamanni the right to occupy those lands. Chnodomar had been surprised and dismayed by Julian's successful campaigns of 355-7. But he was encouraged by his own success against Barbatio and the intelligence brought to him by a deserter that Barbatio's withdrawal had left the Caesar with only 13,000 men. Having driven two Roman magistri from the field (Barbatio and before him, Magnentius' lieutenant, Decentius), Chnodomar had lost the barbarians' traditional fear of pitched battles with the Romans.|$|E

5|$|In a Philippines {{rife with}} {{corruption}} and poverty, hitmen Mario (Joel Torre) and Daniel (Gerald Anderson) are prisoners who are frequently released and paid to perform hits for their boss, Thelma (Vivian Velez). Mario spends his earnings on his law school tuition {{for his daughter}} (Empress Schuck), and for his estranged wife, Lulette (Angel Aquino). Daniel, the younger and most reckless partner, pays remittances {{to his family and}} spends the rest on goods and privileges inside prison.

After the pair murder drug lord Tiu and return to prison, Tiu's murder case is assigned to National Bureau of Investigation Agent Francis Coronel (Piolo Pascual) through the agent's father-in-law Congressman Manrique (Michael de Mesa). Coronel's father, also a police officer, died amid rumors of corruption. When Coronel and his partner Bernabe (Rayver Cruz) arrive at the local precinct, they clash with Philippine National Police Sergeant Joaquin Acosta (Joey Marquez), a twenty-year veteran who believes the case was taken from him for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|The Giants went 8–4–1 in 1926, and {{withstood}} {{a challenge}} from an upstart American football league {{led by a}} team featuring Grange. Grange and his agent had formed the American Football League and placed their flagship team, the Yankees, in New York. According to a story by The New York Times published at the time, the Giants lost over $50,000 during the season. Grange's league lasted one season however, and was subsumed into the NFL. The Giants were so desperate to make money they allowed star Duluth Eskimos running back Ernie Nevers back into a close game after he was injured, even though by the rules they {{had the right to}} disallow his re-entrance, to please fans who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. The Yankees were subsumed into the NFL the next year and played most of their games on the road to avoid direct competition with the Giants. They folded in 1928, one year after Grange went back to playing for the Bears. The Giants paid a total of $21,000 in player salary in 1926, including paying all player expenses during the season, and player salaries ranged from $1,500 to $3,000. According to March, the attendance for the season was nearly equal to the 274,500 the team reported in their inaugural season. However, home attendance for games at the Polo Grounds dropped from 25,000 to 15,000 a game. The team's attendance on the road was significantly higher in their early history—the team averaged 57,000 in their three road games in 1925.|$|E
