40|$|A {{virtual machine}} tool (VMT) is {{presented}} in this two-part paper. In Part 1, the analytical foundation for a virtual machining system is developed, which is envisioned {{as the foundation for}} a comprehensive simulation environment capable of predicting the outcome of cutting processes. The VMT system undergoes “pseudo-real machining”, before actual cutting with a CNC machine tool takes place, to provide the proper cutting conditions for process planners and to compensate or control the machining process in terms of the productivity and attributes of the products. The attributes can be characterized by the machined surface error, dimensional accuracy, roughness, integrity, and so forth. The main components of the VMT are the cutting process, application, thermal behavior, and feed drive modules. In Part 1, the <b>cutting</b> process <b>module</b> is presented. When verified experimentally, the proposed models gave significantly better prediction results than any other methods. In Part 2 of this paper, the thermal behavior and feed drive modules are developed, and the models are integrated into a comprehensive software environment...|$|R
40|$|In the thesis, a {{prototype}} object-oriented fuzzy expert system called SAM (Smart Assistant to Machinist) is presented for rotating cutter selection and cutting condition design. Object-Oriented Design and Programming Methods are employed {{to construct and}} implement the system. Based on partial and imprecise information, the system is able to select rotating cutter products available in current commercial market, and design cutting conditions for an optimized objective. The system consists of four modules: a database, a rule base, a cutter selection <b>module</b> and a <b>cutting</b> condition design <b>module.</b> The database consists of six kinds of data files: machinability of workpieces, machining plan, fuzzy rule, tool adapter, machine tool, as well as cutter inventory files. The rules in the rule base are developed based on fuzzy set theory. They are used to cross-define unknown information and to determine {{the relationships between the}} inputs and outputs information. The cutter selection module is developed based on fuzzy logic, in which the cutter selection is conducted in three steps. First, the input information is 2 ̆ 2 fuzzied 2 ̆ 2. Next, using the fuzzy correlation functions, insert grades and cutters are selected. Then, the selected grades and cutters are searched against the cutter inventory data file to check the availability. The <b>cutting</b> condition design <b>module</b> is developed based on fuzzy non-linear programming where the design constraints could be fuzzy. The model is solved by Hill Climbing Algorithm. Finally, the use of system is demonstrated using two examples. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|We {{report on}} the use of a dynamic {{vegetation}} model, CARAIB, within two modeling exercises in the framework of MACSUR. CARAIB is a physically-based, mechanistic model that calculates the carbon assimilation of the vegetation {{as a function of the}} soil and climatic conditions. Within MACSUR, it was used in the model intercomparison exercises for grassland and crop modeling, in the LiveM 2. 4 and CropM WP 4 tasks, respectively. For grassland modeling, blind model runs at 11 locations were performed for various time ranges (few years). For crop modeling, a sensitivity analysis for building impact response surfaces (IRS) was performed, based on a bench of model runs at different levels of perturbation in the temperature and precipitation input data over 30 years. For grassland modeling, specific management functions accounting for the cutting or grazing of the grass were added to the model, in the framework of the MACSUR intercomparison. Initially developed for modeling the carbon dynamics of the natural vegetation, CARAIB was already adapted for crop modeling but further modifications regarding the management, i. e., yearly-dependent sowing dates, were introduced. For grassland modeling, simulation results will be further intercompared with other modeling groups, but preliminary results showed that the model could cope with the introduction of the grass <b>cutting</b> <b>module.</b> For crop modeling, building the IRS over 30 years permitted to assess the sensitivity of the model to temperature and precipitation changes. So far, the participation of CARAIB in the intercomparison exercises within MACSUR resulted in further improvements of the model by introducing new functionalities. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 93 - 96) An {{approach to}} facilitating {{the task of}} analyzing the various manufacturing aspects for design changes is to provide the design engineer with a tool capable of supplying information on machining parameter selection, cutting tool selection, and machining time for various machining operations. In this thesis, an expert system that generates cutting parameters, tooling information and machining time for a rotational component is designed. The cutting conditions are based on part features, surface finish requirements and the material used. The system consists of three modules: a feature identification <b>module,</b> a <b>cutting</b> tool selection <b>module</b> and a machining time generation module. A prototype system is developed using PC Plus, an expert system building tool. The prototype system is tested using two sample rotational components.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{immersive}} techniques pioneered {{in the delivery}} of a postgraduate module within a new course, MSc Advanced Product Design. The course was written to help graduates engage with thinking and techniques that are at or slightly in front of industry’s <b>cutting</b> edge. The <b>module</b> at the focus of this paper, Sustainability Issues in Design for Production was designed to bring the consequences of the designer’s actions in contributing to global pollution and climate change to the student’s attention. To make the consequences of energy use, consumption of materials and subsequent waste apparent, the graduates were taken to the Centre for Alternative Technology. There they were given lectures on sustainability and access to information on alternative materials. Most importantly however, they were housed in accommodation where they directly experienced the consequence of their use of resources. Hence every time they used too much power they would experience a short power cut, when they needed heat they had to collect wood, and throughout they were forced to monitor their energy use. The paper describes the module delivery in more detail and presents case studies of the project outcomes with analysis of the results. In conclusion it looks to the future and how the module is expected to develop...|$|R
40|$|Iowa Thin Film Technologies is {{completing}} a three-phase {{program that has}} increased throughput and decreased costs in nearly all aspects of its thin-film photovoltaic manufacturing process. The overall manufacturing costs have been reduced by 61 percent through implementation of the improvements developed under this program. Development {{of the ability to}} use a 1 -mil substrate, rather than the standard 2 -mil substrate, results in a 50 percent cost-saving for this material. Process development on a single-pass amorphous silicon deposition system has resulted in a 37 percent throughput improvement. A wide range of process and machine improvements have been implemented on the transparent conducting oxide deposition system. These include detailed parameter optimization of deposition temperatures, process gas flows, carrier gas flows, and web speeds. An overall process throughput improvement of 275 percent was achieved based on this work. The new alignment technique was developed for the laser scriber and printer systems, which improved registration accuracy from 100 microns to 10 microns. The new technique also reduced alignment time for these registration systems significantly. This resulted in a throughput increase of 75 percent on the scriber and 600 percent on the printer. Automated techniques were designed and implemented for the module assembly processes. These include automated busbar attachment, roll-based lamination, and automated die <b>cutting</b> of finished <b>modules.</b> These processes were previously done by hand labor. Throughput improvements ranged from 200 percent to 1200 percent, relative to hand labor rates. A wide range of potential encapsulation materials were evaluated for suitability in a roll lamination process and for cost-effectiveness. A combination material was found that has a cost that is only 10 percent of the standard EVA/Tefzel cost and is suitable for medium-lifetime applications. The 20 -year lifetime applications still require the more expensive material...|$|R
40|$|In machining, it {{is often}} {{difficult}} to select appropriate tools (tool holder and insert), machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) and tool replacement times for all tools due to the wide variety of tooling options and the complexity of the machining operations. Of particular interest is the complex interrelationships between tool selection, cutting data calculation and tool life prediction and control. Numerous techniques and methods of measuring and modelling tool wear, particularly in turning operations were reviewed. The characteristics of these methods were analysed and it was found that most tool wear studies were self-contained without any obvious interface with tool selection. The work presented herein deals with the development of an integrated, off-line tool life control system (TLC). The tool life control system (TLC) predicts tool life for the various turning operations and for a wide variety of workpiece materials. TLC is a closed-loop system combining algorithms with feedback based on direct measurement of flank wear. TLC has been developed using Crystal, which is a rule-based shell and statistical techniques such as multiple regression and the least-squares method. TLC consists of five modules namely, the technical planning of the cutting operation (TPO), tool life prediction (TLP), tool life assessor (TLA), tool life management (TLM) and the tool wear balancing and requirement planning (TRP). The technical planning of the <b>cutting</b> operation (TPO) <b>module</b> contains a procedure to select tools and generate efficient machining parameters (cutting velocity, feed rate and depth of cut) for turning and boring operations. For any selected insert grade, material sub-class, type of cut (finishing, medium-roughing and roughing) and type of cutting fluid, the tool life prediction (TLP) module calculates the theoretical tool life value (T(_sugg)) based on tool life coefficients derived from tool manufacturers' data. For the selected operation, the tool life assessor (TLA) generates a dynamic multiple regression to calculate the approved tool life constants (InC, 1 /a, 1 /β) based on the real tool life data collected from experiments. These approved constants are used to calculate a modified tool life value (T(_mod)) for the given operation. The stochastic nature of tool life is taken into account, as well as the uncertainty of the available information by introducing a 95 % confidence level for tool life. The tool life management module (TLM) studies the variations in tool life data predicted by TLP and TLA and the approved tool life data collected from the shop floor and provides feedback concerning the accuracy of tool life predictions. Finally, the tool life balancing and requirement planning (TRP) methods address the problem of controlling and balancing the wear rate of the cutting edge by the appropriate alteration of cutting conditions so that each one will machine the number of parts that optimize the overall tool changing strategy. Two new tool changing strategies were developed based on minimum production cost, with very encouraging results. Cutting experiments proved that the state of wear and the tool life can be predicted efficiently by the proposed model. The resulting software can be used by machine manufacturers, tool consultants or process planners to achieve the integrated planning and control of tool life as part of the tool selection and cutting data calculation activity...|$|R
