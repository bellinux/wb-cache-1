25|$|On 6 April 2005—following {{a period}} of curatorial maintenance, recording, and analysis—the {{painting}} was {{moved to a new}} location within the museum's Salle des États. It is displayed in a purpose-built, climate-controlled enclosure behind bulletproof glass. Since 2005 the painting has been illuminated by an LED lamp, and in 2013 a new 20 watt LED lamp was installed, specially designed for this painting. The lamp has a <b>colour</b> <b>rendering</b> index up to 98, and minimizes infrared and ultraviolet radiation which could otherwise degrade the painting. The renovation of the gallery where the painting now resides was financed by the Japanese broadcaster Nippon Television. About 6million people view the painting at the Louvre each year.|$|E
25|$|LED {{lighting}} systems {{are sensitive to}} heat. Due to the negative influences of heat on the stability of photometric performance and the light transmitting components, the importance of thermal design, stability tests, usage of low-UV-type LED modules and UV-resistance tests of internal materials has increased dramatically. For this reason, LED signal lamps must remain compliant with the intensity requirements for the functions they produce after one minute and after thirty minutes of continuous operation. In addition, UN Regulation 112 contains a set of tests for LED modules, including <b>colour</b> <b>rendering,</b> UV radiation, and temperature stability tests. According to UN Regulations 112 and 123, mechanical, electromechanical or other devices for headlamps must withstand endurance tests and function failure tests.|$|E

50|$|Through <b>colour</b> <b>render</b> is a sand/cement/lime based render that is {{made from}} White Portland cement (WOPC) and added pigment to produce a {{coloured}} effect that is throughout {{the body of the}} material.

50|$|The {{white light}} LED market is hugely important, {{with the promise}} of {{increased}} lamp lifetimes and efficiencies paving the way for a revolution in the lighting industry. <b>Colour</b> <b>rendering</b> and efficiency are the two most important criteria for traditional light sources for general lighting. The ability of a light source to illuminate an object’s true colour is denoted by its <b>colour</b> <b>rendering</b> index. For example, sodium lamp street lighting has poor <b>colour</b> <b>rendering</b> capability as it’s difficult to distinguish a red car from a yellow car.|$|E
50|$|In Sikkim, {{according}} to Henry John Elwes and Lionel de Nicéville, it occurs from quite low elevations in the Terai up to 7000 ft. Its almost uniform dark <b>colour</b> <b>renders</b> it inconspicuous in the jungle, {{and it is}} therefore difficult to account for its being further protected by a disagreeable smell and probably taste. James Wood-Mason has recorded that the females have a strong and disgustingly rank musky odour.|$|R
50|$|The {{formulation}} of a monocouche render is distinguished {{by the use}} of White Ordinary Portland Cement as a binder which then enables the formulation to be pigmented. The addition of pigments will give a manufacturer the opportunity to produce a colour range and employ the term through <b>colour</b> <b>render</b> as when the product is applied and finished the pigment will bind in place, {{all the way through the}} body of the render.|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of using glue as a binder {{is that the}} <b>colours</b> <b>render</b> as matte and opaque textures suited to austere or mournful images {{as opposed to the}} translucent appearance associated with oil. Many reds and blues bound in glue would have appeared with a brilliance and intensity difficult to achieve with oil. Unfortunately the surviving examples have greatly deteriorated over time, having suffered from colour alteration due to exposure to light. Furthermore, the solubility of glue derived from animal products has meant that the accumulated layers of dirt cannot be removed without damaging the linen or dissolving the pigment.|$|R

A sea of heads gold and brown, ruddy and black oscillating in unison to right or left like waters driven by the tide, as the combatants down below shifted their ground across the floor of the arena--fans of coloured feathers swinging, mantles caught by a passing breeze, every grain of sand on the floor of the arena a minute mirror radiating the light, everything glowed with an intensity of <b>colour</b> <b>rendered</b> all the more vivid by contrast with the dense shadows thrown against the marble walls.|$|R

50|$|C. romanovi Gr.-Grsh. (26 c) {{occurs in}} Southern Fergana. Its golden red <b>colour</b> <b>renders</b> {{it one of}} the finest species of the genus. The broad black {{marginal}} band of the forewing of the male is usually without spots, but bears sometimes a row of contiguous ill-defined yellow subapical spots, there being also yellowish submarginal spots on the hindwing; this form is the ab. maculata of dealers (26c). In the female the ground colour is paler, the slightly yellow-spotted marginal band being broader and the hindwing darkened, the large orange-red middle spot contrasting sharply. The underside is yellow, the proximal portion of the forewing light orange-red, the submarginal spots of the forewing, which are sometimes absent, are blackish, while those of the hindwing are brownish; the forewing bears a large, pale-centred middle spot and the hindwing a large red-edged double spot of the colour of mother-of-pearl.|$|R

2500|$|Though Wong {{admits to}} being controlling, and oversees every aspect the filmmaking process, he has formed several {{long-lasting}} partnerships and close collaborators. In 2013 he said, [...] "It is always good {{to work with a}} very regular group of people because we know how high we can fly and what are the parameters, and it becomes very enjoyable." [...] Two men have been instrumental in developing and achieving his aesthetic: production designer William Chang and cinematographer Christopher Doyle. Chang has worked on every Wong film and is a trusted confidant, responsible for all set design and costuming. Doyle photographed seven of his projects, all from Days of Being Wild to 2046. Stephen Schneider writes that he deserves [...] "much credit" [...] in Wong's success, as his [...] "masterful use of light and <b>colour</b> <b>renders</b> every frame a work of art". Wong's other regular colleagues include writer-producer Jeffrey Lau, producer Jacky Pang, and assistant director Johnnie Kong.|$|R

50|$|Fall {{prevention}} is thus {{an important consideration}} in designing homes for the elderly, {{and one of the}} most critical parts of that design process is supplying strong and effective lighting. Thus, when switched on, lights should react instantaneously, so the user is not surprised by a hidden obstacle as he or she moves into a kitchen or bathroom, for example. In such a case, incandescent light bulbs are preferred over fluorescent lighting, because they react instantaneously while a CFL takes time to warm up and become bright. Incandescent light bulbs also offer much greater illuminance than many other light sources, are relatively low cost and easy to install. Higher lighting levels enable users to see potential hazards before they need to take avoiding action, and so negotiate them safely and easily. Excellent <b>colour</b> <b>rendering</b> (as measured by the <b>Colour</b> <b>rendering</b> index) by such incandescent light also helps users identify colours correctly. Halogen bulbs are also available for greater efficiency, as are rough service bulbs to avoid discriminatory regulations, especially in the EU. No doubt LED lights will become an alternative source of high quality lighting in the future, but in 2013 they remain expensive for domestic use. Rough service bulbs are available in sizes up to 200 watt in all varieties of fittings. Although lifetime is generally lower than for CFLs, they are replaced easily.|$|E
