50|$|Dandi Biyo {{is played}} by two or more players. The wooden pin is laid across a four-inch-deep hole in the ground. One player puts {{one end of the}} stick inside the hole and holds the other end. The player jerks the stick against the pin to launch the pin into the air while other players called 'fielders' try to <b>catch</b> the <b>pin.</b> If one of the fielders <b>catch</b> the <b>pin</b> in the air, the turn is over and the catcher takes the stick. If the pin instead hits the ground, that player plays to score. One of the fielders then throws the pin into the hole while the player tries to hit and throw the pin away. If the pin goes into the hole, the player's turn is over and the points {{accumulated}} by the player automatically becomes zero. If the pin doesn't go into the hole, the player plays to score by hitting the pin at one end by the stick. In another version of the game, a circular boundary of about one-meter diameter is drawn on the ground. The player throws the pin into the circle from a distance of about two meters. If the pin lies within the circle the player continues to play and score.|$|R

25|$|The game is {{best remembered}} for the Giants' fourth-quarter game-winning drive. Down 14–10, New York {{got the ball}} on their own 17-yard line with 2:39 left and marched 83 yards down the field. In the drive's most memorable play, David Tyree made a leaping one-handed <b>catch</b> <b>pinning</b> the {{football}} {{with his right hand}} to the crown of his helmet for a 32-yard gain. Wide receiver Plaxico Burress then scored the winning touchdown on a 13-yard reception with 35 seconds remaining. The game was tight throughout. Only 10 total points were scored in the first three quarters. The Giants consumed a Super Bowl record 9 minutes and 59 seconds on their opening drive, but could only manage a field goal. The Patriots then responded with running back Laurence Maroney's 1-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter. After a scoreless third quarter, the fourth quarter saw a Super Bowl record three lead changes, including New England wide receiver Randy Moss making a 6-yard touchdown reception with 2:42 left to play before New York's game-winning drive. Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who completed 19 of 34 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, was named Super Bowl MVP. Giants defensive end Michael Strahan, who retired following the victory, had two tackles and one sack. This game was the first since Super Bowl IX (a 16-6 Steelers win over the Vikings) that neither team scored at least 20 points.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The article designs a seven joints {{robot arm}} using PC-based controller. The robot arm {{contains}} seven DC servomotors, seven driver devices and a NI motion control card and uses proximity sensors {{to locate the}} limit position, and programs motion trajectories to finish assigned tasks. We tune {{the parameters of the}} PID controller for each joint of the robot arm, and get the nice response to control the robot arm moving to the assigned position. The user interface is developed in the supervised computer using Visual Basic. The supervised computer (controller) computes the kinematic equations of the seven joints robot arm, and calculates the motion displacement of each joint using inverse kinematic equation. Users can program the motion paths on the user interface. The controller of the robot arm can implement precision point to point motion trajectories according to the programmed motion trajectories. In the experimental result, users can write words on the user interface. The robot arm <b>catches</b> the <b>pin</b> to write the assigned word on the plane...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin B 6 is {{indispensible}} for all organisms, notably as the coenzyme form pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate. Plants {{make the}} compound de novo using {{a relatively simple}} pathway comprising pyridoxine synthase (PDX 1) and pyridoxine glutaminase (PDX 2). PDX 1 is remarkable given its multifaceted synthetic ability to carry out isomerization, imine formation, ammonia addition, aldol-type condensation, cyclization, and aromatization, all {{in the absence of}} coenzymes or recruitment of specialized domains. Two active sites (P 1 and P 2) facilitate the plethora of reactions, but it is not known how the two are coordinated and, moreover, if intermediates are tunneled between active sites. Here we present X-ray structures of PDX 1. 3 from Arabidopsis thaliana, the overall architecture of which is a dodecamer of (β/α) 8 barrels, similar to the majority of its homologs. An apoenzyme structure revealed that features around the P 1 active site in PDX 1. 3 have adopted inward conformations consistent with a catalytically primed state and delineated a substrate accessible cavity above this active site, not noted in other reported structures. Comparison with the structure of PDX 1. 3 with an intermediate along the catalytic trajectory demonstrated that a lysine residue swings from the distinct P 2 site to the P 1 site at this stage of catalysis and is held in place by a molecular <b>catch</b> and <b>pin,</b> positioning it for transfer of serviced substrate back to P 2. The study shows that a simple lysine swinging arm coordinates use of chemically disparate sites, dispensing with the need for additional factors, and provides an elegant example of solving complex chemistry to generate an essential metabolite...|$|R
50|$|Cicadas {{have many}} predators {{because they have}} few defenses. Common predators include squirrels, raccoons, opossums, and birds such as: blue jays, common grackles, house sparrows, American crows, and {{sometimes}} northern cardinals. House sparrows chase cicadas in mid-air often hawking them in air and trying to catch them. Blue jays <b>catch</b> cicadas and <b>pin</b> them down with their feet, and then crush and eat them discarding the wings. Cicadas are rarely consumed by spiders due to their rather bulky size and hard exoskeleton. Cicada killer wasps are also a threat to cicadas. Female wasps hunt cicadas by sight. After locating a cicada they sting it, paralyzing it. They then drag the paralyzed cicada up tree trunk or fence and fly away with it. They bury the cicada in their nest which is a 3-inch hole underground. The female lays her eggs and closes the hole. The eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding on the cicadas. They emerge the following spring. Cicadas commonly spray water at their predator, or fly away. Males when captured will emit a loud alarm call.|$|R
50|$|To {{fasten the}} binding, the spring {{assembly}} was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised slightly it could move forward, releasing all {{tension on the}} clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a safety strap. The boot could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the clips, forcing them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. Step-in action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded <b>pin</b> <b>catch</b> on the cams. When the spring assembly was lifted, the pin was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the spring assembly that released spring pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true step-in, step-out behaviour.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight pull ball bearing lock action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to <b>catch</b> the firing <b>pin.</b> The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|R

A while later, loud music comes from Tom's room and Jack and Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) rush to Tom's door trying to open it and upon realising that it is locked and Tom is in danger, Darren breaks the door down in to see Clare holding Tom with a golf club. Clare tries to escape and runs through the pub with Darren giving chase and falling over a stool. He manages to <b>catch</b> Clare and <b>pins</b> her to the ground until the police come and arrest Clare once again and tells the Osborne's it's not over and that she knows Tom has her money.
