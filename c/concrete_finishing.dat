40|$|Construction labor {{productivity}} variations are {{the results}} of several factors. However most of the productivity models developed address only {{the effect of a}} single factor. There are a few models, limited to masonry construction, in which multiple factors are considered. Regression analysis has been the common tool used in productivity studies, but in recent years neural networks have been a successful alternative for problems similar to construction labor productivity modeling. This study involved development of multivariate productivity models for concrete pouring, formwork, <b>concrete</b> <b>finishing,</b> and granular fill. A large sample was obtained from eight projects of a building contractor. Several neural network and regression models were compared. Modeling approaches, and results of the models were discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) model is developed for the estimation of the concrete pavement construction productivity. Data were collected with direct observation over an eight month period. A multi-layer feed forward (MLFF) network with a back-propagation (BP) algorithm is applied for modeling three main sub-tasks: concrete layering, <b>concrete</b> <b>finishing</b> and joints cutting. Two input neurons have been used representing the working width and length of a given surface with a constant concrete thickness and one output neuron provides estimates of the achieved productivity. One hidden layer with three slabs and different number of neurons for each individual model has been implemented, thus resulting in three distinct {{artificial neural network}}s {{for the study of}} the concrete pavement operations. Different types of scaling functions are incorporated in the models, so as to model the actual data in a more realistic manner. The developed neural network models indicate adequate convergence and generalization capabilities, as shown by the outcome of the validation process. The results are compared with the actual data from the field measurements as well as with estimates stemming from multiple regression (MR) models. It has been shown that for the first two sub-tasks the non-linear description is better, whereas for the third sub-task the regression analysis seems to provide more suitable results. The concrete pavement productivity prediction models developed herein enable planners and estimators to acquire more accurate predictions for different operational scenarios...|$|E

This project aims {{to verify}} {{the quality of the}} {{construction}} process of the expansion and rehabilitation of National Route n° 1 North Interamerican highway Cañas–Liberia section, including <b>concrete</b> <b>finishing</b> and placement of load transfer bars, analysis of the properties of the materials used for the manufacture of concrete mix, its properties and an inspection of the pavement two months later of its collocation. The General Specifications for Highways, Roads and Bridges Construction Manual (CR- 2010) and the RTCR 383 are the sources of the information necessary to complete this work. The results of the tests applied to the materials and to the concrete were prepared and supplied by the laboratory LGC to perform the data analysis. The work place was visited to monitor the construction process in order to analyze it and compare it to the requirements contained in the CR- 2010, using control sheets that are being used until now for FCC. The Manual for Rigid Pavement Construction was made with the information collected from the field and from the CR- 2010,this Manual is the guide for using the control sheets. It was concluded that all materials met the specifications, except for the cement which does not reach the limits of insoluble residue content and loss on ignition. The compression and flexural strengths of the rigid pavement slabs averaged analyzed, exceed the minimum strength requirement established in the CR- 2010. Also it was determined that the pavement does not show important deterioration...|$|E
40|$|The {{numerical}} analysis {{was done to}} examine the effect,of passive solar heat gain of two types floor construction, one is the slab on grade foundation, {{the other is the}} suspended floor with vertical edge insulation, the following things were clarified. 1) The floor surface temperature changes around two hours earlier than the room air temperature, when the sun radiation is exposed to the floor. Especially, the higher the heat capacity of surface material is, the more the room air temp lags behind the surface temp. 2) It is important to select the floor finishing material for a passive solar direct gain. The percentage of thermal admission to the ground via floor construction depends on the surface finish material. 3) In the case of the slab on grade foundation floor construction, 75 to 80 % on wood flooring or on carpet flooring, approximately 83 % of <b>concrete</b> <b>finishing</b> are dissipation to the residential room side. 4) The performance of gained solar heat dissipation of the suspended floor with vertical edge insulation on foundation wall is fallen off 10 to 20 % compare to the floor of slab on grade foundation. 5) In the case of insulated foundation method, the height of the crawl space is less influence to the thermal performance in the crawl space. Consequently, the numerical simulation of heat transfer model in the crawl space is able to calculate using the combined heat transfer coefficient, no need to handle the radiative heat transfer and a convective heat transfer respectively...|$|E

40|$|The Wisconsin Department of Transportation WISDOT) has {{sponsored}} investigations on {{the causes of}} freeze-thaw scaling damage on Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) roadways within the state that are coated with membrane forming curing compounds (MFCCs). Several studies have identified excess bleed water {{at the time of}} curing compound application as a potential cause of reduced scaling resistance of concrete pavements. Increasing the delay between <b>concrete</b> <b>finishing</b> steps and MFC application should serve to lessen scaling damage. However, there is currently no literature that sought to quantify a possible linkage between MFCC application time and the scaling resistance. The primary goal of this research was to evaluate the influence of MFCC application time on the freeze-thaw scaling damage resistance of roadway concrete made with materials native to Wisconsin. A factorial experiment was designed to probe the effect of MFCC application time on scaling damage as measured by ASTM C 672. Three emulsion-based curing compounds, Linseed Oil, Wax, and Poly-alpha-methyl-styrene (PAMS) were evaluated at three application times on concrete specimens prepared with one of two sources of coarse aggregate and one of three cementitious materials. An Acrylic solvent-based sealing compound was evaluated at two application times with respect to concrete scaling resistance. Untreated specimens from each mix type were cured in a wet room and tested as controls. A secondary goal of this project was to evaluate a new method for determining the presence of bleed water on a concrete surface by constructing a device to detect changes in the relative humidity of the air above the concrete surface over time to more reliably determine the cessation of the bleeding than current methods. To achieve this goal, a device was built and its operational capability was tested during the study. ii Concrete mixes were designed and specimens were prepared according to WISDOT procedures to provide a good representation of the pavements within Wisconsin. Freeze-thaw scaling damage testing was performed on all specimens and data was recorded following the appropriate testing standard. Properties such as fresh concrete slump, air content, 28 -day compressive strength, and curing compound application rates were measured and recorded to ensure compliance with WISDOT standards. Results in this study indicate that the influence of MFCC application time on the scaling resistance of concrete is dependent upon the compound chosen. The Linseed Oil and Acrylic formulations displayed significantly increased scaling resistance with an increase in application time. The Wax and PAMS formulations did not display significant increases in scaling resistance with an increase in application time. Results from the untreated wet room cured specimens indicate that curing compounds do not promote scaling resistance levels that compare favorably to the humidity control method wet room curing. Scaling resistance was also found to be dependent upon composition of the concrete, especially with respect to the coarse aggregate and cementitious material choice. Elevated levels of ambient relative humidity at the time of specimen manufacture appeared to decrease the scaling resistance, regardless of application time. The device was found not to be reliable for monitoring the presence of bleed water in its current design. Analysis of the data collected by the device showed that future modifications could be made improve its operational capability...|$|E
