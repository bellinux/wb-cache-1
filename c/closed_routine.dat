40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} use of imperative-formatted {{directives}} in Swedish medical consultations. The specific focus of the chapter is {{the division of labor}} between straight, non-modulated imperative turns and imperative turns which are modulated with a discourse particle or some other verbal mitigating device. The results show that non-modulated imperative turns are embedded in diagnostic work, nominating subsequent actions in a series. Orientations to projected trajectories of action and the other participant’s expectations are clearly present when modulated imperative turns are produced; they are also frequent in the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>routines</b> of the consultations. Thus, there is a link between routinized and projectable actions and {{the use of}} imperatives with a pragmatic modulating element...|$|R

The changes to be implemented include circuit breakers to stop trading when a given equity experiences high intraday price volatility, as well as risk controls that are put into play during the pre-trade phase.

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} infamous {{rendition}} of the national anthem came from comedian Roseanne Barr, who sang it at a San Diego Padres baseball game in July 1990. As her voice was not well liked by the audience, because either she has little singing ability or because she purposefully botched the performance, the large crowd heckled her and threw objects onto the field in her direction in disgust. Her poor performance might have been forgotten, except that she appended a couple of gestures associated with baseball players (adjusting one's protective cup and spitting on the ground), which drew widespread complaints, including from then-President George H.W. Bush. She has not been asked to sing again at a baseball game since.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to experimentally investigate the payload sensitivity of model-based control algorithms for the class of vertically articulated industrial manipulators with high torque amplification drive systems. Once the pay-load sensitivity was established, the minimum subset of payload parameters required to permit payload invariant tracking performance was determined. Analysis of open-loop feedforward compensation torques correctly predicted the experimental PUMA results. High amplification drive sys-tems reduce, but do not eliminate, the payload sensitivity of industrial manipulator dynamics. Model-based controllers must adapt to payload variation in order to maintain high speed tracking accuracy. For a wide range of end-effector payload, the payload estimation/adaptation algorithm for the large positioning links need only compensate for variation in payload mass. To accurately adapt to changes in small link dynamics, the algorithm must estimate both the payload mass and centroid. Knowledge of payload sensitivity can re-duce the complexity of all model-based adaptation schemes and bring them a step <b>closer</b> to <b>routine</b> implementation. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this book {{is not only to}} revisit the “significance test controversy,”but also to provide a conceptually sounder alternative. As such, it {{presents}} a Bayesian framework for a new approach to analyzing and interpreting experimental data. It also prepares students and researchers for reporting on experimental results. Normative aspects: The main views of statistical tests are revisited and the philosophies of Fisher, Neyman-Pearson and Jeffrey are discussed in detail. Descriptive aspects: The misuses of Null Hypothesis Significance Tests are reconsidered in light of Jeffreys’ Bayesian conceptions concerning the role of statistical inference in experimental investigations. Prescriptive aspects: The current effect size and confidence interval reporting practices are presented and seriously questioned. Methodological aspects are carefully discussed and fiducial Bayesian methods are proposed as a more suitable alternative for reporting on experimental results. In <b>closing,</b> basic <b>routine</b> procedures regarding the means and their generalization to the most common ANOVA applications are presented and illustrated. All the calculations discussed can be easily carried out using the freeware LePAC package...|$|R

40|$|MRI-based medical image {{analysis}} for brain tumor studies is gaining attention {{in recent times}} due to an increased need for efficient and objective evaluation of large amounts of data.

The objective in the segmentation is outlining the tumor including its sub-compartments and surrounding tissues, while the main challenge in registration and modeling is the handling of morphological changes caused by the tumor. The qualities of different approaches are discussed with a focus on methods that can be applied on standard clinical imaging protocols. Finally, a critical assessment of the current state is performed and future developments and trends are addressed, giving special attention to recent developments in radiological tumor assessment guidelines...|$|R

40|$|A {{review is}} given of the {{literature}} on the design, development and use of micromachined devices for separations in the liquid phase. The emphasis is on those devices that offer more than just an empty channel for, e. g., electrophoretic separation. Topographic structures have been incorporated in the channels during their microfabrication, offering a variety of possibilities for the separation of (mainly) DNA molecules based on different principles. Supports for a stationary phase for chromatographic separations have been introduced in the channels in different ways: by packing of the channels with stationary phase particles, by polymerization of monolithic structures, or by lithographic machining of pillars in the channels. It is shown that the latter strategy gives the highest potential for increasing the separation power of the devices.

Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the safety of right submammary minithoracotomy for repair of ASD in children and to evaluate the cosmetic and functional results of this approach. Patients and Methods: Between August 2010 and August 2013, 35 children underwent heart operations for ASD closure via right submammary thoracotomy. The standard anterolateral thoracotomy technique entailed a 4 - 5 cm right submammary incision.

We discuss unbiased MD simulations that nowadays allow the observation of unsupervised ligand–target binding, assessing how these approaches help optimizing target affinity and drug residence time toward improved drug efficacy.
