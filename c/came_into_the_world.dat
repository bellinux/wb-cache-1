5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E

25|$|Two years pass. Moagim {{makes no}} attempt to attack Llancarfan, but {{continues}} to conquer lands outside the city. When news arrives that the Twelve Duns, home of the Myrmidon, has fallen, Ravanna, who {{is in love with}} Damas, heads there, saving thousands of refugees, and forging an alliance between the Duns and the city. Meanwhile, Connacht receives word from the Smiths that a device he commissioned from them is ready; the SunHammer. However, when he reaches the forge, he finds it under attack by the Spider Cult, a group who worship Skyrosh, a giant spider from another dimension. Finding the Cult has stolen the Tain and the SunHammer, Connacht readies his forces to attack, but before he can do so, the Smiths infiltrate the cultists' temple. They wipe out the Cult, retrieve the artifacts and imprison Skyrosh within the Tain. When Connacht attacks, he finds a note from Traval explaining Skyrosh <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> by way of an accident during the construction of the Tain, so the Smiths felt honor-bound to defeat her, following her inside the Tain to kill her.|$|E

500|$|Generally, {{his work}} is {{described}} as a warning against lust, and the central panel as a representation of the transience of worldly pleasure. In 1960, the art historian Ludwig von Baldass wrote that Bosch shows [...] "how sin <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through the Creation of Eve, how fleshly lusts spread over the entire earth, promoting all the Deadly Sins, and how this necessarily leads straight to Hell". De Tolnay wrote that the center panel represents [...] "the nightmare of humanity", where [...] "the artist's purpose above all is to show the evil consequences of sensual pleasure and to stress its ephemeral character". Supporters of this view hold that the painting is a sequential narrative, depicting mankind's initial state of innocence in Eden, followed by the subsequent corruption of that innocence, and finally its punishment in Hell. At various times in its history, the triptych has been known as La Lujuria, The Sins of the World and The Wages of Sin.|$|E
500|$|Another {{aspect of}} naming was the {{importance}} {{attached to the}} wider meaning contained in a name. In 17th-century England {{it was believed that}} choosing a name for a child should be done carefully. Children should live according to the message contained in, or the meaning of their names. In 1652 William Jenkyn, an English clergyman, argued that first names should be [...] "as a thread tyed about the finger to make us mindful of the errand we <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to do for our Master". In 1623, at a time when Puritan names such as Faith, Fortitude and Grace were appearing for the first time, English historian William Camden wrote that names should be chosen with [...] "good and gracious significations", as they might inspire the bearer to good actions. With the rise of the British Empire the English naming system and English surnames spread across large portions of the globe.|$|E
500|$|Caesar A. Montevecchio of the University of Notre Dame {{published}} a theological {{assessment of the}} spiritual themes in the film concentrating on the act of priestly renunciation depicted towards the end stating: [...] "This climactic scene of Rodrigues trampling the fumie makes clear that Silence {{is as much about}} the object of Christian faith as it is the experience of that faith. As ambient and live sound are washed out entirely, Rodrigues hears the voice of Christ telling him to trample, that it was to be trampled upon that Christ <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The object of faith becomes a Christ who is a hero of pity, who takes up the weakness and suffering of humankind as his cross, rather than a hero of triumphant resolve. The Jesus of Silence is one of utter kenosis (self-emptying), and one who in the mercy of that kenosis radically sympathizes with the weakness, and frailty, of human beings, even ones like Judas and Kichijiro." ...|$|E

Karl Kerényi suggests that [...] "Tritogeneia {{did not mean that}} she <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally."
