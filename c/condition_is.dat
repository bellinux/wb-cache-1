5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a state of}} the art of path choice and traffic {{assignment}} models in road emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> reported. The approaches proposed in literature are classified, distinguishing two approaches for path choice and three approaches for traffic assignment (static, pseudo dynamic and dynamic). In literature, several applications of models in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> available: at the beginning models specified in ordinary <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> applied in emergency conditions. Afterwards, a first generation of models specified in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>was</b> proposed. After 9 / 11 and Katrina Hurricane a second generation of emergency <b>conditions</b> models <b>was</b> specified. Evolution of models applied in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> presented in this paper: first, models in ordinary <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> treated; second, models in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> treated. In the last ten years several applications of models in emergency <b>conditions</b> have <b>been</b> carried out. Main applications in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> summarized in this paper...|$|R

5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E
