5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea was based around {{the premise of}} creating a town like those found in a role-playing game. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game, which is usually not possible with an isometric camera, as it always points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created {{as a way to}} explain this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand-painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as typical in isometric games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Bent edge {{began as}} a counter-movement to {{straight}} edge {{by members of the}} Washington, D.C. hardcore scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene. This idea spread, and on Minor Threat's first tour in 1982, people would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band to identify themselves as bent, crooked, or curved edge. The counter-movement was short lived and faded away {{by the end of the}} 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Hoops, {{also called}} krikoi, were {{probably}} made of bronze, iron, or copper, and were driven {{with a stick}} called the elater. The hoop was sized according to the player, as it had to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of the chest. Greek vases generally show the elater as a short, straight stick. The sport was regarded as healthful, and was recommended by Hippocrates for strengthening weak constitutions. Even very young children would play with hoops.|$|E
25|$|At least forty {{men of the}} 3rd New York Infantry {{had fled}} back to the fort at Hampton where they {{reported}} that their regiment was being cut to pieces by a large Confederate force. Before waiting for a request for reinforcement, Colonel William H. Allen then headed north with the 1st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment to help Townsend's regiment. Peirce also soon sent a message back to Hampton for the 2d New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment under Colonel Joseph B. Carr to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area. They were ordered {{to stop at the}} New Market Bridge and ultimately acted as a rear guard.|$|E
25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify {{the results of their}} researches. It is bad enough if we {{have to put up with}} these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E

25|$|The Maniac, now impersonating Malipiero, finds Pissani and his lackey, the Constable, in {{the room}} where the anarchist was during his interrogation. Telling them that he is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was {{involved}} with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact the events of the interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, who the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was born}} in 1990, the son of Thomas Robinson, Sr., and Dorothea Robinson. [...] Robinson began playing pee-wee {{football}} by age 10 and played the game with his shoes untied, thus earning the nickname [...] "Shoelace" [...] as a child. [...] Those who saw him play at Westside Park in Deerfield Beach recall:"Kids would go for his shoes on tackles, and he'd <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> huddle in just socks. [...] His coach couldn't stand it at first and neither could his parents. They'd tie wristbands around his shoes. When that didn't work, they tried athletic tape. They even rolled his socks over his shoes. He was a marvel, and he wasn't even finished with the sixth grade." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{completed}} his paratrooper training {{in just over}} eight months, and Major General C.W.G. Rich awarded him the prestigious Screaming Eagles patch on January 11, 1962. By February, his personal conduct had begun to draw criticism from his superiors. They labeled him an unqualified marksman and often caught him napping while on duty and failing to report for bed checks. On May 24, Hendrix's platoon sergeant, James C. Spears, filed a report in which he stated: [...] "He has no interest whatsoever in the Army... It is my opinion that Private Hendrix will never <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standards required of a soldier. I feel that the military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible." [...] On June 29, 1962, Captain Gilbert Batchman granted Hendrix an honorable discharge {{on the basis of}} unsuitability. Hendrix later spoke of his dislike of the army and falsely stated that he had received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump.|$|E

500|$|It is {{reported}} that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter. The Greeks {{allowed him to}} <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout's reports {{of the size of}} the Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in calisthenics and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of Demaratus, an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them [...] "the bravest men in Greece" [...] and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, [...] "there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defense." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 June 1944, the 77th Holding, and the {{training}} divisions, had a combined total of 22,355 men. Of these, only 1,100 were immediately available as replacements for the 21st Army Group. The remaining 21,255 men were considered ineligible for service abroad due {{to a variety of}} reasons, ranging from medical, not being considered fully fit, or not yet fully trained. Over the following six months, up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce the 21st Army Group, following the completion of their training and/or having <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> required fitness levels. Stephen Hart comments that, by September, the 21st Army Group [...] "had bled Home Forces dry of draftable riflemen" [...] due to the losses suffered during the Battle of Normandy, leaving the army in Britain (with the exception of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division) with just [...] "young lads, old men, and the unfit". On 1 September 1944, the division was disbanded. The 45th (Holding) Division was then formed (the 45th Infantry Division having been disbanded on 15 August) by Michelmore and his headquarter staff. Michelmore assumed command, and the 45th Holding Division took over the role of the 77th Division. Roger Hesketh states the reason behind this renumbering was due to the 45th Division being a [...] "well-known territorial [...] before the war whose [...] familiar to the public and [...] therefore of recruiting value".|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "Improvements in studio {{technology}} meant that possibilities for shaping the sound {{after it has}} been recorded are almost limitless." [...] Such possibility were applied in the song composition and the remixes present in You Can Dance. Previously to change the sound of an instrument, or to jump from one sound to another, recordings used to stop playing the instrument and the drums at that point. But for the remixes on You Can Dance, the fade engineering technology was applied to the songs, wherein the fader was simply pulled down, and was pushed up again when the sound of the instruments were made to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface. The first song on the album is [...] "Spotlight" [...] which begins with the sound of drums, bass synths and handclaps, followed by Madonna uttering the words [...] "Spotlight, shine bright". After the first verse, the sound of keyboard is heard during the chorus. It continues like this through the second verse, which is followed by an interlude featuring vocal echoes, a piano segment and violin phrases. Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words [...] "Pa-da-pa-da-pappa pappa pa pa" [...] in the same melody. The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that [...] "everybody is a star" [...] and that if one wants to be famous and be under the [...] "spotlight", the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her. According to the sheet music published at SheetMusicPlus.com, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is set in the key of F major with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes of C5 to B5. [...] "Spotlight" [...] has a basic sequence of Am–C–Am–C–G–F as its chord progression.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{theory is}} that the {{reference}} is to , where the prophet Joel says, speaking of the judgment of the dead, [...] "Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD. Let the heathen be wakened, and <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Baldelli had {{to adjust}} to {{professional}} baseball. Says Baldelli, [...] "In Princeton, I {{had a hard time}} with all parts of the game…I didn't know how to play the game.

Philo taught that wise people see themselves as sojourners in a foreign land – the body perceptible by the senses – and view the virtues appreciable by the intellect as their native land.|$|E
