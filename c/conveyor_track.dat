50|$|In 1932, a dealing {{table was}} {{patented}} by Laurens Hammond. This {{was one of}} the first machines to use electricity to power the necessary shuffling and dealing mechanism. His patent description provides interesting insights regarding the problems related to previous machines: if the cards were worn or bent, the shuffling could fail. He also criticized the randomness of previous shuffling methods and pointed out the risk of predicting the final sequence. The patent also contains mathematical explanations regarding the inner state of his machine. A motor drove a rotating frame that would distribute 13 cards to each player. The machine was going through 53 cycles to distribute the 52 cards. During each cycle, a selector plate with 52 notches rotated by one step. There were four possible depths for the notches and a lug touching the notches would determine which player would receive the card. Each card was taken from the top of deck and sent to the corresponding player's receptacle using a <b>conveyor</b> <b>track.</b> The first cycle was used to rotate the plate and ensured that the distribution would start with a new sequence. One property of the machine is that the same player could be served during two or three consecutive cycles. To increase randomness, the author proposes to use a set of different selector plates or to use another deck being shuffled while people are playing. The machine was fast enough to shuffle a whole deck in a few seconds. If only one plate was used, the same dealing sequence would appear after 52 deals (there were 52 possible starting points on the plate; the starting point was not randomly chosen as the plate always rotated by one step in the same direction during each cycle).|$|E

40|$|Purpose. One of {{the main}} {{elements}} of band conveyors is a drive. To analyze the effect of design parameters on the drive power it is necessary to carry out the calculations according to standard procedures outlined in the current technical literature. The main design parameters of the band conveyor are: the type of cargo, project performance, the geometric dimensions of sections and track configuration as a whole. The feature of band conveyor calculation as compared to the elevators is the dependence of the band width on its performance, the inclination angle and the type of cargo. In the article for the account of this fact during calculations it is necessary to construct the dependence of the band width on the generalized parameter, which takes into account change in the design parameters. To determine the general pattern of changing the value of band conveyor drive power when varying its design parameters in the article it is necessary to construct the corresponding graphic dependences taking into account the standard sizes and bands parameters. Methodology. We consider the band conveyor with two sections: the inclined and horizontal one. It is conducted a detailed analysis of dependence of the conveyor band width and its drive power on the type of cargo, project performance, geometric dimensions and configuration of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>track,</b> using the appropriate parameter dependences constructed by the authors in previous papers. Findings. For band conveyors of this type there were constructed the graphics dependences of the band width on the parameter characterizing the project performance and the inclination angle of the track section, and on the performance at a fixed angle of inclination. Taking into account the changes in the band width with an increase in the value of project performance the graph dependences of drive power on the productivity and the inclination angle of the inclined section were built. Originality. For the first time there were built the general dependences of the conveyor band width and the drive power with two sections (inclined and horizontal) on the design parameters and there were presented the corresponding graphs. Practical value. Use of the built graphic dependences of drive power of band conveyors with the inclined and horizontal sections on the design parameters makes it possible to quickly determine the approximate value of drive power at the design stage, and to determine the general change nature of its value while varying the design parameters...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the integration of}} the robotic assembly workcell and the capability of the AdeptOne SCARA robot in performing both non-vision and vision based <b>conveyor</b> <b>tracking.</b> An experiment is set up for a Plastic Leadless Chip Carrier, or PLCC, chip and socket assembly operation. A PLCC chip is a square-shape integrated circuit that has its pins bent down around its perimeter to prevent damage to the pins during assembly and transportation. Binary image processing is employed by the vision system to recognize the random locations of incoming PLCC chips at the upstream location of the conveyor. When at least one PLCC chip is identified, the robot will acquire the chip using a special designed end effector and will wait until a printed circuit board passes the sensor at the downstream location of the conveyor. The robot will then insert the PLCC chip into the PLCC socket on the moving circuit board which is transported into the robot 2 ̆ 7 s work envelope by the conveyor. The circuit board is fixed on the conveyor belt. The entire operation is conducted without any interruption of the conveyor 2 ̆ 7 s motion. This thesis covers the design of the robot workcell and the end effector that accomplishes the assembly task and the results of non-vision and vision <b>conveyor</b> <b>tracking</b> during PLCC assembly using the Adept robot system...|$|R

40|$|Robot <b>{{conveyor}}</b> <b>tracking</b> {{is a task}} {{in which}} a robot follows and obtains objects on a conveyor belt. Prior to obtaining an object from an automation line, a robot needs information about the object, such as its position, orientation, velocity, size, etc. Compared to ultrasonic sensors and infrared ray sensors, vision sensors can provide {{more information about the}} object on the conveyor belts. Generally, an object tracking system has several steps: obtaining an image, recognizing objects, and extracting information for object position and orientation. The object tracking process for a conveyor system should be fast enough to support a real-time environment. In this article we describe a robotic tracking system that uses vision information extracted from sequential image frames. For fast extraction of vision information we applied a difference image technique which carries out a subtraction operation between two sequential frames with a small time interval. This simple method is useful for obtaining information about an image when there are minimal background effects caused by the conveyor system. In this article we present some results of some experiments using an integrated robot conveyor, vision system, and robot user interface software...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{article is}} available at: [URL] Copyright John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [Full text {{of this article}} is not available in the UHRA]In this paper the modelling, analysis and compensation of current <b>conveyor</b> <b>tracking</b> non-idealities in signal-processing circuits employing the second-generation current conveyor (CCII) as a transconductance amplifier are generally investigated. The voltage- and current-following inaccuracies of the CCII are represented in the forms of absolute and relative errors. Analysis shows that the effects of absolute tracking errors in a non-ideal CCII-based transconductance amplifier can be represented by an ideal CCII transconductance amplifier with an external voltage or current offset source. With this model the circuit output signal shift due to tracking errors can be easily evaluated using any excitation-response circuit analysis method. For the relative error description the effects of CCII following inaccuracies are modelled as a change in the transconductance resistance for the CCII transconductance amplifier. The affected circuit parameters are therefore readily assessed by directly replacing the nominal transconductance resistance in the ideal expressions by the varied counterpart, and the impact of relative errors can thus be precisely compensated by simply adding a proper resistance in parallel or series with the transconductance resistance. The methods developed for conventional CCIIs with unity gains are also extended to incorporate generalized CCIIs with any specified voltage and current gains...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the order-of-arrival for items on a conveyor belt is a fundamental operation for automatic supply chain management. Classical solutions are based on optical systems, which are accurate but do not guarantee the transmission of a high amount of data through the barcode, or on ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID), which does not guarantee high-accuracy sorting. Among wireless technologies, ultra-wide band (UWB) provides high-accuracy localization.

When a patient named Cameron Pollins (Sam Jackson) begins acting strange Arthur realises he is their attacker. He threatens Chantelle and grabs her by the neck, but Arthur defends her and they share a kiss. Ostlere said that viewers see a change in Arthur and branded it the first time he managed to [...] "man-up". Writers created a car crash storyline for the character, Arthur accidentally crashes his car {{into the back of a}} lorry with Chantelle and a {{colleague}} as his passengers. Ostlere told Moon (Inside Soap) that the crash episode is [...] "shocking" [...] with a [...] "very tense" [...] aftermath. Chantelle is critically injured in the accident and he rescues her from the wreckage, the actor added that [...] "it's emotional for him seeing the girl he loves in danger." [...] Arthur tries to compensate and fight his guilt by helping during Chantelle's operation. The scenes were filmed on a disused rail track near Luton which was made-up to look like a country road. Filming car crash sequences often requires the vehicle to be placed on a <b>conveyor</b> belt <b>track.</b> But Ostlere was allowed to drive the car with two high-tech cameras attached and he recalled having to be careful as not to break them.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} new modern methods for the research of movement of material on a belt conveyor. One of the innovative methods is Particle Image Velocimetry (“PIV”), which was used to scan and assess the two-dimensional vector field of speed of particles on the belt conveyor. Outputs from PIV were compared to simulations of the same transport process. These simulations were performed using the Discrete Element Method (“DEM”). Four transport speeds of material were assessed for a real and simulative belt <b>conveyor</b> model.

Comparison of the particle path trajectory corresponds to the preliminary hypothesis which leads to calibration of the DEM simulation. The results and assessment of this paper were created based on validation...|$|R
40|$|Background: This patent {{is based}} on the {{combination}} of caterpillar mechanisms and <b>conveyors.</b> Caterpillar <b>tracks</b> support heavy loads and adapt this support according to the ground conditions. Conveyors displace distributed loads continuously and bidirectionally using the force of friction. This paper describes a revision of previous patents related to this innovative design. Objective: This paper presents an innovative patent to continuously displace heavy structures safely. The mechanism was patented in 2011 as Spanish Patent ES 2367737. The combination of these mechanisms provides the design of this patent to displace heavy structures continuously and bidirectionally, while adapting to the deflection of the structures. Methods: The most important elements of this patent are detailed in the paper. The most innovative component is the load compensation system, which increases the safety of the displacement of heavy structures. This system controls the load applied on the mechanism, and the displacement can be stopped before the collapse of the heavy structure. Results: An application of the patent for launching bridges using the Incremental Launching Method is presented. This mechanism is used to displace heavy structures using the force of friction. Conclusion: The patented mechanism is an original contribution for the displacement of heavy structures continuously and bidirectionally. The patent can be used to launch bridges, improving the efficiency, sustainability, and safety of current systems.

By lap 15, Hamlin caught the tail-end {{of the field and}} completed the short <b>track</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. By lap 18, Busch ran down his teammate and pressured him for the lead. Eventually, the No. 18 Toyota used the lap traffic to pass the No. 11 and take the lead on lap 28. The lapped traffic allowed Kyle to pull away from Denny in the ensuing laps. A. J. Allmendinger bumped Paul Menard in turn 3 and about sent the No. 27 car spinning in front of the race leader, but he saved his car and the race continued. Debris in turn 3 brought out the first caution of the race on lap 52. Kyle Busch and Denny Hamlin swapped the lead on pit road with the former pitting on the backstretch. It was ultimately Busch whom exited pit road with the lead. Ryan Blaney and Danica Patrick were tagged for speeding on pit road and restarted the race {{from the rear of the}} field.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} Long Range Transport (LRT) of ozone and related species over the North Atlantic ocean {{and its impact}} on Europe. Measurements of NO 2 and O 3 columns from the GOME and MOPITT {{satellite}} instruments are first used in conjunction with the GEOS-CHEM global model of transport and tropospheric chemistry to identify the major events of LRT that reach Europe {{over the course of the}} summer 2000. Model simulations are then used to examine surface O 3 observations at a European mountain site and O 3 vertical profiles over several European cities to quantify the impact of the LRT events on the European ozone distributions. Over the course of summer 2000, we identified nine major episodes of pollution transport between North America and Europe, which are in majority associated with WCB/post-frontal outflow (7 events) and zonal transport (2 events). We find that on average three episodes occur per month with the strongest ones being in June. The number and frequency of LRT events that reach Europe after leaving North America is strongly driven by the position and strength of the Azores anticyclone. After leaving North America, the plumes can either i) travel in the North American cyclones, mostly in the Warm <b>Conveyor</b> Belt (WCB), <b>tracking</b> poleward and thus reach Europe at high latitudes; ii) be transported zonally between 40 ° and 55 ° N directly to Europe; iii) be incorporated into the Azores anticyclone and reach Europe at mid-latitudes. Based on model sensitivity simulation it can be concluded that on average the North American sources of ozone contribute between 2 – 8 ppb in PBL and 10 – 13 ppb in FT. During particular episodes the North American sources resulted in O 3 enhancement up to 25 – 28 ppb in the layer between 800 – 600 hPa and 10 – 12 ppb in PBL. For some episodes a substantial North American contribution (30 % or higher) does not translate into a well marked enhancement of the total O 3...|$|R
