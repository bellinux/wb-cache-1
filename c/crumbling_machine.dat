50|$|During {{the fourth}} season, Bolin found himself working to re-unite the Earth Kingdom under Kuvira, {{who would become}} the season's villain. During this season, he was stuck between being loyal to his boss or to his friends, where he {{believed}} that Kuvira was {{doing the right thing}} despite his friends trying to convince him otherwise. Later in the season, the character realized that Kuvira was going too far and escaped her control. By helping saving the family of his girlfriend Opal, Bolin regained her trust. After returning to Republic City, Bolin along with Lin, Suyin, and Zhu Li, interrupted a conference of President Raiko's, who was meeting with Korra, Prince Wu, Tenzin and Mako. Zhu Li informed everyone that Kuvira planned to attack Republic City in two weeks. The President ordered the evacuation of Republic City while Bolin, {{along with the rest of}} team Avatar, decided to launch a preemptive strike against Kuvira in an attempt to destroy the dictator's superweapon. However their mission was unsuccessful, discovering the army was only hours away from Republic city, a week earlier than expected, They also were surprised that Kuvira mounted her superweapon on a 25-story tall robot, which she controlled through her metalbending. The team briefed their allies on Kuvira's progress. After Kuvira's army arrived in Republic City, Bolin took part in a plan to stop the large robot: the benders would relentlessly attack the robot to distract Kuvira while two hummingbird mecha suits would cut a circular hole in the machine without being crushed. A team would then enter the suit through the hole and ultimately destroy the massive machine from its inside. The plan was generally successful as he managed to enter inside the hole with Suyin, Lin, Mako, and Korra. In the process Bolin saved Mako from certain death, carrying his brother to safety after he found him unconscious in the engine room of the <b>crumbling</b> <b>machine.</b> In the series' end, Bolin would preside over Varrick (who he befriended in Season Four) and Zhu Li's wedding at Air Temple Island.|$|E
