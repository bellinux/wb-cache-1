40|$|The {{effect of}} benzyl alcohol and phenol on the cure of epoxy resins is reported. The epoxy resin, {{a blend of}} the diglycidyl ethers of {{bisphenol}} A and bisphenol F, was cured with 4, 4 '-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) diamine. Measurements of the cure and vitrification times were obtained using a vibrating plate <b>curometer.</b> Mechanical properties were assessed using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Time temperature transformation (TTT) diagrams were constructed. Benzyl alcohol lowers the viscosity, aids cure and plasticizes the final product. Phenol and triethylenetetramine [TETA] significantly enhance the rate of cure and have a catalytic effect...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} two-phase approach, {{based on}} experimental <b>curometer</b> charts and aimed at predicting the optimal production line parameters (exposition time and cure temperature) for extruded thick rubber items cured with accelerated sulphur is presented. In the first phase, a simple kinetic model {{based on the}} actual reticulation reactions occurring during sulphur curing is utilized to fit experimental <b>curometer</b> data. The model is able to predict the degree of crosslinking at successive curing times and at different controlled temperatures and it requires the calibration of only three kinetic constants. The variation of such parameters with temperature is then evaluated by means of three experimental cure curves performed at three different temperatures. Both the case of indefinite increase of the torque and reversion can be handled. In the second phase, considering the same rubber compound of step one, kinetic reaction parameters are implemented in a Finite Element (FE) software, specifically developed to perform thermal analyses on complex 2 D geometries. As an example, an extruded cylindrical thick EPDM item is considered and meshed through four-noded isoparametric plane elements. Several FE simulations are repeated by changing exposition time tc and external cure temperature Tn, to evaluate for each (tc,Tn) couple the corresponding mechanical properties of the item {{at the end of}} the thermal treatment. An alternating tangent approach (AT) is used to drastically reduce the computational efforts required to converge to the optimal solution associated with the maximization of the average tensile strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to find best formulation for rubber sole sheeting for sandal. The formulation of the compounds were made by variation ratio of natural rubber and sintetic rubber SBR as follow : 100 / 0, 75 / 25, 50 / 50, 25 / 75 and 0 / 100, where as the variation ratio of carbon black N 330 and aluminium silicate filler 100 / 0, 60 / 40 and 20 / 80 respectively. Compounding process was carried out on two roll mill. The rubber compounds were vulcanized at temperature 150 oC and pressure of 150 kg/cm 2 with curing time as indicated by <b>curometer.</b> Vulcanized rubber were tested based on SNI. 06 - 0899 - 1989 : Rubber sheeting for sole. The best formulation was consist of natural rubber 75 phr, sintetic rubber SBR 25 phr, stearic acid 3 phr, zinc oxide 5 phr, Minarex B oil 5 phr, car bon black 100 phr, MBTS 1 phr, PBN 1 phr and sulfur 2 phr.

40|$|The {{variation}} of the viscosity {{as a function of}} the degree of conversion for an anhydride cured epoxy resin is modeled using a combination of a Monte Carlo statistical model of the polymerization process and constitutive equations describing the motion of the entities in the mix. The degree of conversion was monitored as a function of time using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy over the temperature range 80 – 130 °C. The rate data are analyzed using the Kamal equation and activation energy of 57 and 64 kJ mol– 1 obtained from the temperature dependence of the rate constants. The gelation and vitrification times for the cure process measured as a function of temperature were measured using a vibrating probe <b>curometer.</b> The {{variation of}} the viscosity measured experimentally and predicted are found to be similar when compared {{as a function of the}} degree of conversion. A time–temperature transformation was constructed and indicated that the gelation point occurred at approximately the same degree of conversion for all the temperatures investigated. The influence of the cure process on the final mechanical propeties of the resin is explored through dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. This paper indicates the possibility of predicting the {{variation of the}} viscosity prior to gelation based on the cure kinetics for reactive polymer systems...|$|E
