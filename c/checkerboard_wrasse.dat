50|$|The <b>checkerboard</b> <b>wrasse</b> is a {{predator}} that feeds mainly on small invertebrates such as crustaceans, molluscs , worms , echinoderms captured on the substrate {{or in the}} sand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>checkerboard</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Halichoeres hortulanus) is a fish {{belonging}} to the wrasse family. It is native to the area including the Indian Ocean to central Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} wrasses, the <b>checkerboard</b> <b>wrasse</b> is a protogynous hermaphrodite, {{starting}} {{life as a}} female and later becoming a male, changing sex at maturity when it is about 12.8 cm long.|$|E
50|$|The <b>checkerboard</b> <b>wrasse</b> is a {{small sized}} fish that can reach a maximum length of 27 cm. Both its sex and {{appearance}} change during its life, and the colouring at each stage is rather variable based on location. The body is thin, relatively lengthened and its mouth is terminal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>checkerboard</b> <b>wrasse</b> is {{widespread}} throughout the tropical and subtropical {{waters of the}} Indian Ocean, from the Red Sea to South Africa, to the oceanic islands (French Polynesia) from central Pacific Ocean. The northern limit is the south of Japan and the southern limit is the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
50|$|In the {{terminal}} phase (after gender {{has been determined}} at maturity), {{there is a large}} variation of coloration. The <b>checkerboard</b> <b>wrasse</b> has a white to greenish background coloration with blue to black on the edge of its scales, reminiscent of a checkerboard pattern. The head is greenish with pink lines stretching to dots behind the eyes until the base of dorsal fin.A bright yellow spot appears at the border of the side and the dorsal fin. Some color variation occur with a possible black spot just behind the characteristic first yellow spot, and a second bright yellow spot can be seen {{along the edge of the}} dorsal fin but at the end of this later. In the Red Sea, half the back of some individuals may be colored blue. The caudal fin is truncated and usually yellow with a pinkish pattern, which can be faded or completely blue.|$|E
