Delivery of services was categorized according to. telephone or face-to-face; the frequency of each was measured. Services were categorized as "household " (housekeeping, paying bills, making repairs) and "normal kin " (<b>checking</b> <b>on</b> <b>persons,</b> bringing meals, giving gifts, talking {{to them when they}} are depressed).

50|$|For {{purposes}} of employment {{in a field}} that is covered by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and {{not subject to the}} Exceptions Order, once a conviction is ‘spent’, the person is considered rehabilitated and the Act treats the person as if they had never committed an offence. As a result, the conviction or caution in question {{does not need to be}} disclosed by the person when applying for most jobs, educational courses, insurance, housing applications or other purposes, unless the role applied for is ‘exempt’ from the Act. If a role is covered by the Act, it is unlawful for an employer to refuse to employ a person (or dismiss an existing employee) because the individual has a ‘spent’ caution or conviction. It is also unlawful for an organisation to knowingly carry out (or enable someone else to obtain) a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) <b>check</b> <b>on</b> a <b>person</b> for a role which is covered by the Act. If a role is covered by the Act, the employer is only legally entitled to carry out a basic criminal check known as a Basic Disclosure (provided by DBS) which will reveal only ‘unspent’ convictions.|$|R

50|$|At age 16, Christian W. Staudinger {{left home}} {{and went to}} Erfurt, where he began his waiter-apprenticeship after his {{original}} career aspirations of the sailor in the merchant navy and, thereafter, the boatman on inland waters had been rejected by the Stasi. The people in GDR needed a permit from the state for their career aspirations. In Erfurt he fell into circles around Eberhard Häfner and others, which discussed passionate about politics and art, listened {{to the music of}} the so-called imperialist Staatsfeind and he came in contact with THC and LSD-25. He read Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego and Totem and Taboo by Sigmund Freud, which he had received from Eberhard Häfner. The new findings he tied into his examination paper for the final examination - then at least an affront. The teacher, Mrs. Richter, expressed her enthusiasm behind her hand, but could not vote because literature of the “State-enemy” had been cited. The day after his practical test, from which he made a parody and therefore he failed, Staudinger went to his escape from East Germany. To his desire to leave his beloved home, emerging and fast growing doubts about the integrity of the system have led. He had read the classics, but all that did not stand a comparison with reality. In addition, he wanted to become a skydiver. He was in the Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik, but in order to jump one had to be in the National People's Army or in the Stasi. The Stasi began to be interested in him and tried to recruit him as part of the OPK (operational <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> <b>persons).</b> He felt honored and loved those discussions with the Stasi officers who at home always encountered violent counter-arguments. But soon the Stasi was tired, wanted names that refused the artist and at the end stand the never-forgotten threat who received many former GDR-citizens in the same wording: “Either you are with us or against us. Join in and out you can be something. If not, you will croak on the machine!” Christian W. Staudinger 1971 in the age of 18 and together with a friend made on the way to Bulgaria in order to leave the country to Turkey. This way many so-called “Republic-refugees” had chosen, as Stefan Appelius, Professor of Political Science, has researched. Only the brother was informed, in order not to endanger the family. At the Veleka they failed to escape because the maps were false. They came to arrest and torure in the Bulgarian prisons. But he stayed alive, unlike other refugees. The Stasi in Bulgaria stationed brought him back to East Germany, he came into the Stasi prison Andreasstrasse in Erfurt in custody and was sentenced to one year and seven months for his attempt of illegal emigration and anti-state-propaganda, which he served in Cottbus. With the help of the two lawyers Vogel & Stange (one east, one west, and in that times famous in Germany) he came straight from prison to the Federal Republic of Germany. He by a tragic event, unlike many others in the GDR for political offenses convicted, came into possession of at least the copies of the indictment and judgment. The experiences of the flight are published in German as an audio book on YouTube, spoken by Erich Räuker. Shortly before his flight Christian W. Staudinger had fathered a child, of which he only heard in prison as it was already born. He managed to bring mother and child in the way of family reunification to West-Berlin. The West and the events of the recent past ruined everything he had believed, so that he tried to kill himself in 1974 with 250 sleeping pills. From the clinical death the doctors succeeded in his salvation. His brother, Ulrich Staudinger, later was sentenced to 4 years for reportedly subversive propaganda. Released earlier he jumped to death in West-Berlin-subway 1981.|$|R
