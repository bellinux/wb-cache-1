Large national lumber companies set up operations and expanded significantly {{for the next}} two decades. Jetty improvements, commercial fishing and <b>crabbing</b> shaped the development of Charleston. The completion of the North Bend Bridge (now McCullough Memorial Bridge) in 1936 and the Roosevelt Highway significantly improved modern transportation connections and provided the final link in opening the Coos region to the outside world.

25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{recreational}} blue crab fishery in the Gulf of Mexico is not well known. Commercial <b>crabbing</b> was first reported in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1880s. Early crab fishermen used long-handled dip nets and drop nets among other simple fishing gear types to trap crabs at night. Blue crab spoiled quickly, which limited distribution and hindered {{the growth of the}} fishery for several decades. The first commercial processing plant in Louisiana opened in Morgan City in 1924. Other plants opened soon after, although commercial processing of hard blue crabs was not widespread until World War II.|$|E
25|$|Blue crabs grow by {{shedding}} their exoskeleton, or molting, {{to expose}} a new, larger exoskeleton. After it hardens, the new shell fills with body tissue. Shell hardening occurs most quickly in low salinity water where high osmotic pressure allows the shell to become rigid soon after molting. Molting reflects only incremental growth, making age estimation difficult. For blue crabs, {{the number of}} molts in a lifetime is fixed at approximately 25. Females typically exhibit 18 molts after the larval stages, while postlarval males molt about 20 times. Male blue crabs tend to grow broader and have more accentuated lateral spines than females. Growth and molting are profoundly influenced by temperature and food availability. Higher temperatures and greater food resources decrease {{the period of time}} between molts as well as the change in size during molts (molt increment). Salinity and disease also have subtle impacts on molting and growth rate. Molting occurs more rapidly in low salinity environments. The high osmotic pressure gradient causes water to quickly diffuse into a soft, recently molted blue crab's shell, allowing it to harden more quickly. The effects of diseases and parasites on growth and molting are less well understood, but in many cases have been observed to reduce growth between molts. For example, mature female blue crabs infected with the parasitic rhizocephalan barnacle Loxothylacus texanus appear extremely stunted in growth when compared to uninfected mature females. Blue crab may reach maturity within one year of hatching in the Gulf of Mexico, while Chesapeake Bay crabs may take up to 18 months to mature. As a result of different growth rates, commercial and recreational <b>crabbing</b> occur year-round in the Gulf of Mexico, while <b>crabbing</b> seasons are closed for colder parts of the year in northern states.|$|E

Despite the rough seas in 40- to 60-knot (74- to 111-km/hr) winds, Miller Freemans crew managed to get a line across to Aquarian and tow her to Akutan Island, ending a two-day ordeal for Aquarians crew.|$|E
25|$|These {{songs are}} known as décimas, but unlike the ten-line Spanish décima of the 16th century, a form {{widespread}} throughout Hispanic America, the décima of the Isleños of Louisiana is usually composed in couplets using four half-lines of verse, the even verses being assonant rhymes. They {{appear to have been}} composed as recently as the 1920s–1940s and feature themes relating to local history, the hazards encountered by Isleño people in such occupations as shrimping, <b>crabbing,</b> and trapping, the misadventures of local personalities, and humorously exaggerated tales of fishing exploits. The Isleños, at least those of Saint Bernard Parish, sing two types of décimas: traditional décimas and improvised décimas, composed while they are being sung.

Almost all the Coplas have been transmitted, more or less unaltered from generation to generation, from the time of the original emigrants from Spain, mostly from the Canary Islands, in the 18th century.
