5|$|In February 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that Williams had written material with Soul Mekanik, Chambers and Ronson. The singer's spokesman, Tim <b>Clark,</b> <b>said</b> {{that the artist}} was planning to begin recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. The album was mostly written in Williams' home studio and was recorded in London. Amongst those who collaborated in the songwriting were Danny Spencer and Kelvin Andrews, Brandon Christy, Craig Russo, Richard Scott and Scott Ralph, Chas Jankel and Fil Eisler.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, 13-year-old Sanford Clark {{was taken}} {{from his home in}} Saskatchewan (with the {{permission}} of his mother and reluctant father) by his uncle, 19-year-old Gordon Stewart Northcott. Northcott took Clark to a ranch in Wineville, California, where he regularly beat and sexually abused the boy — until , when the police took Clark into custody after his sister, 19-year-old Jessie Clark, informed them of the situation. Clark revealed that he was forced to help Northcott and his mother, Sarah Louise Northcott, in killing three young boys after Northcott had kidnapped and molested them. The police found no bodies at the ranch — <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> they were dumped in the desert — but discovered body parts, blood-stained axes, and personal effects belonging to missing children. The Northcotts fled to Canada, but were arrested and extradited to the United States. Sarah Louise initially confessed to murdering Walter Collins, she later retracted her statement; Gordon, who had confessed to killing five boys, did likewise.|$|E
5|$|The BSAC {{established}} two forts to the north-west of Algoa in 1900, then a boma at Feira in 1902, bringing Mashukulumbwe under Company control. Harrison <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> {{that his}} concessions gave him {{authority over the}} area and demanded that the Company pay him for them. The BSAC said Clark's documents were illegal and refused to deal with him. It offered him compensation, the form of which differs by source; Brelsford {{and a man who}} knew Clark personally during the 1920s, Colonel NO Earl Spurr, say that he was given farms as compensation, while a 1920s business acquaintance, AM Bentley, writes that the Company promised grants of land and the right to reserve some mining claims. Clark reluctantly accepted the compensation when he realised that to challenge the BSAC he would have to travel a great distance, possibly to England, and invest heavily in a court case he would probably lose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clark</b> has <b>said</b> New Zealand will ease {{sanctions}} in Fiji once {{progress towards democracy}} becomes apparent. ("We {{need to see a}} roadmap. We need to see benchmarks met.") Bainimarama has argued that such progress is already apparent. ("What else do they want? People come up and tell me you have to show us concrete steps - what further steps?") <b>Clark</b> has <b>said</b> New Zealand will help fund Fiji's election, when it takes place.|$|R
50|$|Sheriff's {{spokesman}} Shannon <b>Clark</b> later <b>said</b> {{the documents}} wouldn't matter because Bates, a major donor to Sheriff Glanz's re-election, was granted special exceptions.|$|R

25|$|On 26 May, New Zealand {{deployed}} 42 troops, with {{a second}} contingent of 120 troops leaving Christchurch on 27 May, en route to Townsville, Queensland before being sent to East Timor. Prime Minister <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> that the forces would be deployed where needed by the Australian command.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue that}} {{received}} attention during Clark's candidacy was {{allegations of sexual}} exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers. This gross problem was brought to light after Anders Kompass exposed the sexual assault of children by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic. During the United Nations Secretary General Candidate informal dialogues, <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> that the UN needed to deal quickly with sexual exploitation and abuse, and gender-based violence by peacekeepers.|$|E
50|$|In July 2017, Business Secretary Greg <b>Clark</b> has <b>said</b> he {{will bring}} {{proceedings}} against the former directors of Kids Company {{and have them}} banned from company directorships.|$|R
5000|$|Vocalist Ryan <b>Clark</b> has <b>said</b> {{the song}} is about the {{scrutiny}} the band faces, and how they aren't [...] "holy enough" [...] for some people, {{no matter how much}} they express their beliefs.|$|R
50|$|Opened in 2005, it was {{the first}} purpose built junior high in New Zealand. The school was opened by the then Prime Minister Helen <b>Clark</b> who <b>said</b> that the school was a model for future middle level {{schooling}} in the country.|$|R

500|$|Army {{regulations}} set {{a so-called}} [...] "ticking clock" [...] upon promotion to a three-star general, essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post {{within two years}} from his initial promotion or retire. This deadline ended in 1996 and <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> he was not optimistic about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General Dennis Reimer {{did not want to}} recommend him for promotion although [...] "no specific reason was given". According to Clark's book, General Robert Scales said that it was likely Clark's reputation of intelligence was responsible for feelings of resentment from other generals. Clark was named to the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) post despite these rumors. Congress approved his promotion to full general in June 1996, and General John M. Shalikashvili signed the order. <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> he was not the original nominee, but the first officer chosen [...] "hadn't been accepted for some reason." ...|$|E
500|$|Clark {{met with}} a group of wealthy New York Democrats {{including}} Alan Patricof to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of Al Gore in 2000, {{met with a}}ll the Democratic candidates but supported Clark in 2004. <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> that he voted for Al Gore and Ronald Reagan, held equal esteem for Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman, and was a registered independent voter throughout his military career. Clark stated that he decided he was a Democrat because [...] "I was pro-affirmative action, I was pro-choice, I was pro-education... I'm pro-health care... I realized I was either going to be the loneliest Republican in America or I {{was going to be a}} happy Democrat." [...] <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> he liked the Democratic party, which he saw as standing for [...] "internationalism", [...] "ordinary men and women", and [...] "fair play." ...|$|E
5000|$|Congressional {{leaders and}} {{administration}} officials {{point to an}} 1892 Supreme Court case, Field v. <b>Clark</b> (...) , which <b>said</b> the dispute - over differing versions of a bill that were certified by both chambers - was not a matter for the courts to decide.|$|R
5000|$|She termed ACG [...] "difficult" [...] and {{requiring}} frequent discipline, {{unaware of the}} medical-examination findings. In a June 23 article by Portage Daily Register writer Matthew Call, she again denied any role in the murder. As for her relationship with Sisk, Call wrote:Clark said she met Sisk {{at a high school}} in Hopkins County, Ky. They moved to Florida because [...] "that was my dream place to always live," [...] she <b>said.</b> <b>Clark</b> also <b>said</b> she met Clerc in a chat room and at one point considered buying a Sanford, Fla. house in which Clerc and Garlin lived.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Clark</b> is <b>said</b> to have replied, [...] "How {{would the}} {{likeness}} of Clark do?" [...] "Excellent," [...] said Spinner, thinking that reference was made to Freeman Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency. The matter escaped further notice until the notes had been printed in enormous quantities.|$|R
500|$|Cherepanov was an {{offensive}} forward. [...] His agent, Jay Grossman, said [...] "He was an exceptionally talented kid." [...] The NHL Central Scouting Bureau identified his offensive skills {{as the biggest}} strength of his game, and felt he needed {{to work on his}} physical play and consistency. Rangers head scout Gordie <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> Cherepanov had a special talent for scoring goals.|$|E
500|$|Returning to New York {{the next}} day, Kennedy exclaimed {{to the wife}} {{of one of his}} aides, [...] "You don't know what I saw! I have done nothing in my life! Everything I have done was a waste! Everything I have done was worthless!" [...] When asked about the Poverty Subcommittee's findings, <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> that more {{resources}} needed to be allocated to the War on Poverty. He also said that the United States needed a [...] "reawakening of a conscience." [...] The entire subcommittee sent a letter to President Lyndon B. Johnson about their discoveries, writing about [...] "conditions of malnutrition and widespread hunger...that {{can only be described as}} shocking." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> {{the freedom}} of working without a label [...] "lent a sense of {{relaxation}} to the [...] process and a stress-free environment." [...] Not wishing to write the same album twice, Clark explained that the band [...] "wanted [...] to feel 'groovy'", so he spent more time composing the songs. The album's sound {{has been described as}} pop by professional reviewers. According to Clark, [...] "Find You There" [...] is about [...] "find that one special person/or thing that gives [...] their life purpose." [...] "Art of War" [...] was written for inclusion on [...] (2012), but was left off. [...] "Just Keep Breathing" [...] is about being bullied as child for having red hair.|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark {{urged the}} United Nations to bring its full weight {{to bear on}} North Korea after it {{announced}} it had conducted the underground nuclear test.

5000|$|<b>Clark</b> (1838) <b>said</b> that a British officer, who resided {{many years}} at Sierra Leone, saw many fights between lions and tigers, {{and that the}} tiger 'universally' won. As a West African nation, Sierra Leone would have had lions (Panthera leo senegalensis or Panthera leo leo), but not tigers.|$|R

500|$|... "I {{knew it was}} bad, but didn't {{know just}} how bad until I {{received}} their full report by email Monday morning," [...] <b>Clark</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Once I saw their weight-load calculations, I {{knew we had to}} shut it down right away. We couldn't wait until May 29." [...] The thirteen toll booth employees were laid off. As of the closure there are $49,015 in toll tickets that have not been used. Refunds were [...] given for thirty days from the closure. The closure of the New Harmony Bridge as reported in the Evansville Courier would {{have a significant impact on}} farmers in the area and the oil industry. The bridge's closure increases the distance between New Harmony and Crossville, Illinois by about ten miles.|$|E
500|$|On December 6, 2004, it was {{reported}} that Clark had been hospitalized after suffering from a minor stroke. Despite Clark indicating his participation in New Year's Rockin' Eve 2005 in a prepared statement, reports soon surfaced that the stroke may have been serious enough to prevent him from hosting at all. It was officially announced on December 14 that Dick Clark would not be hosting, and that Regis Philbin would fill in for Clark. In a statement, <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> that he was thankful that Philbin was able to quickly step in on short notice to host the show, and hoped that he would do a good job. Philbin was optimistic about his role, considering it the [...] "best temp job ever." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} The Unauthorized Trek: The Complete Next Generation, James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{described}} {{the scene where}} Picard was stabbed through the chest as [...] "particularly violent", and overall said that [...] "Tapestry" [...] was a good story. They also described the view of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry towards religion, saying that in his world the Q Continuum aren't gods but are instead an [...] "evolutionary niche higher than mere mortals". Mark Clark, in his book Star Trek FAQ 2.0, called Stewart's performance [...] "richly nuanced" [...] and [...] "soul searching". <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> that this episode was as important to Picard as the events in [...] "", [...] "" [...] and [...] "". He said that the events of [...] "Tapestry" [...] explored Picard's soul.|$|E

50|$|One of Clark's {{most popular}} novels, Vampyrrhic, has been {{followed}} by several sequels. <b>Clark</b> has <b>said</b> {{that he is not}} a fan of vampire novels. In the 1990s it was his view that vampires were becoming romantic, attractive figures. His intention in writing the book was to make the vampire loathsome, repellent, and ultra-violent again.|$|R
60|$|Henery Walker went off, and as 'e {{passed the}} cottage where old Clark used to live, and which George Barstow 'ad moved into, 'e {{spoke to the}} old man over the palings and told 'im wot Joe <b>Clark</b> 'ad <b>said.</b> George Barstow only grunted and went on stooping and prying over 'is front garden.|$|R
500|$|He did not leave, and in February, Clark {{publicly}} criticised him {{for producing}} [...] "possibly the worst training session {{in terms of}} a professional footballer I have ever come across", despite knowing he was due to start the upcoming game against Watford. Up until this incident, he had scored six league goals at a rate of one every 165 minutes, and been sent off twice. <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> that Žigić would not be involved against Watford, but that it was [...] "in his hands" [...] as to whether he would prepare properly for the Sheffield Wednesday fixture three days later. His response must have been acceptable, because he played the whole of the goalless draw against Wednesday, started all the remaining matches– the longest run of starts of his Birmingham career– and ended the season with nine league goals, second only to King.|$|E
500|$|Griswold's {{anthology}} The Poets and Poetry of America was {{the most}} comprehensive of its kind to date. As critic Lewis Gaylord <b>Clark</b> <b>said,</b> it was expected Griswold's book would [...] "become incorporated into the permanent undying literature of our age and nation". The anthology helped Griswold build up a considerable reputation throughout the 1840s and 1850s and its first edition went through three printings in only six months. His choice of authors, however, was occasionally questioned. [...] A British editor reviewed the collection and concluded, [...] "with two or three exceptions, {{there is not a}} poet of mark in the whole Union" [...] and referred to the anthology as [...] "the most conspicuous act of martyrdom yet committed {{in the service of the}} transatlantic muses". Even so, the book was popular and was even continued in several editions after Griswold's death by Richard Henry Stoddard.|$|E
500|$|On {{the issue}} of whether {{competitive}} curlers would be offended by the episode, LaZebnik said [...] "When you hear The Simpsons is going to do their take on your sport, you naturally get a little alarmed, But we ended up being respectful I would say, even, surprisingly respectful. Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin <b>Clark</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E
