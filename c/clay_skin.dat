40|$|The {{northern}} piedmont of the Madrid's basin {{was formed}} during the Upper Aragonian and it constitutes a substrate of arkosic nature which currently {{is going through}} a dissection process. In the area of Madrid it persist remainings of altipain which is interpreted as morphologic references near the culmination of its sedimentary fill-up. The soils which appear over these surfaces are not comparable which those developed over other peninsular piedmonts. Although these soils are supposed to have a high leve 1 of evolution, {{as a consequence of the}} antiquity of the surfaces, present a high dependence from the lithologic nature of the geological substrate independently if it is Tertiary or Quaternary. In this manner present a texture generally sandy and their more common characteristic, the occurrence of textura 1 contrasts between horizons, is a direct consequence of the original stratigrafical arrangement of the sediment. The repetition in depth of the illuvial horizons is due to the existence of deposition sequences of the geological material. The gain in clay which forms the thick and dense <b>clay</b> <b>skin</b> in these horizons, as well as their mineralogical homogeneity, imply a certain previous soil genesis, to that other developed over the high piedmont surfaces. The order of al 1 these soils is Haploxeralf (Soil Taxonomy) or Luvisol (FAO). The fact that these soils are not considered &# 194;&# 171;palexeralf&# 194;&# 187; only responds to the rigidity of the normative imposed by the classification, which specify a minimum thickness for the argillic horizon. The truth is that these soils are complex andlor polycyclic worked out over paleosoils intrasedimentary of Neogene age. El piedemonte septentrional de la Cuenca de Madrid se ha construido durante el Aragoniense superior y constituye un sustrato de naturaleza arc&# 243;sica que se encuentra actualmente en proceso de disecci&# 243;n.

Los suelos que aparecen sobre esas superficies no son comparables con los que se desarrollan sobre el techo de otros piedemontes peninsulares.

Particular attention is given to how the particle size, sorting, colour, shape {{and the presence of}} iron oxide coatings and <b>clay</b> <b>skins</b> affect the rate of dust production. Natural dune sand samples were obtained from the crests of active continental dunes from the Simpson Desert and the Channel Country and abraded for 72 hours using a large glass 'test-tube' chamber. The chipping, spalling and breakage of sand grains and the removal of iron oxide coatings and <b>clay</b> <b>skins</b> from grain surfaces produced between 0. 41 - 0. 98 % fine particles. Statistical analysis identified that the degree of sorting and grain roundness of a sand sample are the major influences on the dust production rate. Well-sorted, sub-rounded sand samples yielded less dust than poorly sorted angular sand grains. Comparison with previous studies of aeolian abrasion of crushed quartz sands, these natural dune sands produced very low quantities of fine material, but the widespread geographical distribution of desert dune fields makes them potentially a significant source of dust-sized particles on a global scale...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{subsurface}} diagnostic horizons {{are used}} to characterize different soils in soil taxonomy. Each diagnostic horizon provides a characteristic that helps place a soil in its proper class in the system. A soil {{may or may not}} have a subsurface diagnostic horizon. There are approximately 20 subsurface diagnostic horizons, of which include the argillic horizon, natric horizon, kandic horizon, oxic horizon, spodic horizon, and albic horizon. The argillic horizon (designated as Bt) is characterized by a thick accumulation of silicate clays that have moved downward from the upper horizons or have formed in place. The argillic horizon often contains clays with shiny coatings termed [...] "argillans" [...] or [...] "clay skins", and accompanied by less than 15% exchangeable sodium on the colloidal complex. The natric horizon (designated as Btn) similarly has silicate clay accumulation with <b>clay</b> <b>skins,</b> but the <b>clays</b> are accompanied by more than 15% exchangeable sodium on the colloidal complex and by columnar or prismatic soil structural units. The natric horizon is most commonly found in arid and semiarid regions. The kandic horizon (designated as Bt, Bts), sometimes referred to as [...] "old" [...] clays, has an accumulation of Fe and Al oxides as well as low-activity silicate clays (e.g., kaolinite), but <b>clay</b> <b>skins</b> need not be evident. The clays are low in activity as shown by their low cation-holding capacities. The oxic horizon (designated as Bo) is a very weathered horizon with a high content of Fe/Al oxides and low-activity silicate clays. It is generally physically stable, crumbly, and not very sticky, despite its high clay content. It is found most commonly in humid tropical and subtropical regions. The spodic horizon (designated as Bh, Bhs) is an illuvial and dark-colored horizon that is characterized by the accumulation of colloidal organic matter and aluminium oxide with or without iron oxide. It is commonly found in highly leached forest soils of cool humid climates, typically on sandy-textured parent materials. The albic horizon (designated as E) is an eluvial and light-colored horizon that is characterized by a low content of clay and Fe/Al oxides.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 Mineralogical {{analysis}} of 3 upland soil profiles over Tyee parent {{rock from the}} Alsea Basin Area, Oregon showed clear differences among the 4 soil series represented. Soils from the area of higher precipitation (over 80 inches, approximately) had no montmorillonite, lower base saturation and cation exchange capacity, but no lower or only slightly lower amounts of weatherable minerals than soils from the area of lower precipitation. Only the profiles in the lower precipitation area had significant ped coatings of oriented clay. Shallow, yellowish soils, in both precipitation zones were much fresher mineralogically than the corresponding deep, red soils. The most strongly weathered profiles had contents of weatherable minerals too high for Latosols or Oxisols. The change with depth in the red soils suggested that these soils had not formed entirely from rock in place. Fragments of <b>clay</b> <b>skins</b> in the red soils suggested that these soils had developed, with mixing, from older soils. Pyroclastic materials and local mixing are believed responsible for the higher contents of weatherable minerals in the surface horizons of the profiles.

40|$|The chemical, {{morphological}} and mineralogical {{properties of}} two Enon sandy loam (fine, mixed, thermic Ultic Hapludalfs) soilsaprolite profiles, one formed on gabbro {{and the other}} on metagabbro, are compared. <b>Clay</b> <b>skins</b> are scarce and stress cutans common in the argillic horizons of these soils. Iron-manganese concretions are concentrated in soil horizons immediately above the argillic horizons. The high shrink-swell capacities and slow permeabilities of the argillic horizons result in relatively shallow depths to paralithic contact with saprolite. The parent rock from the Enon profile near Albemarle, Stanly County, North Carolina is a medium-grained metagabbro with chlorite, hornblende, quartz, and calcic plagioclase feldspar as the dominant primary minerals. Chlorite weathers to regularly interstratified chlorite-vermiculite, which alters to randomly interstratified chlorite-vermiculite and smectite. Particle size decreases with each mineral alteration. Hornblende weathers to smectite and goethite. Calcic plagioclase feldspar transforms to kaolinite in the saprolite and soil horizons. Quartz is relatively resistant to chemical weathering. The parent rock of the Enon profile near Concord, Cabarrus County, North Carolina is a coarse-grained gabbro with hornblende and calcic plagioclase feldspar as the dominant primary minerals.

40|$|ABSTRACTKnowledge of soil {{characteristics}} {{in areas where}} activities related to the environment are developed, such as Porto Alegre Botanical Garden (JB-PoA), is a fundamental condition for the sustainable use of this natural resource. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize, classify and evaluate some issues about soil formation in Porto Alegre Botanical Garden, as well as relate their distribution on the landscape according to environmental characteristics. For the morphological description and collecting samples four profiles were selected (P 1 to P 4), located in the summit-shoulder transition, backslope, footslope and toeslope, respectively. Granulometric distribution of the P 1 and P 3 profiles indicated sharp textural gradient, with presence of textural and "plânico" B horizons, respectively, according to Brazilian System of Soil Classification. There is predominance of low values of pH, and low base saturation, with exception of P 4, indicating probable deposition of solution material at this area. The Fed/Fes relationship was greater in the profile located in the summit-shoulder transition (P 1), indicating higher weathering. The Feo/Fed relationship increased in P 3 and P 4 profiles, indicating greater participation of iron oxides of low crystallinity in reducing environment. The occurrence of some pedogenic processes may be inferred, like lessivage in P 1 (Ultic Hapludalf), due to <b>clay</b> <b>skins</b> and higher values of fine clay:total clay relationship in subsurface; ferrolysis and gleization, by low pH value and high Feo/Fed relationship in E and EB horizons of P 3 (Oxyaquic Hapludalf), being the last also present in P 4 (Humaqueptic Endoaquent), indicating gleization occurrence...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Different parent {{materials}} {{participate in}} the formation of soils in the hilly landscape of “Mar de Morros” in the Atlantic Forest environment. Those derived from mafic igneous rock (gabbro) frequently show erosion problems because of land use, which is aggravated by the mountainous relief and soil attributes. This study evaluated the main pedogenic processes of soils formed from mafic igneous rock (gabbro) in a toposequence in Pinheiral (RJ) by characterizing physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological attributes. The profiles are located at different sections in the toposequence: summit (P 1), shoulder (P 2), backslope (P 3) and footslope (P 4). They were classified according to the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (SiBCS) and correlated to Soil Taxonomy. The soil morphology of profiles P 2, P 3 and P 4 is expressed by a brownish-red color, blocky structure with high to moderate development, clay films and clay loam to clay texture, with a textural B horizon. P 1 shows less development, with a shallow profile and the sequence of horizons A-C-Cr. The soils have a slightly low degree of weathering, identified by the presence of pyroxenes and feldspars in the sand fraction and montorillonite in the clay fraction; the sum of bases is from 15 to 24 cmolc kg- 1; and cation exchange capacity (CEC) is from 12 to 22 cmolc kg- 1. A significant presence of <b>clay</b> <b>skins</b> was observed in the field and was confirmed by thin section analysis, which showed features such as argillans, ferriargillans and iron nodules. The soil profile at the summit (P 1) was classified as Neossolo Regolítico Órtico (Typic Udorthents), and the other profiles as Chernossolo Argilúvicos Órticos (Typic Argiudolls) ...|$|R
