5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a <b>crawlspace</b> near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E
25|$|The Radza family {{sought refuge}} with a Polish Catholic family, Stephania and Jozef Macugowski. Jozef {{was an old}} friend of Louis Radza's, and had {{previously}} offered assistance if the family ever required it. To hide the Radza family, the Macugowskis dug a secret trench beneath the floorboards of their home. The <b>crawlspace</b> was no more than 5 feet wide, 7 feet long, and 20 inches deep. The family would spend the next {{two and a half years}} hidden within, their presence a secret not only from the outside world, but from the Macugowskis' children and elderly parents as well.|$|E

[...] On December 23 the Aspen trial judge granted the request—but to Colorado Springs, where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects. On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on furlough with their families, Bundy piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body, and climbed into the <b>crawlspace.</b> He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer—who was out for the evening with his wife—changed into street clothes from the jailer's closet, and walked out the front door to freedom.|$|E

500|$|In 1838 Coffin built a two-story, Federal-style brick home as his family's {{residence}} in Newport. Because the Levi Coffin House, its present-day name, {{had so many}} fugitives passing through it, the home {{became known as the}} [...] "Grand Central Station" [...] of the Underground Railroad. The Coffin house had several modifications made to create better hiding places for the runaway slaves. A secret door installed in the maids' quarters on the second floor provided access for fourteen people to hide in a narrow <b>crawlspace</b> between the walls. The hiding space could be used when slave hunters came to the Coffin home in search of runaways. Because Coffin demanded to see search warrants and slave-ownership papers before allowing entry to his home, it was never searched and escaping slaves had been transported to other locations by the time the slave hunters returned with the documents.|$|E

It {{was the first time}} they had seen {{daylight}} in two and a half years, and it burned their eyes at first. Their legs were so wobbly that Soviet soldiers believed they were drunk and beat them, thinking they were hiding vodka. Their vocal cords had atrophied because they had not spoken above a whisper during their entire confinement.|$|E
2500|$|Zahava Burack (née Radza, 1936—September 28, 2001) was a Jewish {{woman from}} Poland {{who survived the}} Holocaust in her {{childhood}} by hiding with her family {{for two and a}} half years in a <b>crawlspace</b> beneath the home of a sympathetic Polish Catholic family. After the liberation of occupied Poland in 1945, she was smuggled to Israel, where she lived for twelve years, two of which she spent serving with the Haganah paramilitary organization. In 1958, Burack moved to the United States, where she became a well-known philanthropist, community leader and political activist, who worked with both American and Israeli politicians for Jewish causes.|$|E

50|$|Humidity {{occurs in}} indoor environments due to {{building}} related causes. Porous walls, rising damp, and leaks {{in the building}} are determinants for structural dampness due to elevated humidity levels. The construction of the building {{can also lead to}} humidity and unwanted moisture in the indoor environment. Wet materials, such as lumber stored unprotected outdoors before construction, can lead to increased humidity indoors for up to the second year of occupancy in the building. Most commonly in residences, elevated relative humidity is produced by poor drainage systems. This leads to dampness in substructures such as <b>crawlspaces</b> and basements. The dampness results in vaporization where water vapor is transmitted into the building's interiors. Water vapor may enter the building through supply air ducts in building slabs and circulated by warm forced air. Water vapor can also enter a building through leaky return air ducts in homes with <b>crawlspaces.</b>|$|R

40|$|Ventilated {{spaces in}} the built {{environment}} create unique and beneficial microclimates. While the current trends in building physics suggest sealing attics and <b>crawlspaces,</b> comprehensive research still supports {{the benefits of the}} ventilated microclimate. Data collected at the University of Florida Energy Park show the attic environment of asphalt shingled roofs to be typically hotter than the outdoor conditions, but when properly ventilated sustains a much lower relative humidity. The hot, humid regions of the United States can utilize this internally convective, exchanging air mass to provide stable moisture levels within attic spaces. Positioning the buildings primary boundary at the ceiling deck allows for utilization of this buffer climate to minimize moisture trapping in insulation and maximize the insulation?s thermal benefits. This investigation concludes the conditions in a ventilated attic are stable through seasonal changes and promotes cost effective, energy efficient climate control of unconditioned spaces in hot, humid regions.
