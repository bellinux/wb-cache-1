Petrological and geochemical data indicate that dolomite cement (DC 1) filling intergranular porosity in grain-dominated facies constituted the initial stage ofdolomitization. The bulk of the dolostone is formed by a replacive nonplanar-a to planar-s dolomite (RD 1) <b>crystal</b> <b>mosaic</b> with very low porosity and characteristic retentive fabric. Neomorphic recrystallization of RD 1 to form replacive dolomite RD 2 occurred by successive dolomitizing fluid flow.

Clear dolomite overgrowths (overdolomitization) precipitated during the last stage of replacement. Strontium isotopic composition suggests that the most likely origin of magnesium was Cretaceous seawater-derived brines that were heated and enriched in radiogenic strontium and iron while circulating through the Paleozoic basement and/or Permo-Triassic red beds. Burial curves and analytical data indicate that the replacement took place at burial depths between 500 and 750 m, and by hydrothermal fluids exceeding temperatures of 80 °C. Following the partial dolomitization of the host rock, porosity considerably increased in dolostones by burial corrosion related to the circulation of acidic fluids derived from the emplacement of the Mississippi Valley-Type deposits. Overpressured acidic fluids circulated along faults, fractures and open stylolites. Saddle dolomite and ore-stage calcite cement filled most of the newly created vuggy porosity. Subsequent to MVT mineralization, precipitation of calcite cements resulted from the migration of meteoric-derived fluids during uplift and subaerial exposure. This late calcite cement destroyed most of the dolostone porosity and constitutes the main cause for its present day poor reservoir quality...|$|E

40|$|The Iowa Pore Index test is {{a method}} {{employed}} by several Midwestern State Departments of Transportation to determine the volume ratio of macropores-to-micropores in a rock aggregate by means of water intrusion. This method, when combined with x-ray diffraction (to measure the dolomite mineral structure using the peak shift) and x-ray fluorescence (to measure the calcite-to-dolomite ratio and the clay content using alumina), {{has been shown to}} be effective in predicting the performance of aggregates in Portland cement concrete. In this test, 4. 5 kilograms of oven-dried crushed carbonate is intruded with water progressively at 240 kilopascals. Readings of intruded volume are taken at 1 and 14 minutes corresponding to macropore and micropore volumes, respectively. The Iowa Pore Index test is interesting more broadly because it is fast, non-destructive, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly, hence it has the potential to replace mercury porosimetry and be integrated in any petrophysical lab. This research aims to understand the geological factors (depositional environment; facies; grain and pore types; texture; and paragenesis) responsible for the results of the Iowa Pore Index test. End-member samples of various geologic ages are collected around Iowa to represent different combinations of accepted and rejected porosity and clay contents. The pore index of each sample is calibrated quantitatively via helium and mercury porosimetry and qualitatively via thin section petrography. Findings of this research show that even the most homogeneous sources have at least three different rock types, or groups of pebbles characterized by distinctive physical and textural attributes observable at hand-specimen scale. Petrographic analysis shows that limestones with a sparite matrix, peloidal grains, and low matrix-to-allochem ratio (i. e., grainy) are better for road constructions than limestones with a micrite matrix, skeletal grains, and high matrix-to-allochem ratio (i. e., muddy).

This crystal geometry preferentially reflects those X-rays that satisfy the Bragg condition and whose electric vectors are perpendicular to the plane defined by the incident and reflected photons.

The energy bandwidth of nearly perfect crystals is extremely small, which makes them very inefficient X-ray polarimeters. This limitation is particularly acute for observations of the relatively weak X-ray continuum of stellar sources.

An assembling of properly oriented crystals can form a lens able to focus x-rays at high energy via Laue diffraction in transmission geometry; this is a Laue lens. The x-ray diffraction theory provides that the maximum diffraction efficiency is achieved in ideal <b>mosaic</b> <b>crystals,</b> but real <b>mosaic</b> <b>crystals</b> show diffraction efficiencies several times lower than the ideal case due to technological problems. An alternative and convenient approach is the use of curved crystals.
