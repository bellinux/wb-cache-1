40|$|In this paper, a new {{analytic}} method with a convergence-control parameter $c$ {{is first}} proposed.

The effectiveness and applicability of the new technique are demonstrated by several physical models including nonlinear heat transfer problems, nano-electromechanical systems, diffusion and dissipation phenomena, and dispersive waves. Moreover, the ideas proposed in this paper may offer us possibilities to greatly improve current analytic and numerical techniques. Comment: 15 page, 7 figure...|$|R
