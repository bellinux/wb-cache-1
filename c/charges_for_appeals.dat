50|$|Each {{petition}} <b>for</b> <b>appeal</b> in {{a criminal}} case is referred to a judge of the Court for review to determine if an appeal should be awarded. The judge may grant the petition <b>for</b> <b>appeal</b> in whole or part. An appellant may request a panel of three judges of the Court of Appeals to review a petition <b>for</b> <b>appeal</b> that was denied, either in whole, or part, by the judge who initially reviewed the petition. As long as oral argument was preserved in the petition <b>for</b> <b>appeal</b> and a reply brief was not filed, the appellant may present oral argument on the petition <b>for</b> <b>appeal</b> before a panel of three judges. Any one of the three judges may grant the petition {{on the basis of the}} record without oral argument. If the petition is granted, briefs are filed by both parties. The clerk of the Court of Appeals refers each granted appeal to a panel of the Court. Oral argument is permitted and may be waived.|$|R
50|$|The {{competence}} of the Great Council strongly fluctuated from period to period and from province to province. In the small lordship of Mechelen, it controlled practically all legislative and executive power. It {{was also the}} court, <b>for</b> both initial <b>charges</b> and <b>appeals</b> <b>for</b> persons and institutions that fell under royal protection. Members of the court, knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece, and everyone who was privileged through title or function could only be judged before the Great Council. For the rest the Council functioned as a court of appeal and a court of cassation over all sentences made by provincial justice councils and other, lower, courts in the Seventeen Provinces (or what remained of it later on). The Great Council also treated issues of privileges, mandates, letters of commendation, letters of marque, donations of functions and goods, gifts and other taxes, confiscation of property, jurisdiction conflicts between separate government institutions, and also border conflicts.Appeals against judicial rulings were also handled, but generally only against serious cases. On the other hand, family rights and inheritance usually fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the church courts.|$|R
