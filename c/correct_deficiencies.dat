25|$|Education in BME also varies greatly {{around the}} world. By {{virtue of its}} {{extensive}} biotechnology sector, its numerous major universities, and relatively few internal barriers, the U.S. has progressed {{a great deal in}} its development of BME education and training opportunities. Europe, which also has a large biotechnology sector and an impressive education system, has encountered trouble in creating uniform standards as the European community attempts to supplant some of the national jurisdictional barriers that still exist. Recently, initiatives such as BIOMEDEA have sprung up to develop BME-related education and professional standards. Other countries, such as Australia, are recognizing and moving to <b>correct</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in their BME education. Also, as high technology endeavors are usually marks of developed nations, some areas of the world are prone to slower development in education, including in BME.|$|E
25|$|Lanyon and Dargan were keen to {{retrieve}} their reputations {{and there was}} a period of furious activity as they worked to <b>correct</b> <b>deficiencies</b> identified in the Board of Trade report. The directors carried out their own inspection of the line on 6 April and felt sufficiently confident about what they had seen to ask Captain Laffan to make a second inspection. This he did and his report of 8 April was more encouraging than the previous one. Although there were some strictures, Captain Henry Drury Harness RE, secretary to the Railway Department of the Board of Trade formally advised the directors of the B on 14 April that the railway could be opened for public service. However, authorisation had been sent previously by telegraph and the railway was already at work.|$|E
500|$|During the 1950s the Spanish Army was {{supplied}} by the United States with 552 M47 and M48 Patton tanks as a mutual defense pact against a potential Soviet invasion of Western Europe. [...] The first tanks were delivered in 1954, and the fleet was upgraded in the 1970s to equal the capabilities of M60 Patton tanks. [...] Spain was, however, interested in replacing these tanks {{as early as the}} 1960s with the French AMX-30 or German [...] [...] Spain eventually decided to buy the French tank and by 1975 the Spanish Army had 299 AMX-30s, designated as AMX-30Es. Of these, 280 tanks were manufactured by the local company Empresa Nacional Santa Bárbara (now Santa Bárbara Sistemas) who received the AMX-30 patent from the French company GIAT. [...] As the first batch of production of AMX-30s ended, the French Army and Santa Bárbara began a research programme for an eventual modernisation of the AMX-30 to <b>correct</b> <b>deficiencies</b> such as mechanical reliability, armor protection and the fire control system. [...] In fielding the AMX-30E, the army found its upgraded M47s and M48s to be outdated; its earliest M47 tank was more than 30years old. [...] The army required a modern tank that could complement its AMX-30Es and started looking for a replacement for its Patton fleet.|$|E
