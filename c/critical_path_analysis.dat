Project {{planning}} and scheduling plays a central role in predicting both the time and cost aspects of a project. This study is aimed at finding trade-off between the cost and minimum expected time that will be required to complete the building project. The data on the cost and duration of activities involved were obtained Angel Estates and Construction Ltd. a construction company based in Ashanti region Ghana. Both <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> method CPM and project evaluation and review technique PERT were used for the analysis. The activities underwent crashing of both the time and cost using linear programming this paved way for the determination of <b>critical</b> <b>path.</b> Further <b>analysis</b> revealed that the shortest possible time for the completion of the analyzed building project is 40 days instead of the expected duration of 79 days. This means that through proper scheduling of activities the expected completion time was reduced by 39 days. The additional cost associated with the reduction in timing is GH 1887. 22 which increases the initial expected cost required to complete the project from GH 57156. 35 to GH 59043. 57...|$|R

40|$|The {{assembly}} protocols for a semiconductor {{capital equipment}} machine were analyzed for potential lead time reduction. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the minimum assembly lead time for the machine based on the constraints of design, space, and labor availability. An assembly requires the completion of a set of procedures that each contains assembly tasks. Precedence relationships between tasks indicate for each procedure what other tasks must be completed before it can start. Each procedure was assumed to have constant resource requirements throughout its duration. The <b>Critical</b> <b>Path</b> Method (CPM) was used to identify 13 procedures on the <b>critical</b> <b>path,</b> based on design and space constraints. A preliminary build schedule was developed that prioritized <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> procedures. A trial of this build schedule achieved an assembly lead time of 39 hours, resulting in a 70 % reduction from the current average of 5. 5 days. This trial was also accomplished with 76 % of the average labor hours for assembly. A production build schedule with a lead time of 43 hours was developed based on the trial results. This schedule allows for production rates of up to 5 machines per week to be achieved with the current shift structure of the company, without the incurrence of overtime. A <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> drag <b>analysis</b> identified <b>critical</b> procedures with the highest potential for lead time reduction.

40|$|Floats and <b>critical</b> <b>path(s)</b> are {{important}} issues in construction management practice. In <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> method, activities {{not on the}} <b>critical</b> <b>path(s)</b> must have float. Float measures {{the amount of time}} an activity can be delayed before it becomes critical. Consecutive repetitive activities have production rates, which may vary considerably from one activity to another. This creates a different situation (from traditional non-repetitive activities) such that repetitive activities may have rate float, in addition to time float. In this paper, a proposed model for determining different types of floats for non-serial repetitive activities is developed. The traditional concept of time float is extended to repetitive activities. Rate float, which is an inherent property of repetitive activities, is also determined. Float analysis is performed in a very similar way to <b>Critical</b> <b>Path</b> Method (CPM) <b>analysis,</b> without the need for graphical aids. The analysis is based on a repetitive scheduling method, which utilizes a traditional CPM network of a typical unit, in which overlapping activities are used to model repetitive activities. A constant activity production rate is assumed and resource continuity is maintained. The method for determining time floats (total and free) and the rate float of non-critical activities and of non-controlling segments of controlling activities is described in detail. The proposed model was automated by a macro-program, which has been coded on a commercial scheduling software to facilitate float determination.

40|$|Abstract—Interpolation-based {{algebraic}} soft-decision decoding (ASD) of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes {{can achieve}} significant coding gain with polynomial complexity. Among available ASD algorithms, the low-complexity Chase (LCC) algorithm can achieve a good performance-complexity tradeoff. In addition, {{the multiplicity of}} each interpolation point involved in this algorithm is one. These features make the LCC decoding very attractive for practical hardware implementation. In this paper, we present an efficient and high-speed VLSI architecture {{for the implementation of}} the LCC decoder. ASD algorithms have two major steps: interpolation and factorization. The high efficiency of the LCC interpolation architecture is achieved by employing a backward interpolation technique, which enables the sharing of intermediate interpolation results. We also show that the factorization step can be eliminated in the case of LCC decoding. From <b>critical</b> <b>path</b> and latency <b>analysis,</b> the LCC decoder can achieve a throughput of several gigabits per second in ASIC implementations. In addition, the LCC decoder requires less than three times the area of a hard-decision decoder that has the same throughput. I...|$|R
