40|$|Article 234 of the EC Treaty {{covers a}} reference-based {{preliminary}} ruling procedure which is the principal procedural link between the European Court of Justice and Member States' courts within the <b>Community</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system.</b> Under this provision, the Court has jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on the validity or interpretation of certain Community rules which the referring national court seeks to apply in the main proceedings. However, there are disputes before domestic courts to which national legislations make Community measures more or less applicable, but otherwise falling {{outside the scope of}} Community law (purely internal situations). In these cases the effects of Community law are extended by force of national law beyond the reach envisaged by the Community legislation itself. The wording of Article 234 EC leaves open {{the question of whether or}} not the Court may give preliminary rulings in such disputes on the interpretation of the Community measures that are indirectly applicable only on the basis of non-Community rules. In most of such cases, first in Thomasdünger, the Court has assumed jurisdiction to give a preliminary ruling. 1 The reasons for the Court's position were first set out in some details in the Dzodzi ruling 2 that is why these cases are called the "Dzodzi line of cases". 3 However, it would not be easy to read consistency into the Dzodzi case-law.

I will focus not only on the "fundamental rights" declared and constituted by the Court of Justice as part of the general principles of Community law, but on the language of rights more widely as used throughout the <b>Community</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> by the institutions in the legislative process, and in the application of Community law to the Member States. This will include not just those rights which have been declared by the Court to have fundamental or "constitutional" status, but also those rights which are created, conferred or declared by Community legislative and other measures. Indeed, the legislative rights which are created at Community level generally acquire a form of constitutional status at the national level where they take priority over national law. This also entails consideration of those areas of Community law in which the language of rights has, perhaps surprisingly, not figured very largely or at all. What is particularly of interest is why the language of rights has come to be used so widely within these areas of Community law, and why it continues to be expanded and developed by the judicial and political institutions. Two partial explanations will be suggested, which focus on how that language is perceived as both a legitimating and an integrating force. Finally, I wish to consider what impact that language may have in reality, and whether a more critical or even sceptical approach is called for...|$|E

40|$|Article 10 of the European Community Treaty has {{gradually}} {{given rise to}} a large body of case law {{on a wide variety of}} subjects, including several profoundly important constitutional principles of Community law: the duty of national courts to give effective protection to rights given by Community law, the duty to give direct effect to directives against the State, the duty to interpret national law so as to be compatible with Community law, and the right to judicial review. These principles are the foundation of the constitutional structure that the Court of Justice has built, in which national courts ensure the rule of Community law in most of the circumstances in which it applies. This Article describes the development of the case law of the Court of Justice, divided for convenience, somewhat arbitrarily, into three periods. The periods are 1952 to 1990, 1990 to 2000, and 2000 to date. As will be seen, much of the elaboration of the case law occurred between 1990 and 2000, although several basic principles had been established before that. Before tracing this development, one feature of the <b>Community</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> needs to be explained, since it is fundamental, and very different from other legal systems such as the U. S. legal system. The rules of European Community (“EC”) law, and now of European Union (“EU”) law, are primarily applied and enforced by national courts and authorities, and not by the Community institutions. The national law and Community law spheres are not separate bodies of law applied by separate institutions. There is no line of demarcation between the two. This fact makes Article 10 much more important than it would otherwise be. It also explains why the case law on Article 10 developed gradually, and is still developing...|$|E
40|$|This short chapter revisits {{the cases}} Costa v ENEL and Simmenthal II and {{their effect on}} the {{development}} of the specific nature and the constitutional order of the EU. Costa v ENEL and Simmenthal II are cases well known for their impact on defining the legal parameters which govern the legal system of the EU/EC. These cases are true classics in the history of case law of the ECJ and thus have been discussed to great detail in legal writing. I will not attempt within this chapter to do justice to the nuances and the ongoing debates in this literature. Instead, this chapter will focus on a more rarely addressed but nonetheless central aspect of the cases: It will argue that the specific contribution of Costa v ENEL and Simmenthal II to the development and definition of the <b>Community</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> arises from a fruitful and productive tension. This tension results from a dichotomy between, on one hand, a rule of conflicts, and, on the other, the notion of the integration of legal systems. Initially, the principle of supremacy, as outlined in these cases, seems to be establishing a hierarchy of norms between EC and national law. It introduces a conflicts rule giving precedence to Community law over national legal provisions in cases of conflict. The cases however equally establish the notion of integration, which, according to Costa v ENEL and Simmenthal II, is based on the E(E) C Treaty having ‘created its own legal system’ which upon entry into force ‘became an integral part of the legal systems of the Member States’ and is ‘applicable in the territory of each of the Member States. ’ The establishment of the principle of supremacy therefore has not led simply to the superimposition of a new level of public power over that of the Member States. The ECJ’s approach in its case law from Costa v ENEL to Simmenthal II led to a unique system of shared sovereignty, in which hierarchic relations are only elements within a wider structure of jointly exercising public powers. The chapter is committed to exploring this unique method of sharing sovereignty within the tension between conflicts and integration...|$|E
40|$|The root of {{positivism}} is {{the idea}} that a <b>legal</b> <b>system's</b> criteria of <b>legal</b> validity have authoritative status just in virtue of social facts, where "social facts" consist of the behavior, beliefs, dispositions, and attitudes of certain persons in the <b>community</b> whose <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> it is. John Austin's version of positivism treated the seat of command (or legislation) as the scene of the social facts constitutive of law's authority, and habitual obedience as the relevant form of those facts. Modern positivists, following H. L. A. Hart, have instead treated the scene of adjudication as the source, and "following a social rule" as the form of those facts. But there are notorious problems with the conventionalist account of law's authority, central among which is that it makes mysterious the persistence of law's authority in circumstances of serious and pervasive disagreement. Taking up a proposal by Scott Shapiro and Jules Coleman, I propose a way of understanding the social facts constitutive of a community's authoritative criteria of legality in terms of judicial collective action. This model of collective action grounds law's normativity socially, despite judicial disagreement, thus maintaining the insight of positivism...|$|R

In Louisiana, private law was codified into the Louisiana Civil Code. Current Louisiana law has converged considerably with American law, especially in its public law, judicial system, and adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code (except for Article 2) and certain legal devices of American common law. In fact, any innovation, whether private or public, has been decidedly common law in origin.
