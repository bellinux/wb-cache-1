We present a method to {{determine}} the exact radiation rate for a point charge. 1. The <b>Čerenkov</b> <b>effect</b> in the MCS model In recent years the so-called Standard-Model Extension (SME) 1 has provided a convenient framework for studying minute Lorentz and CPT violations that may be low-energy signatures for Planck-scale physics. 2 In this work we will study a subsector of the SME describing pure electrodynamics, where Maxwell theory has been modified with Chern–Simons-like term in the Lagrangian parametrized by dimensionful parameter (kAF) µ: LMCS = − 1 4 FµνF µν + (kAF) µAν ˜ F µν − Aµj µ. (1) The Chern–Simons term explicitly violates Lorentz invariance, as well as PT and CPT invariance. (For an explicit mechanism generating it see Ref. 3.) We have explicitly included a coupling to an external current j µ, which we take to satisfy ∂µj µ = 0. As will become clear below, the inclusion of the (kAF) µ term results in a modification of the photon dispersion relation, with the possibility of phase speeds smaller than the conventional speed of light in vacuum c. If realized in Nature, this opens up the possibility that ordinary charged matter could move with a velocity exceeding the phase velocity of radiation, and thus should emit Čerenkov radiation in vacuum. This effect is well established experimentally and theoretically in conventional macroscopic media. 4 Recently, some unexpected features have been encountered in observations involving lead ions 5 and in exotic condensed-matter systems. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{well-known}} <b>Čerenkov</b> <b>Effect</b> contains new phenomena arising from the quantum nature of charged particles. The Čerenkov transition amplitudes allow coupling between the charged particle and the emitted photon through their orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin, by scattering into preferred angles and polarizations. Importantly, the spectral response reveals a discontinuity immediately below a frequency cutoff that can occur in the optical region. Specifically, with proper shaping of electron beams (ebeams), we predict that the traditional Čerenkov radiation angle splits into two distinctive cones of photonic shockwaves. One of the shockwaves can move along a backward cone, otherwise considered impossible for Čerenkov radiation in ordinary matter. Our findings are observable for ebeams with realistic parameters, offering new applications including novel quantum optics sources, and open a new realm for Čerenkov detectors involving the spin and orbital angular momentum of charged particles.
