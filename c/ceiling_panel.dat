2500|$|In 1991, Bechtel, in a {{joint venture}} with Parsons Brinckerhoff, broke ground on Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project or [...] "Big Dig," [...] a project the company had been in charge of since 1986. The Big Dig was, at the time, the largest and most complex urban {{transportation}} project ever undertaken in the United States. The 20-year project was critiqued for rising costs and an increasing scope of work, as the Big Dig became more complex than was originally estimated. Criticism of the project increased in 2005 when a leak sprang in one of the new tunnels. In the summer of 2006, a faulty tunnel <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel</b> collapsed, killing a motorist. Litigation ensued, and in January 2008, Bechtel settled with federal and state officials for $352 million with other contractors involved paying smaller amounts.|$|E
2500|$|E Ink Corporation of E Ink Holdings Inc. {{released}} the first colored e-ink displays {{to be used}} in a marketed product. The Ectaco Jetbook Color was released in 2012 as the first colored e-ink e-reader, which used E Ink's Triton display technology. E Ink in early 2015 also announced another color e-ink technology called Prism. This new technology is a color changing film {{that can be used for}} e-reader, but Prism is also marketed as a film that can be integrated into architectural design such as [...] "wall, <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel,</b> or entire room instantly." [...] The disadvantages present within these technologies are that they are considerably more expensive than standard E Ink displays. The JetBook Color costs roughly nine times more than other popular e-readers such as the Amazon Kindle. As of January 2015, Prism had not been announced {{to be used in}} the plans for any e-reader devices.|$|E

2500|$|Lammy {{wakes up}} and realises she only has 15 minutes {{to get to her}} concert, she is blocked off by a fire. As the Chief Puddle {{attempts}} to get Lammy to help put out the fire since she's in a hurry, Lammy notices a billboard for a casino. Recalling Chop Chop's words, Lammy pictures her fire hose as a guitar and gains the confidence she usually has whilst playing. After putting out the fire, Lammy is rewarded with some pizza but eats so much that she is mistaken as a pregnant lady by Nurse Cathy Piller. Upon realizing she wasn't actually pregnant, Cathy forces Lammy to help put all the newborns to sleep using a baby as a guitar. As she leaves she slips on a skateboard and is launched in to a plane that was flying through the street. She then helps Captain Fussenpepper fly the plane while he is attacked by a <b>ceiling</b> <b>panel,</b> which makes him switch personalities. She ends up crash landing the plane into the middle of a full parking lot. Accidentally leaving her guitar on the plane upon leaving, Lammy goes to build a new one from scratch with the help from a beaver named Paul Chuck. By pretending her chainsaw is a guitar she is able to turn a tree in to a fully functional and painted guitar. Upon leaving with the new guitar, Lammy either slips on a banana peel and dies, where she's taken to the netherworld (Japan and PAL) or gets her belt snagged on [...] the shop door, propelling her backwards through time and onto a strange island (U.S). After being dragged into performing in a concert for idol Teriyaki Yoko, Lammy manages to earn the right to be brought back to Earth using a fax machine, but not before running into her evil twin Rammy, Yoko's original guitarist. After coming back from the dead, Lammy finally arrives at the concert {{at the same time as}} Katy and Ma-san, who had their own set of circumstances causing them to run late. With the band together, MilkCan go ahead and perform their concert before their adoring fans.|$|E

50|$|The {{science of}} {{limiting}} and/or controlling noise transmission from one building space to another to ensure space functionality and speech privacy. The typical sound paths are ceilings, room partitions, acoustic <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels</b> (such as wood dropped <b>ceiling</b> <b>panels),</b> doors, windows, flanking, ducting and other penetrations. Technical solutions {{depend on the}} source of the noise and the path of acoustic transmission, for example noise by steps or noise by (air, water) flow vibrations. An example would be providing suitable party wall design in an apartment complex to minimize the mutual disturbance due to noise by residents in adjacent apartments.|$|R
