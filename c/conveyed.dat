In time, he ordered {{the creation of the}} Orchestra and Symphony of the General Government in its capital, Kraków.

Visual artists, including painters and sculptors, were compelled to register with the German government; but their work was generally tolerated by the underground, unless it <b>conveyed</b> propagandist themes.

5|$|It <b>conveyed</b> a {{tenth of}} the royal demesne– the lands of the crown as opposed to the {{personal}} property of the sovereign– into the hands of churches, ecclesiastics and laymen. In Anglo-Saxon England property was either folkland or bookland. The transmission of folkland was governed by the customary rights of kinsmen, subject to the king's approval, whereas bookland was established by the grant of a royal charter, and could be disposed of freely by the owner. Booking land thus converted it by charter from folkland to bookland. The royal demesne was the crown's folkland, whereas the king's bookland was his own personal property which he could leave by will as he chose. In the decimation Æthelwulf may have <b>conveyed</b> royal folkland by charter to become bookland, in some cases to laymen who already leased the land.|$|E

40|$|Dense phase {{pneumatic}} <b>conveying</b> {{can be a}} most reliable, efficient {{method for}} handling a remarkably wide range of dry bulk solids. Some advantages {{of this type of}} <b>conveying</b> method include high solids/gas ratio, low <b>conveying</b> velocity, thus low power consumption, low product degradation and low pipe wear. However, {{due to the nature of}} discontinuous flow of dense phase <b>conveying,</b> the modeling and controlling of this type of <b>conveying</b> seems to be very difficult if assuming some type of steady state conditions for prediction. This paper will report the research on the transient behaviour of the slug movements through a horizontal pipeline in slug flow pneumatic <b>conveying.</b> The first step of this research is to obtain the fundamental theory for the pressure differential of the system <b>conveying</b> pressure when there is only one slug traveling in the pipeline. In the theory, both instant slug movements and air conservation law were considered. For the next step, by applying this fundamental pressure differential equation, pressure drop models for multiple slugs <b>conveying</b> conditions were proposed by either assuming uniform slug condition or normal distribution slug condition. Finally, the proposed pressure drop models were verified with experimental data and showed the capability of numerically tracing the transient <b>conveying</b> pressure of the dense phase <b>conveying</b> system, i. e. the pressure-time profile of the simulated <b>conveying</b> case. The pressure drop models and transient simulation software derived from these models can be used for predicting operating parameters and slug behaviour within the horizontal slug flow pneumatic <b>conveying</b> system, and have the potential to significantly increase slug <b>conveying</b> efficiency. They can also be used as a controlling algorithm for the control unit of an industrial <b>conveying</b> system...|$|R
