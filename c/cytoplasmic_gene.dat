40|$|We {{examine the}} {{evolutionary}} dynamics of gametic and genotypic disequilibria between a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> and a nuclear gene under two mating system models relevant to hybrid zones. In the first model, in which female mating preference {{is determined by}} an epistatic interaction between the two loci, permanent nonzero cytonuclear disequilibria are possible {{for a variety of}} initial genotype frequencies, particularly when rates of assortative mating for the two parental species are high. In contrast, when mating preference is effectively determined by interaction between a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> and the multilocus nuclear genotypes characteristic of the parental species, all cytonuclear disequilibria, as well as frequencies of pure parentals, rapidly decay to zero unless assortative mating is nearly perfect.

40|$|Post-transcriptional {{control of}} gene {{expression}} is {{mediated by the}} interaction of RNA-binding proteins with their cognate mRNAs that specifically regulate their stability, localization and translation. mRNA-binding proteins are multifunctional {{and it has been}} proposed therefore that a combinatorial RNA-binding protein code exists that allows specific protein sub-complexes to control <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression under a range of pathophysiological conditions. We show that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is central to one such complex that forms in apoptotic cells. Thus, during apoptosis initiated by TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand there is a change in the repertoire of RNA-binding proteins with which PTB interacts. We show that altering the cellular levels of PTB and its binding partners, either singly or in combination, is sufficient to directly change the rates of apoptosis with increased expression of PTB, YBX 1, PSF and NONO/p 54 (nrb) accelerating this process. Mechanistically, we show that these proteins post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression, and therefore apoptotic rates, by interacting with and stimulating the activity of RNA elements (internal ribosome entry segments) found in mRNAs that are translated during apoptosis. Taken together, our data show that PTB function is controlled by a set of co-recruited proteins and importantly provide further evidence {{that it is possible to}} dictate cell fate by modulating <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression pathways alone.

40|$|A novel <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression}} {{system has been}} developed. This system differs from other {{expression system}}s in that it relies on the co-delivery of plasmid DNA and T 7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) during trans-fection. The plasmid contains a T 7 RNAP gene driven by the T 7 promoter (T 7 autogene) and a functional/ reporter gene driven by another T 7 promoter (T 7 T 7 / T 7 -gene construct). Once this DNA- enzyme complex is introduced into eukaryotic cells, the transcription of the T 7 RNAP and the functional/reporter genes is initiated by the co-delivered T 7 RNAP. The T 7 RNAP, {{which is responsible for}} the initiation and maintenance of expression of both T 7 and functional/reporter genes, is replenished by translation of newly synthesized T 7 mRNA. This T 7 system was designed in such a manner that the expression of the functional/reporter genes can occur in the cytoplasm and does not require any nuclear involvement. When transfected by either a pT 7 T 7 /T 7 Luc or a pT 7 T 7 /T 7 hGH plasmids with the co-introduced T 7 RNAP, mouse L cells were found to express high levels of luciferase immediately after transfection, apparently due to the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression; the expression of human growth hormone (hGH) could be sustained for at least 6 days. Both T 7 and hGH mRNA were expressed by the cells trans-fected with pT 7 T 7 /T 7 hGH.

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 16. 27 and 16. 53 % of the total variation was due to differences among species, with the remaining 56. 35 and 83. 47 % due to differences within species and 27. 39 and 0 % due to differences within individuals in 32 nuclear SSR markers set and 6 chloroplast gene markers set, respectively. The 32 nuclear SSR markers detected three subpopulations among 357 individuals, whereas the 6 chloroplast gene markers revealed three subpopulations among 160 accessions in the STRUCTURE analysis. In the clustering analysis, the three inbred species clustered into a single group, whereas the outbreeding species were clearly divided, especially according to nuclear SSR markers. In addition, almost all Lolium multiflorum populations were clustered into group C 4, which could be further divided into three subgroups, whereas Lolium perenne populations primarily clustered into two groups (C 2 and C 3), with a few lines that instead grouped with L. multiflorum (C 4) or Lolium rigidum (C 6).

40|$|Abstract: The {{regulation}} of gene expression in trypanosomatids is predominantly post-transcriptional. Polycistronic tran-scripts are processed {{by the addition}} of a common 5 ’-spliced leader and polyadenylation. However, the processed mRNAs are not necessarily functionally related, suggesting the existence of mechanisms for the degradation or storage of untrans-latable mRNAs.

This review discusses some of the mechanisms and regulatory elements involved in <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression regulation in Trypanosoma cruzi. We also discuss how functional genomic tools have contributed toward determining the role played by RNA binding protein complexes, supporting the concept of “post-transcriptional RNA operons ” or “RNA regulons”.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{uncovered}} {{an abundance of}} non-neutral cytoplasmic genetic variation within species, which suggests that we should no longer consider the cytoplasm an idle intermediary of evolutionary change. Nonneutrality of cytoplasmic genomes is particularly intriguing, given that these genomes are maternally transmitted. This means that the fate of any given cytoplasmic genetic mutation is directly tied to its performance when expressed in females. For this reason, it has been hypothesized that <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> will coevolve via a sexually antagonistic arms race with the biparentally transmitted nuclear genes with which they interact. We assess this prediction, examining the intergenomic contributions to {{the costs and benefits}} of mating in Callosobruchus maculatus females subjected to a mating treatment with three classes (kept virgin, mated once, or forced to cohabit with a male). We find no evidence that the economics of mating are determined by interactions between <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> expressed in females and nuclear genes expressed in males and, therefore, no support for a sexually antagonistic intergenomic arms race. The cost of mating to females was, however, shaped by an interaction between the <b>cytoplasmic</b> and nuclear <b>genes</b> expressed within females.

40|$|Upon sensing {{misfolded}} outer-membrane porins (OMPs) in the periplasm, the E. coli DegS protease cleaves RseA, a transmembrane regulator, transmitting {{a signal}} to activate <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Misfolding is detected by binding of normally inaccessible OMP sequences to the DegS-PDZ domain, which relieves allosteric inhibition and activates proteolysis.

Based on the effects of mutations in the peptide-binding pocket of the PDZ domain and elsewhere, we suggest an allosteric pathway that links peptide binding to DegS activation. These results explain fast responses to envelope stress; demonstrate that the protein-unfolding response, even under catastrophic conditions, can be tailored by the peptide sequences that become accessible to DegS; and suggest strategies for control of related PDZ proteases by allosteric effectors.

Generation means analysis from both the Gardner and Eberhart, and Mather and Jinks methods, indicated that additive genetic effects were the most important for seed weight, HCN-p, and A(, 330), while both additive and dominance genetic effects were important for leaf weight and seedling height. A highly positive correlation between seed weight and HCN-p was found across all entries, suggesting that large-seeded entries had greater HCN-p. ^ A seed-parent effect was found for all traits in the F(, 1) and backcross generations. No evidence of this reciprocal effect was found in the F(, 2), suggesting that <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> were not involved.

These technologies are also being applied in regenerative medicine as tools to reprogram cell genomes to a pluripotent state and to other cell lineages. Rapid progress in these new research areas and expectations for their translation into clini-cal applications have facilitated the development of more sophisticated gene delivery/expression technologies. Since its isolation in 1953 in Japan, Sendai virus (SeV) has been widely used as a research tool in cell biology and in industry, but the application of SeV as a recombinant viral vector has been investigated only recently. Recombinant SeV vectors have various unique characteristics, such as low pathogenicity, powerful capacity for gene expression and a wide host range. In addition, the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression mediated by this vector is advantageous for applications, in that chromosomal integration of exogenous genes can be undesirable.

While this increase was seen with BHK and Neuro- 2 a cells, further studies revealed that some cell lines, such as COS- 7, demonstrated relatively poor levels of cytoplasmic expression. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine what factors were responsible for the different expression levels between BHK (a high expressing cell line) and COS- 7 (a low expressing cell line). Results The main findings of this work are that the individual elements of the cytoplasmic expression system (such as the T 7 RNAP gene and Internal Ribosome Entry Sequence) are functioning similarly in both cell types. Both cell types were found to have the same amount of cytosolic nuclease activity, and that the cells appeared to have differences in the intra-cellular processing of DNA -cationic lipid complexes.

40|$|With rare exceptions, {{mammalian}} mitochondria are inherited {{through the}} female. This probably serves to minimize lethal <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> competition {{and to prevent}} the inheritance of sperm mitochondrial DNA that has been subject to degradation by free radicals. In general, organisms are intolerant of mitochondrial heteroplasmy and, when this occurs in humans, it frequently presents as progressive and lethal bioenergetic or neurological disease. The mitochondria of spermatozoa are specifically destroyed by proteolysis in early embryonic development, in mice at the 4 -to 8 -cell transition. While there are concerns in human assisted reproduction that microinjection of abnormal or immature sperm cells could lead to lasting harm in the offspring through transmission of abnormal mitochondria, there is no clinical evidence to support this. There is more potential for harm through attempts to ‘rescue’ poor quality oocytes by cytoplasmic or nuclear transfer, as it is not currently possible to control the final fate of the donated mitochondria in relation to nuclear-mitochondrial interactions or the embryonic axes.

Targeting and local translation of these RNAs {{is an important}} mechanism for <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> regulation that modulates synaptic plasticity. It is not known if different dendritically targeted RNAs are localized current knowledge about RNA localization in various systems. The second chapter provides evidence that multiple functionally coherent RNAs (CaMKII, NG and ARC) are localized to dendrites via the heteregenous ribonucleoprotein A 2 (hnRNPA 2) pathway. A common cis acting element present in these RNAs, called the hnRNPA 2 response element (A 2 RE), interacts with trans acting factor, hnRNPA 2 to mediate dendritic targeting. Experiments outlined in the third chapter show that tumor-overexpressed gene (TOG) is a multivalent ligand for hnRNPA 2. TOG provides a scaffold for coassembling multiple hnRNPA 2 molecules bound to RNA into composite RNA granules. The final step in dendritic RNA targeting is local translation.

In the last chapter, we describe the multiplexing hypothesis for dendritic targeting. In multiplexing different dendritically localized RNA are packaged into a composite transport intermediate.

50|$|The first {{documentation}} of male sterility was by Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter, who observed anther abortion within species and specific hybrids. Cytoplasmic male sterility {{has now been}} identified in over 150 plant species. It is more prevalent than female sterility, either because the male sporophyte and gametophyte are less protected from the environment than the ovule and embryo sac, or because it results from natural selection on mitochondrial genes which are maternally inherited and are thus not concerned with pollen production. Male sterility is easy to detect because {{a large number of}} pollen grains are produced and are easily studied. Male sterility is assayed through staining techniques (carmine, lactophenol or iodine), while detection of female sterility is by the absence of seeds.

Enzyme purified to near homogeneity from the pH-conditional mutant similarly exhibited pH-conditional activity under conditions where wild-type enzyme was unaffected over a pH range of 6. 0 - 8. 0.

The phenotype of pH-conditional mutants was defined on medium with lactose as the sole carbon source. Under such conditions the gene product itself, beta-galactosidase, is required to maintain intracellular pH, since such maintenance is clearly energy-dependent.

However, not all P-body components are nucleocytoplasmic proteins; rck/p 54, Dcp 1 a, Edc 3, Ge- 1, and Xrn 1 are insensitive to LMB and remain cytoplasmic in its presence. Nuclear Pat 1 b localizes to PML-associated foci and SC 35 -containing splicing speckles in a transcription-dependent manner, whereas {{in the absence of}} RNA synthesis, Pat 1 b redistributes to crescent-shaped nucleolar caps. Furthermore, inhibition of splicing by spliceostatin A leads to the reorganization of SC 35 speckles, which is closely mirrored by Pat 1 b, indicating that it may also be involved in splicing processes. Of interest, Pat 1 b retention in these three nuclear compartments is mediated via distinct regions of the protein. Examination of the nuclear distribution of 4 E-T(ransporter), an additional P-body nucleocytoplasmic protein, revealed that 4 E-T colocalizes with Pat 1 b in PML-associated foci but not in nucleolar caps.

Here, I theoretically analyze the effect of such variation in male intrinsic fertility on ejaculate investment. The model reveals that with increasing variation in male fertility, males should overall spend less resources on their ejaculates. Furthermore, if males differing in intrinsic fertility are able to invest differently in sperm production, there are two contrasting outcomes. Typically, less fertile males should invest more. However, if female mating frequency is relatively low and differences between males relatively large, the most common male genotype should invest more. These results have important consequences both for the understanding of sperm competition strategies {{as well as for}} the evolution of female polyandry and female mating preferences...|$|R

40|$|A mutation, car, {{determining}} {{resistance to}} several macrolide antibiotics, including carbomycin, {{has been identified}} in the alga Chlamydomonas as cytoplasmic, and mapped in the known cytoplasmic linkage group close to genes determining resistance to other antibiotics, including streptomycin, erythromycin, and spectinomycin. The effect of the car mutation on chloroplast ribosome function was demonstrated with an in vitro system incorporating amino acids especially developed to assess activity of 70 S chloroplast ribosomes. In an S- 30 extract containing both 70 S chloroplast and 80 S cytoplasmic ribosomes, low concentrations of Mg++ and spermidine favored 80 S ribosome activity, and high concentrations activated 70 S ribosomes and reversibly inactivated the 80 S component. Under conditions favoring chloroplast ribosome activity, carbomycin inhibited incorporation by an S- 30 extract, and by purified 70 S ribosomes from wild-type but not from car cells. These results show that <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> are directly involved in chloroplast ribosome function and they suggest that the car gene product is a ribosomal protein; the results further strengthen {{the evidence that the}} cytoplasmic linkage group is located in chloroplast DNA...|$|R
