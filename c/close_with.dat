5|$|As {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the {{competition}} in the third round. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis, with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw. Liverpool's matches varied from close affairs to comfortable victories.

Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance.

To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to <b>close</b> <b>with</b> Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E
5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to <b>close</b> <b>with</b> the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|E

Arriving on 13June, the French found the British {{reluctant}} to fight, moving away and anchoring some five miles off. As {{the success of the}} siege would probably be decided by naval action, 1200 troops were embarked onto Suffren's ships to increase his gunnery complement. Having been frustrated by contrary winds, the French fleet was able to <b>close</b> <b>with</b> the British ships on 17June. Hughes, not wishing to be caught at anchor, weighed, and the two fleets began manoeuvring for advantage.|$|E

Lindwall did not bounce Edrich, but Miller did, earning the ire of the crowd. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook. Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit.

5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part.

The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its <b>close</b> <b>with</b> a slow repetition of its final phrase.|$|E
5|$|This gender {{discrepancy}} {{is often}} distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, {{which may have}} implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 1619) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap <b>close,</b> <b>with</b> 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm. Studies also indicate that males who self-harm may also be at {{a greater risk of}} completing suicide.|$|E
