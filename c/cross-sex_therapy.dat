40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} the short- and long-term cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidities during <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> {{in a large}} sample of trans persons. Subjects and methods: A specialist center cross-sectional study compared 214 trans women (male-to-female transsexual persons) and 138 trans men (female-to-male trans persons) with an age- and gender-matched control population (1 - 3 matching). The participants were on <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> {{for an average of}} 7. 4 years. We assessed physical health and possible treatment-related adverse events using questionnaires. Results: Five percent of trans women experienced venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism during hormone therapy. Five of these adverse events occurred {{during the first year of}} treatment, while another three occurred during sex reassignment surgery. Trans women experienced more myocardial infarctions than the control women (P= 0. 001), but a similar proportion compared with control men. The prevalence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) was higher in trans women than in the control men (P= 0. 03). The rates of myocardial infarction and CVD in trans men were similar to the control male and female subjects. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was higher in both trans men and women than in their respective controls, whereas the rates of cancer were similar compared with the control men and women.

Hormone levels were measured by immunoassays. Physical health was assessed by physical examination and questionnaires on general health and specific side effects, areal bone parameters by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Methods. Single center cross-sectional study in 100 transsexual persons post-sex reassignment surgery and on average 10 years on <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy.</b> Results. Transsexual men did not experience important side effects such as cardiovascular events, hormone-related cancers, or osteoporosis. In contrast, a quarter of the transsexual women had osteoporosis at the lumbar spine and radius.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Transgender {{individuals}} experience distress due to {{the persistent}} feeling that their gender identity is incongruent with their assigned sex. This distress is associated with depression, a high suicide rate, and increased mortality. The best solution for transgender patients is <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy,</b> a treatment that changes the physical sex of the patient to be more congruent with their gender identity. This treatment has been proven to reduce depression and suicide rates, as well as increase overall quality of life. Unfortunately transgender patients face unacceptable barriers to accessing this treatment, due in most part {{to the lack of}} willing and knowledgeable transgender care providers. Many physicians share the misconceptions that gender identity is malleable, making transgender identity a psychiatric problem, and that <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> may not be effective and carries too great a risk. However, the literature supports the notion that gender identity is a rigid biological phenomenon and that <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> is safe and effective. Studies reporting failed attempts to assign female sex to XY patients with disorders of sexual development provide evidence that gender identity is not malleable. Other studies reporting elevated gender identity disorder rates in XX individuals with excess prenatal androgen suggest that gender identity is a biological phenomenon influenced by hormones during prenatal development. Neuroanatomical studies of transgender cadavers report that some sexually dimorphic areas of the transgender brain are more similar to the opposite sex than the natal sex, suggesting that gender identity is a rigid biological phenomenon originating {{in the structure of the}} brain. A review of the side effects and risks associated with <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> concluded that treatment is safe provided the physician is familiar with the recommended treatment and monitoring regimens. The lack of transgender care providers is perpetuated by the fact that transgender medicine is not a standard part of the medical school curriculum. Few physicians, therefore, have experience or training in transgender medicine, which is why, to combat this problem, this study has focused on the medical school education system. Previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of transgender medicine to the medical school curriculum increases student comfort and willingness to provide transgender care. Building upon these findings the present study aims to demonstrate that the addition of transgender medicine to the medical school curriculum is an effective means to increase knowledge and change attitudes towards transgender medicine. METHODS: A single lecture on gender identity and transgender medicine was added to the mandatory first-year biochemistry course and the mandatory second-year pathophysiology course at Boston University School of Medicine. An audience response survey was conducted immediately before and after the first- year lecture to assess the change in students opinions regarding of the etiology of gender identity. An elective online survey consisting of two exam style questions was also sent to the first-year students prior to exposure to the curricular content. The same questions were also added to the first-year biochemistry and second-year pathophysiology exams following exposure to the content. The exam-style questions were designed to assess student knowledge of the rigidity of gender identity and transgender medicine. Results: Following exposure to the curricular content there was an increase in the number of students who believe that the origin of gender identity is in the neuroanatomical structure of the brain (p< 0. 001). The relative number of correct responses to the exam-style questions significantly improved between the online survey and the first-year exam (p< 0. 001). On one of the exam questions there was no significant difference between the relative number of correct responses given first-year students the second-year students. On the other exam question the second-year students performed significantly worse (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate that the addition of transgender medicine to a medical school curriculum can increase students' knowledge and change their attitudes towards transgender medicine. Following the curricular content students were convinced that gender identity is a rigid biological phenomenon and that <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> is a medically justified treatment. These findings suggest that a simple curricular content change is an effective means of training knowledgeable physicians who are willing to provide transgender care...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Data on {{the effects}} of <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> (CHT) are limited due to the low {{prevalence}} of gender dysphoria, small number of subjects treated at each center, lack of prospective studies, and wide variations in treatment modalities. Aim. The aim {{of this study is to}} report the short-term effects of CHT on hormonal and clinical changes, side effects, and adverse events in trans men (female-to-male gender dysphoric persons) and trans women (male-to-female gender dysphoric persons). Methods. This was a multicenter 1 -year prospective study in 53 trans men and 53 trans women. Trans men received injections of testosterone undecanoate every 3 months. Trans women younger than 45 years received 50 mg cyproterone acetate (CA) and 4 mg estradiol valerate daily, whereas those older than 45 years received 50 mg CA daily together with 100 mu g/ 24 hours transdermal 17 -beta estradiol. Main Outcome Measures. Sex steroids, prolactin, liver enzymes, lipids, hematocrit, blood pressure, anthropometrics, Ferriman and Gallwey score, and global acne grading scale were measured. Side effects, adverse events, and desired clinical changes were examined. Results. No deaths or severe adverse events were observed. Two trans men developed erythrocytosis, and two had transient elevation of the liver enzymes. Trans men reported an increase in sexual desire, voice instability, and clitoral pain (all P <= 0. 01).

40|$|Transsexualism is characterised by a {{discrepancy}} between biological sex and gender identification, {{in spite of}} hormonal levels that are normal {{with respect to the}} biological sex. Generally, having the diagnosis ‘transsexualism’ or ‘Gender Identity Disorder’ (GID) is a prerequisite for hormonal and surgical treatment. Since transsexualism is such a rare phenomenon, and a so-called ‘gold standard’ against which the diagnosis could be evaluated is lacking, it is of utmost importance that reliable information be published by as many clinics as possible. One of the main aims of this thesis in psychiatry was to investigate potential differences in diagnostic ‘habits’ or interpretation of the classification rules as provided by DSM-IV and ICD- 10 among four European GID clinics (Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway). Secondly, it was investigated whether a widely used self-report inventory, the SCL- 90 -R, is suitable to be used in this patient group as well as two other patient groups. Finally, it was investigated whether <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> in GID patients has an effect on the answering strategy they employ on a math test that is known to show sex differences. The diagnostic criteria were interpreted in a similar manner in the four clinics. However, a distinction was made in Amsterdam between onset/duration {{on the one hand and}} severity/persistence on the other hand. This may lead to differences in diagnostic decisions among the clinics. It is recommended that severity and duration be taken into account in the next version of the DSM. The findings of two of the papers suggest that the dimensionality of the SCL- 90 -R is not stable. Subscale scores be used with care in patient groups reporting little distress, such as GID patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prior to {{the start}} of <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> (CSH), {{androgenic}} progestins are often used to induce amenorrhea in female to male (FtM) pubertal adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD). The aim of this single-center study is to report changes in anthropometry, side effects, safety parameters, and hormone levels in a relatively large cohort of FtM adolescents with a diagnosis of GD at Tanner stage B 4 or further, who were treated with lynestrenol (Orgametril®) monotherapy and in combination with testosterone esters (Sustanon®). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical and biochemical data obtained during at least 6 months of hormonal treatment in FtM adolescents followed at our adolescent gender clinic since 2010 (n[*]=[*] 45) was conducted. McNemar's test to analyze reported side effects over time was performed. A paired Student's t test or a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was performed, as appropriate, on anthropometric and biochemical data. For biochemical analyses, all statistical tests were done in comparison with baseline parameters. Patients who were using oral contraceptives (OC) at intake were excluded if a Mann-Whitney U test indicated influence of OC. RESULTS: Metrorrhagia and acne were most pronounced during the first months of monotherapy and combination therapy respectively and decreased thereafter. Headaches, hot flushes, and fatigue were the most reported side effects. Over the course of treatment, an increase in musculature, hemoglobin, hematocrit, creatinine, and liver enzymes was seen, progressively sliding into male reference ranges. Lipid metabolism shifted to an unfavorable high-density lipoprotein (HDL) /low-density lipoprotein (LDL) ratio; glucose metabolism was not affected. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone, and estradiol levels decreased, and free testosterone slightly increased during monotherapy; total and free testosterone increased significantly during combination therapy. Gonadotropins were only fully suppressed during combination therapy. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) remained stable throughout the treatment. Changes occurred in the first 6 months of treatment and remained mostly stable thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of FtM gender dysphoric adolescents with lynestrenol monotherapy and in combination with testosterone esters is effective, safe, and inexpensive; however, suppression of gonadotropins is incomplete.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effect of {{long-term}} cross-sex hormonal treatment on cortical and trabecular bone mineral density and main biochemical parameters of bone metabolism in transsexuals. Twenty-four male-to-female (M-F) transsexuals and 15 female-to-male (F-M) transsexuals treated with either an antiandrogen in combination with an estrogen or parenteral testosterone were included in this cross-sectional study. BMD was measured by DXA at distal tibial diaphysis (TDIA) and epiphysis (TEPI), lumbar spine (LS), total hip (HIP) and subregions, and whole body (WB) and Z-scores determined for both the genetic and the phenotypic gender. Biochemical parameters of bone turnover, insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and sex hormone levels were measured in all patients. M-F transsexuals were significantly older, taller and heavier than F-M transsexuals. They were treated by cross-sex hormones during a median of 12. 5 years before inclusion. As compared with female age-matched controls, they showed a significantly higher median Z-score at TDIA and WB (1. 7 +/- 1. 0 and 1. 8 +/- 1. 1, P < 0. 01) only. Based on the WHO definition, five (who did not comply with <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy)</b> had osteoporosis. F-M transsexuals were treated by cross-sex hormones during a median of 7. 6 years. They had significantly higher median Z-scores at TEPI, TDIA and WB compared with female age-matched controls (+ 0. 9 +/- 0. 2 SD, + 1. 0 +/- 0. 4 SD and + 1. 4 +/- 0. 3 SD, respectively, P < 0. 0001 for all) and reached normal male levels except at TEPI. They had significantly higher testosterone and IGF- 1 levels (p < 0. 001) than M-F transsexuals. We conclude that in M-F transsexuals, BMD is preserved over a median of 12. 5 years under antiandrogen and estrogen combination therapy, while in F-M transsexuals BMD is preserved or, at sites rich in cortical bone, is increased to normal male levels under a median of 7. 6 years of androgen treatment in this cross sectional study.

40|$|Puberty {{is highly}} {{important}} for the accumulation of bone mass. Bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD) can be affected in transgender adolescents when puberty is suppressed by gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa), followed by treatment with <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapy</b> (CSHT). We aimed to investigate the effect of GnRHa and CSHT on bone turnover markers (BTMs) and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) in transgender adolescents. Gender dysphoria was diagnosed based on diagnostic criteria according to the DSM-IV (TR). Thirty four female-to-male persons (transmen) and 22 male-to-female persons (transwomen) were included. Patients were allocated to a young (bone age of < 15 years in transwomen or < 14 in transmen) or old group (bone age of ≥ 15 years in transwomen or ≥ 14 years in transmen). All were treated with GnRHa triptorelin and CSHT was added in incremental doses {{from the age of}} 16 years. Transmen received testosterone esters (Sustanon, MSD) and transwomen received 17 -β estradiol. P 1 NP, osteocalcin, ICTP and BMD of lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were measured at three time points. In addition, BMAD and Z-scores were calculated. We found a decrease of P 1 NP and 1 CTP during GnRHa treatment, indicating decreased bone turnover (young transmen 95 % CI - 74 to - 50 %, p= 0. 02, young transwomen 95 % CI - 73 to - 43, p= 0. 008). The decrease in bone turnover upon GnRHa treatment was accompanied by an unchanged BMAD of FN and LS, whereas BMAD Z-scores of predominantly the LS decreased especially in the young transwomen. Twenty-four months after CSHT the BTMs P 1 NP and ICTP were even more decreased in all groups except for the old transmen. During CSHT BMAD increased and Z-scores returned towards normal, especially of the LS (young transwomen CI 95 % 0. 1 to 0. 6, p= 0. 01, old transwomen 95 % CI 0. 3 to 0. 8, p= 0. 04). To conclude, suppressing puberty by GnRHa leads to a decrease of BTMs in both transwomen and transmen transgender adolescents. The increase of BMAD and BMAD Z-scores predominantly in the LS as a result of treatment with CSHT is accompanied by decreasing BTM concentrations after 24 months of CSHT. Therefore, the added value of evaluating BTMs seems to be limited and DXA-scans remain important in follow-up of bone health of transgender adolescent...|$|R
40|$|Harm {{reduction}} {{programs and}} policies {{tend to take}} focus on the misuse and overuse of psychotropic substances, which have limited medical benefits, many side-effects, and most importantly cause physical dependence. This paper deals with {{a different kind of}} dependence on chemical products. It describes the use of hormones and skin whitening creams by male to female transgenders, so called waria, in Indonesia, not for pleasure but out of a felt necessity to be ???like women???. Studies of transgender men and women have often focused on their gender identities, elucidating how societies differ in their acceptance of gender ambiguity (Besnier and Alexeyeff 2013, Graham-Davies 2010, Sinnott 2004, Koon 2002, Johnson 1997; Nanda 2000; Nanda 1990). Waria, in Indonesia, are not giving in to societal norms on how bodies should be, but rather resisting prescribed gender-body images. They experience a dissonance between their female jiwa (soul) and a male body, which they try to resolve through feminizing their body. Having a waria identity is not a new phenomenon in the country. The Dutch ethnologist Hendrik Chabot describes how during his field work in the 1940 s he found ???a woman who did not feel at ease with her own sex. She wore hair like a woman, but a sarong like a man?????? (Chabot 1996 : 190). Chabot was surprised that her family accepted these transgressions of her sex-role. Since the waria subject position is well-known in Indonesia, most waria???s begin identifying as such while children. It {{is important to note that}} waria subjectivity is an attribute of male bodies, and that even though waria usually have sex with ???real??? men, they are not seen to be gay. In fact their sexual orientation is somewhat ambiguous. Many waria, though wanting to appear ???like??? women, enjoy penetrating their sexual partners (Oetomo 2000). Bodily presentation appears more important than sexual acts in asserting their femininity (Boellstorff 2005). Josephine Ho???s study look at transgender practice of modifying body in a more complex practices through cross-dressing, hormonal therapy, sexual reassignment surgery, or other procedures. To overcome the tension between their male bodies and female selves, waria perform femininity [...] they dress, talk and walk like women [...] and they tinker with their physical bodies. Lacking access to sex reversal surgery, they resort to contraceptive pills and injections (in high dosages) to make breasts and to many different creams to achieve light skins and treat the pimples caused by the hormones. Such tinkering has been explored by Don Kulick (1998) in Brazil, who describes vividly how self-taught bombadeiras (pumpers) inject liters of industrial silicone into hips and breasts of travesti to achieve desired body shapes. Jacqueline Ho (2006) addressed the practices of cross-dressing, hormonal therapy, sexual reassignment surgery and other procedures in Taiwan. It explores how male-to-female transgenders aimed to mismatch between their body and soul as the formation of self and identity. But, unrealistic dream to become women, the unexpected result of body modification, and the difficulty to exhibit normative sex-gender-sexuality alignment would apparently lead them to commit suicide. Furthermore, within highly sensitized gender atmosphere, male-to-female trans is seen as psychotically criminal by intention. They experienced limited body-soul imagery and bodies as the physical embodiment of self failed to establish their feeling of ???at-homeness???. Our research shows that wariado not want to be women; they want to change their physical appearance to be ???like women???. This entails ???covering??? their masculine bodies, which in this context is associated with the notion of dandan ??? literally (heavy) make up. Our informants often repeated that their true identities become visible when they are dandan. What mattered most was to have smooth, fair skin and to grow beautiful breasts. Towards these ends, they turned to skin-whitening products, including products contain potentially harmful ingredients, as well as the off-label use of contraceptive hormones, through which material body is decorated and reshaped, and experimenting through self-treatment. They assert amazing agency in finding the products, and dosage forms that work for them, but they are continuously confronted with severe side effects. They develop strategies to minimize side effects while achieving the bodily endpoints. Side-effects of hormonal drugs used by male-to-female transgenders have been described in a growing body of studies conducted in formal gender care settings (Paul et al. 1997; Wierckx et. al 2012). It has become clear that the <b>cross-sex</b> hormone <b>therapies</b> are associated with increased rates of cardiovascular disorders, osteoporosis, and cancers. However, harm reduction programs in Indonesia have not included this information in their educational campaigns. Educational programs and research to support it rather focus on the sexual risks associated with being a waria, in respose to HIV prevalence surveys (IBBS 2011) which show that waria are among the most at risk groups (Slamah et al. 2010...|$|R
40|$|Trans persons {{identify}} as, {{or desire}} to be, {{a member of}} the opposite gender of their birth gender. In case of gender dysphoria, this incongruence causes discomfort or distress often leading to the choice for hormonal and/or surgical treatment to conform the body to the desired gender. Although this phenomenon is of all time, and is known in many cultures, it has only gained medical interest in the last decades. Due to more media attention and the widespread use of internet, gender clinics are confronted with increasing numbers of applicants. Consequently, this demands more research of treatment protocols in this underserved group. Hormonal treatment in trans persons consists of sex steroid reversal. The principal endogenous sex steroid (i. e. androgen in men and estrogen in women) is suppressed and replaced by the principal sex steroid of the opposite sex. For trans women, who have a male birth sex, this means androgen suppression and estrogen replacement therapy inducing feminization. Trans men, who have a female birth sex, undergo testosterone therapy, inducing masculinization. Research in trans persons may also shed light on the origin of gender differences in the body and the interplay with sex steroids. Boys, for example, develop longer and bigger bones than girls during puberty indicating a crucial role for sex steroids in this process. Body composition changes during puberty too, resulting in more muscle and less fat mass and a different body shape in men versus women by the time of adolescence. Besides both muscle and fat tissue have an influence on bone. A vast body of evidence indeed pointed out that sex steroids are vital for bone acquisition and maintenance. The differential effects of sex steroids on bone health remain however unclear. In particular, their influence on cortical (the hard outer layer of bone) and trabecular (the interior of bone, a network of rod-like and plate-like tissue) bone needs further clarification. The objectives of this thesis are therefore twofold. We aim to describe bone health in trans persons using hormonal and/or surgical <b>therapy.</b> Secondly, <b>cross-sex</b> hormonal <b>therapy</b> (CSH) in trans persons may help to illuminate differential effects of sex steroids on the skeleton and the interplay with body composition. Previous studies on bone health in trans persons are scarce, often small-scaled and hampered by the use of dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The latter imaging technique shows a projection of the bone and results in the measurement of areal bone mineral density (aBMD). We have made use of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). This technique adds a third dimension to bone imaging, quantifies volumetric BMD, and allows the differentiation of cortical and trabecular bone. In chapter 1, we provide information on gender dysphoria its treatment options and give an overview of some important gender differences in bone and body composition and the relationship with sex steroids. Known literature on bone and body composition in trans persons is also summarized. Further, we state our research objectives and this chapter ends with the presentation of the study groups and the materials and methods. In the addendum, we present data on the prevalence on gender incongruence in Flanders in a population-based survey. In chapter 2, we focus on bone geometry, trabecular and cortical vBMD and the relation to body composition in trans persons. We compare bone, lean and fat mass in trans persons prior to any hormonal treatment and control populations (ch 2. 1) and evaluate short-term (up to 2 years follow-up) (ch 2. 2) and long-term effects (ch 2. 3) of CSH. We show that prior to treatment, trans women have a similar hormonal status, but already had a lower bone and muscle mass vs. control males and a male reference population (ch 2. 1). Osteoporosis is prevalent in 16 % of trans women vs. 4 % of controls. Peripheral QCT reveale a thinner bone cortex with a lower cortical bone area in trans women compared with control men. We hypothesize that trans women, prior to any hormonal treatment, have a different lifestyle than control men as they have a higher prevalence of 25 (OH) vitamin D deficiency (67 % vs. 35 %) and lower levels of sports activity and muscle mass vs. control men. During {{the first two years of}} antiandrogen and estrogen therapy in trans women, the aBMD increases at nearly all measured sites (whole body, lumbar spine, femoral neck, radius) and vBMD and bone geometry is unaffected (ch 2. 2. 1). Considerable loss of muscle mass and strength is also noted in trans women during CSH, whereas they gain body fat mass and subcutaneous fat mass (appendicular as well as at the hips). In a subgroup of these trans women, antiandrogens are used in monotherapy for a short term (median 25 weeks), before combination with estrogen therapy. The aBMD changes are similar in both groups. The markers of bone turnover increase during the first year, followed by a decrease in the second year in the group that had antiandrogens alone. In the group that used combination therapy from the start, bone turnover markers decline during the first and second year. We conclude that estrogen therapy is able to maintain bone health despite hypoandrogenism and substantial muscle loss. In addition, we propose that estrogen treatment in trans women induces a lower bone turnover leading to an increase in aBMD (by estrogen-mediated filling of the remodeling space). The absence of changes in volumetric bone parameters may have been due to the short follow-up, the relatively low sample size and the higher coefficient of variation of pQCT vs. DXA. In chapter 2. 2. 2, trans men prior to testosterone treatment and age-matched control women are followed prospectively and after one year. After the baseline visit, trans men received testosterone treatment (testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg, IM, 1 x/ 12 weeks), sometimes preceded by progestagens. At baseline, bone parameters are alike in both groups. After one year of testosterone therapy in trans men, considerable increases in muscle mass and strength and markers of bone turnover, and declines in fat parameters (subcutaneous as well as trunk and total body fat mass) are observed. We report a modestly increased aBMD at the total hip and trabecular vBMD in trans men, but not in control women. Other areal and volumetric bone parameters are unaffected. In chapter 2. 3. 1, we consider the long-term effects of testosterone treatment and sex reassignment surgery (including gonadectomy) on bone and body composition in 50 trans men and 50 age-matched control women in a cross-sectional study. Corresponding with the short-term effects of testosterone therapy, trans men still have higher muscle mass and strength and lower body fat mass vs. control women median 10 yr after the start of testosterone therapy. Trans men have a larger waist circumference too, indicating a more central, masculine pattern of fat distribution (apple-shape). A greater cortical bone size at the radius in trans men vs. control women is observed which was related to the higher muscle mass and strength. Trabecular vBMD is also higher than control women, similarly to the increased trabecular vBMD in our short-term study in trans men. Both findings may be suggestive for a direct or indirect (through muscle mass and strength) anabolic effect of testosterone therapy on trabecular and cortical bone. In chapter 2. 3. 2, in a subgroup of these 50 trans men on long-term testosterone treatment who underwent phalloplasty (n= 44), we assess bone health at the forearm that is used as donor-site for radial forearm phalloplasty. We observe no functional limitations on daily life activities, a painless and rather aesthetic scar and unaffected bone health. Long-term effects of CSH on bone geometry and body composition in trans women were previously described by our research group and are therefore not part of this thesis. In chapter 3, body composition is assessed in relationship to cardiovascular factors in 40 trans women and 20 trans men prior to and after one year of CSH. Trans women gain fat and loose muscle and body lean mass, while trans men undergo changes in the opposite direction during the first year of CSH. Estrogen treatment in trans women result in modestly increased insulin resistance and generally improved lipid profile (decline in triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein (Apo) A and B, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol (TC)) after one year. In contrast, trans men develop less insulin resistance but a worsening of lipid profile (increased TG, LDL and ApoB and lower HDL) in their first year using testosterone treatment. Less decline (in trans men) and a greater incline (in trans women) in fat mass are associated with a less favorable lipid profile. So, the CSH-mediated changes in body composition in trans persons have implications for their cardiovascular profile. In chapter 4, we summarize and discuss the main findings of the included studies. We then highlight the limitations of our work, suggest perspectives for further research and end with a discussion of the clinical relevance of this thesis...|$|R
