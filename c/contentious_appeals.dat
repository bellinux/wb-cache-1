50|$|In 2002, both Tracy and Franchitti joined Andretti to race at the Indianapolis 500. Due to the MSA, however, primary sponsor KOOL {{could not}} {{appear on the}} cars, and {{associate}} sponsor 7-Eleven was on the sidepods instead. Tracy placed second in a highly controversial finish. The team protested the results, and a lengthy and <b>contentious</b> <b>appeals</b> process dragged on into the summer. Ultimately, Green lost the appeal, to considerable disappointment and at considerable expense.|$|E
50|$|Weekly {{attorneys}} {{argued that}} both the Weekly and the Guardian had declining revenues, not because of an illegal pricing conspiracy but because of negative trends that were buffeting the entire American newspaper industry, including the rise of free classified advertising websites such as Craigslist and the general flow of readers to the web. However, the jury ultimately found {{in favor of the}} Guardian and awarded it $6.4 million in damages, an amount that ballooned to $15.6 million after partial trebling. After a lengthy and <b>contentious</b> <b>appeals</b> process, higher courts upheld the judgment, which was later settled for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
50|$|Decision No.106 from 3 February 2011 of the Court of Cassation “breaks and cancels in its entirety” the {{decision}} of the Appeal Court, rejecting all of Clearstream's arguments. The judges commented that “the public interest in the subject and the seriousness of the investigation, led by an investigative journalist, allowed the wording and the <b>contentious</b> allegations, the <b>Appeal</b> Court violated the above-mentioned texts” therefore cancelling Robert’s previous convictions. The Court of Cassation specifically stated that “when a public debate of public interest is involved, journalistic freedom includes possible resort to a certain degree of exaggeration, even provocation, in the debate”.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{treatise}} is to revisit and reconsider {{the development of the}} review test set out in the Constitutional Court judgment of Sidumo & another v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd & Others (2007) 28 ILJ 2405 (CC) and consequently ascertain the correct approach to be adopted by our Labour Courts in the application of such test. The secondary purpose, entail the determination {{of the extent to which}} Labour Court judges interfere with the merits of awards and the resulting impact on the distinction between appeal and review. In order to establish whether the test for review was correctly developed and to determine whether our review proceedings deter recurrent interference by our judges, an edifying consideration of judicial review in South Africa, an extensive analysis of various judgements pertaining to such development, followed by a comprehensive comparison with the United Kingdom`s application of review proceedings and judicial composition are made. The research methodology is based on a contour of Sidumo, commencing with the Sidumo judgment, followed by three <b>contentious</b> Labour <b>Appeal</b> Court judgments and concluding with a Supreme Court of Appeal judgement, which clarifies the operation of the review test. The contour is interlinked with the notion of reasonableness. The primary research findings are identified in the judgment of Herholdt v Nedbank Ltd (2013) 34 ILJ 2795 (SCA). The judgment, concluding the Sidumo contour, underlines the current position in our law and consequent narrower approach. A comparison made with the United Kingdom, differentiate between such approach implemented by our courts and the strict gross unreasonableness approach applied by Employment Appeal Tribunals, recognising the finding, that our Labour Court judges ardently interfere with the merits of awards. In the conclusion it is submitted that our labour law jurisprudence will constantly evolve, dictated by our courts interpretation of lawfulness, reasonableness and fairnes...|$|R
