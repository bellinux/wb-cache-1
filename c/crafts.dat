He was the oldest of two sons born to Ethel May Hollamby, née Kingdom (1899/1900–1966), and Edward Thomas Hollamby (1893–1978), a police constable. His primary {{education}} took place at St. Peter's Church School, before he won a scholarship to study at a junior technical school. From there, he gained a higher education by training in architecture at the nearby Hammersmith School of Arts and <b>Crafts</b> during the 1930s. At the college, he {{was inspired by the}} Arts and <b>Crafts</b> aesthetic propounded by one of his lecturers, Alwyn Waters, and through him came to take an interest in William Morris, who had been a pioneer of the Arts and <b>Crafts</b> movement {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. At the same time, Hollamby was influenced by the modernist movement in architecture to which two of his favourite lecturers, Arthur Ling and Alex Lowe, belonged, and joined the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS).|$|E

5000|$|Studio <b>craft</b> is the {{practice}} of <b>craft</b> methodology in an artist's studio. Traditional <b>craft</b> tends to generate <b>craft</b> objects out of necessity or for ceremonial use while studio <b>craft</b> produces <b>craft</b> objects at the whim of the maker or intended owner. These objects are at most only desirable for use and often lack any utility. Because studio <b>craft</b> doesn't make objects out of necessity, it is similar to works of studio art which are made for aesthetic rather than functional purposes.|$|R

40|$|<b>Craft</b> {{producers}} in South Africa face difficulties selling to formal <b>craft</b> retailers. This {{is due to}} the lack of understanding of what <b>craft</b> retailers consider as important when searching for suppliers. The study was conducted to determine the importance of various supplier selection criteria that <b>craft</b> retailers use to evaluate suppliers. Convenience sampling was adopted and self-administered questionnaires were completed by a total of 233 <b>craft</b> retailers. The findings revealed that <b>craft</b> retailers consider product quality as the most important supplier selection criteria when evaluating <b>craft</b> producers as suppliers. The MANOVA results further indicated that although the importance attached to supplier selection criteria differed for various types of <b>craft</b> retailers, such differences occur only for selected supplier criteria. An understanding of the supplier selection criteria used by <b>craft</b> retailers could enable informal <b>craft</b> producers to gain access to the formal market. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|An air-cushioned landing <b>craft,</b> {{also called}} an LCAC (landing <b>craft,</b> air cushioned) {{is a modern}} {{variation}} on the amphibious landing boat. The majority of these <b>craft</b> are small- to mid-sized multi-purpose hovercraft, also known as [...] "over the beach" [...] ("OTB") <b>craft.</b> This allows troops and material to access more than 70 percent of the world's coastline, while only approximately 15 percent of that coastline is available to conventional boat-type landing <b>craft.</b> Typical barriers to conventional landing <b>craft</b> are soft sandy beaches, marshes, swampland, and loose surfaces. Air cushion technology has vastly increased the landing capability of the <b>craft,</b> providing greater speed and flexibility over traditional landing <b>craft.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{has never}} been in Japan such a {{remarkable}} movement for modernization of designs and <b>craft</b> as has been the case in Europe. As for <b>craft,</b> there was barely the folk <b>craft</b> movement advanced by Muneyoshi Yanagi, whose goal was not the modernization of <b>craft.</b> During the Meiji Era, Japan was so urgent to adapt herself to European civilization that she could ill afford to start her own movement considering her position in the fields of design or <b>craft.</b> Especially, {{in most parts of the}} country, having little influence from Europe, the <b>craft</b> manufacturers were unable to get rid of their traditional way of thinking and manufacturing. In 1929, however, there came home to Japan a toung man called Fusaichiro Inouye, who had experienced a new movement for design and <b>craft</b> for seven years in France. In Takasaki, his native town, trying to connect art with local industry, he would start a movement to make high quality <b>craft</b> far more popular than ever. For this purpose, Inouye organized an Association for distribution of wood <b>craft,</b> established the Inouye <b>Craft</b> Institue, and actually started designing and manufacturing himself. What he aimed at was not only fostering local <b>craft</b> but also manufacturing such <b>craft</b> goods as would be well fit for overseas markets. It was because of such a basis well established that Bruno Taut moved to Takasaki in 1934 so as to be a leader in <b>craft.</b> Taut sympathized with Inouye in his ideal of fostering <b>craft</b> movement as had never been found in Japan, and gave a helping hand to the industrialization of <b>craft</b> and design. Indeed, he settled in Takasaki for twenty-seven months, devoting himself to the development of a new <b>craft.</b> What was a tiny <b>craft</b> movement started in Takasaki, grew big under Taut's leadership, whose designs have had a great influence on the local <b>craft</b> here. It would be necessary for us to evaluate highly this <b>craft</b> movement in Takasaki, if we were to make a panorama of our modern design and <b>craft...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Craft</b> and {{performance}} art are both experiencing renewed significance within contemporary art. Correspondingly, practices, exhibitions, and works that combine features of both <b>craft</b> {{and performance}} art are {{appearing in the}} form of collaborative <b>crafting,</b> documentation of <b>crafting</b> events, live and public performance of <b>craft</b> work, and <b>crafting</b> as a tool for social and political projects. This thesis addresses the intersections of <b>craft</b> and performance art in select artworks and curatorial strategies from the exhibitions Common Threads at the Illingworth Kerr Gallery in Calgary (2007), She Will Always Be Younger Than Us at the Textile Museum of Canada in Toronto (2009), and Gestures of Resistance at the Museum of Contemporary <b>Craft</b> in Portland (2010). Centering on presentations that foreground the performance of <b>crafting</b> or craft-making as the central mode of the work, I argue that a comprehensive reading of these works must situate them not only within the history of <b>craft,</b> but also within the history and theories of performance art. By examining and drawing upon the history and strategies of performance art, this thesis proposes that the incorporation of performance art into <b>craft</b> calls into question the traditional view of <b>craft</b> as an object-centred practice. The notion of a dematerialized <b>craft</b> practice is considered in light of recent developments in <b>craft</b> theory that propose thinking about <b>craft</b> not as a set of objects or materials, but rather as form of knowledge or a as subject...|$|R
