25|$|Other common {{spasmolytic}} agents include: methocarbamol, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> gabapentin, metaxalone, and orphenadrine.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} {{the use of}} carisoprodol in 1959, metaxalone in August 1962, and <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> in August 1977.|$|E
25|$|The {{muscle relaxants}} <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> {{carisoprodol}} with acetaminophen and caffeine and tizanidine are sometimes {{used to treat}} fibromyalgia; however as of 2015 they are not approved for this use in the United States. The use of NSAIDs is not recommended as first line therapy.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{muscle relaxants}} are not {{approved}} by FDA for long-term use. However, rheumatologists often prescribe <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> nightly {{on a daily}} basis to increase stage 4 sleep. By increasing this sleep stage, patients feel more refreshed in the morning. Improving sleep is also beneficial for patients who have fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|Adjuvant analgesics, {{also called}} {{atypical}} analgesics, include nefopam, orphenadrine, pregabalin, gabapentin, <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> hyoscine (scopolamine), {{and other drugs}} possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, {{as well as many}} other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.|$|E
25|$|Outpatient {{palliative care}} {{following}} discharge often {{consists of a}} weak or moderate strength opioid (e.g. codeine or tramadol, respectively) depending on pain scores, an anti-inflammatory agent (e.g. naproxen, cortisone), and an antispasmodic (e.g. <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> diazepam), {{for a few days}} to a week. If the pain and/or spasms have not resolved by this time, a second medical evaluation is generally advised, and differential diagnoses may be considered. Occasionally, an antibiotic is prescribed as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclobenzaprine</b> {{produces}} {{confusion and}} lethargy, {{as well as}} anticholinergic side effects. When taken in excess or {{in combination with other}} substances, it may also be toxic. While the body adjusts to this medication, it is possible for patients to experience dry mouth, fatigue, lightheadedness, constipation or blurred vision. Some serious but unlikely side effects may be experienced, including mental or mood changes, possible confusion and hallucinations, and difficulty urinating. In a very few cases, very serious but rare side effects may be experienced: irregular heartbeat, yellowing of eyes or skin, fainting, abdominal pain including stomachache, nausea or vomiting, lack of appetite, seizures, dark urine, or loss of coordination.|$|E
25|$|Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> metaxalone, and {{methocarbamol}} {{are commonly}} prescribed for {{low back pain}} or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants. Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs. In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use. No drug {{has been shown to}} be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness. Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use. A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse-effect profile, tolerability, and cost.|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, on February 11, Houston {{was found}} {{unconscious}} in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, submerged in the bathtub. Beverly Hills paramedics arrived at approximately 3:30p.m. {{and found the}} singer unresponsive and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55p.m. PST. The {{cause of death was}} not immediately known. Local police said there were [...] "no obvious signs of criminal intent". On March 22, 2012, the Los Angeles County coroner's office reported the cause of Houston's death was drowning and the [...] "effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use". The office stated the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance shortly before her death. Toxicology results revealed additional drugs in her system: diphenhydramine, alprazolam, cannabis and <b>cyclobenzaprine.</b> The manner of death was listed as an [...] "accident".|$|E
2500|$|Tramadol may {{interact}} with serotonergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors, other opioid analgesics (pethidine (meperidine), tapentadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl), dextromethorphan, certain migraine medications (triptans, ergots), certain anxiolytics (such as the SSRIs and buspirone), certain antibiotics (namely, linezolid and isoniazid), certain herbs (e.g. St. John's wort, passiflora, etc.), amphetamines, substituted amphetamines, phenethylamine and substituted phenethylamines, phentermine, lithium, methylene blue {{as well as}} numerous other therapeutic agents. As it is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, any agents {{with the ability to}} inhibit or induce these enzymes will likely {{interact with}} tramadol. A pressor response similar to the so-called [...] "cheese effect" [...] was noted in combinations of amphetamine and tramadol, which appears to cause dysfunction of or toxicity to epinephrine/norepinephrine receptors. [...] <b>Cyclobenzaprine,</b> a commonly-used muscle relaxant, atypical analgesic adjunct, as well as a potentiator often used with analgesics like codeine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone and the like, is structurally related to the tricyclic antidepressants [...] and therefore should not be used with tramadol; this is also the case for trazodone ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclobenzaprine</b> has major {{contraindications}} with {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors (MAOIs). At least one {{study also found}} increased risk of serotonin syndrome when <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> was taken with the serotonergic drugs duloxetine or phenelzine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclobenzaprine</b> {{may affect}} the {{medications}} used in surgical sedation and some surgeons request that patients temporarily discontinue its use prior to surgery. The prescribing physician should be consulted prior to discontinuing, and resuming, <b>cyclobenzaprine.</b>|$|E
50|$|By mouth, <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> is {{marketed as}} Apo-Cyclobenzaprin, Fexmid and Novo-Cycloprine. Flexeril was discontinued. It is {{available}} in generic form. A once-a-day, extended-release formulation, Amrix, is available. <b>Cyclobenzaprine</b> is also used by compounding pharmacies in topical creams.|$|E

50|$|A rapidly absorbed form of <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> {{is being}} {{studied in the}} {{treatment}} for post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors taken {{within two}} weeks of <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> may result in serious, {{life-threatening}} side effects.|$|E
50|$|Some {{experts believe}} that <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> should be avoided in elderly {{patients}} because it can cause confusion, delirium, and cognitive impairment.|$|E
50|$|The {{sedative}} {{effects of}} <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> are {{likely due to}} its antagonistic effect on histamine, serotonin, and muscarinic receptors. Agitation is a common side effect observed especially in the elderly. In general, the National Committee for Quality Assurance recommends avoiding the use of <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> in the elderly {{because of the potential}} for more severe side effects. Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related tricyclic, such as tricyclic antidepressants.|$|E
50|$|People who {{are taking}} meperidine, tramadol, methadone, propoxyphene, dextromethorphan, St. Johnâ€™s wort, <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> or another MAO {{inhibitor}} should not take rasagiline.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} {{the use of}} carisoprodol in 1959, metaxalone in August 1962, and <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> in August 1977.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclobenzaprine</b> {{has been}} found to be not {{inferior}} to tizanidine, orphenadrine, and carisoprodol in the treatment of acute lower back pain, although none has been proven to be effective for long-term use (beyond two weeks of treatment). No differences in pain or spasm scores were noted among these agents, nor when compared to benzodiazepines. However, nonbenzodiazepine (including <b>cyclobenzaprine)</b> treatment was found to have a lower risk of medication abuse and continuation of use against medical advice. Side effects such as sedation and ataxia are also less pronounced with nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodics.|$|E
50|$|Various {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (TCAs) {{contain the}} dibenzocycloheptene moiety in their chemical structures, including amineptine, amitriptyline, amitriptylinoxide, butriptyline, demexiptiline, nortriptyline, noxiptiline, and protriptyline. <b>Cyclobenzaprine,</b> a skeletal muscle relaxant, also contains this functional group.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} grey {{column is}} the target for some spasmolytic medications. Norepinephrine release here, (as induced by <b>cyclobenzaprine)</b> reduces spasms by innervation (reducing nerve activity) of alpha motor neurons via interaction with gamma fibers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclobenzaprine</b> is {{regulated}} in the U.S. for prescription use only. Though {{it does not}} fall within most governmental guidelines as a controlled substance, possession of it without a valid or current prescription may be illegal, depending upon various state and local laws.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscle relaxants}} <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> {{carisoprodol}} with acetaminophen and caffeine and tizanidine are sometimes {{used to treat}} fibromyalgia; however as of 2015 they are not approved for this use in the United States. The use of NSAIDs is not recommended as first line therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclobenzaprine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Flexeril among others, is a muscle relaxer {{medication}} used to relieve skeletal muscle spasms and associated pain in acute musculoskeletal conditions. It is the best-studied drug for this application. It has also been used off-label for fibromyalgia treatment.|$|E
50|$|C. elegans {{is able to}} {{transform}} the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and doxepin, the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine, the muscle relaxant <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> the typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine {{as well as the}} antihistamine and anticholinergic methdilazine and azatadine. It is also able {{to transform}} the antihistamines brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and pheniramine.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study on}} the {{treatment}} of musculoskeletal pain treatment with <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> alone or in combination with ibuprofen, no significant differences in pain scores were noted among the three treatment groups. Peak benefit was found to occur on day seven of the treatment for all groups.|$|E
50|$|Meta-analysis {{studies have}} found {{significantly}} increased rates of drowsiness (38% of patients), dry mouth (24%), dizziness (10%), and adverse events of any kind in patients taking <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> versus placebo. Drowsiness and dry mouth appear to intensify with increasing dose. Dysphagia, a life threatening side-effect, may rarely occur.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{muscle relaxants}} are not {{approved}} by FDA for long-term use. However, rheumatologists often prescribe <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> nightly {{on a daily}} basis to increase stage 4 sleep. By increasing this sleep stage, patients feel more refreshed in the morning. Improving sleep is also beneficial for patients who have fibromyalgia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclobenzaprine</b> {{has also}} shown {{effectiveness}} {{in the treatment of}} fibromyalgia symptoms, with a reported Number needed to treat of 4.8 (meaning that 1 patient out of every 4.8 benefits from treatment) for pain reduction, but no change in fatigue or tender points. It may also be used along with other treatments for tetanus.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{drugs are}} often used to help analgesics combat various types of pain, {{and parts of the}} overall pain experience, and are hence called {{adjuvant}} medications. Gabapentin - an anti-epileptic - not only exerts effects alone on neuropathic pain, but can potentiate opiates. [...] While perhaps not prescribed as such, other drugs such as Tagamet (cimetidine) and even simple grapefruit juice may also potentiate opiates, by inhibiting CYP450 enzymes in the liver, thereby slowing metabolism of the drug. In addition, orphenadrine, <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> trazodone and other drugs with anticholinergic properties are useful in conjunction with opioids for neuropathic pain. Orphenadrine and <b>cyclobenzaprine</b> are also muscle relaxants, and therefore particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions. Clonidine has found use as an analgesic for this same purpose, and all of the mentioned drugs potentiate the effects of opioids overall.|$|E
50|$|Adjuvant analgesics, {{also called}} {{atypical}} analgesics, include nefopam, orphenadrine, pregabalin, gabapentin, <b>cyclobenzaprine,</b> scopolamine, {{and other drugs}} possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, {{as well as many}} other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.|$|E
