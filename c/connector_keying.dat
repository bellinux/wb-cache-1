50|$|Batteries {{designed}} for these portable vacuum tube receivers were {{a combination of}} several different battery types and sizes, combined in a single package and intended to slowly wear out {{at about the same}} rate. The battery typically connected to the radio via a specially shaped four- or five-pin <b>connector,</b> <b>keyed</b> so that the plug must be inserted correctly. A battery eliminator would take the typical 6-volt or 12-volt DC power from a car battery and transform it into the required LT and HT needed to power the vacuum tubes in a car radio. Without a battery eliminator, it was necessary to occasionally replace the battery pack in the vacuum-tube car radio.|$|R

50|$|Third {{generation}} systems (1980s) were transistorized {{and based}} on integrated circuits and likely used stronger algorithms. They were smaller and more reliable. Field maintenance was often limited to running a diagnostic mode and replacing a complete bad unit with a spare, the defective box being sent to a depot for repair. Keys were loaded through a connector on the front panel. NSA adopted {{the same type of}} connector that the military used for field radio handsets as its fill <b>connector.</b> <b>Keys</b> were initially distributed as strips of punched paper tape that could be pulled through a hand held reader (KOI-18) connected to the fill port. Other, portable electronic fill devices (KYK-13, etc.) were available as well.|$|R

50|$|The power supply's {{connection}} to the motherboard was changed from the older AT and LPX standards; AT and LPX had two similar connectors that could be accidentally interchanged by forcing the different <b>keyed</b> <b>connectors</b> into place, usually causing short-circuits and irreversible damage to the motherboard (the rule of thumb for safe operation was to connect the side-by-side connectors with the black wires together). ATX used one large, <b>keyed</b> <b>connector</b> {{which could not be}} connected incorrectly. The new connector also provides a 3.3 volt source, removing the need for motherboards to derive this voltage from the 5 V rail. Some motherboards, particularly those manufactured after the introduction of ATX but while LPX equipment was still in use, supported both LPX and ATX PSUs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new network diagram {{authoring}} tool, Dunnart, that provides continuous network layout. It continuously adjusts the lay-out {{in response to}} user interaction, while still maintaining the layout style and, as far as possible, the current layout topology. The diagram author uses placement constraints, such as alignment and distribution, to tailor the layout style and can guide the layout by repositioning dia-gram components or rerouting <b>connectors.</b> The <b>key</b> to the flexibility of our system {{is the use of}} topology-preserving constrained graph layout. ...|$|R
50|$|Bridges and {{structures}} using Znap are often integrated into train layouts at shows. One challenge {{of doing so}} is that different parts came in different colors, and certain <b>key</b> <b>connector</b> parts were available only in strange colors, like purple, making uniform color bridges difficult to construct.|$|R
50|$|The extra-low voltage <b>connector</b> also {{supports}} <b>keying,</b> although {{in this case}} the angle is the position of the minor key relative to the major key. Minor key positions 5h, 6h and 7h are unavailable, as they would overlap with the major key, but an unkeyed variant exists.|$|R
5000|$|While Mini-DIN {{connectors}} {{cannot be}} plugged in the [...] "wrong way", {{it is possible}} to have trouble finding the right way without looking inside the circular connector's shroud. Apple attempted to help by using U-shaped soft plastic grips around the <b>connectors</b> to <b>key</b> both plugs and sockets so the flat side has a specific relation to the shell keyway, but this feature was ignored by some 3rd-party manufacturers. Additionally, there are four ways to orient the receiving socket on a device such as a keyboard; various Apple keyboards use at least three of these possible orientations.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a research agenda for selecting software connectors which quantifiably satisfy different scenarios for large volume data distribution.

50|$|Many <b>connectors</b> are <b>keyed,</b> {{with some}} {{mechanical}} component which prevents mating except with a correctly oriented matching connector. This {{can be used}} to prevent incorrect or damaging interconnections, either preventing pins from being damaged by being jammed in at the wrong angle or fitting into imperfectly fitting plugs, or to prevent damaging connections, such as plugging an audio cable into a power outlet. For instance, XLR connectors have a notch to ensure proper orientation, while Mini-DIN plugs have a plastic projection, which fits into a corresponding hole in the socket and prevent different connectors from being pushed together (they also have a notched metal skirt to provide secondary keying).|$|R
30|$|Major joint {{problems}} usually {{occur only}} when the joint is subjected to service conditions. Al-Cu joints are mostly used in electrical industries as electrical <b>connectors,</b> so a <b>key</b> consideration is oxidation, since Al-Cu joints are easily oxidised, resulting in resistance to electrical flow (Klauke, 2012). Therefore, joint properties and microstructure formation when the joints are in service need to be considered.|$|R

50|$|This {{system is}} used on certain 1981-83 models. There were two {{different}} EEC-III modules: Feedback Carburetor (FBC) and Central Fuel Injection (CFI; similar to GM's Throttle Body Injection). The module size and shape were approximately {{the same as the}} EEC-II and still utilized the external memory module. The two modules had differently <b>keyed</b> <b>connectors</b> to prevent accidental insertion in the wrong vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|ST <b>connectors</b> have a <b>key</b> which {{prevents}} {{rotation of the}} ceramic ferrule, and a bayonet lock similar to a BNC shell. The single index tab must be properly aligned with a slot on the mating receptacle before insertion; then the bayonet interlock can be engaged, by pushing and twisting, locking {{at the end of}} travel which maintains spring-loaded engagement force on the core optical junction.|$|R
25|$|The {{connectors}} {{are similar}} to XLR but with an extra coding key and groove that allows control over the intermating of XLD plugs and XLR sockets. A connector with the coding key installed will not {{mate with a connector}} that does not have the matching groove. By suitably <b>keying</b> <b>connectors,</b> analog microphones can be protected from damage by the high current digital phantom power supply provided for digital microphones.|$|R
50|$|The Sinclair QL and 128k ZX Spectrum home {{computers}} used type 631W connectors for their serial ports (on the Spectrum 128 and +2, MIDI signals {{could also be}} sent from the port). These closely resemble standard 631A <b>connectors</b> but the <b>keying</b> slots {{on the back of}} the plug have a different size and position. The Sinclair QL also used the left handed variant of this connector (the 630W) for its joystick ports.|$|R
40|$|We {{have built}} an {{infrastructure}} which reifies the architectural connections between modules into a data structure that constantly reflects the dynamic structural architecture of a software system. It similarly makes available all communications passing through those connectors. Since these connections and the communications passing through them constitute the entire behavior of an architecture, our infrastructure provides {{the basis for}} a full range of architecture-level monitoring, testing, debugging, and enforcement tools. This paper concentrates on the latter by presenting a language for stating architectural constraints which can be checked against the data structure that dynamically reflects the software system's structural architecture.

The interstate begins in Tampa, Florida, and travels northeast across the midsection of the state directly through Orlando, ending in Daytona Beach.

40|$|Internal localization, {{the problem}} of {{estimating}} relative pose for each module (part) of a modular robot {{is a prerequisite for}} many shape control, locomotion, and actuation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a robust hierarchical approach that uses normalized cut to identify dense subregions with small mutual localization error, then progressively merges those subregions to localize the entire ensemble. Our method works well in both 2 D and 3 D, and requires neither exact measurements nor rigid intermodule <b>connectors.</b> One <b>key</b> component of our solution is a simple method to reduce the cost of normalized cut computations. Most of the other computations can be effectively distributed. The result is a robust algorithm that scales to large, non-homogeneous ensembles. We evaluate our algorithm in accurate 2 D and 3 D simulations of scenarios with up to 10, 000 modules...|$|R
40|$|In a simply {{supported}} composite bridge girder the concrete is in compression over {{the full length}} of the bridge, whereas in a continuous multispan bridge some regions of the bridge are subjected to negative bending moment, in which case the concrete goes into tension. With respect to fatigue behavior of stud shear <b>connectors,</b> one <b>key</b> difference between placing studs in the positive and negative moment regions is the stress state of the base metal of the beam flange. The fact that the beam flange is in tension {{at the base of the}} studs in the negative moment region raises questions about whether this affects their fatigue endurance. This report summarizes the research behind the fatigue design provisions for shear connectors in the negative moment region in the American Association of State and Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specification.

50|$|Computer bus {{interfaces}} {{provided through}} the M.2 connector are PCI Express 3.0 (up to four lanes), Serial ATA 3.0, and USB 3.0 (a single logical port {{for each of}} the latter two). It is up to the manufacturer of the M.2 host or device to select which interfaces are to be supported, depending on the desired level of host support and device type. The M.2 <b>connector</b> has different <b>keying</b> notches that denote various purposes and capabilities of M.2 hosts and modules, preventing plugging of M.2 modules into feature-incompatible host connectors.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the colour code, <b>connectors</b> are <b>keyed</b> in one of 12 positions to ensure that incompatible utilization voltages cannot be connected. Different voltage and frequency combinations are distinguished by {{the location of the}} earth pin (or a plastic projection called the minor keyway, for connectors with no earth pin), as shown in the following table. The earth pin can be in one of twelve locations, described by clock positions 1h through 12h, spaced at 30° intervals around the circle on which all the pins lie. The various positions are referenced from the view of the open side of a socket; the 6 o'clock (6h, 180°) position is at the same angle as the major keyway, and is oriented downwards. The major keyway is a projection on the plug shroud which aligns with a notch on the socket. The earth pin has a larger diameter than the other pins, preventing the wrong type of plug being inserted in a socket.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} results of {{laboratory}} testing of compression and bolted splices installed on stranded aluminum power conductors. The tests on compression splices involved connectors of 10 different designs using 240 mm 2 stranded aluminum cable. Testing on the bolted splices was performed on connectors of 16 different designs installed on stranded aluminum cable with dimensions of 50 and 240 mm 2. Splice performance was assessed {{on the basis of}} resistance measure-ments during short-circuit tests and thermal cycling as specified by the IEC 61238 - 1 standard, and from inspections of cross-sectioned connections. Differences in splice performance are related to such factors as physical properties of the materials in contact, splice assembly procedures, number of compression indentations or number of bolts, and other rele-vant parameters. The influence of conductor deformation on the ability to disrupt of aluminum oxide films on the conductor surface during connector installation is addressed. The laboratory data indicate that large mechanical deformations in a splice significantly improve connector performance. For com-pression splices, relatively soft (annealed) conductors lead to inferior performance than hard-drawn conductors, unless the soft conductor hardens significantly when it is deformed during installation. The sequence in which the compression indenta-tions are made, may influence <b>connector</b> performance. <b>Key</b> words...|$|R
