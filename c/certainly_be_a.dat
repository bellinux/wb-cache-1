500|$|Contenders for {{the general}} {{classification}} were Simon Špilak (Team Katusha), Thibaut Pinot (...) , Rafal Majka (...) , Sergio Henao (Team Sky), Tom Dumoulin (Giant-Alpecin), Michał Kwiatkowski (...) and Geraint Thomas (...) [...] Other hopefuls were Jurgen Van den Broeck (...) and Sébastien Reichenbach (...) [...] It was 's Domenico Pozzovivo's first race after his disastrous crash in the Giro d'Italia, so his form was predicted as uncertain, but the Italian climber could <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor {{if he was in}} shape.|$|E
2500|$|As for prisoners, the {{available}} numbers are even scarcer. Chronicler Palencia wrote that when Afonso V {{returned to the}} city of Toro in the days immediately after the battle, he had wasted [...] "an opportunity of stabbing or drowning in the river 500 enemies both infantry and chivalry [...] ".]] Alonso de Palencia, Década III, book XXV, chapter IX., which would <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> revenge over men who had contributed to his defeat in the battle. Like all numbers related to the battle of Toro, there are no certainties, and this number of 500 Castilian prisoners should be considered as a maximum and possibly inflated.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the release}} of Dare, three of its tracks—"The Sound of the Crowd", [...] "Love Action (I Believe in Love)", and [...] "Open Your Heart"—had already been {{released}} as successful singles. With a hit album and three hit singles in a row, Virgin's chief executive Simon Draper decided to release one more single from the album {{before the end of}} 1981. His choice, [...] "Don't You Want Me", instantly caused a row with Oakey who did not want another single to be released because he was convinced that [...] "the public were now sick of hearing The Human League" [...] and the choice of the [...] "poor quality filler track" [...] would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> disaster, wrecking the group's new-found popularity. [...] Virgin were adamant that a fourth single would be released and Oakey finally agreed on the condition that a large colour poster accompany the 7" [...] single, because he felt fans would [...] "feel ripped off" [...] by the 'substandard' single alone.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{assessments}} of the opera have often mentioned both the opera's strong and weak points. [...] Audrey Williamson wrote in a 1982 book that the virtues of The Sorcerer, [...] "in spite of its defects ... justify {{its place in the}} repertoire." [...] In 1996, Ian Bradley commented in the introduction to his annotated edition of the Gilbert and Sullivan libretti, [...] "It will <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great pity if it gradually fades away. The Sorcerer contains two of W. S. Gilbert's best-drawn characters, the soulful Dr Daly ... and the flashy but ultimately tragic figure of John Wellington Wells. Sir Arthur Sullivan's music is delightful and guaranteed to weave a magic spell over all those who hear it, if not actually to make them fall instantly in love with their next-door neighbours." [...] The New York Times commented in 2012 that the plot [...] "has not aged especially well. Its references to rank are dated beyond empathy’s reach; filled with sly allusions, its assumptions about a general audience's musical knowledge are unrealistic. Without those cues what remains is neither as exotic nor as amusing as Pinafore, Pirates or The Mikado. [...] Still, The Sorcerer packs ample charms, including a felicitous score, a Verdian drinking song turned to teetotal ends, and at least one chorus that has reached the periphery of pop culture. ... the work can entrance a modern audience". However, Isaac Goldberg, one of the first Gilbert scholars, in 1913 called it [...] "the weakest of Gilbert's productions".|$|E
