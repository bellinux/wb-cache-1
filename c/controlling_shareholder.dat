Using a unique dataset of 654 French listed firms spanning 1998 – 2007, this study provides evidence that stock price synchronicity increases with excess control, supporting the argument that <b>controlling</b> <b>shareholders</b> tend to disclose less firm-specific information to conceal opportunistic practices. Additionally, this study shows that firms with substantial excess control {{are more likely to}} experience stock price crashes, consistent with the conjecture that <b>controlling</b> <b>shareholders</b> are more likely to hoard bad information when their control rights exceed their cash flow rights. Another important finding is that firms’ stock prices are less synchronous and less likely to crash when <b>controlling</b> <b>shareholders</b> own a large fraction of cash flow rights. This is consistent with the argument that <b>controlling</b> <b>shareholders</b> have less incentive to adopt poor disclosure policies and to accumulate bad news, since high cash flow ownership aligns their interests with those of minority investors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} excess control rights on the leverage decisions made by Chinese non-SOEs {{before and after the}} Non-tradable share reform (NTS reform).

We also find that excess leverage in firms with excess control rights decreases and the market reaction to announcements of related party transactions are more positive after NTS reform. This confirms that tunneling by the <b>controlling</b> <b>shareholders</b> actually reduced. We argue that in emerging markets where legal protection for creditors and <b>shareholders</b> is weak, <b>controlling</b> <b>shareholders</b> borrow excess debt to tunnel through inter-corporate loans and related party transactions. Furthermore the privatization of these economies can reduce the <b>controlling</b> <b>shareholders</b> 2 ̆ 7 tunneling activities and associated excess leverage which destroys firm value...|$|R
