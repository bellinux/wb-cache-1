40|$|The present {{thesis is}} based upon two papers {{concerning}} the core-valence double onization of molecular oxygen and mutual neutralization of H+ and H- ions at low collision energies. The former of these processes has been studied {{for the first time}} using a magnetic bottle time-of-ight electron coincidence spectrometer in combination with ab initio electronic structure calculations. The core-valence photoelectron spectra have been interpreted by comparing with the calculated double ionization energies, as well as the conventional valence band spectrum. Based on this comparison, some general features of the process are discussed and assignments for several of the dicationic states proposed. The latter process has been studied by means of a molecular close coupling approach in which both the nuclei and the electrons have been treated at a quantum mechanical level of theory. Accurate ab initio potential energy curves and non-adiabatic couplings have been used to calculate the <b>neutralization</b> <b>cross</b> section in the collision energy region 0. 001 to 100 eV.

40|$|AbstractPorter {{has shown}} that excited neutrals of {{specified}} internal energies can be prepared by neutralization of an ion beam with metal vapors of low ionization potential (IP). For specific problems in neutralization-reionization mass spectrometry, a metal with the desired IP value may not be available, or it may present experimental problems such as a high vaporization temperature, instrument contamination, or detector instability. The use of organic neutralization agents such as tetra-p-anisylethylene (IP = 6. 0 eV) can minimize these problems (although <b>cross</b> sections for <b>neutralization</b> with these are a factor of 5 lower than those with metals), and can provide a much wider range of IP values.

Robust gene amplification techniques have now uncovered several genetically distinct hantaviruses from shrews in widely separated geographic regions. Here, we report the characterization of a newly identified hantavirus, designated Imjin virus (MJNV), isolated from the lung tissues of Ussuri white-toothed shrews of the species Crocidura lasiura (order Soricomorpha, family Soricidae, subfamily Crocidurinae) captured near the demilitarized zone in the Republic of Korea during 2004 and 2005. Seasonal trapping revealed the highest prevalence of MJNV infection during the autumn, with evidence of infected shrews' clustering in distinct foci. Also, marked male predominance among anti-MJNV immunoglobulin G antibody-positive Ussuri shrews was found, whereas the male-to-female ratio among seronegative Ussuri shrews was near 1.

40|$|The {{neutralization}} of the laryngeal {{features of}} a consonant that is not directly followed by a vowel is a common process <b>cross</b> -linguistically. Laryngeal <b>neutralization</b> in this position has a clear phonetic cause: laryngeal features are not salient unless they are immediately followed by a vowel. Since laryngeal neutralization has a phonetic cause, {{it seems reasonable to}} characterize it directly in phonetic terms, without positing any additional layer of phonological abstraction. However, a phonetic explanation is not sufficient to account for all cases of laryngeal neutralization. For example, in Korean, laryngeal neutralization occurs in a nonneutralizing phonetic environment; in Nisgha, laryngeal neutralization occurs only in the reduplicant, although the phonetic environment for neutralization is found in both the reduplicant and the base. Although phonetics is the major factor leading to the development of these types of restrictions on laryngeal features, I argue that a phonetic account is not adequate for all such restrictions. Abstract phonological constraints and representations are necessary. Hence, two types of neutralization are possible: (i) phonetic neutralization, which results directly from the lack of saliency of cues and occurs in every instance of the neutralizing environment; and (ii) abstract phonological neutralization, which may occur where the neutralizing environment is absent (as will be demonstrated for Korean), and may fail to occur in every instance of the neutralizing environment (as will be demonstrated for Nisgha) ...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} a century {{physicists}} have been trying to understand the striking particularities of the atomic nucleus. Although several questions remain open for stable nuclei, our current interest for exploring the properties of exotic species has revealed new and unexpected aspects of nuclear structure. The study of nuclei at extreme conditions is not only relevant for nuclear physics, it can also provide answers to questions related to astrophysical processes such as the origin of elements in the universe and the limits of existence for nuclear matter. Besides the complexity of the nuclear many-body problem, nuclear structure properties exhibit regular patterns at the so called “magic” numbers of nucleons. The understanding of these apparently simple structures has motivated the development {{of some of the most}} elegant models of nuclear physics. Up to now, most of these models have been successfully applied to describe the properties of nuclei in specific regions of the nuclear chart. Even though some models might have a wide range of applicability, they can describe only part of the experimental data available, and generally fail to predict new observations for isotopes far away from stability. Understanding the properties of the atomic nucleus implies not only a reliable description of the nuclear force but also requires a proper treatment of the many-body problem. During the last few years, considerable progress has been made in both directions. Chiral effective field theory (ch-EFT) has allowed a systematic description of nuclear forces in terms of low-energy degrees of freedom, nucleons and pions, based on the symmetries of the underlying theory, quantum chromodynamics. It allows to explain naturally the hierarchy of manybody forces, and provides a consistent treatment of theoretical uncertainties. Thanks to the advances in ch-EFT, and the development of powerful manybody methods, nuclear physics has made important steps in the construction of an “effective theory of the atomic nucleus”. Ab-initio calculations are now available for medium and heavy nuclei, providing an accurate description of experimental properties of doubly- and semi-magic nuclei. Here, the importance of our experimental knowledge of “magic” nuclei to test the contemporary nuclear theories. Having two doubly-magic isotopes, 40 Ca and 48 Ca, the calcium isotopes are considered as a prime benchmark for nuclear structure, both from a theoretical and an experimental perspective. A renewed interest has been given to the neutron rich Ca isotopes, as their properties have revealed new aspects of the nuclear forces and many-body physics. Additionally, evidence of doubly-magic features in two new short-lived Ca isotopes has been recently reported in two exotic isotopes, 52 Ca and 54 Ca. By using high-resolution bunched-beam collinear laser spectroscopy (COLLAPS) at ISOLDE, CERN, this work presents the first measurements of the ground-state magnetic moments of 49, 51 Ca, the quadrupole moments of 47, 49, 51 Ca, and the root-mean square charge radii of 49, 51, 52 Ca. Additionally, the 51 Ca ground-state spin I = 3 / 2 was determined in a model-independent way. Ground state electromagnetic moments are compared with state-of-the-art shell-model calculations using both phenomenological interactions and microscopic interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The results for neutron-rich isotopes are in excellent agreement with predictions of interactions derived from chiral effective field theory including three-nucleon forces, while lighter isotopes illustrate the presence of particle-hole excitations of the 40 Ca core in their ground state. Our measurements of charge radii are complemented by state-of-the-art density functional theory and ab-initio calculations. Ab-initio calculations can accurately reproduce the charge radii of 40, 48 Ca, but fail to predict the large increase observed beyond N = 28. This discrepancy between our unexpected experimental results and the different and theoretical predictions defy the doubly-magic character of 52 Ca. This opens up new and intriguing question in our understanding of the atomic nucleus and the evolution of nuclear sizes for neutron-rich systems. Our findings highlight the importance of extending these experiments further away from stability, especially for the suggested doubly-magic 54 Ca nucleus. With a production yield of ∼ 300 ions/s, the 52 Ca (N = 32) isotope is at the limit of the optical-detection techniques. In order to extend the measurements up to 53 Ca (< 100 ions/s) and 54 Ca (< 10 ions/s), substantial modifications to the COLLAPS beam line were developed to implement a sensitive particle detection scheme. Ions initially in the ground state can be efficiently transferred to a metastable state by using multi-step optical pumping. The difference in <b>neutralization</b> <b>cross</b> section between the metastable and ground state is used to separate atoms and non-neutralized ions after passing the ion beam through a vapor cell. Finally, independent counting of atoms/ions (free of beam contaminants) by detecting the -radiation of the decaying isotope. Therefore, the resonant signal on the laser-ion interaction is translated into a resonant signal on the detection.

40|$|Orbit {{precession}} {{returned the}} SERT II spacecraft to continuous sunlight in January 1979 {{for the first}} time since early 1972, and new experiments were planned and conducted. Neutralization of an ion beam was accomplished by a second neutralizer cathode located 1 meter away. Plasma potential measurements were made of the plasma surrounding the ion beam and connecting the beam to the second neutralizer. When the density of the connecting plasma was increased by turning on the main discharge of a neighboring ion thruster, the neutralization of the ion beam occurred with improved (lower) coupling voltage. These and other tests reported should aid in the future design of spacecraft using electric thruster systems. Data taken indicate that <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> of ion thrusters in a multiple thruster array should occur readily...|$|E

The virus continues to bring significant economic losses to swine industry, {{and is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important swine pathogens. Vaccination has been utilized to aid or facilitate PRRS control. Among various types of vaccines used, attenuated live virus vaccines appear to be more efficacious than killed virus vaccines. However, the effect of vaccination with attenuated live virus vaccines is crippled by several safety and efficacy issues. First, the vaccine development process is time-consuming. Second, the vaccine has the potential to revert to virulent. Third, the vaccine tends to provide full protection only to homologous strains. Three independent studies were conducted to address these issues and provide a concept for future vaccine development. The first study was based on a previous in vitro work in our laboratory which demonstrated that chimeric viruses containing mixed structural genes from two genetically and antigenically distinct strains (VR 2332 and JA 142) of PRRSV in an organized manner were susceptible to antisera generated against both of the donor strains. In the present study, three chimeric viruses (JAP 5, JAP 56 and JAP 2 - 6) were constructed by replacing ORF 5, ORFs 5 and 6, and ORFs 2 - 6 of VR 2332 with the corresponding gene(s) of JA 142 respectively and were evaluated in vivo for their ability to confer pigs the cross protection against the VR 2332 and JA 142 strains. A total of 114 pigs were divided into 6 groups and each group was intramuscularly inoculated with one of the three chimeric viruses (n= 16 per group), VR 2332 (n= 24), JA 142 (n= 24), or sham inoculums (n= 18). At 44 days post inoculation (dpi), these pigs were divided further into 15 groups (n= 6 or 8 pigs per group) and challenged intranasally with VR 2332, JA 142, or sham inoculum. Although no pigs demonstrated severe clinical signs or lesions after the 2 nd inoculation, all pigs inoculated with chimeric viruses prior to challenge had significantly (p The second study utilized the same concept of the first study but was expanded to assess if use of chimeric viruses can be universally applicable to obtaining broader cross protection among PRRS viruses. To evaluate the strategy of chimeric virus, this study selected four distinct wild-type 1648 - 02, 17198 - 6, MN 184 and SDSU 73 strains of PRRSV whose nucleotide identities range from 86. 7 % to 92. 2 % and generated 12 chimeric viruses by mixing their ORFs 3 - 4 or ORFs 5 - 6. Their susceptibilities to the neutralizing activity of hyperimmune serum generated against each one of the four wild-type strains were assessed in vitro by fluorescent foci neutralization (FFN) assay. No or minimum level of <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> existed among the four wild-type strains, and not all chimeric viruses obtained broader <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization.</b> Broader <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> could be obtained when chimeric viruses were constructed in an organized manner depending on the immunobiological importance of ORFs 3 - 4 and ORFs 5 - 6 products of each strain. The neutralization of MN 184 and SDSU 73 were mainly mediated by ORFs 5 - 6 products, while ORFs 3 - 4 products played very limited roles in virus neutralization. Products from ORFs 5 - 6 and ORFs 3 - 4 of 1648 - 02 were all implicated in virus neutralization, but ORFs 5 - 6 products were more important (p The third study focused on assessing whether non-structural proteins play a role in the <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> between viruses. In this study, eight different patterns of structural gene mixing between JA 142 and VR 2332 were constructed into three cDNA infectious clone backbones. Chimeric viruses were then tested for their susceptibilities to JA 142 and VR 2332 antisera. No matter which backbone was used to construct the chimeric viruses, chimeric viruses carrying the same structural genes showed almost the same degree of susceptibility to the JA 142 and VR 2332 antisera, suggesting non-structural gene of the backbone has limited impact on the specificity of viral immunity. On the other hand, chimeric viruses with different gene mixing patterns displayed significant diversity in their susceptibilities to the JA 142 and VR 2332 antisera. <b>Cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> testing demonstrated that determinants for VR 2332 neutralization were located in ORF 3 or ORF 4 whereas determinants for JA 142 neutralization were located in ORF 6. ORFs 2 and 7 products of JA 142 displayed conflicting roles in virus neutralization. Their impacts remain to be further studied. In conclusion, chimeric virus strategy may be a way to induce broader cross-neutralizing antibody leading to better cross-protective humoral immunity against heterologous PRRSVs in pigs. As the nonstructural genes of backbone did not affect the specificity and sensitivity of virus neutralization, chimeric viruses containing avirulent non-structural genes of the backbone (i. e., infectious clone) and well-organized structural genes of PRRSV may be used to obtain the improved efficacy and safety of vaccination when a live virus based vaccine is used...|$|E

It was identified immunologically and morphologically as identical with the "Peste des Petits Ruminants" virus. There were cross reactions between stomatitis pneumoenteritis complex virus isolate and rinderpest virus by immunodiffusion and complement fixation tests but no <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization.</b> Goats recovered from stomatitis pneumoenteritis complex were protected against a challenge with rinderpest virus that was lethal to control goats.

40|$|Blue eye disease, {{caused by}} a porcine rubulavirus (PoRV), is an {{emergent}} viral swine disease that has been endemic in Mexico since 1980. Atypical outbreaks were detected in 1990 and 2003. Growing and adult pigs presented neurological signs, mild neurological signs were observed in piglets, and severe reproductive problems were observed in adults. Amino acid sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein revealed genetically different lineages. We used cross-neutralization assays, with homologous and heterologous antisera, to determine the antigenic relatedness values for the PoRV isolates. We found antigenic changes among several strains and identified a highly divergent one, making up a new serogroup. It seems that genetically and antigenically different PoRV strains are circulating simultaneously in the swine population in the geographical region studied. The <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> {{studies suggest that the}} HN is not the only antigenic determinant participating in the antigenic changes among the different PoRV strains...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-A gross Iymphoproliferative lesion {{similar to}} that of Marek's disease (MD) was {{observed}} in the peripheral nerves of chickens inoculated with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). Induction of these nerve lesions by REV stocks from 4 different sources and substantial <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> between neurotropic and viscerotropic REV stocks were evidence that the lesions were speciAc for REV. Nerve lesions induced by REV were char-acterized by abundant plasma cells, but they could not always be differen-tiated from lesions of MD. However, the absence of contact spread and the high susceptibility of line 6 chickens were some obvious characteristics distinguishing the REV-induced syndrome from that of MD. No antibody against REV was detected in 5 commercial Rocks of chickens with extensive MD losses, and evidence was lacking that REV infection was of economic importance. However, adventitious contamination with REV could be a potential hazard in the conduct of experiments on MD. -J Nat Cance...|$|E

Its properties were compared with a control line passaged {{in the absence of}} antiserum. When measured in terms of the ratio of infectivity for suckling hamsters to infectivity for rabbits (both inoculated intracerebrally), the control line of virus showed a greater increase in infectivity for suckling hamsters than did the antibody selected line. The latter, dose for dose, killed suckling hamsters more quickly. Whereas the parent and control lines produced several kinds of cytopathic effect in cell cultures, the antibody selected line induced predominantly the formation of syncytia. <b>Cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> tests with antisera against various herpes viruses revealed that the antibody selected line differed antigenically from the control line.

Several isolates which consistently produced levels ≥ 2 µg/ml were identified. In <b>cross</b> <b>neutralization</b> tests using post-vaccinal sera, SAT- 1 and SAT- 2 isolates showed considerable diversity and none of the viruses tested would be expected to produce a broad-spectrum response if incorporated into a vaccine. On the other hand, when 2 of the SAT- 2 isolates were incorporated into the same vaccine a distinctly broader response resulted.
