In 1952, she juggled motherhood and classes at the University of Texas. Early in 1952, Paul was called to the United States Army Reserve for the Korean War. While he served in the army, she spent a year at Camp Gordon, Georgia. Her life became easier with Paul's army allotment. <b>Coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Korean War in 1954, he took a job with a small newspaper in East Los Angeles, California, and lived in a small apartment in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, with Jayne and her pets— a Great Dane, three cats named Sabina, Romulus, and Ophelia, two chihuahuas, a poodle dyed pink, and a rabbit. While in California, she left Jayne Marie with her maternal grandparents and spent the summer semester at UCLA.|$|E

The planned expedition involved several elements, including overtaking Spanish treasure ships <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Americas loaded with gold and silver, and then assaulting Spanish towns, {{with the intention}} of causing stress within Spain's economy and weakening the Spanish supply chain and resources in regards to the Electorate of the Palatinate.|$|E

Benning. These range from Wesley woods to Leesburg to Brittney and Willowbrook and the high end Sears woods and Windsor park. Large tracts of blighted areas were cleaned up. A modern Columbus Consolidated Government Center was constructed in the city center. A significant period of urban renewal and revitalization followed {{in the mid to}} late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Christie {{was born}} into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon. She served in a Devon {{hospital}} during the First World War, tending to troops <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trenches, before marrying and starting a family in London. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six rejections, but this changed when The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring Hercule Poirot, was published in 1920. During the Second World War she worked as a pharmacy assistant at University College Hospital, London, during the Blitz and acquired a good knowledge of poisons which featured in many of her novels.|$|E
25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, {{meaning that the}} detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cavity. This is achieved {{by the use of}} a device known as the circulator which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.|$|E

25|$|On early 1604, 27-year-old Spanish officer Antonio de Oquendo was {{appointed}} commander of a two-galleon flotilla based at Lisbon by his superior, Luis Fajardo, Captain General of the Spanish Ocean Fleet.

The goal of Oquendo’s small unit was to fight the Dutch, English and Moroccan privateers which threatened the shipping lanes along the western Atlantic coast of Spain and Portugal. The squadron was made of the flagship Delfín de Escocia and the slightly smaller Dobladilla.|$|E
25|$|Georgia next faced a tough test in Brigham Young {{at home on}} September 9. Walker, <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> thumb injury, rushed 31 {{times for}} 124 yards against the Cougars. BYU's Steve Young {{connected}} with Scott Collie on a 21-yard touchdown pass in the 3rd quarter to give Brigham Young a 14–7 lead going into the final period. However, Walker rallied the Bulldogs as he led them on two scoring drives that gave Georgia the win, 17–14. He scored on a 1-yard touchdown run late to tie the game. Later still, Walker converted on a huge 4th-and-1 that enabled Georgia kicker Kevin Butler to make a 44-yard field goal in the game's closing seconds. Walker's game-winning drive of 40 yards to set up Butler's kick covered three minutes in all, and was keyed by his 23-yard breakaway run.|$|E

The [...] "dildo" [...] jokes were removed from the pilot as well as two scenes in which Kyle kicks his baby brother, Ike. After complaints from viewers, the series was moved to midnight on October 17, 1997 and the deleted material was restored. Almost a year after its original air date, the episode was broadcast {{for the first time}} in Britain (outside of satellite television) on July 10, 1998 on Channel 4. A station representative said [...] "It's for the audience <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pub with a curry." ...|$|E
500|$|Spirits of dead Elves {{go to the}} Halls of Mandos in Valinor. After {{a certain}} period of time and rest that serves as [...] "cleansing", their spirits are clothed in bodies {{identical}} to their old ones. However, they almost never go back to Middle-earth and remain in Valinor instead. An exception was Glorfindel in The Lord of the Rings; as shown in later books, Tolkien decided he was a [...] "reborn" [...] hero from The Silmarillion rather than an individual with the same name. A rare and more unusual example of an Elf <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Halls of Mandos is found in the tale of Beren and Lúthien, as Lúthien was the other Elf to be sent back to Middle-earth – as a mortal, however. Tolkien's Elvish words for [...] "spirit" [...] and [...] "body" [...] were fëa (plural fëar) and hröa (plural hröar) respectively.|$|E

Julianna has Clive ditch his wife and meet her at their hotel. At the bar, Claire gives Phil the key to her room. While watching Claire walk way, Phil takes the wrong room key belonging to an older woman who was arranging her purse. He enters the wrong room, sprinkles rose petals on the bed, undresses, and waits on the bed with a bottle of champagne. The older woman then walks in after <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bar. Back at the house, Phil and Claire decide to just act like themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Ingraham often {{calls the}} show [...] "Reality Radio", {{and this is}} {{evidenced}} by her and her producer's constant jokes and bloopers and Ingraham's occasional lateness on the show.

500|$|In Shakespeare's day, much of {{the world}} was still being colonized by European merchants and settlers, and stories were <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Americas, with myths about the Cannibals of the Caribbean, faraway Edens, and distant {{tropical}} Utopias. With the character Caliban (whose name is almost an anagram of Cannibal and also resembles [...] "Cariban", the term then used for natives in the West Indies), Shakespeare may be offering an in-depth discussion into the morality of colonialism. Different views of this are found in the play, with examples including Gonzalo's Utopia, Prospero's enslavement of Caliban, and Caliban's subsequent resentment. Caliban is also shown {{as one of the most}} natural characters in the play, being very much in touch with the natural world (and modern audiences have come to view him as far nobler than his two Old World friends, Stephano and Trinculo, although the original intent of the author may have been different). There is evidence that Shakespeare drew on Montaigne's essay Of Cannibals—which discusses the values of societies insulated from European influences—while writing The Tempest.|$|E

2500|$|These circumstances, which {{applied to}} the enemy as well, don't explain the Castilian behaviour: the chronicles of both sides show that the Prince's battle kept {{increasing}} (making a [...] "gross battle"), because towards it moved many defeated and fugitives from the Royal Battle and also the Prince's men <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> enemy's chase, and even contingents of soldiers from [...] Toro, which crossed the battlefield to reinforce the Prince. Thus, if all these men could reach the Prince, the Castilians could do it too, especially because the two battles (the Portuguese and the Castilian) were so proximal that the men could listen to each other: [...] "(...) being so {{close to each other}} [...] that they could hear what they talked about (...)"
