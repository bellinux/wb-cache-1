2500|$|As of 2004, the {{marketing}} mascots are a care-free Jamaican <b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick</b> named CinnaMon and an accident-prone apple named Bad Apple. Labeled as Apple Jacks Adventures in print advertising, the commercials focus on CinnaMon upstaging Bad Apple by reaching {{a bowl of}} Apple Jacks before he can, {{in spite of the}} apple's attempts to stop him. Bad Apple's antagonistic nature was latter dropped; Apple and CinnaMon were then portrayed as highly competitive friends, both getting into the bowl. The campaign was slated to be retired in 2007, and replaced by a retread of the 1990s campaign focused on children, but fan response to Apple and CinnaMon helped them remain as the mascots. [...] In 2007, Apple and Cinnamon were fused together with Cinnamon sticking through the center of Apple with both of their legs at the bottom of their body. [...] They remained this way for a few of the commercials until they became unstuck by a special machine. In 2009, Apple and Cinnamon were transported out of their cartoon world to the real world of New York City, where they continue to race each other to the bowl where they would enter the bowl at the same time. In 2010 Kellogg planned to have Apple and Cinnamon race across the country to see who would enter the bowl first, but the production team saw no real need to change their New York City commercial.|$|E

5000|$|Melktert, Afrikaans for [...] "milk tart", is a South African dessert {{consisting}} of a sweet pastry crust containing a creamy filling made from milk, flour, sugar and eggs. The ratio of milk to egg is higher than in a traditional Portuguese custard tart (Pastéis de nata) or Chinese egg tart (dan ta), in which both {{was influenced by the}} Portuguese, resulting in a lighter texture and a stronger milk flavour. Some recipes require the custard to be baked in the crust, and others call for the custard to be prepared in advance, and then placed in the crust before serving. Cinnamon is often sprinkled over its surface. The milk used for the custard can also be infused with a <b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick</b> before preparation.|$|E

40|$|Cinnamomum burmannii Blume (<b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick)</b> from Indonesia is a little-investigated spice. In this study, the {{antibacterial}} activity, minimum {{inhibitory concentration}} (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick</b> extract were evaluated against five common foodborne pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella anatum). <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>stick</b> extract exhibited significant antibacterial properties. Major compounds in <b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick</b> were tentatively identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography (LC-MS) as a predominant volatile oil component ((E) -cinnamaldehyde) and several polyphenols (mainly proanthocyanidins and (epi) catechins). Both (E) -cinnamaldehyde and proanthocyanidins significantly contributed to the antibacterial properties. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe morphological changes of bacteria treated with the crude extract of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick</b> and its major components. This study suggests that <b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick</b> and its bioactive components have potential for application as natural food preservatives. © 2007 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the antibacterial efficiency of five spice and herb extracts (<b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick,</b> oregano, clove, pomegranate peel, and grape seed) against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enterica in cheese at room temperature (∼ 23 °C). The lipid oxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) of cheese was periodically tested by oxidative analyses. The results showed that all five plant extracts were effective against three foodborne pathogens in cheese. Treatments with these extracts increased the stability of cheese against lipid oxidation. Clove showed the highest antibacterial and antioxidant activity. The reduction of foodborne pathogen numbers and the inhibition of lipid oxidation in cheese indicated that the extracts of these plants (especially clove) have potential as natural food preservatives.

50|$|The basic {{ingredients}} carry a rich symbolism to the Passion of Christ, and {{the dish}} {{is considered by}} many Mexican and Mexican-American families as a reminder of the suffering of Christ on Good Friday.

The cachaça is added and boiled for another 5 minutes.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to find natural spice and herb {{extracts}} with antibacterial and antioxidant capacities that could be potentially used as natural preservatives in raw pork. RESULTS: The inhibitory effects of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>stick,</b> oregano, clove, pomegranate peel and grape seed extracts on Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica were evaluated in raw pork at room temperature (~ 20 °C). The influences of these extracts on lipid oxidation in the meat were also investigated. The pH, colour parameters and TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) values were tested periodically. The results showed that all five natural extracts, especially clove, were effective against the bacteria. During storage the colour parameters of the extract-treated pork samples changed slightly, in comparison with significant changes in the control. Treatments with these extracts increased the stability of raw pork against lipid oxidation. Clove was the most effective for retarding lipid oxidation and presented the highest antioxidant activity in raw pork. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the tested extracts, especially clove, have potential as natural preservatives to reduce numbers of pathogenic bacteria, colour degradation and lipid oxidation in raw pork. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cinnamon</b> <b>stick</b> {{is world}} {{widely used in}} cooking, {{traditional}} medicine, perfumery and aesthetic industries. Many studies have demonstrated the potential of cinnamon extracts in diabetes treatment. Although {{it has been reported}} as safe in general cooking recipe and categorized as GRAS by USDA, sub-acute toxicity procedure was conducted in this study to determine effect of cinnamon extract on histopathological changes as well as the haematological parameters of blood. Water extraction was done for dried cinnamon. Twenty-four female Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study. The oral route was selected because it is the most likely route of human exposure through the consumption of herbs. The concentrations studied were 0. 1, 0. 5 and 2. 0 g/kg cinnamon aqueous extract (CE). There were no statistically significant effects of all concentrations of CE on behaviour, mortality, water intake, food consumption, weight gain, internal organs weight (liver and kidney) and heamatological parameters during treatment and post-treatment periods except 1) the slight decrease in kidney and liver weight of rats treated with 0. 5 g/kg and 2) slight decrease in liver weight of rats treated with 2. 0 g/kg, during post-treatment period. Hence, these toxicity studies suggest that the CE is low to moderate in toxicity and CE below 0. 5 g/kg dose level is safe {{to be used in the}} efficacy study especially for diabetes treatment...|$|E
50|$|In Puerto Rico, horchata {{is called}} horchata de ajonjolí and made with ground sesame seeds.
