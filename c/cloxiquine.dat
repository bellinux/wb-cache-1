The supramolecular synthon pattern of O-H***N hydrogen bonds linking dimers and π-π stacking interactions were described within the QTAIM (quantum theory of atoms in molecules) /DFT (density functional theory) formalism. Both proton {{donor and acceptor}} sites in O-H***N bonds were characterized using H-O and H-N NQDR spectroscopies and QTAIM. The possibility {{of the existence of}} O-H***H-O dihydrogen bonds was excluded. The weak intermolecular interactions in the crystals of clioquinol and <b>cloxiquine</b> were detected and examined. The results obtained in this work suggest that considerable differences in the NQR parameters for the planar and twisted supramolecular synthons permit differentiation between specific polymorphic forms, and indicate that the more planar supramolecular synthons are accompanied by a greater number of weaker hydrogen bonds linking them and stronger π***π stacking interactions...|$|E
