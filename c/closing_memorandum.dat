40|$|This report {{details the}} {{implementation}} {{and testing of}} a buoyancy engine for an underwater glider. The introduction of the report discusses underwater glider principles, and buoyancy engines. The following section presents the project design challenge, and the design constraints. An overall description of the vehicle {{and all of its}} major subsystems is presented. To commence testing fabrication had to be completed for the electronics section of the Buoyancy Engine. A mounting system was designed and fabricated for the electronic systems. To deal with power requirements a linear voltage regulator was designed. Then the standard assembly procedure is discussed. Section 4 describes software routines written to provide interfacing and control of all the subsystems. Some issues identified during programming are highlighted along with methods to correct them. Once all fabrication and programming was complete tests were run on individual subsystems, and finally in tank testing of the vehicle. The various testing procedures are detailed along with the results of the tests. Finally this <b>memorandum</b> <b>closes</b> with conclusions {{of the results of the}} project and recommendations for future work. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
5000|$|As with {{previous}} editions, several players {{qualified for the}} tournament with multiple teams, allowing them {{to play for the}} teams of their choosing. Should a player decline the option of playing for his [...] "home" [...] team, his chosen team must pay the [...] "home" [...] team a compensation fee of $150,000. Nine players were nominated in preliminary squad of more than one team and all of them chose to play for their Indian Premier League teams. As a result, teams lost players who helped them qualify for the tournament. Amongst these teams, Trinidad and Tobago were very determined to have Kieron Pollard, Dwayne Bravo and Sunil Narine represent them (their national team) instead of their IPL teams. The T&T government offered to match the higher match fees given by the IPL teams as compensation. In June, T&T sports minister Anil Roberts announced that the players wanted to play for T&T and were <b>close</b> to signing <b>memorandums</b> of understanding. All three players eventually chose to play for their IPL teams despite their efforts.|$|R
5000|$|Mustafa Reşid Pasha is {{credited}} with playing {{a leading role in}} the authorship of the decree that started the Tanzimat era. The Hatt-ı Şerif of Gülhane, known as the [...] "Edict of Gülhane" [...] or [...] "Rose Garden Edict", was read in the rose garden of the Topkapi Palace among foreign diplomats and the sultan Abdulmecid. The edict was the result of the combination of several powerful circumstances. First, after the death of Sultan Mahmud II in 1838, his son Abdulmecid rose to the throne with completely different ideals from his father; unlike his father, who focused on creating a stronger and more powerful throne, Abdulmecid wanted to enact liberal reforms to bring the Ottoman Empire along the lines of other European monarchies. Secondly, up to this point Mustafa Reşid Pasha had been well versed in Orthodox Islam due to his apostleship to Pertev Pasha. Third, Reşid Pasha and many of the other Porte officials had been well versed in European political thought and institutions due to their extended connections as current and former ambassadors. In fact, on 11 August 1839, while still in London serving as ambassador, Mustafa Reşid Pasha sent a confidential memorandum to then British ambassador Lord Palmerston with whom he had a <b>close</b> relationship. The <b>memorandum</b> was not an Ottoman document but only the personal views of Reşid Pasha. He told Lord Palmerston that reform within the Ottoman Sublime Porte was greatly needed and finally doable following the death of Mahmud II and the rise of the young Abdulmecid, who needed to be led in the right direction. Reşid Pasha also wrote that the protection and security of the people was mandatory if they were to accept the new reforms he wanted to institute, since their previous rejections were based on the fear of further prosecution by the corrupt Sublime Porte. Furthermore, he put forth that European support and cooperation was mandatory and essential for the preservation of the Ottoman state. All of these thoughts would later appear in the Rose Garden Edict only a few months later. His main goal was to ensure the power of the sultanate while at the same time establishing a strong central bureaucracy within the Sublime Porte to indefinitely postpone the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire.|$|R
