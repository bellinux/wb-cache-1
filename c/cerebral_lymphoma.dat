40|$|Seventy <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> from 37 men and 33 {{women were}} {{reviewed}} and reclassified using the modified Kiel classification. Fifty {{two of the}} patients were {{over the age of}} 50 years (age range 23 - 85 years). Only two patients were known to be immune deficient [...] one case of AIDS and one renal transplant recipient. Necropsies only were performed on 31 cases, biopsies only in 23 cases, and both biopsies and necropsies in 16 cases. Systemic tumour was found in 16 of 47 necropsy cases. All the tumours available for review were classic diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Where immunocytological studies were positive, the tumour cells were of B cell origin. None was of T cell origin, although reactive T cells in the tumours were frequently identified.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} Epstein-Barr virus genome in primary <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> occurring {{in the absence of}} immune suppression. METHODS: Forty eight consecutive patients with lymphomas restricted to the central nervous system were identified, all of whom had had neurosurgical biopsies performed at the National Hospitals for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London. Only five patients had some form of underlying immune deficiency; 43 were apparently normal. The tumours were studied with immunohistochemical markers and by in situ hybridisation, using a biotinylated probe to the internal repeat region of Epstein-Barr virus. RESULTS: All the lymphomas were B cell in origin. Tumours from the five immunosuppressed patients all showed hybridisation, as did two of the "spontaneous" tumours. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series of <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> so far probed for Epstein-Barr virus genome: as more are examined, it is suggested that a small proportion of the tumours from immunocompetent patients will also contain the virus...|$|R
50|$|Particular {{attention}} {{is given to}} the high incidence of <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> associated with adult CNH. Intracerebral B-cell lymphoma represents less than 1% of all primary malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Infiltration of lymphoma cells into the pons and medulla is the most frequently reported cause of CNH, accounting for half of all CNH-inducing brain tumors, despite its considerable rarity. It has been suggested that these lymphomas are capable of diffusely penetrating the midbrain, without significantly destructing the overall structures.|$|R

40|$|Primary non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} of {{the brain}} is rare, representing only 1 % of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), but its incidence has been increasing rapidly in south-east England since 1985.

This increase in <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is not adequately explained by improvements in the precision of diagnosis or by changes in disease coding or cancer registration practice. While there has also been a rapid increase in Kaposi sarcoma, neither immunosuppression acquired through HIV infection nor the overall trend in non-Hodgkin lymphoma can satisfactorily explain the recent increase in <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> which affects all ages and both sexes similarly.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A 10 -year-old female {{sea otter}} {{exhibited}} convulsions, arrhythmia, hyperthermia, forced breathing and anorexia and died after a week. Histopathological examination revealed neoplastic proliferation of small round cells with scant cytoplasm and round or oval nuclei distributed {{mainly in the}} thalamus. The proliferation of neoplastic cells was observed in the cerebral parenchyma and perivascular areas. The neoplastic cells were immunopositive for CD 3, but not CD 20. No neoplastic proliferation of T-cells was found in other organs.

40|$|Lymphomatosis cerebri (LC) {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} primary central nervous system {{lymphoma}} (PCNSL). Clinically, the disease typically presents with a rapidly progressive dementia and unsteadiness of gait. Its presentation on cerebral MRI, which is characterised by diffuse leukoencephalopathy without contrast enhancement, often causes diagnostic confusion 1 with suspected diagnoses ranging from Binswangerâ€™s disease to leukoencephalopathy or encephalomyelitis. Here we report a patient with subacute dementia and diffuse bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemispheres and additional involvement of the brainstem, basal ganglia and thalamus on MRI. Initially, she was considered to suffer from an autoimmune encephalitis, transiently responded to immunosuppression but then developed multiple solid appearing <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{nervous system}} is {{frequently}} affected {{in patients with}} the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition to opportunistic CNS infections and <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> approx. 20 % of the patients develop HIV-associated encephalopathies. Two major histopathological manifestations are observed. HIV leukoencephalopathy (progressive diffuse leukoencephalopathy) {{is characterized by a}} diffuse loss of myelin in the deep white matter of the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, with scattered multinucleated giant cells and microglia but scarce or absent inflammatory reaction. HIV encephalitis (multinucleated giant cell encephalitis) is associated with accumulations of multinucleated giant cells, inflammatory reaction and often focal necroses. In some patients, both patterns may overlap. In order to identify the HIV genome in the CNS, brain tissue from 27 patients was analyzed for the presence of HIV gag sequences using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and primers encoding a 109 base pair segment of the gag gene. Amplification of HIV gag succeeded in all 5 patients with clinical and histopathological evidence for HIV encephalopathy but was negative in the 20 AIDS patients with opportunistic bacterial, parasitic and/or viral infections or with <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> These results strongly suggest that the evolution of histopathologically recognizable HIV-encephalopathies closely correlates with the presence and/or tissue concentration of HIV. Since there were no cases with amplified HIV DNA in the absence of HIV-associated tissue lesions, we conclude that harboring and replication of HIV in the CNS rapidly causes corresponding clinical and morphological changes of HIV-associated encephalopathies. In two children with severe HIV encephalomyelitis, large amounts of HIV gag and env transcripts were detected in affected areas of the brain and spinal cord by in situ hybridization.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, Atuegwu et al. {{proposed}} {{a mathematical model}} based on ADCmean and ADCmin to calculation of cellularity. Our purpose was to compare the calculated cellularity according to the formula with the estimated cell count by histopathology in different tumors. METHODS: For this study, we re-analyzed our previous data regarding associations between ADC parameters and histopathological findings. Overall, 134 patients with different tumors were acquired for the analysis. For all tumors, the number of tumor cells was calculated according to Atuegwu et al. 2013. We performed a correlation analysis between the calculated and estimated cellularity. Thereby, Pearson's correlation coefficient was used and P <. 05 was taken to indicate statistical significance in all instances. RESULTS: The estimated and calculated cellularity correlated well together in HNSCC (rÂ =Â  0. 701, PÂ =Â . 016) and lymphomas (rÂ =Â  0. 661, PÂ =Â . 001), and moderately in rectal cancer (rÂ =Â  0. 510, PÂ =Â . 036). There were no statistically significant correlations between the estimated and calculated cellularity in uterine cervical cancer, meningiomas, and in thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION: The proposed formula for cellularity calculation does not apply for all tumors. It {{may be used for}} HNSCC, <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and rectal cancer, but not for uterine cervical cancer, meningioma, and thyroid cancer. Furthermore, its usefulness should be proved for other tumors...|$|R
40|$|We used a {{multiplex}} nested-PCR assay for {{the simultaneous}} detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of five human herpesviruses (HVs) (cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], varicella-zoster virus [VZV], {{herpes simplex virus}} [HSV], and human herpesvirus 6 [HHV- 6]) in a clinical evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients with neurological disorders. This method, which has the advantages of being rapid and economical, would be of particular interest for the diagnosis of neurological syndromes caused {{by more than one}} HV. We studied 251 CSF samples from 219 patients. HV DNA was demonstrated in 93 (37 %) of the CSF samples (34 % of the patients). CMV was the HV most frequently detected in our patients (25 %), while EBV, VZV, HSV, and HHV- 6 DNAs were present in significantly fewer cases (7, 4, 3, and 1 %, respectively). When results were compared with the final etiological diagnoses of the patients, the multiplex HV PCR showed high specificity for the diagnosis of CMV and VZV neurological diseases and for <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (0. 95, 0. 97, and 0. 99, respectively). The sensitivity of the assay was high for CMV disease (0. 87), was low for <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (0. 33), and was not evaluable for VZV disease due to the small number of patients with this diagnosis. Nevertheless, detection of VZV DNA had possible diagnostic value in four of the nine cases, and EBV DNA amplification always predicted the diagnosis of <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in patients with cerebral masses. Detection of HSV DNA was frequently associated with CMV amplification and fatal encephalitis. HHV- 6 was not considered to have a pathogenetic role in the three cases in which it was detected. This multiplex HV PCR assay is a specific and clinically useful method for the evaluation of HIV-infected patients with neurological disorders related to HV...|$|E

40|$|Chemotherapy {{has become}} a third major {{treatment}} option for patients with brain tumors, in addition to surgery and radiotherapy. The role of chemotherapy {{in the treatment of}} gliomas is no longer limited to recurrent disease. Temozolomide has become the standard of care in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Several ongoing trials seek to define the role of chemotherapy in the primary care of other gliomas. Some of these studies are no longer only based on histological diagnoses, but take into consideration molecular markers such as MGMT promoter methylation and loss of genetic material on chromosomal arms 1 p and 19 q. Outside such clinical trials chemotherapy is used in addition to radiotherapy, e. g., in anaplastic astrocytoma, medulloblastoma or germ cell tumors, or as an alternative to radiotherapy, e. g., in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors or low-grade gliomas. In contrast, there is no established role for chemotherapy in other tumors such as ependymomas, meningiomas or neurinomas. Primary <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> are probably the only brain tumors which can be cured by chemotherapy alone and only by chemotherapy. The chemotherapy of brain metastases follows the recommendations for the respective primary tumors. Further, strategies of combined radiochemotherapy using mainly temozolomide or topotecan are currently explored. Leptomeningeal metastases are treated by radiotherapy or systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy depending on their pattern of growth...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced T 2 *-weighted MR imaging {{has been}} helpful in characterizing {{intracranial}} mass lesions by providing information on vascularity. Tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDLs) can mimic intracranial neoplasms on conventional MR images, {{can be difficult}} to diagnose, and often result in surgical biopsy for suspected tumor. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether dynamic contrast-enhanced T 2 *-weighted MR imaging can be used to distinguish between TDLs and intracranial neoplasms that share common features on conventional MR images. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the conventional and dynamic contrast-enhanced T 2 *-weighted MR images and medical records of 10 patients with tumefactive demyelinating disease that was diagnosed by either biopsy or strong clinical suspicion supported by laboratory evaluation that included CSF analysis and evoked potential tests. Twelve TDLs in 10 patients and 11 brain tumors that appeared similar on conventional MR images were studied. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was calculated from dynamic MR data and was expressed as a ratio to contralateral normal white matter. rCBV values from 11 patients with intracranial neoplasms with very similar conventional MR imaging features were used for comparison. RESULTS: The rCBV values of TDLs ranged from 0. 22 to 1. 79 (n = 12), with a mean of 0. 88 +/- 0. 46 (SD). The rCBV values of intracranial neoplasms ranged from 1. 55 to 19. 20 (n = 11), with a mean of 6. 47 +/- 6. 52. The difference in rCBV values between the two groups was statistically significant (P =. 009). The difference in rCBV values between TDLs and primary <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (n = 4) was less pronounced but was statistically significant (P =. 005). CONCLUSION: Dynamic contrast-enhanced T 2 *-weighted MR imaging is a useful diagnostic tool in differentiating TDLs from intracranial neoplasms and may therefore obviate unnecessary surgical biopsy...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} results of {{supportive}} treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and antibiotic prophylaxis in combination with splenectomy in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of case records of 21 patients from March 1984 to February 1996. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia was cured in 14 of 15 patients who had splenectomy, but it recurred intermittently in three. Mean platelet volume (MPV) was normal transiently in some patients, but all MPV values were subnormal 8 - 23 months after splenectomy. Antibiotic and IVIG prophylaxis {{may have contributed to}} the lack of a detectable increase in the number of severe acute bacterial infections in the 451 months after splenectomy. Four patients died in 2205 months of observation before and after splenectomy (median 82, range 16 - 248) : two of <b>cerebral</b> B cell <b>lymphoma,</b> one of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, and one with severe chronic chest disease of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Adequate supportive treatment with IVIG and antibiotic prophylaxis together with splenectomy enables good survival and quality of life in the short and medium term in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Persistence of infection, bleeding, and vasculitic and allergic symptoms in a significant minority and the risk of development of lymphoma, however, suggest that bone marrow transplantation may be indicated if an HLA identical donor is available...|$|R
