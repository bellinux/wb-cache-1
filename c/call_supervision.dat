40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to get a better {{understanding}} of social workers experiences of supervisions impact on social work with children and families. The two research questions where: Which are social workers needs of supervision? And does social workers perceive supervision as a tool for professional development and learning? The study´s empirical findings were a result of semi-structured interviews with five social workers in the social service department. The study´s theoretical framework was based on two different theories: new institutionalism, which is a specialization within organizational theory, and system theory perspective. The result found that social workers experiences supervision as an opportunity for support and reflection, which encourages them to develop professional skills in their daily work. Supervision had an effect on social workers self-confidence and wellbeing by adding expertise, which gave more structure, energy and stress relief in their work. The interviews also showed that supervision had a direct impact on the interaction and the team climate within a working group. However, certain terms and conditions must have been considered to <b>call</b> <b>supervision</b> successful. The supervisors responsibility to lead, see the groups needs and have an over all perspective was mentioned as one condition for good supervision. Another term was that the group cooperated and showed professionalism and respect towards one another. It was very important that supervision took place in a safe environment and that all group members felt trust towards their colleagues and supervisor. This way they where able to learn from each others experiences and show vulnerability and emotions which could contribute to reflection and professional development. Furthermore, social workers emphasise supervision as positive and a necessary tool in order to achieve an efficient and well functioning workplace...|$|E

Generally binding ordinances of municipalities are legal regulations containing legal rules, that are creates by municipal council.

Thesis is divided into four chapters according to these phases of life of generally binding ordinances of the municipalities. The first chapter is called Passing of generally binding ordinances of the municipalities. This chapter describes complicated process of law creation in the form of municipal legal regulations, from preparing a proposal of a generally binding ordinance of municipality to its becoming effective. The second chapter, called Implemantation of generally binding ordinances of municipalities, deals with implementation of these municipal legal regulations and especially it is focused on sanction of infringement of generally binding ordinances.

40|$|BACKGROUND Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) is a {{classification}} method that enables local health staff to assess health programmes {{for which they}} are responsible. While LQAS has been favourably reviewed by the World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO), questions remain about whether using local health staff as data collectors can lead to biased data. METHODS In this test-retest research, Pallisa Health District in Uganda is subdivided into four administrative units <b>called</b> <b>supervision</b> areas (SA). Data collectors from each SA conducted an LQAS survey. A week later, the data collectors were swapped to a different SA, outside their area of responsibility, to repeat the LQAS survey with the same respondents. The two data sets were analysed for agreement using Cohens' kappa coefficient and disagreements were analysed. RESULTS Kappa values ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 97. On average, there was a moderate degree of agreement for knowledge indicators and a substantial level for practice indicators. Respondents were found to be systematically more knowledgeable on retest indicating bias favouring the retest, although no evidence of bias was found for practices indicators. CONCLUSIONS In this initial study, using local health care providers to collect data did not bias data collection. The bias observed in the knowledge indicators is most likely due to the 'practice effect', whereby respondents increased their knowledge as a result of completing the first survey, as no corresponding effect was seen in the practices indicators...|$|R
30|$|Besides bootstrapping, another {{promising}} weakly <b>supervisioned</b> approach, <b>called</b> distant <b>supervision,</b> {{has been}} applied for Relation Extraction. According to Mintz et al. [70], if two entities participate in a relation, any sentence that contains these entities also expresses this particular relation. Mintz et al., make use of features extracted from different sentences containing pairs of entities from the knowledge base Freebase [9] to build a rich vector of features. Such features are based in lexical information, syntactic and NER. In [58], the MultiR system for multi-instances learning is presented, which also uses a distant supervision approach from Freebase and applies to the proposed features in [70].|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{bidirectional}} recurrent {{neural network}} (BRNN) {{has been widely}} used for question answering (QA) tasks with promising performance.

60|$|In all {{the former}} {{part of the}} day the {{scholars}} are divided into classes, according to their proficiency in particular branches of study, and they resort to their recitations for instruction. They now are divided into six sections as we call them, and placed under the care of superintendents not for instruction, but for what may be <b>called</b> <b>supervision.</b> Teaching a pupil is not all that is necessary to be done for her in school. There are many other things, to be attended to--such as supplying her with the various articles necessary for her use,--seeing that her desk is convenient,--that her time is well arranged,--that she has not too much to do, nor too little,--and that no difficulty which can be removed, obstructs her progress in study, or her happiness in school. The last hour is appropriated to this purpose, with the understanding, however, that such a portion of it as is not wanted by the superintendent, is to be spent in study. You will see then, when the last hour arrives, that all the scholars go in various directions, to the meetings of their respective sections. Here they remain as long as the superintendent retains them. Sometimes they adjourn almost immediately; perhaps after having simply attended to the distribution of pens for the next day; at other times they remain during the hour, attending to such exercises as the superintendent may plan. The design, however, and nature of this whole arrangement, I shall explain more fully in another place.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on an {{approach}} to the automatic failure detection of reactive software systems <b>called</b> specification-based <b>supervision.</b> Assumed is that the software is specified in a formalism based on communicating extended finite state machines (CEFSMs). The major difficulty in supervising such systems is that the supervisor must account for all possible behaviors that are permissible under the non-determinism present in the specification. An approach to the automatic detection of failures based on the theory of beliefs is presented. This theory was developed to deal with the nondeterminisms present in CEFSM based formalisms. The specification language SDL, standardized by the International Telecommunication Union, is used as a concrete example. In the theory of beliefs, each behavioral alternative is represented as a separate belief of one or more specification CEFSMs. Beliefs are combined into consistent belief sets that represent legitimate external behaviors. A consist [...] ...|$|R
