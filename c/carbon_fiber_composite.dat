25|$|On 11 July 2005, Tesla and British {{sports car}} maker Lotus entered an {{agreement}} about {{products and services}} based on the Lotus Elise, where Lotus provided advice on designing and developing a vehicle as well as producing partly assembled vehicles, and amended in 2009, helped with basic chassis development. The Roadster has a parts overlap of roughly 6 percent with the Lotus Elise, a 2-inch longer wheelbase, and a slightly stiffer chassis according to Eberhard. Tesla's designers chose to construct the body panels using resin transfer molded <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> to minimize weight; this choice makes the Roadster {{one of the least}} expensive cars with an entirely carbon fiber skin.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} in {{darkness}} McLaren merged with Ron Dennis's Formula Two Project-4 team. The McLaren MP4/1 (McLaren Project-4) introduced the first <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> chassis in 1981, an innovation which, despite initial doubts over its likely performance in a crash, had been taken up by all the teams {{by the middle of}} the decade. The use of carbon fibre composite in place of aluminium honeycomb produced cars that were significantly lighter, yet also far stiffer which improved grip and therefore cornering speed. Significant skepticism regarding the use of carbon fiber chassis remained, but John Watson's 1981 crash in the MP4/1 showed that the new technology was sufficiently safe, with the violent accident leaving Watson unscathed, where similar previous incidents had resulted in death or serious injury.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} polyacrylonitrile-based hollow-porous and solid <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> were {{prepared}} by pyrolysis of polyacrylonitrile-based hollow-porous and solid fibers {{at the same}} condition. The microstructure, composition, surface electrical conductivity, electromagnetic parameters and reflectivity of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> were studied. The microwave absorbing properties of two kinds of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> as microwave absorbents were parallel investigated. Results show that the apparent density of the hollow-porous <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> is {{lower than that of}} the solid <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> due to their hollow-porous structure. The surface electrical conductivity of single solid <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> is nearly 10 times that of the hollow-porous <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber.</b> The- 10 dB bandwidths of solid <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> carbonized at 850 and 950 °C are both 0 GHz, while those of the corresponding hollow-porous <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> are up to 3. 05 and 2. 62 GHz, respectively. Results indicate that the microwave absorbing properties of the hollow-porous <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> are better than those of solid <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rigid, high {{surface area}} {{activated}} <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> {{have been produced}} with high permeabilities for environmental applications in gas and water purification. These novel monolithic adsorbents can be produced in single pieces to a given size and shape. The project involves a collaboration between the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Center for Applied Energy Research (CAER), University of Kentucky. The <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> are produced at the ORNL and activated at the CAER using different methods, with the aims of producing a uniform degree of activation, and of closely controlling pore structure and adsorptive properties. The main focus of the present work has been to find a satisfactory means to uniformly activate large samples of <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> and produce controlled pore structures. Several environmental applications have been explored for the activated <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites.</b> One of these was to evaluate the activated composites for the separation of CH{sub 4 }-CO{sub 2 } mixtures, and an apparatus was constructed specifically for this purpose.

40|$|The wear {{characteristics}} of PEEK <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> {{are not well}} understood in comparison to high strength materials in common use such as steel, aluminum, and <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> epoxy.

2500|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> is an {{increasingly}} popular non-metallic material commonly used for bicycle frames. Although expensive, it is light-weight, corrosion-resistant and strong, {{and can be}} formed into almost any shape desired. The result is a frame that can be fine-tuned for specific strength where it is needed (to withstand pedaling forces), while allowing flexibility in other frame sections (for comfort). Custom carbon fiber bicycle frames may even be designed with individual tubes that are strong in one direction (such as laterally), while compliant in another direction (such as vertically). [...] The ability to design an individual composite tube with properties that vary by orientation cannot be accomplished with any metal frame construction commonly in production. Some carbon fiber frames use cylindrical tubes that are joined with adhesives and lugs, in a method somewhat analogous to a lugged steel frame. [...] Another type of carbon fiber frames are manufactured in a single piece, called monocoque construction.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced <b>composites</b> is {{to a great}} extent dictated by the interfacial adhesion strength between the fibers and matrix. In order to improve the interfacial properties of carbon fiber/polypropylene (PP) composites, a new surface treatment has been developed to graft the amine-capped cross-linked polyphosphazenes (ACP) onto <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> as a novel coupling agent through in situ polycondensation between hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) and 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenyl ether (DDE) under mild reaction conditions, and maleic anhydride grafted PP (M-PP) was used as the matrix. The chemical composition of the modified <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> was verified by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The surface morphologies of the modified <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) between <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> and the matrix was investigated by a microbond test. The grafted ACP with a quantity of amine groups uniformly covered the <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> surfaces, which results in strong interfacial adhesion between the modified <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> and M-PP. The results of the test reveal a significant improvement of IFSS in the ACP grafted <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> with an increase of 223. 0 % compared to the unmodified <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites.</b> In this work, we propose a facile and effective method for improving the interfacial properties of <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> by grafting a novel coupling agent...|$|R

40|$|Earlier we have {{described}} the various uses of infrared line scanner based thermal nondestructive testing equipment [1]. Time constants of measurements made with these kind of equipment are very suitable for testing <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites.</b> Scanning a line heat source over a sample surface causes a nonuniform temperature distribution in the sample. In addition to the heat flow normal to the surface, lateral heat flow exists in the surface plane. In the case of <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> with a specific oriented structure, the surface temperature distributions depend on the direction where the line source moves. Generally, {{this is true of}} any sample having anisotropic thermal conductivity. In oriented <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> the bulk thermal conductivity can be considered anisotropic, because the heat transfer in the composite is different {{in the direction of the}} fibers compared to perpendicular directions [2, 3].
