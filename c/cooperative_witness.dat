50|$|The Zoran Đinđić {{trial in}} newly formed Special Court for the {{organized}} crime, lasted until 2007 and was dubbed by some media {{as the most}} important trial of Serbian Justice in a century (sudski proces veka). Four members of Zemun Clan received a special status of <b>cooperative</b> <b>witness.</b> In 2006, President of the Chamber in the trial, withdrew from the case, and the other Chamber member Nata Mesarović stepped in his place.|$|E
50|$|According to the 2004 {{testimony}} of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>witness</b> Dejan Milenković Bagzi (who was an important member of the Zemun Clan) in the Zoran Đinđić trial, in Serbian Special Court for Organised Crime: on 5 September 2002, Belgrade-based Rakovica Clan tried to eliminate the Montenegrin criminal Veselin Božović Vesko, but he survived the assassination and {{was transferred to the}} Clinical Centre of Serbia in which at that time worked Lončar. Allegedly, he had good chances to survive and his condition was stable. According to Milenković, head of the criminal group Dušan Spasojević who also had interest of Božović's death, asked one of his insider doctors Risović to finish him in the hospital, but he was having second thoughts. Later, allegedly, another Spasojević's insider doctor, Lončar confessed to Spasojević that he gave him lethal injection and Božović died shortly after, on 7 September 2002. For the reward, Spasojević gave him apartment in New Belgrade. Officially, ten days after Božović's death, Lončar bought the apartment from the wife of Zemun Clan hitman Sretko Kalinić for 30,000 euros only to re-sell it months later. Miladin Suvajdžić, another <b>cooperative</b> <b>witness</b> and former important member of the Zemun Clan, in his 2006 testimony confirmed the story of Milenković; one of the main roles of Suvajdžić was to buy properties, vehicles for various of reasons. At the time of testimonies, Lončar denied these allegations and was never prosecuted.|$|E

50|$|Knowles {{was one of}} 34 {{journalists and}} 26 New York Times {{employees}} subpoenaed by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in November 1955. The subpoenas were a result of journalist Winston Burdett's testimony in June 1955.

50|$|In September 2014, {{journalist}} Nikola Vrzić and Milan Veruović, personal bodyguard of Zoran Đinđić, who {{was also}} severely injured but survived, have published a book The Third Bullet (Treći metak). The name of the book comes from the claim that Đinđić was shot by the second sniper, unlike what the official version says. The authors claim that indictment (and later trial verdict) is not based not on the physical evidences nor eyewitness testimonies, but constructed on unsustainable expertise and carefully built network of confessions and testimonies of <b>cooperative</b> <b>witnesses.</b>|$|R
50|$|In May 1952, Odets {{was called}} before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA; more commonly, HUAC). He {{had belonged to}} the Communist Party {{for less than a}} year, between 1934 and 1935 and {{sponsored}} many left-wing, progressive groups. He cooperated with the Committee {{to the extent that he}} responded to their questions, and reiterated names of Communist Party members who had been previously cited by his friend and former Group colleague, Elia Kazan. Prior to Kazan's final testimony in April 1952, they agreed to name each other. Odets thereby avoided blacklisting, but reactions to his testimony confused him; he did not consider himself a <b>cooperative</b> <b>witness.</b> A partial transcript of Odets' testimony can be found in Eric Bentley's Thirty Years of Treason. Odets was reportedly tormented by public reaction to his testimony until his death in 1963. In his autobiography, Kazan recalls incidents of Odets being accosted in the street and snubbed in Hollywood restaurants after his HUAC appearance. Odets's productivity markedly improved after his 1952 testimony: he had written nothing for the screen in the six years prior to 1952, but in the decade after 1952, over 20 of his scripts reached either the large or small screen.|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{psychological}} aspects of accuracy and credibility of a statement. It emphasises the fact that each statement has to be assessed {{from the point of}} view of both of these perspectives. The study summarizes information regarding factors influencing the accuracy and completeness of a statement. It deals with the factors affecting memories of criminal events and their recall and verbalization in the course of an interview. The description of appropriate techniques of an interview with a <b>cooperative</b> <b>witness</b> includes the author's professional experience. The study than covers the issue of credibility of a statement, paying attention to the knowledge of features of truthful and untruthful statements. Finally it presents and analyses verbal and nonverbal criteria of statement credibility assessment...|$|E

The FBI hopes to use the drug dealers as <b>cooperative</b> <b>witnesses</b> to target the politicians. McNulty is enraged that they would consider letting Bell and Barksdale reduce their sentences. Daniels ends the meeting, saying they are moving in different directions. McNulty cannot restrain himself, accusing the FBI agents of ignoring the death of West Baltimore.|$|R
5000|$|Police use persuasive {{manipulation}} techniques when conducting interrogations {{in hopes}} of obtaining a confession. These can include lying about evidence, making suspects believe they are there to help them, or pretending to be the suspect's friends. After enough time and persuasion suspects are likely {{to conform to the}} investigators' demands for a confession, even if it was to a crime they did not commit. One of the most important findings in guilt manipulation research is that once guilt is induced in the subject, it can be directed into greater compliance with requests that are completely unrelated to the original source of guilt. This has important implications for police interrogation, because guilt induction is recommended in manuals on police interrogation. A 2010 study conducted by Fisher and Geiselman showed the lack of instruction given to entry-level police officers regarding the interview process. They stated in their research that, [...] "We were discouraged to find that police often receive only minimal, and sometimes no, formal training to interview <b>cooperative</b> <b>witnesses,</b> and, not surprisingly, their actual interview practices are quite poor." [...] While many officers may develop their own interview techniques, the lack of formal training could lead to interviewing with the purpose of simply completing the investigation, regardless of the truth. The easiest way to complete an investigation would be a confession. Fisher and Geiselman concur, saying, [...] "It seems to be more on interrogating suspects (to elicit confessions) rather than on interviewing <b>cooperative</b> <b>witnesses</b> and victims". This study suggests that more training could prevent false confessions, and give police a new mindset while in the interview room.|$|R

40|$|In Western European agriculture, an {{increasing}} number of conventional farmers are actively augmenting the autonomy of their farm enterprises. They do so, amongst others, through decreasing the external inputs, whilst simultaneously improving the use of internal resources. Thus, low external input farming systems emerge that increasingly enhance ecological processes. Simultaneously, the farmers involved may maintain key features of their entrepreneurial mode of farming. In this context, the network of French farm machinery <b>cooperatives</b> <b>witnesses</b> a movement of collective innovation experienced by farmer members to become more autonomous. The present paper aims at better understanding this phenomenon visible within some French farm machinery co-ops. Our methodology is based on an exploratory survey of 15 machinery co-ops and a range of six in-depth case studies among them. Our work combines a farming system and a sociological approach. Most of the studied farmers mainly seek to become more autonomous from markets, notably from input markets. A part of them also claim to gain autonomy from advisory services and regulatory institutions. The current price volatility context appears as one of several decisive factors, of many of the farmers interviewed to seek the means to become more autonomous. The collective organisation provided by the socio-technical network of farmers’ arrangements associated with their machinery co-op, has allowed them to benefit from favourable conditions under which to undertake the new practices. We conclude by suggesting some lessons from these experiences to strengthen local networks of farmers’ sharing arrangements as a conducive arena for agroecological transition...|$|R

40|$|Most investigative {{interviewing}} protocols, {{including the}} National Institute of Justice’s 1999 guidelines on collecting eyewitness evidence, recommend building rapport with <b>cooperative</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{to increase the}} quality and quantity of details obtained at recall. To date, only three published articles have empirically addressed the effects of rapport-building on adult witness memory, and all suggest an increase in witness accuracy under certain conditions. However, to our knowledge no research has addressed the importance of the investigator when building rapport and whether rapport can increase witness susceptibility to suggestive-leading questions – the aim of the current research. Specifically, this project examined the effects of change in interviewer between rapport and retrieval, and the effects of interviewer suggestion after rapport eyewitness memory accuracy. Participant witnesses (N= 198) viewed a videotaped mock convenience store robbery followed by rapport-building or a standard police interview about non-crime related details (rapport manipulation). One week later all participants were interviewed about the mock crime they witnessed either by the same or a different interviewer (interviewer manipulation). All witnesses were interviewed about the mock crime using open-ended questions about the event, witnesses, suspect, and location followed by a series of specific suggestive questions containing both correct- and incorrect-leading information about the crime. Videotaped and transcribed witness reports were scored for accurate and false information by two independent raters. Findings indicated that, contrary to all hypotheses, neither rapport-building on day 1 nor change in interviewer on day 2 (one week later) manipulations resulted in significant effects on the primary accuracy dependent measures on day 2, including open-ended and suggestive-leading questions. The present study was the first to investigate the effect of rapport-building on eyewitness recall after a delay, whether changing interviewers across the investigation impacts recall, and whether rapport can act as a safeguard by inoculating witnesses against investigator-provided misinformation. These null findings further suggest that future research should disentangle the specific conditions under which rapport-building facilitates witness recall need to be disentangled in future research...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss in}} detail our facile method for {{producing}} supramolecular polymeric nanoparticles from {{the collapse of}} single polymer chains. A new family of poly(methyl methacrylate) -based nanoparticles confirm that our method is general and can be easily tuned toward a variety of applications. Thorough AFM characterization elucidates the conditions required to visualize single particles as well as complex assemblies of particles mediated by the evaporation of solvent. AFM studies also indicate that the intramolecular collapse resembles the <b>cooperative</b> folding process <b>witnessed</b> in biomacromolecules and that the particles possess a complex morphology that implies the internal organization of the UPy dimers used to induce the intramolecular collapse.

40|$|Most {{real-world}} high-seas fisheries harbor {{more than}} one commercially valuable species of fish that may, or may not, be biologically interdependent. The access to the fish stocks in high-seas fisheries is open to everyone. Hence, these fisheries attract multiple coalitions to harvest the common fish stocks. Over the past century, {{this has led to}} the overexploitation of the stocks of several important marine species. As a result, the stocks have declined and profitability of fishing has decreased. This has aroused discussion on the benefits of cooperation between fishing nations and the challenges of designing multilaterally satisfying treaties. The overfishing problem has also attracted the attention of economists, who have studied the economically optimal exploitation of fisheries with single and multiple species, as well as the stability of coalition structures between fishing nations. However, a successful theoretical merger between multi-species models and cooperative coalition games has not yet been <b>witnessed.</b> <b>Cooperative</b> game models of fisheries usually focus on a limited number of coalitions exploiting a single stock, while multi-species models are predominantly confined to a monopoly setting. In this study, we pursue the possibility combining these two approaches into a single modeling framework {{that could be used to}} study the survival of biologically interdependent species under different coalition structures and the stability of coalition structures in multi-species fisheries. First we review economic literature on fisheries to establish the necessary building blocks of such a model. Next, we discuss the desirable characteristics of cooperative game models for multi-species fisheries, and propose that such models should be discrete-time games. Furthermore, we argue, that as the biological and economic settings in real-world fisheries differ, a single theoretical model cannot be used to provide general intuitive answers to the questions about a the survival of species and the stability of coalition structures. Instead, a general theoretical framework should be developed, and adjusted to each fishery separately. Unlike in the traditional fisheries models, when {{more than one}} coalition selectively harvest multiple species of biologically interdependent fish, unambiguous pure-strategy Nash equilibrium solutions seldom exist. Hence, in this setting, fishing coalitions cannot set there harvesting policy as a best response to their rivals actions. As a solution to this problem, we propose that coalitions set their harvesting policies based on expectations instead of perfect information about their rivals actions. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Police {{interviews}} {{have traditionally}} placed {{strong emphasis on}} interviewing suspects, and devote much less attention to interviewing victims and witnesses of crime, who may possess information critical to solving the crime. In the last two decades, cognitive interviewing has emerged {{from the field of}} psychology as a superior paradigm for interviewing victims and witnesses, enabling police interviewers {{to move away from the}} practice of indiscriminately using the same traditional interviewing techniques for suspects when interviewing <b>cooperative</b> victims and <b>witnesses,</b> who may be vulnerable, traumatised and subsequently unfit to be subjected to the same style of interviewing as suspects. This thesis examines the application of cognitive interviewing involving non-English speaking victims and witnesses to understand how the paradigm works (or otherwise) and to what extent it works when interlingual mediation by a language interpreter is employed. To date, there have been no known studies on whether this protocol retains the same level of efficacy confirmed in literature in monolingual settings mostly emanating from Anglophone countries. This study conducted a series of laboratory experiments using a pair of monolingual English cognitive interviews that incorporated features of cognitive interviewing, adopted into bilingual interviews across eight different languages (all paired with English). Through qualitative and descriptive statistical analysis of the data generated by eight participant interpreters, the researcher ascertained whether the interpreted versions of the interviews retained the same cognitive interviewing features and verbal strategies intended by the original English monolingual design, and how much the bilingual versions resembled or deviated from the monolingual version as a benchmark. Data analysis of this study established that the common ground between the interviewer&rsquo;s and interpreter&rsquo;s knowledge schema was low. Unless the interpreter had prior knowledge and understanding of the cognitive interviewing protocol through previous training or briefing by the police, some verbal strategies and features were changed or completely missing in the bilingual versions. Furthermore, the desired uninterrupted free-form narratives afforded by the interviewee as a result of the successful application of the protocol conflicted fundamentally with the cognitive requirements and linguistic operations of the interpreting process. The truncated version of the interviewee&rsquo;s narration due to the process of interpreting, therefore, presents risks to disrupt the interviewee&rsquo;s intensive recall effort. This research has implications for Anglophone police using cognitive interviewing with victims and witnesses who do not speak English, yet possess critical information to solve crimes. This is particularly in the light of the constant frustration experienced by police and victims/witnesses who are unable to communicate with each other due to a lack of appropriately skilled interpreters. This research highlights a possible need to adjust the application of the cognitive interviewing protocol in bilingual settings when interlingual mediation is employed. The researcher argues strongly that specialised training on the cognitive interviewing protocol should be developed and made available to interpreters who might be engaged by police for such interviews, with an aim to develop the interpreters&rsquo; knowledge schema and foster cognitive common ground between interpreters and the police. Interdisciplinary research in the future is recommended to follow up on this pioneering study...|$|R
