40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} high strain rate and high temperature behavior of mechanically alloyed and oxide dispersion strengthened nickel based superalloy MA 760. These types of alloys are used in many high temperature applications, such as turbine blades, where also impact type loadings can occur. Therefore, understanding the behavior of the alloy at its operating temperatures can help designing better and safer components in the cases of high rate impacts and collisions. The high strain rate high temperature tests were carried out using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar device at different strain rates and temperatures. The tests were carried out at strain rates between 1050 s- 1 and 3800 s- 1 and at temperatures ranging from room temperature up to 900 ⁰C. The obtained data was analyzed based on the principles of the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar, focusing on the yield strength, strain rate, and fracture strain. Based on the test results, the effects of strain rate and temperature on the mechanical behavior of the MA 760 was described. Yield strength increases as a function of temperature until temperatures close to 700 ⁰C, after which the yield strength decreases. However, even after this decrease the material is still very strong, which makes this material suitable for high temperature applications. The reason for this observed behavior is the anomalous yielding behavior of the γ’ phase. The flow stress increases with increasing temperature until the maximum. At higher temperatures (above 700 ⁰C), the deformation starts in the γ matrix, which causes the reduction in the yield strength of the material. Around 900 ⁰C, the initial cuboidal microstructure changes its morphology, which leads to the further reduction of the strength of the material. During the work of this thesis, a high temperature apparatus for the Taylor impact test was designed and built. The apparatus consists of the sample holder made of Teflon. The sample is placed in the sample holder with a <b>ceramic</b> <b>wool</b> ring. Two thermocouples are attached to each end of the specimen to monitor the temperature of the specimen. A stopper filled with <b>ceramic</b> <b>wool</b> was built to catch the specimen and the projectile. An induction heater was used to heat up the specimen to the test temperature. The impact process was recorded with a high speed camera to measure the speed of the projectile.

Experiments {{were based on the}} assumption that thin, long and durable fibres are of special importance for the carcinogenic potency of this type of substances. Parameters measured include number of fibres, diameter and length distribution of fibres retained in lung ash and leaching of various elements from fibres.

For another type of glass microfibre with a high alcaline earth content (CaO + MgO = 22 %) a very high in vivo solubility was detected. The studied glass wool and rock wool, showed a medium solubility in the rat lung. By the means of analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM) and proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) the leaching of alcaline and alcaline earth cations could be established for some types of fibres.

Animal and human studies carried out since the early 1900 s have established that asbestos is carcinogenic and that exposure to especially asbestos dust causes a large number of diseases. The search is, therefore, still on to find suitable substitutes for asbestos. A brake lining containing 14 ingredients was investigated to study the effect of ingredients on various aspects of friction properties. The composite was developed for a nonasbestos organic based friction material for an automotive brake system and contained typical ingredients for commercial brake friction materials. Two types of friction materials with different combinations were developed: (1) flyash range (10 %- 60 %), and (2) without flyash based friction materials were investigated to study the effect of ingredients on the friction characteristics and wear. The main focus on the average normal coefficient, hot coefficient (Fade and recovery), wear loss, mechanical, as the function of the relative amount of the ingredient. The results also showed that the friction coefficient of fly-ash was better in the range of 0. 35 to 0. 48 when compared barites based brake linings and asbestos based brake linings. The materials such as potassium titanate (terraces), wollastonite, friction dust powder have strongly influence on friction coefficient. Wear resistance of the friction material was strongly affected by the relative amounts of <b>ceramic</b> <b>wool,</b> rockwool, calcium hydroxide, and zircon. The presence of glass fiber, twaron fiber, has increased the strength of the friction material. All these samples were tested on chase type friction tester at automobile ancillary unit...|$|E

A major concern is the fire behavior of FRPs, especially their thermal softening with increasing temperature and consequently the reduction of load bearing capacity with adverse impact on structural integrity. In order to improve the composite fire performance and enhance the reliability of composite applications, {{it is necessary to}} study and understand the structural response of FRPs subjected to combined thermal and mechanical loadings. Special attention has to be paid to in depth analysis of various length- and time-scales. This paper presents the results of a series of large-scale structural fire experiments with E-glass fiber/vinyl ester panels subjected to compression loading and one-sided heating. All panels had the same overall dimensions of 2100 mm in width, 3000 mm in height and 13. 0 to 13. 5 mm in thickness.

40|$|Consideration of {{the human}} {{epidemiology}} of diseases arising from exposure to naturally occurring and man-made mineral fibers encompasses the several forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite-actinolite), other naturally occurring silicates (talc, sepiolite, erionite, attapulgite, vermiculite, and wollastonite), and man-made mineral fibers (glass continuous filament, glass/rock/ slag insulation <b>wools,</b> <b>ceramic</b> and other refractory fibers, and glass microfibers). The diseases arising from exposures {{to some of these}} fibers include pleural thickening (plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, and calcification), pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancers, mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum, and other cancers). Risk factors important in assessing these diseases include assessment of latency, duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, fiber origin and characteristics (length and diameter), other possible confounding occupational or environmental exposures, and smoking. Methodological issues commonly presenting problems in evaluation of these data include assessment of the adequacy of environmental exposures, particularly in regard to fiber identification, distribution, and concentration over the duration of exposure, and the adequacy of study design to detect health effects (disease frequency, latency, and cohort size). Research priorities include further assessment and standardization of pleural thickening relative to fiber exposure, uniform mesothelioma surveillance, further epidemiological assessment of certain silicate and man-made mineral fiber cohorts with emphasis given to assessment of tremolite and small diameter glass and ceramic fibers. Further assessment of possible health risks of the general public should await improved definition of relevant fiber exposure in ambient air...|$|R
40|$|Boron carbide is {{produced}} in a heat resistance furnace using boric oxide and petroleum coke as the raw materials. In this process, a large current is passed through the graphite rod located {{at the center of}} the cylindrical furnace, which is surrounded by the coke and boron oxide mixture. Heat generated due to resistance heating is responsible for the reaction of boron oxide with coke which results in the formation of boron carbide. The whole process is highly energy intensive and inefficient in terms of the production of boron carbide. Only 15 % charge gets converted into boron carbide. The aim of the present work is to develop a mathematical model for this batch process and validate the model with experiments and to optimize the operating parameters to increase the productivity. To mathematically model the process and understand the influence of various operating parameters on the productivity, existing simple one-dimensional (1 -D) mathematical model in radial direction is modified first. Two-dimensional (2 -D) model can represent the process better; therefore in second stage of the project a 2 -D mathematical model is also developed. For both, 1 -D and 2 -D models, coupled heat and mass balance equations are solved using finite volume technique. Both the models have been tested for time step and grid size independency. The kinetics of the reaction is represented using nucleation growth mechanism. Conduction, convection and radiation terms are considered in the formulation of heat transfer equation. Fraction of boron carbide formed and temperature profiles in the radial direction are obtained computationally. Experiments were conducted on a previously developed experimental setup consisting of heat resistance furnace, a power supply unit and electrode cooling device. The heating furnace is made of stainless steel body with high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>wool</b> insulation. In order to validate the mathematical model, experiments are performed in various conditions. Temperatures are measured at various locations in the furnace and samples are collected from the various locations (both in radial and angular directions) in the furnace for chemical analysis. Also, many experimental data are used from the previous work to validate the computed results. For temperatures measurement, pyrometer, C, B and K type thermocouple were used. It is observed that results obtained from both the models (1 -D and 2 -D) are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Once the models are validated with the experiments, sensitivity analysis of various parameters such as power supply, initial percentage of B 4 C in the charge, composition of the charge, and various modes of power supply, on the process is performed. It is found that linear power supply mode, presence of B 4 C in the initial mixture and increase in power supply give better productivity (fraction reacted). In order to have more confidence in the developed models, the parameters of one the computed results in the sensitivity analysis parameters are chosen (in present case, linear power supply is chosen) to perform the experiment. Results obtained from the experiment performed under the same simulated conditions as computed results are found in excellent match with each other...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} fill the lack of {{knowledge}} about slender elements behavior at elevated temperatures, a European research project called FIDESC 4 has been funded by the RFCS. This project involves experimental testing, parametric numerical analyses and development of simple design rules. The present paper reports the characteristics and the results of the FIDESC 4 experimental test campaign performed at the University of Liege on slender steel columns at elevated temperatures. A total of eight columns have been tested, all of them with I shape section. Six columns were made of welded sections (some prismatic and some tapered members) and two columns were with hot rolled sections. The nominal length of the columns was 3 meters with the whole length being heated. The strength of the material (webs and flanges) was measured on sample before the tests. The order of magnitude of the initial geometrical imperfections was recorded. The columns were not restrained against longitudinal thermal elongation. The supports at the ends were cylindrical thus inducing a restrain against rotation in one plane while allowing rotation in the other plane. The allowed direction of rotation was chosen in each test to induce buckling around the strong or the weak axis. The load was applied at ambient temperature and maintained for a period of 15 minutes after which the temperature was increased under constant load. The load was applied concentrically on some tests and with an eccentricity in other tests. The load eccentricity was either applied at both ends, leading to constant bending moment distribution along the length, or at one end only, leading to a triangular bending moment distribution. Heating was applied by electrical resistances enclosed in ceramic pads. The columns and the ceramic pads were wrapped in <b>ceramic</b> <b>wool</b> insulating material. This technique was preferred to gas heating in a standard test furnace because it allows applying a slower and better controlled heating rate and thus obtaining a more uniform temperature distribution in the member. It is also easier to measured lateral displacements of the column. Preliminary blank tests were performed on unloaded specimen {{in order to determine the}} heating range to be used later on the loaded columns. The paper will also report on a modification of the heating technique that was applied and improved significantly the uniformity in the temperature distribution. Numerical simulations were performed before the tests using shell elements of the software SAFIR and assumed values of the material properties in order to predict the failure modes. It was essentially crucial to determine whether lateral supports at intermediate levels should be provided in order to ensure failure in the desired direction. Experience showed that the failure modes developed as predicted by the numerical simulations. Besides a thorough description of the experiments, the paper will also present the obtained results in terms of failure mode, ultimate temperature and evolution of longitudinal and transverse displacement. Some information will also be given about the level of detail that has to be used in the numerical model in order to get accurate results at a reasonable price. Peer reviewe...|$|E

In {{the presence of}} azide, all the fibres caused considerable H 2 O 2 formation, and about twice as much H 2 O 2 was found in mixtures with the natural fibres (asbestos, erionite, and wollastonite) than in mixtures with the manmade fibres (rock wool, glass <b>wool,</b> and <b>ceramic</b> fibres). In the presence of externally added iron, all the fibres were found to generate OH. and the natural fibres caused about three times more OH. formation than the manmade fibres. In the absence of external iron, there was less OH. formation; however, amosite, crocidolite, antophyllite, erionite, and wollastonite still generated considerable amounts of OH., also under circumstances in which only small amounts of OH. were produced in mixtures with the manmade fibres. These findings indicate that natural fibres generate more H 2 O 2 and OH. than manmade fibres when incubated with PMNLs {{in the presence of}} external iron. They also suggest that the natural fibres, amosite, crocidolite, antophyllite, erionite, and wollastonite may act catalytically in the dissociation of H 2 O 2 to OH. in the absence of external iron, whereas manmade fibres such as rock wool, glass <b>wool,</b> and <b>ceramic</b> fibres, {{do not seem to be}} able to generate OH. in the absence of external iron...|$|R

Uma alternativa é a utilização de tecnologias com características industrializadas como o "light steel framing" (LSF) que é um sistema aberto, modular, de rápida execução, fácil manutenção e sustentável. Com a vigência da norma de desempenho, a NBR 15575 (ABNT, 2013), nasce uma necessidade de ciência sobre o desempenho dos sistemas. Materiais com características sustentáveis e de menor custo precisam ser avaliados de forma a contribuir para o avanço sustentável do LSF no Brasil, então o objetivo é avaliar o desempenho de alternativas para as vedações verticais externas em LSF com relação ao seu desempenho térmico e acústico visando menor custo e sustentabilidade. Os painéis possuem elementos constantes e variáveis como os isolantes e as massas para acabamento. Foram testados produtos industrializados, resíduo industrial, gesso acartonado moído e em pedaços (resíduo da construção) e materiais utilizados em outros sistemas construtivos. O desempenho térmico foi analisado segundo o procedimento 1 A Simplificado - NBR 15575 (ABNT, 2013) e experimento onde comparou-se a diferença de temperatura com a medição da face interna enquanto que uma fonte de calor manteve a temperatura da face externa em 80 oC por 60 minutos. O desempenho acústico foi analisado utilizando o método da função de transferência, já que os materiais reciclados não possuem índices para incrementar os cálculos ou simulações nos dois casos. Os resultados obtidos foram analisados pelo Processo de Análise Hierárquica (AHP) que determinou qual é o melhor painel. Quando o desempenho térmico é considerado o critério de maior importância, os painéis com acabamento na face externa (estuque sintético), massa látex PVA na parte interna e no {{interior}} do painel fibra cerâmica obtiveram o melhor desempenho. Para o desempenho acústico, o painel com lã de vidro no miolo obteve o melhor desempenho e quando o critério de maior relevância é o custo, os painéis com o interior preenchido com materiais reciclados obtiveram o menor valor.

In the thermal experiment measurements were done in one face, while the other source of heat kept the temperature from the opposite face in 80 C (176 F) for 60 minutes.
