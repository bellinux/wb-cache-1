Lansbury was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1994, and promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to drama, charitable work, and philanthropy. On being made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, Lansbury stated: [...] "I'm joining a marvellous {{group of women}} I greatly admire like Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.

500|$|The {{urgency of}} {{negotiating}} a concession {{was made clear}} to Rhodes {{during a visit to}} London in June 1888, when he learned of the London syndicate's letter to Knutsford, and of their appointment of Maund. Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly. [...] "Someone has to get the <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think we should have the best chance," [...] Rhodes told Rothschild; [...] "I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king. He is the only block to central Africa, as, once we have his territory, the rest is easy... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen... I have faith in the country, and Africa is on the move. I think it is a second Cinderella." ...|$|E

In December 1643, Temple was prominent in the defence of the crossing of the River Adur at Bramber Castle against a Royalist attack during Lord Hopton's attempt to obtain control of Sussex for the King. His actions were described by Dr Cheynell: [...] "Upon the 12th of December I visited a brave soldier of my acquaintance, Captn Jas Temple, who did that day defend the fort of Bramber against a bold and daring enemy to the wonder of all the <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did not marvel at it, for {{he is a man}} that hath his head full of stratagems, his heart full of piety and valour, and his hand as full of success as it is of dexterity." ...|$|E

On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged. I felt as though he had given so much to our <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation.

Of great historical interest is the filming, in 1899, of three brief segments from his production of King John, in which he starred and directed. [...] This is the first film record of a Shakespeare play. [...] Charles Urban filmed the opening shipwreck from the 1904 revival of The Tempest at the theatre in 1905; Tree, whose role in the production was Caliban, did not appear in this scene. Tree played Cardinal Wolsey in a 1911 studio film by William Barker of a five-scene version of Henry VIII, based on the theatre's 1910 production. Tree was paid the unprecedented sum of £1000 lest the film prove unsatisfactory, or damage ticket sales of the theatre presentation. [...] Filming took place at studios in Ealing, west London and took only one day, thanks to careful preparation beforehand.
