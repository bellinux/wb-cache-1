It is concluded that significant opportunities exist to enhance reintegration outcomes in this type of programme. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{monitoring}} is {{a recent}} advance in information gathering for <b>correctional</b> program <b>administration.</b> To be effective in achieving correctional goals, electronic monitors must be applied to offenders when there is some risk of performance problem. Advocates of electronic monitoring argue they can promote public safety, save tax dollars, and enhance correctional performance. Because corrections systems find it so difficult to innovate with offenders who represent a risk to society, these claims are overstated. Electronic monitoring raises short-term concerns concerning damage to correctional program credibility and long-term concerns about the enhancement of social control.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present {{research}} was to report the experiences of teachers in juvenile correctional institutions, their challenges, and professional development needs. Research was conducted using a qualitative descriptive phenomenological methodology through a semi-structured interview applied to four teachers from the Juvenile <b>Correctional</b> Institutions <b>Administration</b> (AIJ) in Puerto Rico. The information was analyzed based on the systematic qualitative research procedures proposed by Strauss and Corbin (1998), cited by Lucca and Berríos (2003) : open, axial and selective coding, respectively. Teachers were greatly satisfied for providing educational services. A relevant finding is the lack of a curriculum that fits the needs of this youth population. The curriculum used {{is the same as the}} one used in public schools, which makes it unappealing to these students. These teachers face unusual challenges, including the institutions’ security system and the teaching and learning methodology. A lack of coordination is perceived in the educational services and a multidisciplinary team is needed to address the cognitive and emotional aspects of the population. Like teachers in any other educational system, respondents obtain some achievements and satisfactions that strengthen them spiritually and motivate them to continue working in these institutions for many years...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} main {{determinants}} of the hazard of recidivism among ex-prisoners. We use a nationally-representative sample of prisoners released in 1996 – 1997 in France, {{drawn from a}} 5 -year follow-up survey run by the French <b>correctional</b> <b>administration.</b> We estimate semi-parametric duration models which deal with violations of the proportional hazards assumption. Our results confirm the importance of gender, age, nationality, employment status and prior convictions on recidivism within 5 years after release from prison. We also find significant differences in hazards of recidivism by type of initial offense, penal status at entry, and type of release (early release under parole, etc.), while controlling for prison fixed effects. Finally, our study casts doubt {{on the influence of}} several sociodemographic variables (marital status at entry, education, homelessness) and on the effectiveness of "semi-liberte" as a way to prevent recidivism...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Counseling and Educational PsychologyFred O. BradleyThe {{number of}} animal {{training}} programs in correctional facilities {{has increased in}} the past 25 years. Anecdotal accounts have informally assessed the efficacy of prison training programs; however, only limited systemic {{studies have been conducted}} (Britton & Button, 2005; Furst, 2006). Preliminary information from anecdotal accounts and narratives indicates the potential these programs have to impact inmate behavior, self- esteem, staff and inmate morale, and community perceptions of offenders (Cushing & Williams, 1995; Harkrader, Burke, & Owen, 2004). There is also an indication inmate trainers learn responsibility, patience, coping skills, and vocational skills (Britton & Button, 2005; Merriam-Arduini, 2000; Turner, 2007). This qualitative study presents preliminary findings from the following five participant perspectives on the perceived outcomes of a canine training program in a correctional facility where inmates train assistance, therapy, rescue, and medical alert canines: (a) inmate trainers, (b) former inmate trainers, (c) non-trainer inmates who are not involved in the training program, (d) staff, and (e) the researcher. Once trained, the canines are adopted as assistance dogs for individuals in need. Data collected from in- depth interviews with current inmate trainers, former inmate trainers, non-trainer inmates, and staff, and audio and video recordings, researcher observations, and a researcher developed scale indicated the following themes which emerged from the study: there are positive emotional outcomes and positive practical outcomes for inmate trainers who work with dogs in the training program. Positive emotional outcomes for inmate trainers include the following: (a) providing social support, (b) gaining a sense of pride, (c) serving as a feeling of giving back to society, (d) increasing personal patience, (e) humanizing the inmate trainers, and (f) improving self-esteem. Positive practical outcomes for inmate trainers emerged in the following areas: (a) improving responsibility, (b) having a positive impact on the prison environment, (c) providing opportunities to help others, (d) using goal setting, (e) gaining employability skills, and (e) having a positive effect on behavior. Results from this study will add to existing literature and research in the field of animal-assisted interventions and rehabilitation programs with human beings, specifically those in correctional facilities. In addition, results from this study will assist <b>correctional</b> <b>administration</b> in the design, implementation, and evaluation of dog training programs in prisons...|$|E
