40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) {{used to treat}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease can cause <b>compulsive</b> <b>behaviours</b> and impulse control disorders (ICDs), such as pathological gambling, compulsive buying and hypersexuality. Like more familiar drug-based forms of addiction, these iatrogenic disorders can cause significant harm and distress for sufferers and their families. In some cases, people treated with DRT have lost their homes and businesses, or have been prosecuted for criminal sexual behaviours. In this article we first examine the evidence that these disorders are caused by DRT. If it is accepted that DRT cause <b>compulsive</b> or addictive <b>behaviours</b> in a significant minority of individuals, then the following ethical and clinical questions arise: Under what circumstances is it ethical to prescribe a medication that may induce harmful <b>compulsive</b> <b>behaviours?</b> Are individuals treated with DRT morally responsible and hence culpable for harmful or criminal behaviour related to their medication? We conclude with some observations of the relevance of DRT-induced ICDs for our understanding of addiction and identify some promising {{directions for future research}} and ethical analysis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

While the previous studies {{on the relationship between}} compulsive buying and familial variables have been implied by research in social sciences and mainly about adults, it has not yet been examined fully in the marketing literature. The present study addresses this void by investigating how three parent-child relationship factors (cohesion, expressiveness and conflict) could have both direct and indirect (through the mediator of self-esteem) effects on children's <b>compulsive</b> buying <b>behaviour.</b> This research investigated the relationship among three major concepts, i. e. parent-child relationship, self-esteem, and adolescents' <b>compulsive</b> buying <b>behaviour.</b> The parent-child relationship was measured according to fathers', mothers' and children's responses. The findings indicated that both parent-child relationship and self-esteem may affect significantly the extent of adolescents' <b>compulsive</b> buying <b>behaviours.</b> Gender, availability of pocket money and involvement in part-time jobs were also found to predict children's <b>compulsive</b> buying <b>behaviour</b> in a sample of Canadian adolescents.

40|$|Workaholism {{refers to}} the {{uncontrollable}} need to work and comprises working compulsively (WC) and working excessively (WE). Compulsive Internet Use (CIU), involves a similar behavioural pattern although in specific relation to Internet use. Since many occupations rely upon use of the Internet, and the lines between home and the workplace have become increasingly blurred, a self-reinforcing pattern of workaholism and CIU could develop from those vulnerable to one or the other. The present study explored {{the relationship between these}} <b>compulsive</b> <b>behaviours</b> utilizing a two-wave longitudinal study over six months. A total of 244 participants who used the Internet as part of their occupational role and were in full-time employment completed the online survey at each wave. This survey contained previously validated measures of each variable. Data were analysed using cross-lagged analysis. Results indicated that Internet usage and CIU were reciprocally related, supporting the existence of tolerance in CIU. It was also found that CIU at Time 1 predicted WC at Time 2 and that WE was unrelated to CIU. It is concluded that a masking mechanism appears a sensible explanation for the findings.

40|$|Purpose - The study tests a {{screening}} tool to identify compulsive purchase tendency {{on the part}} of consumers. It also examines consumer proclivity to buy tourism products compulsively by tourism product type and purchase behaviour characteristics. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire survey using {{a screening}} tool was used to identify subjects who typically behave compulsively in their purchase behaviour and to examine compulsive purchasing within a tourism context in the Czech Republic. Exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression were employed to identify significant predictors of compulsive purchase tendency. The characteristics of <b>compulsive</b> purchase <b>behaviour</b> in a tourism context are then explored. Findings – A core set of six <b>compulsive</b> purchase <b>behaviour</b> discriminator variables were identified together with two intrinsic and one extrinsic dimension: therapeutic pleasure, obsessive expenditure and credit card facilitation. The intrinsic dimensions were significant predictors of compulsive purchase tendency. The results also show that certain types of tourism products are purchased by subjects with compulsive purchase tendency. Research limitations/implications – The study has the restriction of being limited to the Czech case, therefore the results relating to both the screening tool and <b>compulsive</b> purchase <b>behaviour</b> in tourism cannot be generalised. Moreover, the findings relating to tourism cannot be compared with previous studies {{because of the lack of}} research in this area. Nevertheless, the study has identified a new area for research in tourism. Practical implications – The increasing incidence of <b>compulsive</b> purchase <b>behaviour</b> in both developed and developing economies may have serious implications for marketing practices, ethics and marketing policy. Originality/value – The study contributes to our overall understanding of <b>compulsive</b> purchase <b>behaviour</b> by identifying significant discriminator variables and examines this phenomenon in the tourism market, which has hitherto been neglected in this respect...|$|R
25|$|<b>Compulsive</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{characterized}} by addiction are underpinned by two interacting systems: (a) impulsivity, and (b) reflection. Impulsivity {{is responsible for}} the rapid signalling of the affective importance of a stimuli. Reflection cognitively evaluates the signal before altering the behavioural response. Dysfunction in impulsivity exaggerates the emotional impact of the drug-related stimuli and attenuates the impact of natural reinforcement. Dysregulation in reflection results in the inability to override impulsivity, thus resulting in addiction. Under-responsiveness to naturally occurring positive stimuli is a crucial element that biases the individual towards the use of substances or behaviours and away from non-drug alternatives.|$|R

50|$|Depersonalization {{exists as}} both a primary and {{secondary}} phenomenon, although making a clinical distinction appears easy but is not absolute. The most common comorbid disorders are depression and anxiety, although cases of depersonalization disorder without symptoms of either do exist. Comorbid obsessive and <b>compulsive</b> <b>behaviours</b> may exist as attempts to deal with depersonalization, such as checking whether symptoms have changed and avoiding behavioural and cognitive factors that exacerbate symptoms. Many people with personality disorders such as schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder will have high chances of having depersonalization disorder. Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, England suggest depersonalization disorder be placed with anxiety and mood disorders, as in the ICD-10, instead of with dissociative disorders as in the DSM-IV-TR.|$|R
5000|$|Founded {{in current}} {{research}} on the adverse consequences of overusing technology, digital addict is used as an overarching phrase to suggest an increasing trend of <b>compulsive</b> <b>behaviour</b> amongst users of technological devices, recognising that over-exposure to and over-use of technology {{can result in a}} dependence on digital devices, leading to behavioural symptoms similar to any addictive disorder, as the user neglects to maintain a healthy balance between using technology and socialising outside of it. [...] The negative side-effects of overusing technology have in recent decades attracted increasing attention as a legitimate psychological disorder. Unrestrained use of technological devices may impact upon developmental, social, mental and physical well-being and result in symptoms akin to other behavioural addiction.

5000|$|Before the 1980s, {{interaction}} between neuroscience and cognitive science was scarce. Cognitive neuroscience began {{to integrate the}} newly laid theoretical ground in cognitive science, that emerged between the 1950s and 1960s, with approaches in experimental psychology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. (Neuroscience was not established as a unified discipline until 1971). In the very late 20th century new technologies evolved that are now the mainstay of the methodology of cognitive neuroscience, including TMS (1985) and fMRI (1991). Earlier methods used in cognitive neuroscience includes EEG (human EEG 1920) and MEG (1968). Occasionally cognitive neuroscientists utilize other brain imaging methods such as PET and SPECT. An upcoming technique in neuroscience is NIRS which uses light absorption to calculate changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin in cortical areas. In some animals Single-unit recording can be used. Other methods include microneurography, facial EMG, and eye-tracking. Integrative neuroscience attempts to consolidate data in databases, and form unified descriptive models from various fields and scales: biology, psychology, anatomy, and clinical practice.
