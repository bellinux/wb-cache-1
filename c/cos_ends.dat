40|$|Temperate {{bacteriophage}} NJL of Rhodococcus rhodochrous has a 49 -kb linear double-stranded DNA with {{cohesive ends}} (cos). NJL DNA has unique target sites for HindIII and SspI, two target sites each for NheI and ScaI, and no cleavage site for AxyI, DraI, EcoRI, SacI, and SphI. The single-stranded regions of <b>cos</b> <b>ends</b> were ligated {{to each other}} with T 4 DNA ligase, removed with mung bean nuclease, or blunted with the Klenow large fragment of DNA polymerase I; then the sequences of the <b>cos</b> <b>ends</b> were determined. Comparison of these sequences revealed that the single-stranded regions are complementary and 18 bases long and protrude at the 3 ' ends; they have the following sequences: 5 '-TTGGCACCGTGGGAGGAG- 3 ' and 3 '-AACCGTGGCAC CCTCCTC- 5 '. A physical map of NJL was constructed by a cos mapping method based on information about {{the structure of the}} cohesive ends and multiple digestions with restriction endonucleases...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction and}} use of a cosmid vector, loric, which {{is derived from the}} phage lambda origin of replication and appears to be more stable than ColE 1 -derived cosmids. Loric recombinants can be efficiently packaged in vivo to yield 100 - 300 micrograms of DNA per liter that is linear and has single-stranded <b>cos</b> <b>ends.</b> We call such molecules "phosmids. " Phosmid restriction maps can be rapidly generated by labeling either the left or right cos site by annealing on a 32 P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to either cos-L or cos-R. Partial restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography are used to size restriction fragments of increasing length, all of which terminate at the labeled cos site. The procedures have been tested by isolating and mapping a region of the H- 2 locus of mouse chromosome 17...|$|E
40|$|Ku-dependent nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is a double-strand break {{repair process}} conserved in all {{branches}} of cellular life {{but has not}} previously been implicated in the DNA metabolic processes of viruses. We identified Ku homologs in Corndog and Omega, two related mycobacteriophages of Mycobacterium smegmatis. These proteins formed homodimers and bound DNA ends in a manner identical to other Ku's and stimulated joining of ends by the host NHEJ DNA ligase (LigD). Omega and Corndog are unusual in having short 4 base <b>cos</b> <b>ends</b> {{that would not be}} expected to self-anneal and would therefore require NHEJ during phage genome circularization. Consistently, M. smegmatis LigD null strains are entirely and selectively unable to support infection by Corndog or Omega, with concomitant failure of genome circularization. These results establish a new paradigm for sequestration of the host cell NHEJ process by bacteriophage and provide a framework for understanding similar transactions in eukaryotic viral infections...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{magnetic}} susceptibility, electrical resistivity (rho), and heat capacity measurements {{as a function}} of temperature are reported for the alloys, Ce 2 Rh(1 -x) Co(x) Si 3, crystallizing in an AlB 2 -derived hexagonal strcture. Ce 2 RhSi 3 exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 7 K. The Neel temperature decreases gradually with the increase in Co concentration. For x greater than 0. 6, no magnetic ordering is observed down to 0. 5 K. Interestingly, the x= 0. 6 alloy exhibits signatutes of non-Fermi liquid behavior, while the <b>Co</b> <b>end</b> member is a Fermi liquid. Thus, a transformation of magnetic ordering state to non-magnetism via non-Fermiliquid state by isoelectronic chemical doping is evident in this solid solution. The electrical resistivity data for x= 0. 2 and 0. 3 alloys show an upturn at respective Neel temperatures, establishing the formation of a magnetism-induced pseudo-gap for these intermediate compositions alone as though there is a gradual Fermi surface transformation as the quantum critical point is approached.

5000|$|The {{road from}} Brisbane to Gympie became {{the best known}} Cobb & Co. route in Queensland, and the most rugged section was from the Maroochy River to Traveston, which is {{reflected}} in the greater distance covered from Brisbane to the Maroochy River (76.5 miles) in {{the same time that it}} took to get from Gympie to the Maroochy River (41 miles). The road degenerated quickly however, and in 1871 the English novelist Anthony Trollope was warned against travelling by coach because of the terrible state of the Gympie road. He went regardless, and wrote that [...] "There is often no road, and the coach is taken at random through the forest. Not infrequently a fallen tree blocks the track...But the great miracle is the sudden pinches, looking as though they were almost perpendicular, down which the coach is taken - and then the equally sharp ascents..."

40|$|We {{report a}} simple in vivo {{technique}} for introducing an antibiotic resistance marker into phage lambda. This technique {{could be used}} for direct selection of lysogens harboring recombinant phages from the Kohara lambda bank (a collection of ordered lambda clones carrying Escherichia coli DNA segments). The two-step method uses homologous recombination and lambda DNA packaging to replace the nonessential lambda DNA lying between the lysis genes and the right cohesive (<b>cos)</b> <b>end</b> with the neomycin phosphotransferase (npt) gene from Tn 903. This occurs during lytic growth of the phage on a plasmid-containing host strain. Neomycin-resistant (npt+) recombinant phages are then selected from the lysates containing the progeny phage by transduction of a polA 1 lambda lysogenic host strain to neomycin resistance. We have tested this method with two different Kohara lambda phage clones; in both cases, neomycin resistance cotransduced with the auxotrophic marker carried by the lambda clone, indicating complete genetic linkage. Linkage was verified by restriction mapping of purified DNA from a recombinant phage clone. We also demonstrate that insertion of the npt+ recombinant phages into the lambda prophage can be readily distinguished from insertion into bacterial chromosomal sequences...|$|R

40|$|With {{molecular}} dynamics we {{have studied the}} deposition of single Co atoms on Ag(001) {{as a function of}} the energy of deposition on the surface. Co atoms were deposited with an energy between 5 and 30 eV, typically used for low-energy ion deposition. As a consequence of the impact, Co atoms that arrive on the surface mainly end up in two positions: either the adatom site or the substitutional site in the first Ag surface layer. The configuration energy of both sites is independent of the impact position and the deposition energy, indicating that not only the adatom site but also the substitutional site is thermodynamically stable. For increasing deposition energy the fraction of <b>Co</b> atoms <b>ending</b> up in a substitutional site increases. When a <b>Co</b> particle <b>ends</b> up in a substitutional site, this is accompanied with the creation of at least one Ag adatom. Under our experimental conditions, the direction of impact can differ considerably from the surface normal. Therefore, we also studied the influence of the impact angle between 0 degrees and 40 degrees off normal. When the deposition angle increases, the fraction of substitutional Co atoms as well as the fraction of created Ag adatoms decrease. status: publishe...|$|R
