40|$|Abstract — In past decades, <b>carbon–carbon</b> <b>composites</b> {{composed}} of multidirectional carbon fiber reinforcement embedded in carbon matrix have been significantly explored {{due to its}} excellent mechanical and physical properties. <b>Carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites</b> have light weight, high {{strength at high temperature}} in non-oxidizing atmospheres, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high electrical conductivity and high thermal conductivity. Based on the properties, the <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites</b> can be utilized in high speed vehicles and thermal management applications. However, carbon is easily oxidized at temperature of 450 o C and above which resulted in decrease of its properties such as electrical conductivity. In general, high temperature heat treatments (above 1, 000 o C) are included for the production of carboncarbon composites. In this study, we introduced a bio antioxidant which is nontoxic and environmentally safe for deoxidation of carboncarbon composites.

40|$|TITLE: CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Jarlen Don <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites,</b> are {{materials}} that offer designers a significant importance over conventional materials for advanced applications. The <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites</b> were originally developed {{to be used}} in aerospace and defense applications, because of their unique properties. Currently, they are employed in many applications. They exhibit light weight, high thermal efficiency, and excellent mechanical properties at higher temperatures, making them the right candidate materials for aircraft and racing car brakes and re-entry nose tips. Moreover, they demonstrate significant durability for friction and wear properties. Compared to advanced ceramics, <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites</b> have improved thermal and mechanical properties along with high friction coefficient and low wear [1 - 2]. Due to its remarkable properties, <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites</b> display high dimensional stability at elevated temperatures greater than 3000 °C without major deformation, while other materials such as a wide range of metals experience drastic deterioration. The properties of <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (C-C) <b>composites</b> are very much dependent on the manufacturing methods used for production.

This design works for Mach-25 spacecraft re-entry shields, and therefore should work for any aircraft that can carry {{the weight of the}} coolant. Exotic materials such as <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composite</b> do not conduct heat but endure it, but they tend to be brittle. Heatpipes are not widely used at present. Like a conventional heat exchanger, they conduct heat better than most solid materials, but like a thermosiphon are passively pumped.

Therefore numerous investigations have been conducted in an attempt to protect <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites</b> against oxidation. The main protection mechanism relies on the use of a barrier against oxygen diffusion. The problem, when applying this concept, is the thermal mismatch between coating and carbon substrate which results in cracking of the coatings.

Therefore other approaches have been developed including : (1) intermediate layers, (2) inhibited matrices and (3) fiber protections. The purpose of this work is to examine the oxidation of <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>composites</b> and to evaluate the inherent limitations of the various current coatings.
