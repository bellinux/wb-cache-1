This building, which is elevated on timber stumps, is of drop slab timber construction, although the front of the building has been faced with horizontal timber weatherboards. The hipped corrugated iron roof is centrally pierced with a brick chimney shaft, with simple brick corbelling and <b>chimney</b> <b>hood.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Built {{of brick}} with {{sandstone}} elements {{on a stone}} foundation, the two-story Deuscher House features a central projecting bay containing the entrance and its fanlight; a small gable with oculus sits {{at the top of}} the projection. On the left side of the facade, as seen from the road, is a large bay window on the first floor with a single window on the second, while two windows are placed on each floor on the facade's right side. A hip roof covers the house, descending to form a cornice supported by paired brackets. [...] A small widow's walk sits atop the roof, which is ringed by a railing and pierced by four <b>chimneys,</b> and three <b>hood</b> molded windows are placed in the bay. The farmstead includes three other buildings: a barn and shed dating from the farm's early years, and a much newer garage. [...] These elements combine to make the 1870 residence a fine example of the Italianate style of architecture.|$|R
40|$|Background: Almost half {{of global}} child deaths due to acute lower {{respiratory}} infections (ALRIs) occur in sub- Saharan Africa, where {{three-quarters of the}} population cook with solid fuels. This study aims to quantify the impact of fuel type and cooking practices on childhood ALRI mortality in Africa, and to explore implications for public health interventions. Methods: Early-release World Health Survey data for the year 2003 were pooled for 16 African countries. Among 32 620 children born during the last 10 years, 1455 (4. 46 %) {{were reported to have}} died prior to their fifth birthday. Survival analysis was used to examine the impact of different cooking-related parameters on ALRI mortality, defined as cough accompanied by rapid breathing or chest indrawing based on maternal recall of symptoms prior to death. Results: Solid fuel use increases the risk of ALRI mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2. 35 (95 % CI 1. 22 to 4. 52); this association grows stronger with increasing outcome specificity. Differences between households burning solid fuels on a well-ventilated stove and households relying on cleaner fuels are limited. In contrast, cooking with solid fuels {{in the absence of a}} <b>chimney</b> or <b>hood</b> is associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2. 68 (1. 38 to 5. 23). Outdoor cooking is less harmful than indoor cooking but, overall, stove ventilation emerges as a more significant determinant of ALRI mortality. Conclusions: This study shows substantial differences in ALRI mortality risk among African children in relation to cooking practices, and suggests that stove ventilation may be an important means of reducing indoor air pollution. ...|$|R
