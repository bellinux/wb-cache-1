5|$|Sirius is {{a binary}} star system {{consisting}} of two white stars orbiting {{each other with a}} separation of about 20 AU (roughly the distance between the Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940K. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system emits a higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by IRAS space-based observatory. This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The <b>Chandra</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>Observatory</b> image shows Sirius B outshining its bright partner as it is a brighter X-ray source.|$|E

40|$|Aims: We {{conducted}} the first X-ray {{observations of the}} newly erupting FU Ori-type outburst in HBC 722 (V 2493 Cyg) with the aim to characterize its X-ray behavior and near-stellar environment during early outburst. Methods: We used data from the XMM-Newton and <b>Chandra</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>observatories</b> to measure <b>X-ray</b> source temperatures and luminosities {{as well as the}} gas column densities along the line of sight toward the source.

The gas column density exceeds values expected from optical extinction and standard gas-to-dust ratios. We conclude that dust-free gas masses are present around the star, such as strong winds launched from the inner disk, or massive accretion columns.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an environmental risk-mitigation tool for the <b>Chandra</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>Observatory's</b> Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). Because exposure to 100 - 200 keV protons appears to have degraded the front-illuminated CCD's charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), an accurate tool for predicting encounters with magnetospheric regions rich in these particles is required. We implement standard models to predict bow-shock, magnetopause, and plasma-sheet boundaries. Using these models and solar-wind databases compiled from IMP- 8 and ACE measurements, we then calculate the probability that Chandra is located in one of these regions, along with predicted particle flux, to arrive at appropriate safing times for the ACIS detector. Finally, we validate this tool by comparing the model's boundary-crossing and proton flux predictions with measurements from Chandra's on-board particle detector and with data from other spacecraft operating in the Earth's magnetosphere...|$|R

Using binoculars, its clouds of nascent stars, luminous gas, and dust can be observed. The Trapezium cluster has many newborn stars, including several brown dwarfs, all of which are at an approximate distance of 1,500 light-years. Named for the four bright stars that form a trapezoid, it is largely illuminated by the brightest stars, which are only a few hundred thousand years old.

25|$|In May and June 2002 Roberto Soria and {{his colleagues}} at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics {{discovered}} two Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with the <b>Chandra</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>Observatory.</b> ULXs are objects that emit tremendous amounts of X-rays (> 1032 watts or 1039 erg/s), assuming they radiate isotropically (the same in all directions). This amount is larger than currently understood stellar processes (including supernovae) but smaller than the amount of X-rays emitted by active galactic nuclei, which accounts for their alternate name, Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Objects (IXOs). The source designated ULX1 was found in a relatively empty interarm region, far from any bright clusters or star-forming complexes, and showed a 75% increase in X-ray luminosity over the course of 20 days. ULX2 was found in an exceptionally bright young stellar complex, and showed an order of magnitude increase over the same time period.|$|E
40|$|The hard X-ray (2 - 10 keV) {{luminosity}} of a star-forming galaxy tracks {{its population}} of high mass X-ray binaries and is essentially unobscured. It {{is therefore a}} practically unbiased measure of star-formation in the host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Using recent and archival observations of GRBs with the XMM-Newton and <b>Chandra</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>observatories,</b> limits are placed on the underlying X-ray emission from GRB hosts. Useful limits on the current massive star-formation rates (SFRs), unaffected by obscuration, are obtained for the hosts of three low redshift GRBs: GRB 980425, GRB 030329 and GRB 031203. These limits show that though the specific SFRs may be high (as in dwarf starburst galaxies), none have massive obscured star-formation at the levels implied by the sub-mm detection of some GRB hosts. It is also shown that {{in cases where the}} faint luminosities of the late time afterglow or supernova emission are of interest, the contribution of the host galaxy to the X-ray flux may be significant.

40|$|We {{report on}} a 10 ksec {{observation}} of the double pulsar system J 0737 - 3039 obtained with the <b>Chandra</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>Observatory's</b> Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer. We detect {{the system as a}} point source with coordinates (J 2000) RA = 07 : 37 : 51. 23, Decl. = - 30 : 39 : 40. 9, making this the first double neutron star system to be detected at X-ray energies. Only 77 source counts are detected. The data are represented satisfactorily by a power-law spectrum with photon index = 2. 9 +/- 0. 4. The inferred 0. 2 - 10 keV luminosity is approximately 2 e 30 erg/s for a distance of 0. 5 kpc. We do not detect any significant variability with orbital phase in these data, which span one full orbit. These results are consistent with the X-ray emission originating solely from the magnetosphere of the energetic A pulsar, with an efficiency for conversion of rotational energy to X-rays in this band of roughly 0. 04 %, although we cannot exclude other possibilities.
