US12 was rerouted to follow the bypass, supplanting the M-17 and Bypass US112 designations used previously on the bypass. US112 was also rerouted, and it ran concurrently with US12 along the bypass. The former route of US12 along Plymouth Road from Ann Arbor east to Detroit was renumbered M-14, and the M-112 designation on the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways was replaced by US12.

Imposed organizational <b>change</b> <b>is</b> predicted in circumstances where the desired <b>change</b> <b>is</b> not urgent, the loss of accepting lower offers than in the past is above a certain level, and the costs of imposed <b>change</b> <b>are</b> lower than the costs of delay.

Voluntary organizational change occurs immediately when the desired <b>change</b> <b>is</b> perceived to be urgent. Case studies are presented along these lines of thought. ...|$|R
