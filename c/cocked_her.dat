60|$|She {{opened her}} eyes very wide and <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head on one side, looking at him with indescribable archness.|$|E
6000|$|Jenny Wren <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> tail {{up in that}} saucy way of {{hers and}} winked at Johnny Chuck. [...] "The way he can fly," [...] said she softly.|$|E
60|$|Instantly Jenny Wren popped {{her head}} out of her doorway. She <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head on one side to listen, then looked down at Peter, and her sharp little eyes snapped.|$|E
60|$|The {{old lady}} rose, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> black eyebrows and her silver crest at us for an instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's this?" [...] cried Mrs. Tuke, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> head on one side. [...] "Music! A mandoline! How extraordinary! Do {{you think}} it's a serenade?--" [...] And {{she lifted her}} brows archly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's a great secret, but Maura {{told me in}} the cloakroom. It {{is because}} Mr. Frank wants to be her---to be her---her admirer,' said Valetta, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> head on one side, and adding to the already crimson colour of her cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Minnow <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head: [...] "Mister Picklepip," [...] she said, [...] "Do {{you ever}} think to wed?" [...] Town of Dae by the sea, [...] No fair lady ever made a [...] Wicked speech like that to me! ...|$|E
60|$|The mare {{had raised}} her head and <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> ears at the {{rustling}} of a quail in the thicket. Chris leaned over and rubbed around her ears. Dolly's enjoyment was evident, and she drooped her head over against the shoulder of his own horse.|$|E
60|$|So another donkey was procured, {{this time}} with a man's saddle, and putting her foot in the stirrup, she <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> leg over and took her seat triumphantly. Neither modesty nor bashfulness was to be {{reckoned}} among Liza's faults, and in this position she felt quite at ease.|$|E
40|$|Before long Sally Senior will <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> {{mortar board}} over her newly waved tresses, trip nonchalantly across the platform, receive a diploma with almost eager hands, and {{walk back to}} her seat as Sarah Alum. Graduation gifts she really likes will do much toward making the jump from Sally to Sarah seem the momentous and joyous {{occasion}} it really should be...|$|R
60|$|He heard lively {{voices from}} the library above. He entered a room to be lived in and be happy in, with a jolly fire on the hearth and {{friendly}} people on a big, brown davenport. Ruth Winslow smiled at him from behind the Colonial silver and thin cups on the tea-table, and as he saw her light-filled eyes, saw <b>her</b> <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> head gaily in welcome, he was again convinced {{that he had found}} a playmate.|$|R
40|$|Dores McCree {{made your}} day {{a little better}} {{whenever}} she walked into a room. When you talked with her, you knew her goal was simply to enjoy your company, not to {{get something out of}} you, and not to show herself off. She was good at talking and good at listening. She 2 Ì† 7 d <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> head slightly and ask questions to which she really cared about the answers. On more than one occasion, I had to jockey with others to be able to sit with her at a dinner...|$|R
60|$|The queer things my aunt {{said were}} {{nothing to the}} queer things she didn't say. I {{remember}} her in our drawing-room one day, and how she <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> eye--it's the only expression--at the India-rubber plant in a Doulton-ware pot which Marion had placed {{on the corner of}} the piano.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the black}} furrow {{of a field}} [...] I saw an old witch-hare this night; [...] And she <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> lissome ear, [...] And she eyed the moon so bright, [...] And she nibbled o' the green; [...] And I whispered 'Whsst! witch-hare,' [...] Away like a ghostie o'er the field [...] She fled, and left the {{moonlight}} there.|$|E
6000|$|Jenny Wren <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> pert little head on one side, and her sharp little eyes snapped. [...] "Why don't {{you learn}} to swim, Peter, like your cousin down in the Sunny South?" [...] she demanded. [...] "If {{he had been in}} your place, he would simply have plunged into the Smiling Pool and laughed at Reddy Fox." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rosamond <b>cocked</b> up <b>her</b> left eyebrow with an ineffably droll look, which {{encouraged}} Charlie to say, [...] "Such fierceness {{can only}} be prompted by personal experience. Look out, Rosamond!" ...|$|R
50|$|Anna LaCazio (born January 26, 1962) is an American vocalist, {{best known}} {{as a member of the}} American pop rock band <b>Cock</b> Robin. <b>Her</b> father was Italian and her mother Chinese.|$|R
60|$|These {{directions}} {{made the}} innkeeper's wife very uneasy. However, she said nothing, {{and began to}} roast the <b>cock,</b> while <b>her</b> husband {{did his best to}} make the man sleepy with wine, but all in vain.|$|R
6000|$|As a {{confession}} of Zo's first love, this was irresistible. Carmina burst out laughing. Zo indignantly claimed a hearing. [...] "I haven't done yet!" [...] she burst out. [...] "The boy dances. Like this." [...] She <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head, and slapped her thigh, and imitated the boy. [...] "And sometimes he sings!" [...] she cried with another outburst of admiration.|$|E
6000|$|It was not {{the wind}} at her back, it was the thrust of Bjornstam's scorn which carried her through town. She faced Juanita Haydock, <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head at Maud Dyer's brief nod, and came home to Bea radiant. She telephoned Vida Sherwin to [...] "run over this evening." [...] She lustily played Tschaikowsky--the virile chords an echo of the red {{laughing}} philosopher of the tar-paper shack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes--but I don't keer for that." [...] She <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> hat {{a little}} audaciously, but Brice noticed that her arms {{afterwards}} dropped {{at her side}} with the same weary gesture he had observed before. [...] "Whenever I go into shops it's always 'Yes, miss,' and 'No, miss,' and 'Certainly, Miss Dimwood.' Oh, they're mighty respectful. I reckon they allow that Snapshot Harry's rifle carries far." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{each has}} a little baby bird {{swimming}} behind it. Oh! there: the mother has <b>cocked</b> up <b>her</b> tail and dived, and the little one is swimming about looking for her! How it cries! It is afraid of the yacht.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cocks</b> played <b>her</b> first senior {{international}} test on 30 October 2013 in Stratford, Taranaki, New Zealand against Australia {{as part of}} the 2013 Oceania Cup. She {{scored the}} winning goal in the 3-2 match, with a field goal in the 60th minute.|$|R
60|$|Alas {{for poor}} Lavinia! no such resurrection was {{possible}} for her. Long after Mat had bravely donned the scarlet hose, <b>cocked</b> up <b>her</b> beaver and gone forth to festive scenes, her shipmate remained below in chrysalis state, fed by faithful Marie, visited by the ever-cheerful Amanda, and enlivened by notes and messages from fellow-sufferers in far-off cells.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} they came to Skalaholt, {{and there was the}} body buried, and the next after they set out for home. Finnward's heart was heavy, and his mind divided. He feared the dead wife and the living; he feared dishonour and he feared dispeace; and his will was like a sea-gull in the wind. Now he cleared his throat and made as if to speak; and at that Aud <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> eye and looked at the goodman mocking, and his voice died unborn. At the last, shame gave him courage.|$|E
60|$|Down in {{his little}} tunnels {{underneath}} the snow Danny Meadow Mouse felt perfectly safe from Reddy Fox, who would stop and dig frantically at the little round doorway where he had last seen Danny. But old Granny Fox knew all about those little tunnels, and she didn't waste any time digging at the doorways. Instead she <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> sharp little ears and listened with all her might. Now Granny Fox has very keen ears, oh, very keen ears, and she heard just what she hoped she would hear. She heard Danny Meadow Mouse running along one of his little tunnels under the snow.|$|E
60|$|She {{retained}} her hold, <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> weapon, {{and stepped}} back a pace from the door. The blue sleeve {{was followed by the}} rest of the overcoat, and a blue cap with the infantry blazoning, and the letter H on its peak. They were for the moment more distinguishable than the man beneath them--grimed and blackened with the slime of the Marsh. But what could be seen of his mud-stained face was more grotesque than terrifying. A combination of weakness and audacity, insinuation and timidity struggled through the dirt for expression. His small blue eyes were not ill-natured, and even the intruding arm trembled more from exhaustion than passion.|$|E
60|$|I {{hammered}} fresh charges into my pistols after I {{had turned}} this {{over in my}} head. Then I put {{them back in the}} holsters, and I examined my little mare, she jerking <b>her</b> head and <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> ears the while, as if to tell me that an old soldier like herself did not make a fuss about a scratch or two. The first shot had merely grazed her off-shoulder, leaving a skin-mark, as if she had brushed a wall. The second was more serious. It had passed through the muscle of her neck, but already it had ceased to bleed. I reflected that if she weakened I could mount Montluc's grey, and meanwhile I led him along beside us, for he was a fine horse, worth fifteen hundred francs at the least, {{and it seemed to me}} that no one had a better right to him than I.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{wherefore}} {{should not}} I {{go to the}} wars," [...] she cried, [...] "and fight beside the Maid? I am as tall as she, if scantly so strong, and brave--oh, I am very brave Glacidas, I bid you beware!" [...] she said, putting the archer's bonnet gallantly <b>cocked</b> on <b>her</b> beautiful head, and drawing forth the sword from his scabbard, as one in act to fight, but in innocent unwarlike wise.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hell hath no fury!!! Ms. Arthur indulges <b>her</b> <b>cock</b> rock {{tendencies in}} {{throbbing}} tracks that sooth the burn of traumatic social encounters and occupational ennui. Features remixes of the 2 Skinnee J's, Stave, and Bicycle Thieves." ...|$|R
60|$|Observing {{me sitting}} there, they lowered their voices. Evidently {{she wanted him}} to put the brick down and leave her to think. She was not quite sure where she would have it. He, on the other hand, was sure he had found the right place for it. He pointed it out to her and {{explained}} his views. Other birds quarrel a good deal during nest building, but swallows are the gentlest of little people. She let him put it where he wanted to, and he kissed her and ran out. She <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> eye after him, watched till he was out of sight, then deftly and quickly slipped it out and fixed it {{the other side of the}} door.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems," [...] {{said the}} Earl of Derby, [...] "that old England {{who takes a}} frolicsome brain-fever once {{every two or three}} years, for the benefit of her doctors, and the {{purification}} of the torpid lethargy brought on by peace and prosperity, is now gone stark staring mad on the subject of a real or supposed Popish plot. I read one programme on the subject, by a fellow called Oates, and thought it the most absurd foolery I ever perused. But that cunning fellow Shaftesbury, and some others amongst the great ones, having taken it up, and are driving on at such a rate as makes harness crack, and horses smoke for it. The King, who has sworn never to kiss the pillow his father went to sleep on, temporises, and gives way to the current; the Duke of York, suspected and hated on account of his religion, is about to be driven to the continent; several principal Catholic nobles are in the Tower already; and the nation, like a bull at Tutbury-running, is persecuted with so many inflammatory rumours and pestilent pamphlets, that she has <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> tail, flung up her heels, taken the bit betwixt her teeth and is as furiously unmanageable as in the year 1642." ...|$|E
6000|$|The big {{parade of}} all the thirty {{thousand}} men was held that afternoon, and Vixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of Afghanistan, with high, big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great diamond star in the center. The {{first part of the}} review was all sunshine, and the regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving together, and guns all in a line, till our eyes grew dizzy. Then the cavalry came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter of [...] "Bonnie Dundee," [...] and Vixen <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> ear where she sat on the dog-cart. The second squadron of the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his tail like spun silk, his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and one back, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as smoothly as waltz music. Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two other elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while twenty yoke of oxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and they looked rather stiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy the mule carried himself as though he commanded all the troops, and his harness was oiled and polished till it winked. I gave a cheer all by myself for Billy the mule, but he never looked right or left.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of the daughter of the last Navajo chief, Chief Manuelito, ca. 1901. From the waist up. She sits outside in front of an adobe brick wall. A blanket with a stripe and diamond pattern is pulled around her shoulders and over her lap. She is wearing a dark shirt, long beaded necklaces around her neck, and bracelets on both forearms. <b>Her</b> head is <b>cocked</b> to <b>her</b> left as she peers straight ahead...|$|R
60|$|By {{and by the}} Painted Lady {{came along}} the road. She was a little woman, brightly dressed, so fragile that a collie might have knocked her over with his tail, {{and she had a}} {{beautiful}} white-and-pink face, the white ending of a sudden {{in the middle of her}} neck, where it met skin of a duller color. As she tripped along with mincing gait, she was speaking confidentially to herself, but when she saw Dite grinning, she seemed, first, afraid, and then sorry for herself, and then she tried to carry it off with a giggle, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> head impudently at him. Even then she looked childish, and a faded guilelessness, with many pretty airs and graces, still lingered about her, like innocent birds loath to be gone from the spot where their nest has been. When she had passed monotony again reigned, and Dite crossed to the smithy window, though none of the letters could be for him. He could read the addresses on six of them, but the seventh lay on its back, and every time he rose on his tip-toes to squint down at it, the spout pushed his bonnet over his eyes.|$|R
60|$|I cannot however, but observe {{here with}} some regret, how it appears by the consequence, that the Devil was not mistaken when he made an early {{judgment}} of Mrs. Eve; and how Satan really went {{the right way to}} work, to judge of her; 'tis certain the Devil had nothing to do but to look in her face, and upon a near steady view he might easily see there, an instrument for his Turn; nor has he fail'd to make her a Tool ever since, by the very methods which he at first proposed; to which, perhaps, he has made some additions in the corrupting her composition, as well as her understanding; qualifying her to be a compleat snare to the poor weaker vessel MAN; to wheedle him with her Syren's voice, abuse him with her smiles, delude him with her crocodile tears, and sometimes <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> crown at him, and terrify him with the thunder of her TREBLE; making the effeminated Male Apple-eater tremble at the noise of that very Tongue, which at first commanded him to Sin. For it is yet a debate which the Learned have not decided, whether she persuaded and entreated him, or like a true she-tyrant, exercised her authority and oblig'd him to eat the forbidden fruit.|$|R
