500|$|During the mid 19th century, Galveston, {{though not}} a large city by world standards, emerged as an {{international}} city with immigration and trade from around the U.S. and around the world. The island has sometimes been called the [...] "Ellis Island of the West" [...] {{as it was the}} primary point of entry for European immigrants settling in the western United States. German immigration during this period was so great that the German language became a <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> <b>language</b> on the city's streets. The immigrants were not simply the poor or the oppressed seeking refuge but many of the educated, middle class.

2500|$|MTM Enterprises {{developed}} the series {{on behalf of}} NBC, appointing Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll as series writers. The writers were allowed considerable creative freedom and created a series that brought together a number of emerging ideas in TV drama for the first time. Each episode featured a number of intertwined storylines, {{some of which were}} resolved within the episode, with others developing over a number of episodes throughout a season. The conflicts between the work lives and private lives of the individual characters were also large elements of storylines. The series featured a strong focus on the workplace struggle between [...] "what is right" [...] and [...] "what works". Almost every episode began with a pre-credit sequence (or [...] "teaser") consisting of (mission) [...] and roll call {{at the beginning of the}} day shift (from season three it experimented with a [...] "Previously on..." [...] montage of clips of up to six previous episodes before the roll call). Many episodes were written to take place over the course of a single day, and often concluded with Capt. Frank Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti) and public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel) in a domestic situation, often in bed, discussing how their respective days went. The series was notable for dealing with real-life issues and employing <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> <b>language</b> and slang to a greater extent than had been seen before, which brought a sense of verisimilitude to the production.|$|E

50|$|Another {{reason that}} {{dataflow}} systems never became popular is that compilers {{of the era}} {{found it difficult to}} work with common imperative languages like C++.

5000|$|At {{the time}} that people began using SLOC as a metric, the most <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> <b>languages,</b> such as FORTRAN and {{assembly}} language, were line-oriented languages. These languages were developed {{at the time when}} punched cards were the main form of data entry for programming. One punched card usually represented one line of code. It was one discrete object that was easily counted. It was the visible output of the programmer so it made sense to managers to count lines of code as a measurement of a programmer's productivity, even referring to such as [...] "card images". Today, the most <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> computer <b>languages</b> allow a lot more leeway for formatting. Text lines are no longer limited to 80 or 96 columns, and one line of text no longer necessarily corresponds to one line of code.|$|R
