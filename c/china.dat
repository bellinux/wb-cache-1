40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines strategic motivations {{and implications of}} the international expansion of <b>China's</b> maritime shipping industry (MSI). <b>China's</b> economic growth strategy depends upon maritime shipping to export foreign exchange earning commodities and import energy, industrial, and food resources. As a result, <b>China's</b> MSI is expanding faster than {{that of any other}} nation in the world. <b>China's</b> MSI expansion is creating regional shipping networks that increase levels of Sino-foreign trade (SFT) interdependence. The argument herein is that increases in SFT enhance Beijing's regional ability to advance <b>China's</b> economic, political and security interests. The analysis suggests <b>China's</b> foreign policy and overseas investment in strategic resources increase levels of SFT and transportation requirements for <b>China's</b> MSI. <b>China's</b> MSI expansion impacts regional shipping services, schedules, and prices in <b>China's</b> favor. The analysis also suggests <b>China's</b> dependencies on regional MSI and SFT networks increases Beijing's sense of maritime economic vulnerability to perceived threats in international waters. <b>China's</b> maritime security policy and recent naval deployments are examined to assess the potential for <b>China's</b> Navy to protect <b>China's</b> MSI in regions where levels of SFT are high. <b>China's</b> desire to protect its MSI offers opportunities for Sino-U.

The establishment of a socialist state in <b>China</b> (People's Republic of <b>China)</b> on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong's open border to mainland <b>China.</b> In 1951, a boundary zone was demarked as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist <b>China.</b> Border posts along the north of Hong Kong began operation in 1953 to regulate the movement of people and goods {{into and out of the}} territory.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} fulfil three major research objectives {{situated in the}} context of <b>China’s</b> media going-global project from 2009 : firstly, clarifying <b>China’s</b> political articulation of China-related economic responsibilities; secondly, uncovering <b>China’s</b> media representation of the same issue; thirdly, examining Western countries’ media representation of the same issue and detecting the potential influence of <b>China’s</b> media discourse on Western journalistic representations. They are generated from the following considerations. In studies of <b>China’s</b> responsible power claim, scholars in international politics and relations tried to gauge <b>China’s</b> behaviours with certain standards. Only a limited number of studies explored the political ideas behind <b>China’s</b> behaviours. Moreover, seldom research in the discipline of media probed into the mediation of China-related economic responsibilities through aspects of media texts, construction, and impact. This research aims to bridge these gaps. The inquiries of political articulation and media representation need to be contextually explored. Therefore, this study mainly applies Norman Fairclough’s (1995) framework for critical discourse analysis, which is complemented with a political economic perspective in examining the immediate situational and institutional environment surrounding relevant Chinese and Western media. The policies were retrieved from <b>China’s</b> central government online portal. The media analysis focuses on media texts and practitioners in <b>China’s</b> Xinhua News Agency, USA’s The Wall Street Journal, and UK’s Financial Times. The research findings show that <b>China’s</b> political articulation of China-related economic responsibilities was consistent with <b>China’s</b> sociocultural understandings of responsibility. <b>China’s</b> media representation was congruent with <b>China’s</b> political discourse and its media practitioners confirmed the constraining influence of the Chinese government on external communication. Nevertheless, <b>China’s</b> media discourse yielded trivial influence on Western media representations. This study makes breakthrough in exploring the path of the message of China-related economic responsibilities from aspects of its construction and impact. It also has implications for future external communication...|$|R
