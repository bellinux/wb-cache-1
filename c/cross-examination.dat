5|$|During the {{subsequent}} trial of George Pettibone, Darrow conducted a powerful <b>cross-examination</b> against Orchard, before falling ill and {{withdrawing from the}} trial, leaving Judge Hilton of Denver {{in charge of the}} defense. After a second jury acquitted Pettibone, the charges against Moyer were dropped.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant <b>cross-examination</b> by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under <b>cross-examination,</b> both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Another {{one of the}} men {{gave the}} {{surprising}} testimony that Lieutenant Commander Coakley had threatened to have him shot after he refused to answer some questions during interrogation at Camp Shoemaker. Seaman Alphonso McPherson held fast to his testimony even when faced by Coakley in <b>cross-examination.</b> Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E

50|$|Gladys Towles Root (1905 - 1982) was a {{successful}} criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles, known for her piercing <b>cross-examinations.</b> Root was forced to specialize in sexual assault and murder cases because no other work was available to her.|$|R
5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow <b>cross-examination</b> of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of <b>cross-examination.</b> When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's <b>cross-examination</b> of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|The Earps {{hired an}} {{experienced}} trial lawyer, Thomas Fitch, as defense counsel. Wyatt {{testified that he}} drew his gun only after Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury went for their pistols. He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to disarm the cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during <b>cross-examination</b> that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his questions, or in which they {{said they could not}} remember.|$|E
5000|$|Chauvinism {{is seen by}} some as an {{influential}} factor in the TAT, a psychological personality test. Through <b>cross-examinations,</b> the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the [...] "potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation" [...] for women.|$|R

5000|$|Other notable <b>cross-examinations</b> {{conducted}} by White in the ‘Military 1’ case include former Rwandan prime minister Jean Kambanda, Colonel Luc Marchal [...] of the Belgian Armed Forces, and Joseph Nzirorera {{the former head}} of the MRND political party and the president of the National Assembly.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cross-examination</b> of him {{and other}} {{witnesses}} by Birkett swayed the jury, and they took only fifteen minutes to find Rouse guilty of murder. After his appeal had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, Rouse {{admitted that he had}} in fact committed the murder– although he never gave a reason– it was theorised that he had done so in an attempt to fake his own death. Despite his admission of guilt the identity of the victim has never been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{standardized}} {{procedures for}} testimony by forensic chemists {{are provided by}} the various agencies that employ the scientists as well as SWGDRUG. Forensic chemists are ethically bound to present testimony in a neutral manner and {{to be open to}} reconsidering their statements if new information is found. Chemists should also limit their testimony to areas they have been qualified in regardless of questions during direct or <b>cross-examination.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to <b>cross-examination</b> {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
50|$|In the {{prosecution}} testimonies {{there are many}} <b>cross-examinations,</b> each witness was actually further inquired. However, {{it is not clear}} who did this, it could have been Baretti himself, the judge or even a lawyer. Shoemaker pointed out that prosecution lawyers first appeared at the Old Bailey in around the 1730s, followed almost immediately by lawyers for the defense, so by the time Baretti was prosecuted there might have been one of them present in the court. Moreover, it is necessary to consider that for most eighteenth century interventions of lawyers are not reported or are unclear in The Proceedings. The possibility that Baretti had a lawyer who carried out all the <b>cross-examinations</b> we read in the trial transcription is therefore not to be excluded.|$|R
25|$|Corday {{underwent}} {{three separate}} <b>cross-examinations</b> by senior revolutionary judicial officials, including the President of the Revolutionary Tribunal {{and the chief}} prosecutor. She stressed {{that she was a}} republican and had been so even before the Revolution, citing the values of ancient Rome as an ideal model.|$|R
50|$|Based on the {{evidence}} of Queensberry's detectives and Carson's <b>cross-examinations</b> of Wilde at the trial, Wilde was subsequently prosecuted for gross indecency in a second trial. He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to two years' hard labour, after which he moved to France, where he died penniless.|$|R
5|$|In his <b>cross-examination</b> {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} {{psychological}} reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during <b>cross-examination</b> of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E
5|$|Michael Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in December 1995 to treat an abscess {{in his brain}} caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would not survive the proceedings, and knowing that his testimony was key to their case, prosecutors videotaped his testimony beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under <b>cross-examination</b> by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green had contributed to {{the problems in the}} couple's marriage and that his relationship with his son had been so adversarial that they had sometimes come to blows.|$|E
60|$|Madge, therefore, uninterrupted, went on {{with the}} wild disjointed chat which her {{rambling}} imagination suggested; a mood {{in which she was}} much more communicative respecting her own history, and that of others, than when there was any attempt made, by direct queries, or <b>cross-examinations,</b> to extract information on these subjects.|$|R

40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that {{opposite}} opinions of persons professing to be experts may be obtained to any amount; and it often occurs that not only days but even weeks, are consumed in <b>cross-examinations,</b> to test the skill or knowledge of such witnesses and the correctness of their opinions, wasting the time and wearying th...|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to <b>cross-examination</b> would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E
5|$|The case of Gruban v Booth {{opened on}} 7 May 1917 in the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice {{in front of}} Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington {{represented}} Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts. While both Rigby Smith and Douglas Hogg were highly respected barristers, Booth's <b>cross-examination</b> by Hastings was so skilfully done that the jury took only ten minutes to find that he had been fraudulent; they awarded Gruban £4,750 (about £ in 2015).|$|E
5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court because the notation indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) that the trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on <b>cross-examination</b> were prejudicial.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{counterfeiting}} {{being considered}} high treason, punishable by hanging, drawing and quartering, convicting {{even the most}} flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. Undaunted, Newton conducted more than 100 <b>cross-examinations</b> of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. He himself gathered much of the evidence he needed to successfully prosecute 28 coiners.|$|R

They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious <b>cross-examinations.</b>|$|R
500|$|Admitted to the Illinois bar in 1836, {{he moved}} to Springfield, Illinois, and began to {{practice}} law under John T. Stuart, Mary Todd's cousin. Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with {{a reputation as a}} formidable adversary during <b>cross-examinations</b> and closing arguments. He partnered with Stephen T. Logan from 1841 until 1844. Then Lincoln began his practice with William Herndon, whom Lincoln thought [...] "a studious young man".|$|R
5|$|The {{defendants}} argued: (1) {{that the}} indictment {{should have been}} quashed because {{of the absence of}} women from the grand jury; (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court; (3) that the indictment was duplicitous, inconsistent, and vague; (4) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (5) that the trial judge should have granted a continuance, rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske; (6) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants; (7) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay; (7) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent to the jury during its deliberations; (8) that Glasser had been cross-examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination; (9) that the <b>cross-examination</b> of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted; (10) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced; (11) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske; (12) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted; (13) that the admission of various prejudicial evidence had the cumulative effect of denying the defendants a fair trial; (14) that the trial judge's <b>cross-examination</b> of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy; and (15) that the trial judge should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women from the jury pool.|$|E
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and <b>cross-examination</b> of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E
5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his <b>cross-examination</b> of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Proudie, {{though she}} had {{contrived}} to lend her assistance in recapitulating the palatial dilapidations, had not on that account given up her hold of Mr. Harding, nor ceased from her <b>cross-examinations</b> as to the iniquity of Sabbatical amusements. Over and over again had she thrown out her [...] "Surely, surely," [...] at Mr. Harding's devoted head, and ill had that gentleman been able to parry the attack.|$|R
500|$|Coakley's <b>cross-examinations</b> {{began with}} an attempt to have the signed {{statements}} admitted as evidence. Veltmann objected that each statement was obtained under duress and was not voluntary. Coakley characterized the statements as not being confessions requiring voluntary conditions but merely [...] "admissions" [...] that had no such requirement. Osterhaus ruled that Coakley could not introduce the statements as evidence but that he could ask the defendants questions based on what each man's signed statement contained.|$|R
