40|$|This {{research}} was pursued {{to study the}} relationship between construction project complexity and project team integration. Construction projects exhibit several dimensions of complexity, including building system complexity, site <b>complexity,</b> <b>and</b> <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> It was shown that project teams could work more effectively if these complexities are identified and an appropriate mechanism for integration is implemented. The study began with {{the identification of the}} specific dimensions of complexity that are relevant to design and construction, and the definition of integration mechanisms that can be used by project teams. It was expected that high complexity requires high levels of integration, except when familiarity and high levels of trust exist within the project team. Low levels of complexity do not require integration. Using the dimensions of complexity and the measures of integration, this theory was tested through the in-depth study of seventeen building projects. This empirical study was conducted through the use of detailed personal interviews of critical participant...|$|E

A grounded-theory-building cross-case analytic approach {{is used to}} acquire {{a deeper understanding of}} customer collaboration in product development within the Chinese context. The results show that the firm level analysis in multiple cases helps identify different techniques of customer collaboration in product development. The two coordination dimensions (information exchange and co-development) are clearly demonstrated in three stages (concept generation, <b>project</b> execution, <b>and</b> product usage) and two directions. In particular, it has been found that the focal firms involve cosupplier in the process of customer collaboration. Building on RBV and interorganizational learning theory, a customer collaboration-operational capability model is hereby proposed. Two operational capabilities (supply chain operating capability and integrated product development capability) and contingencies (technology/market familiarity and service proactiveness) are also identified based on case evidences. In this final study, the impacts of <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> novelty on product design collaboration are tested. Three types of involvement activities (customer, supplier, and manufacturing involvement) are identified as product design collaboration in NPD project. A conceptual model is then built based on organizational information processing theory (OIPT). The relationships are tested in the international samples from eight countries, and the results demonstrate the different roles of involvement activities in dealing with <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> novelty. Particularly, <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> has direct impact on manufacturing involvement. <b>Project</b> <b>complexity</b> has indirect impact on customer and supplier involvement through manufacturing involvement. In addition, only project novelty has direct impact on customer and supplier involvement. In this study, the impacts of internal and external resources, as well as their interactions on the product innovation capability of Chinese manufacturers are investigated. Three internal resources (financial, physical, and human) and two external resources (external expert <b>and</b> cooperated <b>project)</b> are identified as antecedents of firm product innovation capability. The conceptual model is then built based on resource-based view (REV) and absorptive capacity (ACAP). Panel data from the Guangdong Technology and Innovation Assessment Center are used to test the relationships in the model. The results show that internal and external resources have different impacts on product innovation capability. Moreover, the interactions between internal resources and external resources significantly influence product innovation capability.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} tendency {{to draw attention to the}} particular challenges posed by complex projects. At the same time, <b>complexity</b> in <b>and</b> of <b>projects</b> has emerged as a theme for discussion and debate in response to growing concern about the dominance of various versions of control theory, operations research, systems theory, and instrumentalism in studies of <b>projects,</b> <b>project</b> management, <b>and</b> <b>project</b> settings in general. Research and critique have questioned the relevance of the traditional project management research to the challenges experienced in contemporary project environments at three levels: (1) discrepancy between “project management best practice” recommendations and what is really being enacted in practice; (2) observations of paradoxical, unintended consequences in practice that emerge from following the project management prescriptions in “the book”; and (3) the need for alternative theoretical conceptualizations <b>and</b> thinking about <b>projects</b> <b>and</b> <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> in practice. This paper reports on research, undertaken with support from the Project Management Institute, that aims to contribute to the theoretical basis of the field of project management, by examining the landscape of “complexity theory” and illuminating those developments within it that have high relevance to project management, notably the concept of “complex responsive processes of relating in organizations” (CRPR).

40|$|The {{context in}} which {{projects}} operate constantly influences the way <b>projects</b> are structured <b>and</b> managed. Due to increasing movements owing to global development, projects are becoming dispersed on multi sites where people and tasks are distributed. Coupled with the inherent complexity of development, complex projects become even more complex. Thus, the location of work <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> are considered contextual factors that moderate how projects are managed. Studying {{the impact of these}} factors on project performance is of significant importance. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to contribute to the body of knowledge of project management research by offering {{a better understanding of the}} impacts of contextual factors on projects’ success. This is achieved through the development of a contingent model that has the potential to deal with the variability and constraints imposed by the extent of the location of work <b>and</b> <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> In this research, a model is proposed based on the assumptions of contingency theory. A contingent approach was adopted in order to theorise the influences of the work’s location <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> as contingency factors on the relationship between structure <b>and</b> performance of <b>projects.</b> Moreover, the impact of ICT use on <b>project</b> performance <b>and</b> its mediating role between a <b>project’s</b> structure <b>and</b> performance was also addressed. A conceptual model was developed which divided projects into four types: Simple Co-located, Simple Dispersed, Complex Co-located, <b>and</b> Complex Dispersed <b>projects.</b> These types were the results of two continuums of project context: Location of Work <b>and</b> <b>Project</b> <b>Complexity.</b> Each quadrant suggests that when a <b>project’s</b> location of work <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> are at certain levels, its structural and technological characteristics are fitted in a certain way to achieve a successful project performance.

40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>complexity</b> is a {{term that}} is not well {{understood}} {{in the construction industry}} in relation to academia <b>and</b> practice. <b>Project</b> <b>complexity</b> often refers to a measurement of the number of <b>project</b> elements <b>and</b> interactions between <b>project</b> elements or a relative comparison of difficulty to what was previously accomplished. <b>Project</b> <b>complexity</b> is a very critical factor that presents additional challenges to achieving project objectives. Impacts of <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> can be negative if it is not assessed and managed appropriately. Developing a methodology to assess <b>and</b> measure <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> can help <b>project</b> teams increase the likelihood of success <b>and</b> predictable <b>project</b> outcomes. This research proposed a constructive approach to assess <b>and</b> measure <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> as a separate factor influencing projects including a model that helps identify the levels of <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> In this research, first, the concepts of <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> its attributes were explored, and the literature relevant to defining <b>and</b> assessing <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> was studied. A working definition of <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> was then developed as a basis for describing <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> <b>Project</b> <b>complexity</b> was intentionally described in terms of managing projects rather than project physical features such as facility technology, types of materials, or project physical components to ensure that the research results could be generalized across a wide range of industry sectors. The possible <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> attributes were then identified using complexity theory variables, the literature review results, and industry experience. The identified complexity attributes were used to develop the complexity indicators deemed to measure the associated attributes. The developed complexity indicators were then converted to survey questions for data collection purpose. The collected data was analyzed using statistical methods to test the significance of complexity indicators in differentiating low <b>complexity</b> <b>projects</b> from high <b>complexity</b> <b>projects.</b> The research result showed that thirty-seven complexity indicators associated with twenty-three complexity attributes were significant. These significant complexity indicators were considered to be truly representative of <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> The thirty seven significant indicators were then used as the input for the model development process. The model developed in this research is a binary logistic regression that predicts the probability of high complexity or low complexity given the values of complexity indicators. In the research, the multivariable analysis was used as the method to develop the model, and the univariate method was used as an approach to selecting a subset of explanatory variables. The univariate method resulted in a set of 27 complexity indicators out of 37 initial significant indicators that functioned as the measures of <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> To generate the required input for the proposed model, the variable reduction process called Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was applied during the model development process {{to reduce the number of}} explanatory variables. PCA process resulted in a significantly smaller number of principal components functioning as the moderating variables in the model (10 PCs). However, this number of moderating variables was still not small enough to create a stable model. Therefore, the univariate method was applied the second time to the set of principle components. The second application of univariate method resulted in the final set of 8 principle components. Those principle components functioned as the final set of moderating variables in the developed model as it was sufficient to generate a stable model. This process helped in generating a numerically stable model while the subject observations were limited. The developed model helps scholars and practitioners in the field of <b>project</b> management assess <b>complexity</b> level of a project based on the applicably identified complexity measures. Given the identified <b>complexity</b> levels, <b>project</b> practitioners can facilitate the management process and formulate a management plan by applying an appropriate complexity management strategy...|$|R

One {{of the reasons for}} poor performance was assigned to <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> A combination of lean construction <b>and</b> agile <b>project</b> management are hypothesized as a possible solution to cope with <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> In this paper we aim to understand if the implicit usage of lean and agile help coping with complexity. The research was done by means of correlation analysis on data gathered from a structured questionnaire (67 responses). In total, 51 significant correlations among 255 possible relations were found. To reduce the number of variables, factor analysis was performed. Correlation analysis on the defined factors showed 8 significant correlations among 25 relations. Several lean and agile elements were shown to significantly correlate to either reducing complexity or managing complexity. It was therefore concluded that these are promising to cope with <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> improve <b>project</b> performance, which is to be confirmed in subsequent research...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of a growing social complexification, {{projects}} have evolved in the pastdecades from simple endeavours to complex and uncertain undertakings. Consequently,project complexity has emerged as an important research direction, <b>and</b> recently severalproject <b>complexity</b> frameworks have been suggested. However, little research has beendone in this area and there has been no study on the relationship of project complexity,in its holistic sense, and the risk of delay. Therefore, the study investigates the intricaterelationship between <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> <b>project</b> delay. The research is conducted in{{the context of}} Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP) implementation projects,which are inherently complex and often record delays. The study has a qualitative nature and adopts an inductive approach. Nine ERPimplementationprojects have been studied in order to answer the research question. Several sources of evidence (semi-structured interviews and questionnaires) have beenutilized to ensure the credibility of the research findings through triangulation. The study contributes to the research field by verifying and augmenting the existingframeworks on reasons for <b>project</b> delay, <b>complexity</b> categories <b>and</b> their interplay. Itwas identified that complexity in a holistic sense represents a necessary condition forproject delay. Moreover, the study showed that although ERP projects are oftenconsidered to be technically complex, their complexity stems mainly from ‘subjective’(or perceived) <b>and</b> ‘uncertainty’ <b>complexity</b> dimensions. Finally, the conceptual modelof Eden et al. (2005) was modified to reflect the findings of the study...|$|R
40|$|Megaprojects are characterised {{by their}} {{large-scale}} capital expenditure, long duration and significant levels of technical <b>and</b> process <b>complexity.</b> Empirical {{data show that}} megaprojects in the energy sector experience alarming rates of failure, such as cost overruns, delays in completion and production shortfalls. One of the main causes of failure is their high level of <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> the absence of effective tools to assess <b>and</b> manage it. <b>Project</b> <b>complexity</b> has received increasing attention in recent years, both in academia and the industry. However, {{there is still a}} lack of consensus on a clear definition for ‘project complexity’ or a comprehensive list of complexity indicators, specifically for energy megaprojects. Furthermore, there is also a lack of a widely accepted assessment method to measure <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> in a quantitative manner. This study is carried out in response to these problems. First, it develops a taxonomy of <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> indicators {{on the basis of a}} comprehensive review and synthesis of existing literature. It includes 51 internal <b>and</b> external <b>Project</b> <b>Complexity</b> Indicators (PCIs) in a logical hierarchical structure; these indicators specify the aspects that need to be measured when assessing <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> Second, weights for all indicators are established through an integrated Delphi-AHP method, with the participation of 20 international experts. Finally, the study specifies Numerical Scoring Criteria (NSCs) for all indicators based on a synthesis of existing knowledge about megaprojects. The criteria specify the scoring thresholds, on a 1 - 5 scale, for each indicator. These three components constitute a new <b>Project</b> <b>Complexity</b> Assessment (PCA) method, which is implemented as a spreadsheet PCA tool. The developed tool allows a project team to assess <b>and</b> score their <b>project</b> in each of the PCIs against the defined criteria. It then calculates two separate complexity indices for internal and external factors; the results indicate the complexity level of the <b>project.</b> <b>Complexity</b> profiles are also produced to illustrate the complexity scores of different categories of PCIs. The PCA method is tested using an energy megaproject case study. The results demonstrate not only that the tool can help a project team understand the <b>complexity</b> of their <b>project,</b> but also it can help the team to develop appropriate complexity management strategies by comparing the assessment results of different projects...|$|R
40|$|All {{projects}} deliver value, {{even those}} that fail: It is the lessons that project professionals learn from failed projects that often teaches them how they can best use the discipline's tools and techniques. This paper examines previously published catastrophic projects, endeavors that were managed well but which far exceeded the defined budget. In doing so, it first discusses <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> <b>project</b> uncertainty in relation to standard project management techniques; it then examines the systemic and soft effects shaping <b>project</b> behavior <b>and</b> subsequently explores the relationship between <b>project</b> disruptions <b>and</b> feedback. Following this, it looks at The Strathclyde Process and compares it to the ways that project professionals analyze <b>project</b> risk <b>and</b> develop lessons learned activities. This paper subsequently describes how excessive overspending causes positive feedback loops and how apparently sensible project-management actions generate unexpected results. It then details the ways that complex projects behave, puts forward measures that can enable project managers to effectively and efficiently realize such initiatives, and questions the significance of using the PMBOK® Guide in executing projects. It closes by considering a more systemic view of <b>project</b> risk <b>and</b> concludes by suggesting that researchers and practitioners work to define a method that relates project management philosophy to metrics...|$|R
40|$|Essentially, {{performance}} evaluation {{is a human}} behavioural phenomenon involving a cognitive perceptual process. Project performance has two attributes, at least: (1) the individual's expected performance (manifested as assigned goals); and (2) the individual's perceived actual performance. Evaluation comprises the comparison of these two attributes. The present paper develops a research model for project outcome evaluation designed {{to examine the effects}} of the two moderators, goal commitment <b>and</b> <b>project</b> <b>complexity,</b> on the perceived project performance of project participants. It is postulated that: (1) there is a positive monotonic relationship between goal difficulty and performance, but that this is moderated by project complexity; (2) difficult goals lead to higher performance, but that this will happen only when the project participant is committed to the goal; and (3) the transferability of critical success factors to enhance/improve the performance of subsequent projects has to be examined and applied in the light of the effects of these two moderators on project performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of different Project Based Learning (PBL) approaches are presented in this paper. All of them were {{carried out in the}} framework of the MSc degree in Electronic Systems for Smart Environments from the University of Malaga. Four subjects were developed using different values of the three main parameters of PBL: teamwork, self-guided learning <b>and</b> <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> During two academic years, several indicators were used to evaluate these experiences: compliance with subject time schedules, scores obtained for the students, interaction of each student in his team and satisfaction of students with the experiences. Our results encourage the use of PBL in bachelor degrees but, at the same time, confirm that PBL implementation is not a trivial task when projects are complex or when a high level of autonomous learning is required from students. Teamwork difficulties have also been found. So, we discuss the need of reaching a minimum level of proficiency in some key competencies before using PBL...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe biggest {{challenge}} for business leaders today {{is making sure}} initiatives that are undertaken at the project level are aligned with the strategic and financial goals of their organizations. Unfortunately, business leaders who recognize the need to use tools to validate the business case of every initiative are finding relatively few truly viable options. Organizations are looking to implement a <b>project</b> <b>and</b> portfolio management (PPM) solution to help ensure they pursue only those projects that provide the greatest business value with the minimum or accepted organizational risk. This paper provides a practical framework in aligning business opportunities with overall project risk through an assessment process from the strategy, technology exposure, organizational change management, <b>and</b> communication, financial, <b>project</b> organization, <b>project</b> management <b>and</b> <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> point of view. In the proposed framework, if the project with an accepted risk matches the organizational business strategy, it will be forwarded {{for the rest of}} evaluation process in the Project Portfolio Management. To demonstrate the approach, a case study is conducted in one of the biggest Iranian Power Industry Contractors...|$|R
40|$|Este artigo apresenta uma análise das relações existentes entre as características das empresas e a importância que estas atribuem aos fatores que influenciam na transferência de conhecimentos (TC) entre projetos de produtos. A análise é baseada num levantamento (survey) realizado com 58 empresas no Brasil. As características estudadas foram: (i) tamanho da empresa; (ii) tamanho da equipe de projetos; (iii) localização das equipes; (iv) número de projetos simultâneos; (v) tempo de duração dos projetos; (vi) grau de inovação; e (vii) complexidade dos projetos. Através de uma análise de aglomerados, foi identificado que as características (ii), (iv) e (vii) são significativas na determinação das importâncias atribuídas aos fatores da TC. Os resultados apontam que as empresas que possuem um perfil de gestão mais complexo enfatizam os fatores de influência pertencentes ao ambiente externo. Já empresas com um perfil de gestão mais simples atribuem maior importância aos fatores internos da empresa. This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the relationship between company characteristics and the importance that companies attribute to the main factors that have influence on inter-product project knowledge transfer (KT). The analysis was based on a survey carried out on a sample of 58 companies that operate in Brazil. The studied characteristics of the companies were: (i) company size; (ii) project team size; (iii) team localization; (iv) number of concurrent projects; (v) project duration; (vi) <b>project</b> innovation <b>and</b> (vii) <b>project</b> <b>complexity.</b> It was possible to identify, using a cluster analysis, that project team size; number of concurrent <b>projects</b> <b>and</b> <b>project</b> <b>complexity</b> are statistically significant regarding the determination of attributed importance for the KT influence factors. The results revealed that companies that have a more complex management profile are more interested in influence factors of the external environment. On the other hand, companies that have a simpler management profile are more interested in influence factors of the internal environment...|$|R
