5|$|East of Brooks Avenue, NY33A {{passes through}} a small {{residential}} area before entering a more industrial neighborhood surrounding the Erie <b>Canal</b> <b>and</b> the Rochester city line. In the western portion of this area, the route meets I-390 at exit19 and intersects Buell Road (County Route162), which directly links NY33A to the airport a half-mile (0.8km) to the south. East of I-390, NY33A crosses the Erie <b>Canal</b> <b>and</b> enters the city of Rochester, at which point maintenance of NY33A shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the city of}} Rochester. On the northern bank of the waterway, the route passes under the Rochester and Southern Railroad. The surroundings become significantly more residential east of the railroad as the route heads northeastward toward downtown Rochester. However, NY33A ends roughly one mile (1.6km) west of downtown at a junction with NY33 (West Avenue). Here, Chili and West Avenues converge and NY33 continues toward downtown as West Main Street.|$|E

5|$|Just before Godnow Swing Bridge, the {{northern}} soak drain {{crosses to the}} north side of the railway. As the canal approaches Ealand there are some large lakes to the north, which are now used for sailing. Crowle Bridge carries the A161 road over the railway and the <b>canal,</b> <b>and</b> Crowle railway station is sandwiched between the <b>canal</b> <b>and</b> the North Soak Drain. A little further east are the remains of Crowle railway bridge. It carried the Axholme Joint Railway over the <b>canal,</b> <b>and</b> consisted of four arches built from bricks, with a central swinging section, to allow keels to sail along the canal. The bridge was retained after the railway was closed in 1966, because stators from Keadby Power Station were too heavy to be transported over the A161 road bridge. The stators were carried by road to Ealand, loaded onto the railway, and crossed the bridge to Belton, where they were transferred back to a road vehicle. The process became unnecessary when Lindsey County Council rebuilt the A161 bridge in 1970, and the railway bridge was demolished in 1972.|$|E
