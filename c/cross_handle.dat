6000|$|After the {{beautiful}} chant of the hymn was ended, the {{service for the}} Holy Communion began. When the time came for the offering, each noble gave gold or silver; and, lastly, Rainulf of Ferrieres {{came up to the}} step of the Altar with a cushion, on which was placed a circlet of gold, the ducal coronet; and another Baron, following him closely, carried a long, heavy sword, with a <b>cross</b> <b>handle.</b> The Archbishop of Rouen received both coronet and sword, and laid them on the Altar. Then the service proceeded. At that time the rite of Confirmation was administered in infancy, and Richard, who had been confirmed by his godfather, the Archbishop of Rouen, immediately after his baptism, knelt in solemn awe to receive the other Holy Sacrament from his hands, as soon as all the clergy had communicated. {8} ...|$|E

Astronomers initially had {{no reason to believe that}} there would be countless thousands of minor planets, and strove to assign a symbol to each new discovery, in the tradition of the symbols used for the major planets. For example, 1 Ceres was assigned a stylized sickle (⚳) 2 Pallas a lozenge with a <b>crossed</b> <b>handle</b> (⚴) 3 Juno a Venus mirror crowned by a star ( [...] , later became a star with a <b>crossed</b> <b>handle,</b> ⚵) and 4 Vesta a sacred fire altar (...)

50|$|Richard Newsham (died 1743) was an English inventor. He {{took out}} 2 patents for fire engines in 1721 and 1725 (Royal Patent Office 1721 patent #439 and 1725 patent #479) and soon {{dominated}} the fire engine market in England. The engine had two single-acting pistons and an air vessel {{placed in a}} tank which formed {{the frame of the}} machine. The pump was worked by people at the long <b>cross</b> <b>handles.</b> At the front of the engine, protected by a sheet of horn and a door, were directions for keeping the machine in order. The cistern could hold about 170 gal of water pumping up to 100 gal a minute. New York City imported its first two fire engines from Newsham in 1731. In 1737 Newsham made a manual fire pump for the Parish of Bray in Berkshire.|$|R
60|$|Although {{a number}} of the crew had not yet come off from shore, the Moslems still outnumbered their assailants, and, knowing that their consorts would soon come to their aid, they threw {{themselves}} in a body on the Christians. But in a hand-to-hand conflict like this, the knights of the Hospital were irresistible. Protected by their armour and long shields from the blows of their enemies' scimitars and daggers, their long, <b>cross</b> <b>handled</b> swords fell with irresistible force on turbaned head and coat-of-mail, and, maintaining regular order and advancing like a wall of steel along the deck, they drove the Moslems before them, and the combat would soon have terminated had not a shout been raised by one of the overseers of the slaves. One of the other ships had rowed alongside the galley, and the crew were already leaping on board it. At the same moment another ship came up alongside that they had boarded, while the fourth was maneuvering to bring up under her stern.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To apply and to {{evaluate}} the newly developed advanced fast marching algorithm (aFM) in vivo by reconstructing the human visual pathway, which is characterized by areas of extensive fiber crossing and branching, i. e., the optic chiasm and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion tensor images were acquired in 10 healthy volunteers. Due to the proximity to bony structures and air-filled spaces of the optic chiasm, a high sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reduction factor was applied to reduce image distortions in this area. To reconstruct the visual system, three different seed areas were chosen separately. The results obtained by the aFM tracking algorithm were compared and validated with known anatomy. RESULTS: The visual system could be reconstructed reproducibly in all subjects and the reconstructed fiber pathways are in good agreement with known anatomy. CONCLUSION: The present work shows that the advanced aFM, which is especially designed for overcoming tracking limitations within areas of extensive fiber <b>crossing,</b> <b>handles</b> the fiber <b>crossing</b> and branching within the optic chiasm and the LGN correctly, thus allowing {{the reconstruction of the}} entire human visual fiber pathway, from the intraorbital segment of the optic nerves to the visual cortex...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} the site and ensure the continuation of research, a simple method was used to explore the fields. This involved the location and mapping of these hidden walls by probing with iron rods with <b>cross</b> <b>handles.</b> (These were locally available {{as they had been}} previously used to probe for prehistoric fallen timber below the bog, subsequently dug up and used in this treeless landscape. The fallen trees revealed their location as surface bare patches during frosty weather. Probes were used to locate each end of the timber and, if the vibrations from the probe at one end being struck could be felt at the probe at the other end, the piece of timber had not shattered in falling and so was worth excavating.) The ensuing excavation of habitation sites and tombs reveals the way of life of people living 200 generations ago. They were a large community [...] of farmers who cleared hundreds of acres of pine forests, pollen from pine trees being present in the peat. Their main economy was cattle rearing but among them were also craftspeople and builders in both wood and stone.|$|R

5|$|The crossing's {{development}} {{started in}} the late 1930s, but was interrupted due to the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s. The original tunnel catered for a single lane of traffic in each direction, but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built. The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986, and this increased traffic {{put pressure on the}} tunnels' capacity. A Private Finance Initiative scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge. The combined <b>crossing</b> now <b>handles</b> four lanes of traffic in each direction.|$|R
50|$|An agile, {{consistent}} and athletic goalkeeper, Pagliuca was renowned for his excellent reactions and penalty-stopping abilities, {{as well as}} his accurate distribution of the ball. Although he was capable of coming off the line to <b>handle</b> <b>crosses,</b> he performed better between the posts. Nicknamed The Wall, he also distinguished himself by his strong temper.|$|R
50|$|Despite his {{relatively}} small stature for a goalkeeper, Bodini was {{a reliable and}} effective shot-stopper, who stood out for the consistency of his performances throughout his career.

5000|$|Apart from [...] "a {{moment of}} {{individual}} brilliance" [...] as Phillips [...] "nipped in {{to steal the}} loose ball and after nutmegging Ivar Ingimarsson advanced unchallenged {{to the edge of}} the area and lashed in a stinging low drive", Reading were in complete control as they replaced Birmingham in second place in the table with a 3-1 win at St Andrew's. At Ipswich Town on Boxing Day, McFadden converted Birmingham's first penalty of the season, awarded when Kemy Agustien's <b>cross</b> was <b>handled,</b> and Agustien himself came close to extending the lead with a powerful shot.

500|$|The Element {{system of}} Chrono <b>Cross</b> <b>handles</b> all magic, {{consumable}} items, and character-specific abilities. Elements unleash magic effects upon the enemy or party {{and must be}} equipped for use, much like the materia of 1997's Final FantasyVII. Elements can be purchased from shops or found in treasure chests littered throughout areas. Once acquired, they are allocated to a grid whose size and shape are unique to each character. They are ranked according to eight tiers; certain high level Elements can only be assigned on equivalent tiers in a character's grid. As the game progresses, the grid expands, allowing more Elements to be equipped and higher tiers to be accessed. Elements are divided into six paired oppositional types, or [...] "colors," [...] each with a natural effect. Red (fire/magma) opposes Blue (water/ice), Green (wind/flora) opposes Yellow (earth/lightning), and White (light/cosmos) opposes Black (darkness/gravity). Each character and enemy has an innate color, enhancing the power of using same-color Elements while also making them weak against elements of the opposite color. Chrono Cross also features a [...] "field effect", which keeps track of Element color used in the upper corner of the battle screen. If the field is purely one color, characters are able to unleash a powerful summon element {{at the cost of}} one the player's stars. The field will also enhance the power of Elements of the colors present, while weakening Elements of the opposite colors. Characters also innately learn some special techniques ("Techs") that are unique to each character but otherwise act like Elements. Like Chrono Trigger, characters can combine certain Techs to make more powerful Double or Triple Techs. Consumable Elements may be used to restore hit points or heal status ailments after battle.|$|R
