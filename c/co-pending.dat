50|$|Technically, double {{patenting}} can only exist between issued patents. However, {{double patenting}} objections may {{be raised by}} an examiner during an application's pendency. The position of the Patent Office is that such objections are raised as a courtesy; examiners are {{under no obligation to}} identify double patenting situations during prosecution. Canadian practice differs significantly from U.S. practice on this front, in that, once a double patenting objection is encountered, there is no statutory provision for terminal disclaimer in the Canadian Patent Act. Thus, terminal disclaimer is not available to overcome double patenting objections. Instead, the applicant must demonstrate (by arguing or amending the claims) that the claims are patentably distinct in view of those of the <b>co-pending</b> application.|$|E
40|$|In {{the roughly}} {{two years since}} inter partes review {{replaced}} inter partes reexamination, petitioners have filed almost two-thousand requests for the Patent Trial and Appeal Board to review the validity of issued U. S. patents. As partial data on inter partes review (IPR) has trickled out via the blogosphere, interest from patent practitioners and judges has grown to a fever (and sometimes fevered) pitch. To date, however, no commentator has collected a comprehensive set of statistics on IPR. Moreover, what little data currently exists focuses on overall institution and invalidation rates — data that, alone, gives us little idea whether IPR is thus far accomplishing its original goal of serving as a quick, efficient alternative to defending patent suits filed in federal court, particularly those initiated by non-practicing entities (NPEs). This Essay aims to fill both gaps by reporting the findings of an empirical study tracking the outcome of IPRs {{and their impact on}} <b>co-pending</b> litigation. As described in greater detail below, we find that: Petitions for IPR are instituted for at least one challenged claim 84 percent of the time; Among instituted IPRs, all challenged claims are instituted 74 percent of the time; Among IPRs that reach a final decision on the merits, all instituted claims are invalidated or disclaimed more than 77 percent of the time; IPRs challenging NPE-owned patents {{are more likely to be}} instituted and, on average, are instituted for a larger share of challenged claims, but have their claims invalidated at a lower rate; Litigation proceeding in parallel with an instituted IPR is stayed about 82 percent of the time. Though it is too early to draw sweeping conclusions from these statistics, they suggest that inter partes review promises to be considerably more potent than inter partes reexamination and, moreover, to have a substantial impact on <b>co-pending</b> patent litigation, particularly suits filed by NPEs...|$|E
40|$|In {{the roughly}} 20 {{months since the}} Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) was born, petitioners have filed over a {{thousand}} requests for inter partes review (IPR), roughly 200 of which {{have come to a}} final conclusion. To the surprise of many, early IPRs have overwhelmingly been decided in petitioners 2 ̆ 7 favor. Among IPRs in which the PTAB has issued a final written decision, 83 percent were instituted against all claims challenged by the petitioner and 76 percent concluded with the cancellation of all challenged claims. Overall, 94 percent of all claims instituted in an IPR decided on the merits have been cancelled. Though this data has already made quite a splash in the patent community, it alone tells us little about whether IPR is thus far accomplishing its original goal of serving as a quick, efficient alternative to defending patent suits filed in federal court, particularly those filed by non-practicing entities. This study aims to shed light on this question by pairing data on IPRs with data on the NPE-status of challenged patents 2 ̆ 7 owners and data on the timing and outcome of <b>co-pending</b> litigation...|$|E
40|$|In her Article, The Rise of the End User in Patent Litigation, Professor Bernstein {{makes the}} case for {{legislative}} and judicial action designed to protect technology users from abusive patent enforcement that exploits their relative lack of resources and technical knowledge. This Essay presents the findings of an empirical study designed {{to determine the extent}} to which this problem has been mitigated in recent months by inter partes review (“IPR”) —a reform signed into law more than three years ago but only now emerging as a powerful shield for those accused of patent infringement. My findings suggest that IPR has thus far proven to be a substantial benefit to downstream technology purchasers and other relatively small entities faced with infringement claims. I find that tech purchasers and small businesses have both been nearly as successful as large manufacturers at instituting reviews, halting <b>co-pending</b> litigation, and ultimately winning on the merits of their petitions. In addition, I observe that some manufacturers have filed IPR petitions to challenge patents asserted in court against their customers. However, despite the potential benefits of pursuing IPR, I find that technology purchasers appear to be substantially underrepresented among IPR petitioners, likely due to the high cost involved. Accordingly, additional reform measures may still be advisable to assist those particularly vulnerable to abusive litigation tactics...|$|E
