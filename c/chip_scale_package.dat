The package survived harsh environmental accelerated stress tests and showed only a slight reduction of the shear strength through void formation and small cracks within the lead frame that could be verified through FEM simulations. The stress on the bolometers is investigated by thermomechanical FEM simulations. Executed reliability tests showed no enlargement in the number of defect pixel. The sensor performance showed a longtime drift and temperature dependence through outgassing processes inside the package leading to a significant performance reduction. Thus this effect is investigated closer and possible countermeasures are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – <b>Chip</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>Packages</b> {{have become}} a major new {{packaging}} format in recent years. One of the first industries to embrace this package format is the mobile communications sector. CSP’s offer several advantages over leaded components, such as relatively small footprint, and can be processed with standard surface mount equipment. They have become so popular that CSP’s are now used in almost all phone designs. Originally {{it was believed that}} <b>chip</b> <b>scale</b> <b>packages</b> would not require underfilling to meet reliability requirements. However most manufacturers have found it necessary to underfill these devices, to be able to meet users expectations for reliable phones. As the functionality of mobile phone handset increases, the complexity of the handset system PCB increases. This is pushing component densities to higher levels and the space between the CSP and the nearest components is has been drastically reduced in recent years. This now requires that strategies for underfilling CSP’s include the effect of the adjacent passive components. This paper will review board construction materials and placement of CSP and adjacent passive components and look at their impact on the underfill process. We will also discuss underfill of components under radio frequency shields...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{developed}} and {{made use of}} the microDAC deformation measurement technique to determine strain fields on thermally stressed, cross sectioned FC and CSP specimens. The method allows to resolve strain fields inside tiny structures like e. g. solder interconnects or conductive adhesive layers. It bases on comparison of digitized micrographs obtained from different object load states. Optical, SEM and laser scanning microscopy are applied for image capture. The paper presents results of strain analysis in interconnects of different flip chip configurations and <b>chip</b> <b>scale</b> <b>package</b> types. E. g., global shear of outward bumps is almost completely suppressed in most of flip chip cases by underfilling. Furthermore, bump deformation can be strongly influenced by the local appearance of glass fabrics in organic laminates used as board materials. A main demand to <b>chip</b> <b>scale</b> <b>package</b> reliability is the avoidance of too large thermal solder ball strains, which lead to material fatigue. Different packages with rigid and flex interposers tackle the stress compensation problem in a different way. A first attempt is made to compare some of them basing on experimental strain and warpage measurements...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{demand for}} higher performance products with light weight and small dimensions is requiring levels of package performance of microelectronic devices unattainable by the molded plastic and ceramic packages {{of the past}} decade. These factors have driven a variety of major innovations in packaging technology (e. g. Organic Land Grid Array - OLGA; Flip Chip Pn Grid Array - FCPGA; µ-PGA; <b>Chip</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>Packaging</b> - CSP). Such packages have been introduced to combine flip chip interconnect with a very small form factor (physical outline) and socketability for compact and portable systems. Portability {{is expected to continue}} as a strong driver of new packaging approaches and the saved area on a PWB make new product features possible that will be used for sales promotion. For example altimeters and barometers appear already today in clocks and pocket knifes. So {{there is a need for}} fully linearized pressure sensor systems with little temperature shift and small form factor, i. e. calibrated pressure sensors ideally as CSP.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{melting point}} of Sn–Ag/Sn–Ag–Cu solders {{are higher than}} that of Sn–Pb solders by 30 C in particular. These in turn lead to {{significant}} divergences in plastic and creep behaviors. This research uses the validated finite-element analyses to study the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors of the 96. 5 Sn– 3. 5 Ag, 95. 5 Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu lead-free solders, and the classical 63 Sn– 37 Pb solder bumped wafer level <b>chip</b> <b>scale</b> <b>package</b> (WLCSP) on printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies subjected to four different temperature cycle tests. The behaviors of equivalent stress and equivalent total strain hysteresis loops are examined in the five key areas, which are the center, upper-right, upper-left, lower-right, and lower-left, at the outmost corner solder joint. It can be seen that: (1) for the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors to these three solder alloys, the range of the temperature loading is the most important factor to assess the reliability of the solder bumped WLCSP on PCB assemblies; (2) {{in the case of the}} same scale to the WLCSP and the WLCSP with underfill, the difference of the equivalent total strain range exceed an order of magnitude for all the three solder joints.

40|$|The CM 1426 is {{a family}} of pi−style EMI filter arrays with ESD protection, which {{integrates}} four, six and eight filters (C−R−C) in a <b>Chip</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>Package</b> with 0. 50 mm pad pitch. The CM 1426 has component values of 8. 5 pF − 100 � − 8. 5 pF per channel. The CM 1426 has a cut−off frequency of 230 MHz {{and can be used}} in applications where the data rates are as high as 92 Mbps. The parts include avalanche−type ESD diodes on every pin that provide a very high level of protection for sensitive electronic components against possible ESD strikes. The ESD protection diodes safely dissipate ESD strikes of ± 8 kV, well beyond the maximum requirement of the IEC 61000 − 4 − 2 international standard. Using the MIL−STD− 883 (Method 3015) specification for Human Body Model (HBM) ESD, the pins are protected for contact discharges at greater than ± 15 kV. These devices are particularly well−suited for portable electronics (e. g. wireless handsets, PDAs, notebook computers) because of their small package and easy−to−use pin assignments. In particular, the CM 1426 is ideal for EMI filtering and protecting data and control lines for the I/O data ports, LCD display and camera interface in mobile handsets. The CM 1426 incorporates OptiGuard � which results in improved reliability at assembly.
