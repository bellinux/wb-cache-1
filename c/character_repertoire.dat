25|$|Only two fonts {{available}} by default on the Windows platform, Microsoft Sans Serif and Lucida Sans Unicode, provide a wide Unicode <b>character</b> <b>repertoire.</b> A bug in Verdana (and the different handling {{of it by}} various user agents) hinders its usability where combining characters are desired.|$|E
25|$|When {{released}} in 2001, Apple's iPod music player reused the Macintosh font Chicago {{as the system}} font. Later versions of the iPod drew from the larger <b>character</b> <b>repertoire</b> of the TrueType Chicago, adding a number of characters not present in the bitmap Chicago, such as Greek and Cyrillic. Even though the screen supported grayscale, the characters were not anti-aliased.|$|E

2500|$|The Unicode {{character}} set can be encoded into bytes for storage or transmission {{in a variety}} of different ways, called [...] "encodings". Unicode itself defines encodings that cover the entire repertoire; well-known ones include UTF-8 and UTF-16. There are many other text encodings that predate Unicode, such as ASCII and ISO/IEC 8859; their <b>character</b> <b>repertoires</b> in almost every case are subsets of the Unicode {{character set}}.|$|R
25|$|DSDL (Document Schema Definition Languages) is a {{multi-part}} ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 19757) {{that brings}} together a comprehensive set of small schema languages, each targeted at specific problems. DSDL includes RELAX NG full and compact syntax, Schematron assertion language, and languages for defining datatypes, <b>character</b> <b>repertoire</b> constraints, renaming and entity expansion, and namespace-based routing of document fragments to different validators. DSDL schema languages {{do not have}} the vendor support of XML Schemas yet, and are to some extent a grassroots reaction of industrial publishers to the lack of utility of XML Schemas for publishing.|$|E
2500|$|Modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean typefaces {{typically}} use {{regional or}} historical variants {{of a given}} Han character. In the formulation of Unicode, {{an attempt was made}} to unify these variants by considering them different glyphs representing the same [...] "grapheme", or orthographic unit, hence, [...] "Han unification", with the resulting <b>character</b> <b>repertoire</b> sometimes contracted to Unihan.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 a group named [...] "Rachana Akshara Vedi" [...] {{produced}} {{a set of}} free fonts containing the entire <b>character</b> <b>repertoire</b> of more than 900 glyphs. This was announced and released along with a text editor {{in the same year}} at Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala. In 2004, the fonts were released under the GNU GPL license by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation at the Cochin University of Science and Technology in Kochi, Kerala.|$|E
50|$|The world glyph {{sets are}} <b>character</b> <b>repertoires</b> {{comprising}} {{a subset of}} Unicode characters. Their purpose is to provide an implementation guideline for producers of fonts for the representation of natural languages. Unlike Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL) it is specified by font foundries and not by operating system manufacturers. It is, however, very similar in glyph coverage to WGL4, but neither contains all the characters of the other.|$|R
5000|$|Once Thompson began voicing Geoff Peterson live, he {{incorporated}} {{several of}} his own impressions into the <b>character's</b> <b>repertoire.</b> He has performed his Morgan Freeman impression for Freeman during the actor's appearances. In June 2011, Geoff asked Freeman, [...] "Would you like to hear my Morgan Freeman voice?" [...] and [...] "What {{would you like to}} say to yourself?". Freeman gave the impression a thumbs-up and called it [...] "outstanding".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>character</b> <b>repertoires</b> {{utilized}} in Japanese mobile phones {{at the present}} time are based on JIS X 0208. There are no officially announced plans whatsoever to migrate these to JIS X 0213 compatibility. As mobile phones are now a pervasive aspect of Japanese textual communication (see Japanese mobile phone culture), being a widespread, commonly accessed medium for sending e-mail and accessing the World Wide Web, a lack of adoption for mobile phones deters usage elsewhere.|$|R
2500|$|In {{computers}} and telecommunication systems, writing systems {{are generally not}} codified as such, but graphemes and other grapheme-like units that are required for text processing are represented by [...] "characters" [...] that typically manifest in encoded form. There are many , such as ISO/IEC 8859-1 (a <b>character</b> <b>repertoire</b> and encoding scheme oriented toward the Latin script), CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and bi-directional text. Today, many such standards are re-defined in a collective standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 [...] "Universal Character Set", and a parallel, closely related expanded work, The Unicode Standard. Both are generally encompassed by the term Unicode. In Unicode, each character, in every language's writing system, is (simplifying slightly) given a unique identification number, known as its code point. Computer operating systems use code points to look up characters in the font file, so the characters can be displayed on the page or screen.|$|E
2500|$|The V2, V3, and V4 {{proposals}} {{were developed by}} a group at the Han-Nom Research Institute led by Nguyễn Quang Hồng. V4, developed in 2001, includes over 400 ideograms formerly used by the Tay people of northern Vietnam. This allows the Tay language to get its own registration code. V5 {{is a set of}} about 900 characters proposed in 2001. As these characters were already part of Unicode, the IRG concluded that they could not be edited and no Vietnamese code was added. (This is despite the fact that national codes were added retroactively for version 3.0 in 1999.) The Nom Na Group, led by Ngô Thanh Nhàn, published a set of nearly 20,000 Nom characters in 2005. This set includes both the characters proposed earlier and a large group of additional characters referred to as [...] "V6". These are mainly Han characters from Trần Văn Kiệm's dictionary which were already assigned codepoints. Character readings were determined manually by Hồng's group, while Nhàn's group developed software for this purpose. The work of the two groups was integrated and published in 2008 as the Hán Nôm Coded <b>Character</b> <b>Repertoire.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other symbols such as musical {{notation}} are {{also included in}} the <b>character</b> <b>repertoire.</b> Both the Unicode and GB18030 standards have a <b>character</b> <b>repertoire.</b> As new characters are added to one standard, the other standard also adds those characters, to maintain parity.|$|E
50|$|The gems {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} aspects, with over 100 types of gems that cause various beneficial effects such as adding extra attacks or more elemental defenses or increasing range or adding spells to the <b>character's</b> <b>repertoire.</b> These gems all have an innate level and that level must match or be lower than the slot available in the Ring weapon to be equipped. Each Ring Weapon only has 3 gem-slots with a level of 0-9 for each slot to equip the respective level gems.|$|R
5000|$|Thompson {{described}} Peterson's {{voice as}} [...] "one part Snagglepuss, one part Vincent Price, two parts George Takei". Thompson says his live segments are [...] "100% unscripted and improvised". Since Thompson began voicing Geoff Peterson live, he has incorporated {{several of his}} own impressions into the <b>character's</b> <b>repertoire.</b> He also performed his Morgan Freeman impression for Freeman himself on June 10, 2011, asking the amazed actor [...] "Would you like to hear my Morgan Freeman voice?" [...] and [...] "What {{would you like to}} say to yourself?". Freeman called the impression [...] "outstanding".|$|R

5000|$|Most modern {{proportional}} fonts align plain spacing tilde at {{the same}} level as dashes, or only slightly upper. This distinguishes it from a small tilde ( [...] ˜ [...] ), which is always raised. But in some monospace fonts, especially used in text user interfaces, ASCII tilde character is raised too. This apparently is a legacy of typewriters, where pairs of similar spacing and combining characters relied on one glyph. Even in line printers' age <b>character</b> <b>repertoires</b> were often not large enough to distinguish between plain tilde, small tilde and combining tilde. Overprinting of a letter by the tilde was a working method of combining a letter.|$|R
50|$|Many Bookman revivals {{appeared}} for phototypesetting {{systems in}} the 1960s and 1970s, often including an extensive <b>repertoire</b> of swash <b>characters,</b> meaning that the design is commonly associated with the graphic design of the period. These large <b>character</b> <b>repertoires</b> {{took advantage of the}} new phototypesetting technology, which allowed characters to be stored on film or glass phototype master disks and printed at any desired size, rather than bulky metal type. Letraset created one revival during this period. The separation of type designs from the complex manufacturing process of metal type also allowed for easier cloning of typefaces, meaning that many fonts sold during the period were unauthorised copies or modifications of other companies' designs.|$|R

In the Growlanser series, a Ring Weapon is a new technology where magic rings transform into different weapons depending on the user's personality. Players find these rings often after the defeat of an enemy and can equip different rings for different stat bonuses and different gem-equip slots. There are over 100 types of gems that cause various beneficial effects such as adding extra attacks, more elemental defenses, or increasing range or adding spells to the <b>character's</b> <b>repertoire.</b> These gems all have an innate level and that level must match or be lower than the slot available in the Ring weapon to be equipped. Each Ring Weapon only has 3 gem-slots {{with a level of}} 0-9 for each slot to equip the respective level gems. Additionally, a gem's color must match the color of a ring slot. A gem can be equipped into any given slot, however, penalties are incurred if the gem has a skill that can be learned.|$|R
