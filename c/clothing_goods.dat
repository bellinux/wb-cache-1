2500|$|The Treaty of Bosque Redondo {{between the}} United States {{and many of}} the Navajo leaders was {{concluded}} at Fort Sumner on June 1, 1868. [...] Some of the provisions included establishing a reservation, restrictions on raiding, a resident Indian Agent and agency, compulsory education for children, the supply of seeds, agricultural implements and other provisions, rights of the Navajos to be protected, establishment of railroads and forts, compensation to tribal members, and arrangements for the return of Navajos to the reservation established by the treaty. The Navajo agreed for ten years {{to send their children to}} school and the U.S.government agreed to establish schools with teachers for every thirty Navajo children. The U.S.government also promised for ten years to give to the Navajos annually: <b>clothing,</b> <b>goods,</b> and other raw materials, not exceeding the value of five dollars per person, that the Navajos could not manufacture for themselves.|$|E
60|$|The King {{was very}} proud of this longship. It had {{recently}} been built by him, {{and was one of the}} largest that had ever been seen in Norway. The exact dimensions of it are not now known, but we know that it had thirty-two banks for rowers, from which we may infer that it must have been of nearly the same size with the Long Serpent, a war vessel of thirty-four banks, which was built about the end of the tenth century, and some of the dimensions of which are given in the Saga of Olaf Tryggvesson. The length of her keel that rested on the grass, we are told, was about 111 feet, which is not far short of the length of the keel of one of our forty-two gun frigates. As these warships were long in proportion to their breadth, like our modern steamers, this speaks to a size approaching 400 tons burden. As we have said, the Dragon was a gorgeous vessel. It had a high poop and forecastle, a low waist, or middle part, and a splendidly gilt and painted stern, figurehead, and tail. The sides, which were, as usual, hung round with the red and white painted shields of the crew, were pierced for sixty-four oars, that is, thirty-two on each side, being two oars to each bank or bench, and as there were three men to each oar, this gave a total crew of 192 men; but in truth the vessel contained, including steersmen and supernumeraries, above 200 men. Under the feet of the rowers, in the waist, were chests of arms, piles of stones to be used as missiles, provisions, <b>clothing,</b> <b>goods,</b> and stores, all of which were protected by a deck of movable hatches. On this deck the crew slept at nights, sheltered by an awning or sail, when it was not convenient for them to land and sleep on the beach in their tents, with which all the vessels of the Norsemen were usually supplied. There was but one great mast, forty feet high, and one enormous square sail to this ship. The mast was tipped with gilding, and the sail was of alternate strips of red, white, and blue cloth. Each space between the banks served as the berth of six or eight men, and was divided into half berths--starboard and larboard--for the men who worked the corresponding oars. On the richly ornamented poop stood the King himself, surrounded by his bodyguard and chief men of the Court, including Jarl Rongvold and Thiodolph the scald. From the stem to the mid-hold was the forecastle, on which were stationed the King's berserkers, under Hake of Hadeland. All the men of Hake's band were splendid fellows; for King Harald, having a choice of men from the best of every district, took into his house troop only such as were remarkable for strength, courage, and dexterity in the use of their weapons.|$|E

Thus we can define a comfort quality profile (sensorial and thermophysiological), allowing to create a “comfort label” of easy interpretation, similar to the textiles “clean and conservation label”, currently used in the textiles and clothes industry labelling. This label will certify the quality and prestige of these textiles, towards the modern consumer’s needs and demands. Programme POCTI/IDEI...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{estimate}} the evolution of Latvia’s textile and clothing industry. The Latvian textile and clothing industry is traditionally highly export-oriented. Approximately 80 % of the sector's manufacturing output was exported in 2006. Historically based on {{a small number of}} giant enterprises, the sector has evolved into a virtual cluster with a many newly emerged flexible and specialised SMEs. The major markets for Latvian textile and <b>clothing</b> <b>goods</b> are EU member states (~ 76 % of exports), where product quality is a prerequisite. Methodology/Approach – The paper shows the results of situation analysis in Latvian textile and clothing industry using a database of Associations of Textile and Clothing Industry and questionnaire of enterprises. Findings – The results of research shows the evolution of Latvian textile and clothing industry during the last five years, the sector's main strengths and market potentials in future. Research limitations/implications – The research has only been carried out on a very limited number of subjects. It is caused by a very low level of cooperation of Latvia’s textile enterprises in such researches. However, as Latvia is a small country, data for this research was sufficient and the results clearly show the situation. Originality/value of paper – This information hasn’t been previously published in this way. That will help to evaluate the industry evolution prospects in international textile and clothing markets...|$|E
30|$|A brief {{review of}} the {{literature}} on the social psychology of clothing reveals that young women are more frequently research participants than men (Kwon 1997; Kaiser 1997; Crane 2000). This may be because women far outnumber men in majoring in clothing design and apparel merchandising and thus are more easily accessible as research participants than men. Regardless of why clothing research includes more women as research participants, this focus on women has resulted in a dearth of research on young men. In support of this, Reilly and Rudd (2007) report that research has investigated men’s clothing preferences and habits to a lesser extent than women’s. With rare exceptions (e.g., Frith and Gleeson 2004; Hathcote and Kim 2008), men’s ideas about fashion and its importance in their lives have been overlooked. Despite the limited research on young men, consumer groups comprised of college men are important to commercial marketers in terms of expenditure in men’s apparel and accessories. According to Statista, in 2012 the expenditure on men’s <b>clothing</b> <b>goods</b> in the United States was $ 22.2 billion. Men purchased footwear the most, followed by shirts and suits. Prior research has also shown that men’s interest in fashion is on the rise, leading to an increase in men’s apparel sales (Bakewell et al. 2006; Frith and Gleeson 2004).|$|E
40|$|Among the {{industries}} expected in future to be - {{according to several}} surveys - exposed to high pressure through adjustment: requirements due to accelerating export performance by developing countries, the textile and clothing industry occupies a predominant rank. The question whether developing countries are well advised to penetrate into the markets of developed countries as new suppliers of {{textile and clothing products}} has subsequently led to vehement controversies. The following contribution does not intend to examine more closely the questions raised in this connection, but, within the limits of this contribution, the following aspects shall be treated: - extent and direction of the structural change in the textile and clothing industry of the Federal Republic of Germany during the last decade, and their origin; - to show the protective measures granted to the West German producers of textile and <b>clothing</b> <b>goods</b> vis-a-vis their competitors from so - called low price countries and to analyse the quantitative, effects of these protective measures; - to examine the question which percentage of the imports from so-called low price countries is absorbed by the different industrial countries and whether it is possible to develop standards for a fair distribution of the import burden from low price countries; - finally to analyse more closely the development of textile and clothing exports from developing and so-called low price countries, in order to obtain possibly data about the future development. ...|$|E

40|$|The textile and {{clothing}} industry, {{aware of the}} marketing evolution cannot neglect the requests of comfort, which have been increasing and are actual exigency for <b>clothing</b> <b>goods</b> consumers. There is an urgent need to evaluate and quantify the comfort properties of textile in general. The present work aims to make {{a study of the}} different types of lightweight wool fabrics, based on the objective evaluation of thermo and sensorial comfort, according to real preferences, to develop a simple sensorial comfort “predictable model”. The approach presented uses a self-organizing map (SOM), this type of neural network perform classification in a non-supervised fashion performing vector quantization and therefore placing similar vectors close together in the two dimensional output space. The unsupervised process leads to the self organization of modelling with no previous knowledge of what is being modelled and therefore it does not model a predetermined environment. Taking the above into account objective properties (physical and mechanical measured parameters) were selected and used to train the neural network to recognize subjective evaluations of sensorial comfort. The methodology applied in this work to develop the model is divided in two parts. In the first part, it was carried out the subjective evaluation of the materials, using a psychophysical methodology that enables the quantification of descriptive aspects of hand sensation (subjective evaluation by a panel of experts). One the other part, studies were conducted on fabric objective measurements: structural, thermal, physical and mechanical properties (KES-FB system). The results of the two parts were correlated by neural network techniques, in order to quantify the comfort, contributing for the definition of comfort sensorial standards for lightweight wool fabrics.

40|$|Purpose: Recent {{empirical}} {{studies have reported}} an unexpected negative relationship between KAM formalization and performance. This study seeks to address: (1.) how and why do formal KAM programmes hinder effective KAM management, and (2.) how can the problems of formalization in KAM be overcome? Methodology An 18 month (340 day) ethnographic investigation was undertaken in the UK-based subsidiary of a major US <b>clothing</b> <b>goods</b> manufacturer. This ethnographic evidence was triangulated with 113 in-depth interviews. Findings: We identify how and why managerial reflexivity allows for a more effective combining of Formal and Post-Bureaucratic KAM practices. While Formal KAM programmes provide a means to control KAM, they have an unintended consequence of increasing organizational bureaucracy, which may hinder KAM effectiveness in the long-run. Heightened reflexivity, including ‘wayfinding’, is identified {{as a means to}} overcome many of these challenges, allowing for reflexively combining Formal with Post-Bureaucratic KAM practices. Research implications: The thesis of this paper starts a new line of reflexive KAM research, which draws theoretical influences from the Post-Bureaucratic Turn in management studies. Practical implications: This study seeks to increase KAM implementation success rates and long-term effectiveness of KAM by conceptualizing the new possibilities offered by reflexive KAM. We demonstrate how reflexive skills (conceptualised as ‘KAM wayfinding’) can be deployed during KAM implementation and for its continual improvement. Further, the study identifies how KAM programmes can be used to train organizational learning regarding KAM. Furthermore, we identify how and why Post-Bureaucratic KAM can offer additional benefits after an organization has learned key KAM capabilities. Originality/value: A new line of enquiry is identified: the reflexive-turn in KAM. This theoretical position allows us to identify existing weaknesses in the extant KAM literature, and to show a practical means to improve the effectiveness of KAM. This concerns in particular the importance of managerial reflexivity and KAM wayfinding, as a means to balance {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} Formal and Post-Bureaucratic KAM...|$|E
