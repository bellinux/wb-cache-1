50|$|A small {{heater coil}} {{is built into}} the thermotime switch, which {{effectively}} gives a timed output to the <b>cold</b> start <b>injector</b> with the timing duration dependent on the temperature of the engine. If the engine is started whilst warm the bimetallic strip remains open due to the higher temperature, meaning the cold start routine is not entered.|$|R
50|$|This {{duration}} {{is controlled}} by the thermotime switch, which is a bimetallic strip based device placed in the water jacket {{or in the case of}} an air-cooled engine, in the engine/timing case. When an engine first starts, the coolant temperature is cold and the bimetallic strip is closed, which in turn supplies the <b>cold</b> start <b>injector</b> with current.|$|R
50|$|A thermotime switch, or TTS, is {{a sensor}} {{used to control}} the cold start {{enrichment}} process in some older fuel injection systems. An extra injector {{is placed in the}} inlet manifold designed to feed all of the cylinders, and whilst the other injectors have flow rates controlled by pulse duration, the <b>cold</b> start <b>injector</b> stays on during the initial cold starting procedure.|$|R
5000|$|Cold engines also {{typically}} {{require more}} fuel and a richer mixture when first started (see: <b>cold</b> start <b>injector),</b> because fuel does not vaporize as well when cold and therefore requires more fuel to properly [...] "saturate" [...] the air. Rich mixtures also burn slower and decrease {{the risk of}} spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) when the engine is under load. However, rich mixtures sharply increase carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{simplified}} and more modern variant of L-Jetronic. The ECU was much cheaper to produce due to more modern components, and was more standardised than the L-Jetronic ECUs. The connections between mass airflow meter and ECU are simplified. Three variants of LE-Jetronic exist: LE1, the initial version. LE2 (1984-), featured cold start functionality integrated in the ECU, {{which does not}} require the <b>cold</b> start <b>injector</b> and thermo time switch used by older systems. LE3 (1989-), featuring miniaturised ECU with hybrid technology, integrated into the junction box of the mass airflow meter.|$|R
50|$|On 26 July 2007, {{during the}} early vehicle {{subsystem}} testing phase, an explosion occurred during a propellant flow test by Scaled Composites at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The test included filling the oxidizer tank with 4500 kg of nitrous oxide, followed by a 15-second <b>cold</b> flow <b>injector</b> test. The test did not ignite the engine and no solid rocket fuel was involved. Three Scaled employees were killed and three injured, two critically and one seriously, by flying shrapnel when the nitrous oxide oxidizer spontaneously ignited and exploded (dissociation into N2 and O components, releasing energy).|$|R
40|$|An {{abbreviated}} {{program was}} conducted to investigate igniter, injector, and thrust chamber technology for a 10. 3 N/cm 2 (15 psia) chamber pressure, 6660 N (1500 lbf) gaseous H 2 /O 2 APS thruster for the Space Shuttle Vehicle. Successful catalytic igniter tests were conducted with ambient and <b>cold</b> propellants. <b>Injector</b> testing with a heat sink chamber (MR = 2. 5, area ratio = 5. 0) gave a measured specific impulse of 386 sec with 11 % of the fuel used as film coolant. This coolant flow rate was demonstrated {{to be more than}} adequate to cool a spun adiabatic wall, flightweight thrust chamber...|$|R
40|$|A 6 -month {{program was}} {{conducted}} to fabricate, acceptance test, and deliver to JPL two FLOX/MMH rocket engine assemblies. Acceptance testing consisted of <b>injector</b> <b>cold</b> flows and 15 -second-duration hot firings with the engine assemblies. An additional objective {{of the program was}} to determine the feasibility of utilizing FLOX/MMH thrust chamber components with the F 2 /N 2 H 4 propellant combination. Feasibility studies consisted of analysis, cold flow, and comparative F 2 /N 2 H 4 -FLOX/MMH calorimeter hot fire testing, followed by a 500 -second duration F 2 /N 2 H 4 demonstration test...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept in}} electrodeless plasma propulsion, {{which is also}} capable of {{delivering}} a variable Isp, is presented. The concept involves a three-stage system of plasma injection, heating, and subsequent ejection through a magnetic nozzle. The nozzle produces the hybrid plume by the coaxial injection of hypersonic neutral gas. The gas layer, thus formed, protects the material walls from the hot plasma and, through increased collisions, helps detach it from the diverging magnetic field. The physics of this concept is evaluated numerically through full spatial and temporal simulations; these explore the operating characteristics of such a device over a wide region of parameter space. An experimental facility to study the plasma dynamics in the hybrid plume was built. The device consists of a tandem mirror operating in an asymmetric mode. A later upgrade of this system will incorporate a <b>cold</b> plasma <b>injector</b> {{at one end of}} the machine. Initial experiments involve the full characterization of the operating envelope, as well as extensive measurements of plasma properties at the exhaust. The results of the numerical simulations are described...|$|R
40|$|By {{applying}} the Priem-Heidmann Generalized-Length vaporization correlation, the computer model {{developed by the}} present study predicts the spatial variation of propellant vaporization rate using the <b>injector</b> <b>cold</b> flow results to define the streamtubes. The calculations show that the overall and local propellant vaporization rate and mixture ratio change drastically as the injection element type or the injector operating condition is changed. These results are compared with the regions of carbon formation observed in the photographic combustion testing. The correlation shows that the fuel vaporization rate and the local mixture ratio produced by the injector element have first order effects {{on the degree of}} carbon formation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{automated}} environmental air monitor {{has been}} developed to measure selected organic compounds in urban air. The instrument {{is based on a}} cryofocusing-thermal desorption gas chromatographic mass spectrometry technique where the mass spectrometer is a slightly modified residual gas analyzer (RGA). The RGA was chosen as a detector because the whole system must be robust for long periods, with 24 -h continuous air monitoring. RGA are extremely simple and seemed the most reliable mass spectrometers for this purpose. Moreover, because they have no physically limited ion source, contamination is considerably reduced, so maintenance intervals are longer. The gas chromatograph is equipped with a computer-controlled six-way sampling valve, with a 100 -mL sampling loop and thermal desorption <b>cold</b> trap <b>injector.</b> Environmental air is enriched with an isotopically labeled internal standard in the sampling line. This internal standard is added with a validated, custom-made, permeation tube device. The “on-line” internal standard provides for high quality quantitative data because all variations in instrument sensitivity in cryofocusing or in thermal desorption efficiency are taken into account. High repetition rates (down to 5 min for a full analytical cycle) are obtained with the use of an isothermal gas chromatography program, microbore capillary column, and environmental air sampling during the gas chromatography run...|$|R
50|$|The 5S-FE was {{available}} in several variations each being distinguished by valve cover design. The first generation, introduced in the 1990-92 Celica GT/GT-S and MR2, had a power rating of 130 hp and 144 lbs-ft/torque. The second generation was introduced in 1993 with the fifth generation (ST184) Celica, and continued through the sixth generation (ST204) Celica. The second generation was also used in the MR2 (SW21) and Camry/Scepter (XV10) series and had a power output of 135 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque. It had slightly less aggressive cams, no <b>cold</b> start <b>injector,</b> a knock sensor, and more aggressive tuning to give it slightly more power. In states that had adopted California emission standards the 5S-FE was rated at 130 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque due mainly to emission equipment used to meet those emission regulations. The third generation was the last 5S-FE engine produced and {{was used in the}} 1997-01 Camry XV20 and 1999-01 Camry Solara; however, from 1996 onward, the engine received a crank angle sensor instead of a cam angle sensor for a smoother idle. From 1997 to 1999 the engine produced 133 hp at 5,200 rpm and 147 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. From 2000 to 2001, the engine received modest improvements to increase power output to 136 hp at 5,200 rpm and 150 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. The 5S-FE was replaced in all applications by the 2.4 L 2AZ-FE.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from the tank {{to a large}} control valve called a fuel {{distributor}}, which divides the single fuel supply line from the tank into smaller lines, one for each injector. The fuel distributor is mounted atop a control vane through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume supplied to the injectors based on {{the angle of the}} air vane in the air flow meter, which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the control pressure. The control pressure is regulated with a mechanical device called the control pressure regulator (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR). Depending on the model, the CPR may be used to compensate for altitude, full load, and/or a <b>cold</b> engine. The <b>injectors</b> are simple spring-loaded check valves with nozzles; once fuel system pressure becomes high enough to overcome the counterspring, the injectors begin spraying.|$|R
5000|$|Stiction is a {{commonly}} used term when diagnosing diesel fuel powered engines. The Ford Powerstroke 6.0-L and 7.3-L engines {{are the most}} prevalent to experience <b>cold</b> start or <b>injector</b> stiction issues. The 7.3-L was produced between 1994 and 2003, while the 6.0-L was produced between 2003 and 2007. Both engines were manufactured by Navistar International and incorporated the HEUI injector system. These injectors use the engine oil to lubricate themselves and over time the sticky friction build up causes the injector to malfunction and fail. Alternatively to replacing injectors with new units, products are available that rid the injector, turbos and transmission of stiction and prevent build up. Leading engineers in the field have found in their research that 9 out of 10 failing injectors in diesel trucks are cases of stiction, and once removed are still in optimal working condition. [...] Stiction is also the same threshold at which a rolling object would begin to slide over a surface rather than rolling at the expected rate (and {{in the case of}} a wheel, in the expected direction). In this case, it's called [...] "rolling friction" [...] or μr.|$|R
40|$|Issues of {{propellant}} atomizing, {{mixing and}} viscous loss become increasingly more {{important as the}} thrust chamber are reduced in size. Two main components in thrust chamber {{have been identified as}} critical since small differences in its design can result in dramatically different performance. They are injector and nozzle, which have been greatly studied by many researchers experimentally or numerically. Current research examines the performance of two solid cone and one hollow cone swirl injectors and 22 convergent-divergent nozzles for thrust chamber application. The spray characteristics of these injectors were investigated by means of cold flow test and the flow inside the nozzles were numerically analyzed by means of computational model that utilizes Spalart-AUmaras model as turbulence model, which was designed specifically for aerospace applications. In addition, optimization of the nozzle's performance was investigated, where nozzle divergence angle was reduced if flow separation occurs inside nozzle. Main objectives of <b>injector</b> <b>cold</b> flow test lay on the determination of flow discharge coefficients, spray cone angle and spray break up length of each injector at different injection pressure. Results show an approximate direct proportion between Reynolds number and discharge coefficient. However, introducing purely axial stream inside injector's swirl chamber does not necessarily increase the coefficient of discharge. Experiment also indicates that increase in injection pressure increased the spray angle. However, at higher injection pressure, both solid cone injectors experience slight decreases in spray angle as the liquid film at the nozzle outlet contracted. Further investigation leads to general conclusion that breakup length decreased with an increase in injection pressure where hollow cone spray produces the longest liquid film. From nozzles analysis, there was significant improvement in nozzle's performance as a result of optimization is foreseen. It is concluded that in order to operate the thrust chamber efficiently, the nozzle geometry must be contoured to prevent flow separation. Actual testing of thrust chamber was performed by means of combustion test utilizing a specially designed test stand and feed systems. Although the test did not provide quantitative performance data of thrust chamber, the functionality and reliability of the feed system had been proved...|$|R
