40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of focused wave groups with a vertical wall is investigated {{based on the}} second order potential theory. The NewWave theory, which represents the most probable surface elevation under a large crest, is adopted. The analytical solutions of the surface elevation, velocity potential and wave force exerted on the vertical wall are derived, {{up to the second}} order. Then, a parametric study is made on the interaction between nonlinear focused wave groups and a vertical wall by considering the effects of angles of incidence, wave steepness, focal positions, water depth, frequency bandwidth and the peak lifting factor. Results show that the wave force on the vertical wall for obliquely-incident wave groups is larger than that for normally-incident waves. The normalized peak <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> forces reduces with the increase of wave steepness. With the increase of the distance of focal positions from the vertical wall, the peak crest of surface elevation, although fluctuates, decreases gradually. Both the normalized peak crest and adjacent crest and trough of wave forces become larger for shallower water depth. For focused wave groups reflected by a vertical wall, the frequency bandwidth has little effects on the peak <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> elevation or forces, but the adjacent crest and trough become smaller for larger frequency bandwidth. There is no significant change of the peak crest and adjacent trough of surface elevation and wave forces for variation of the peak lifting factor. However, the adjacent crest increases with the increase of the peak lifting factor...|$|E

5000|$|In physics, {{interference}} is {{the meeting}} <b>of</b> two correlated <b>waves</b> and either increasing or lowering the net amplitude, {{depending on whether}} it is constructive or destructive interference. If a <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wave</b> meets a <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> another <b>wave</b> {{at the same point}} then the crests interfere constructively and the resultant crest wave amplitude is increased; forming a much more powerful <b>wave</b> than either <b>of</b> the beginning <b>waves.</b> Similarly two troughs make a trough of increased amplitude. If a <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wave</b> meets a trough <b>of</b> another <b>wave</b> then they interfere destructively, and the overall amplitude is decreased; thus making a wave that is much smaller than either <b>of</b> the parent <b>waves.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{elements}} {{are given the}} correct lengths and spacings so that the radio waves radiated by the driven element and those reradiated by the parasitic elements all arrive {{at the front of}} the antenna in phase, so they superpose and add, increasing signal strength in the forward direction. In other words, the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the forward <b>wave</b> from the reflector element reaches the driven element just as the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wave</b> is emitted from that element. These waves reach the first director element just as the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wave</b> is emitted from that element, and so on. The waves in the reverse direction interfere destructively, cancelling out, so the signal strength radiated in the reverse direction is small.
