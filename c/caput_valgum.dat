30|$|With {{recent studies}} {{evaluating}} guided growth in skeletally immature children [9, 10, 11], another option for treating <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> is to insert a transphyseal screw through the inferomedial proximal femoral physis. The {{hypothesis is that}} gradual correction of the <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> occurs. This paper continues the follow-up of early results presented previously [12]. That study reported the early radiographic changes in the proximal femur and acetabulum following the insertion of a transphyseal screw {{for the treatment of}} <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> associated with DDH.|$|E
30|$|Between 2003 and 2007, {{consecutive}} {{patients treated}} with a transphyseal screw for <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> were prospectively followed. All patients were undergoing ongoing clinical and radiographic review following open treatment via a medial approach for DDH. The senior author selected patients for transphyseal screw placement when increasing <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> deformity was recognized on serial radiographs. Patients with hip dysplasia secondary to neuromuscular conditions, arthrogryposis, or other teratologic conditions were excluded.|$|E
30|$|The physeal {{orientation}} was measured intending to separate <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> from coxa valga by disregarding the neck shaft angle. The {{orientation of the}} middle 1 / 3 was measured, {{as opposed to the}} medial and lateral edges, because following growth disturbance of the physis, the physis is often nonlinear. The physeal {{orientation was}} measured with respect to the ground and not the femoral neck, because the femoral neck in patients with <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> is short and accurate measurement is challenging. McGillion and Clarke referenced the orientation of the proximal femoral physis to the pelvis when they measured “tilt angle” [19]. Measuring the orientation of the physis to the ground, however, eliminates variability due pelvic tilt. The physeal orientation measurements showed good intra- and inter-rater reliability.|$|E
30|$|The {{sequelae}} of <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> deformity are unpredictable, but {{may result}} in poor acetabular development, acetabular dysplasia and early degenerative arthritis [3, 4, 7, 8]. Early recognition of deformity is difficult, and late management is challenging. When recognized early, a complete epiphysiodesis of the proximal femoral physis would maintain the femoral–acetabular relationship, but {{at the expense of}} femoral neck length. When recognition occurs after the development of a <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> deformity, an acute corrective osteotomy might be considered. However, the osteotomy is often performed {{at the level of the}} lesser trochanter and introduces a translational deformity. Another disadvantage is that a corrective osteotomy performed prior to skeletal maturity incurs the risk of recurrent deformity, if the growth disturbance of the proximal femoral physis remains untreated.|$|E
30|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effect of such a transphyseal screw on both femoral and {{acetabular}} development in patients with <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> following open treatment of DDH. These patients were followed clinically and radiographically until skeletal maturity. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were assessed, measuring the proximal femoral physeal orientation (PFPO), the head–shaft angle (HSA), Sharp’s angle and the center edge angle of Wiberg (CE angle).|$|E
30|$|A late {{finding of}} some hips treated for {{developmental}} dysplasia {{of the hip}} (DDH) is a growth disturbance of the lateral proximal femoral physis, which results in <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> and possibly osteoarthritis. Current treatment options include complete epiphysiodesis of the proximal femoral physis or a corrective proximal femoral osteotomy. Alternatively, a transphyseal screw through the inferomedial proximal femoral physis that preserves superolateral growth might improve this deformity.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} our results, {{most of the}} {{radiographic}} values excluding the LT {{are consistent with the}} boundary of age norms. Examination {{of the children in the}} first group revealed partial recurrence of the deformity of the proximal femur at last outcome. This can be observed by the decrease in the values of the NSA, ATD, and LT. Nevertheless, the orientation of the head relative to the neck and the head containment within the acetabulum did not change significantly. We think that this is expected, as the child is growing and later correction can be performed. However, the recurrence is confined to the neck–shaft varus and in the ATD, as there is no observation of significant change of the NEA or recurrence of <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> deformity in the last outcome assessment. The correction of neck varus can be done with simple corrective osteotomy. The decrease of the ATD can be addressed by trochanteric advancement osteotomy if hip abductors function is affected. Joo et al. [25] studied the result of this surgery in Perthes patients with relative overgrowth of the greater trochanter and found that it doesn’t always improve hip function, so we recommend that the decision of revision surgery to be taken when clinical and radiological aspects are assessed together. Group II patients showed a significant reduction only in the average NSA, which corresponded to the lower limit of normal values. This change is unlikely to be increased, as this group is reaching skeletal maturity. In both groups, no significant change was observed for recurrence of <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> or change in head containment represented by postoperative sustained values of NEA and CEA, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Defining the {{geometry}} of the proximal femur on two-dimensional radiographs has limitations as compared with three-dimensional imaging modalities. Serial computer tomography would expose patients to unacceptably high levels of radiation and serial magnetic resonance imaging is cost-prohibitive. On plain film radiographs, abduction and adduction of the hip, as well as internal and external rotation of the hip, can affect radiographic measurements. As such, {{efforts were made to}} standardize the position of the patient, obtaining radiographs with the patient standing, patellae forward, and hips with neutral abduction/adduction. Prior work by Foroohar et al. showed that the head–shaft angle had good inter-rater reliability and minimal variability due to rotation [13]. Since the orientation of the physis was made relative to the femoral shaft, one disadvantage of the head–shaft angle measurement {{is that it does not}} differentiate between coxa valga and <b>caput</b> <b>valgum,</b> valgus orientation of the femoral neck and head, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Avascular {{necrosis}} of the femoral head {{can result}} from many causes that interfere with its blood supply. Reduction manipulation is a leading cause following DDH treatment [16]. Deformities include coxa vara, <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> resulting from growth disturbance to the lateral femoral physis [1], femoral neck shortening, and proximal migration of the greater trochanter with hyperplasia and impingement on the acetabular rim with abduction. The resulting disturbed biomechanics accentuates hip joint deformation and ischemia in a vicious circle manner and, eventually, early osteoarthritic changes. Many proximal femoral osteotomies have been described with different results. This included single, double, and triple [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] osteotomies. Buess and Morscher [9] used a technique with lengthening of the femoral neck and distal transfer of the greater trochanter. They used three osteotomies, at the greater trochanter, one proximal, and the third an oblique osteotomy {{at the level of}} the distal femoral neck. In 15 patients with 16 operated hip joints, the results were satisfactory in 14 of the 16 hips. They recommend this technique to be performed in young patients with little or no degenerative changes.|$|E
30|$|At {{skeletal}} maturity, hips with <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> deformity {{treated with}} transphyseal screw {{compared to the}} contralateral hip in patients with unilateral deformity were not statistically different. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} placement of a transphyseal screw induces beneficial changes to the proximal femur, as well as the acetabulum. However, in comparison with published normal values, the head–shaft angle, the center edge angle of Wiberg, and Sharp’s angle for hips at skeletal maturity in this case series were in the upper limits of normal, or slightly worse than normal. Foroohar et al. reported the normal values of the head–shaft angle in typically developing children to be 152.5 ° [13]. The head–shaft angle of patients in this study at skeletal maturity was more similar to hips in patients with cerebral palsy not warranting surgical intervention. The mean final Sharp’s angle of treated hips and untreated hips in this series was 43 ° and 44 °, respectively. This was slightly greater than the 42 ° reported by Sharp to be the upper limit of normal [15]. Lastly, the CE angle of patients in this series measured 24 ° and 28 ° for untreated hips and treated hips at skeletal maturity, respectively, resulting in borderline normal values of the CE angle [16, 21]. Comparing the treated and untreated hips to normal values suggests that even untreated hips had subtle abnormalities and longer-term follow-up is warranted.|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionSevere slipped capital femoral {{epiphysis}} inevitably results into arthritis, making surgical {{recovery of}} normal anatomy an attractive objective. This {{can be achieved}} by the procedure described by Dunn. However, all published studies report a risk of avascular necrosis. Material and methodsThe present series assembles 25 adolescent cases aged 10 to 15 years. There were 16 cases of chronic pure displacement with several months’ evolution, including nine exacerbated by an acute accident. In all cases, epiphyseal slippage was severe, between 60 ° and 90 °. Postoperative traction was systematic, for 15 to 21 days. As of 1979, bone scan was prescribed 2 weeks postsurgery to study femoral head vascularization. ResultsReduction was anatomic, except in two cases in which the epiphysis was fixed, respectively in <b>caput</b> <b>valgum</b> and in 15 ° varus. There were 15 good results, with clinically and radiologically normal hips, but also 10 immediate or late complications: i. e., a complications rate of 40 %. The eight immediate complications (32 %) comprised four necroses (16 %), two of which rapidly evolved into arthritis, three chondrolyses, which all evolved into arthritis, and one mechanical complication. At less than 10 years’ FU, two arthrodeses and three hip replacements were required. At long-term FU, there were two further late deteriorations, despite initial favorable clinical and X-ray outcomes. DiscussionIn theory, the procedure described by Dunn limits the vascular risk of the displacement correction. It does, however, involve certain tricky technical points: trochanterotomy may be excessive or insufficient; posterior cervical periosteal detachment may be aggressive; and the periosteum may be too tight during the reduction. In all series studying Dunn's operation, such risk of necrotic complication is reported, at rates up to 17 %. The present series had a 16 % rate of necrosis which, associated with chondrolysis, caused immediate loss of joint function – unacceptable, in our view, in adolescent patients. A direct approach to the displacement, after arthrotomy, with associated anterior cuneiform neck resection, corrects the slippage while avoiding the risky first two steps of Dunn's procedure, and is our current approach of choice.
