40|$|In human {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI), a characteristic pattern of frontal and parietal activity is produced by many different cognitive demands. Although frontoparietal cortex has been shown to represent a variety of task features in different contexts, little is known about detailed representation of different task features within and across different regions. We used multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of human fMRI data to assess the representational content of frontoparietal cortex in a simple stimulus–response task. Stimulus–response mapping rule was the most strongly represented task feature, significantly coded in a lateral frontal region surrounding the inferior frontal sulcus, a more ventral region including the anterior insula/frontal operculum, and the intraparietal sulcus. Next strongest was coding of the instruction <b>cue</b> (<b>screen</b> color) indicating which rule should be applied. Coding of individual stimuli and responses was weaker, approaching significance in a subset of regions. In line with recent single unit data, the results show a broad representation of task-relevant information across human frontoparietal cortex, with strong representation of a general rule or cognitive context, and weaker coding of individual stimulus/response instances. 9 page(s...|$|E

40|$|A {{telephone}} survey of {{a random sample}} of Rhode Island women ages 40 and older residing in minority low-income census tracts [...] census tracts in the lowest quartile of a variety of socioeconomic indicators in which at least 5 percent of the population was classified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic black [...] was conducted in 1991, focusing on breast cancer screening. Hispanic women were found to have about half the breast cancer screening rate (20 percent, according to current screening guidelines) of other respondents (37 percent). Determinants of screening were explored to suggest reasons for this difference. The Health Belief Model was used to identify and compare determinants of breast cancer screening (sociodemographics, health care utilization, perceived susceptibility to breast cancer, perceived seriousness of breast cancer, <b>cues</b> to <b>screening</b> such as a provider's recommendation, and the perceived benefits and costs of screening) among Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks. Hispanics were younger, less educated, and had lower family incomes than other women residing in minority low-income census tracts, were less likely to receive medical care, to perceive themselves as susceptible to breast cancer, and to perceive breast cancer as curable. Logistic regression analyses revealed the importance of use of health care, <b>cues</b> for <b>screening,</b> and perceptions of mammography to explain the screening behavior of Hispanics and non-Hispanics alike. Access to medical care is a significant problem in the Rhode Island Hispanic community, related to recent immigration, undocumented immigration, and low income characteristics of its members.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine trial-to-trial {{reliability}} {{of a new}} clinical test, rapid reaction step <b>cued</b> on a <b>screen</b> test, and its relationship with fall risk score, independence in activity of daily living score, and various leg muscle function tests. One-hundred fifty seven older women participated in this study. Nine square plates (32 × 32 cm) were lined up with three plates. Participants stood on a center plate and were instructed to step, using one leg, {{to one of the}} other eight plates, as quickly as possible, when that plate changed in color from white to red.

In this paper, we present an exploration of the impact of co-navigation supports, including location <b>cue,</b> split <b>screen,</b> and shared view, on the experiences and performance of 60 co-shopper dyads. We also studied if status composition of shopping companions played a role in this process. By analyzing about 1800 minutes of eye-tracking data, video footages, and web logs, we found that split screen encouraged more diverse product search, shared view enabled better coordination, and location cue was the least distracting. Co-buyers achieved better factual and inference understanding, though buyer-advisor dyads were more likely to stay together...|$|R

Smokers' onscreen visual fixation is an indicator of cognitive resources allocated to visual attention.

At the same time, these cues are embedded in messages that associate avoidance responses with these appetitive cues, potentially inducing avoidance of PSA processing. Findings suggest that segments of PSAs that contain smoking cues are processed similarly to segments that contain complex stimuli (operationalized in this case as high in information introduced) and that visual attention is aligned with smoking <b>cues</b> on the <b>screen...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Clustered {{within the}} {{nomenclature}} of Asian American are numerous subgroups, each {{with their own}} ethnic heritage, cultural, and linguistic characteristics. An understanding of the prevailing health knowledge, attitudes, and screening behaviors of these subgroups is essential for creating population-specific health promotion programs. Methods Korean American women (123) completed baseline surveys of breast cancer knowledge, attitudes, and screening behaviors {{as part of an}} Asian grocery store-based breast cancer education program evaluation. Follow-up telephone surveys, initiated two weeks later, were completed by 93 women. Results Low adherence to the American Cancer Society's breast cancer screening guidelines and insufficient breast cancer knowledge were reported. Participants' receptiveness to the grocery store-based breast cancer education program underscores the importance of finding ways to reach Korean women with breast cancer early detection information and repeated <b>cues</b> for <b>screening.</b> The data also suggest that the Asian grocery store-based cancer education program being tested may have been effective in motivating a proportion of the women to schedule a breast cancer screening between the baseline and follow-up surveys. Conclusion The program offers a viable strategy to reach Korean women that addresses the language, cultural, transportation, and time barriers they face in accessing breast cancer early detection information. </p...|$|R

Two methods were used: 1) a cognitive walkthrough; and 2) usability testing with a ‘think-aloud’ protocol.

40|$|SummaryThe outer {{membrane}} (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria is an asymmetric {{lipid bilayer}} {{that serves as}} a barrier to the environment. During infection, Gram-negative bacteria remodel their OM to promote survival and replication within host tissues. Salmonella rely on the PhoPQ two-component regulators to coordinate OM remodeling in response to environmental <b>cues.</b> In a <b>screen</b> for mediators of PhoPQ-regulated OM remodeling in Salmonella Typhimurium, we identified PbgA, a periplasmic domain-containing transmembrane protein, which binds cardiolipin glycerophospholipids near the inner membrane and promotes their PhoPQ-regulated trafficking to the OM. Purified-PbgA oligomers are tetrameric, and the periplasmic domain contains a globular region that binds to the OM in a PhoPQ-dependent manner. Thus, PbgA forms a complex that may bridge the envelope for regulated cardiolipin delivery. PbgA globular region-deleted mutant bacteria are severely attenuated for pathogenesis, suggesting that increased cardiolipin trafficking to the OM is necessary for Salmonella to survive within host tissues that activate PhoPQ...|$|R

40|$|The Necker cube is a {{striking}} example for perceptual dominance of 3 D over 2 D. Object symmetry and obliqueness of angles are co-varying cues that may underlie the perceived slant of Necker cubes. To investigate {{the power of the}} oblique-angle cue, slants were judged of extremely simple symmetrical shapes. Slant computations based on an assumption of orthogonality were made for two abutting lines as a function of vertex angle and the slant of the screen. Computed slants were compared with slants judged by six subjects under binocular viewing conditions. Judged slant was highly correlated with slant specified by the oblique angles under an assumption of orthogonality. The contributions of <b>screen</b> <b>cues,</b> including binocular disparity, were negligible. The consistency of the judgments across subjects indicates the assumption of orthogonality as one of the principles underlying slant perception. Necker cubes illustrate that the visual system can disengage unambiguous cues in favor of ambiguous object-symmetry and oblique-angle cues, if the latter indicate very different slants. Selective disengagement of cues may be the mechanism that underlies the success of 2 D images in ancient, as well as modern civilizations...|$|R
40|$|More {{than one-third}} of people {{over the age of}} 65 {{experience}} falls each year, and those who fall once are two to {{three times more likely to}} fall again. A fall can significantly limit a person’s ability to remain self-sufficient. Fall injuries are responsible for significant disability, reduced physical function, and loss of independence. However, falls are not an inevitable result of aging. Systematic reviews of fall intervention studies have established that prevention programs can reduce falls. Physical activities, including strengthening exercises, tai chi, dancing and walking have been demonstrated to improve balance and decrease risk of falls in older adults. Modified dance-based exercises that include step-based movements have been demonstrated to improve endurance and balance in older adults. Dance video games, using a dance mat with areas that the player must step on in time with <b>cues</b> on the <b>screen,</b> have been demonstrated to improve activity and mood and reduce weight in children and youth. However, these dance games often include fast paced music, frequent jumping and an overload of visual information, movement and colors on the screen.

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advancements, strong {{competition and}} targeted marketing strategies by virtual instrument merchants have established virtual instruments and digital instrument samples as essential {{components of a}} professional screen composer's toolset. The democratisation of these powerful tools has led to broad accessibility to virtual instruments and the digital sequencing software required to run them. Virtual instruments are portable, powerful, and affordable––they {{are no longer the}} exclusive domain of expensive recording studios. This thesis aims to quantify and qualify the parameters surrounding screen music composition in this digital age and introduce to the literature new empirical data together with the experiences of working screen music professionals. This is achieved by following a mixed methods sequential exploratory methodology starting with a survey of Australian screen composers (n= 102) where they are asked to answer questions with a recent cue in mind. Informed by the results of the survey, semistructured interviews were conducted and recorded with working Australian screen composers (n= 22). When combined the meta-inferences confirm that virtual instruments are vital for Australian screen composers to do their job, especially now that their tools are democratised. Screen composers are able to swiftly create cues that are finished products and not demos for their director and film-team. These changes have also shaped a new paradigm of film and television directors to expect final and completed versions of <b>cues</b> from Australian <b>screen</b> composers and not working drafts...|$|R
40|$|In earlier literature, {{so-called}} twitches {{were used}} to support a user in a steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) {{to focus attention on}} the requested targets. Within this work, we investigate the impact of these transient target stimuli on SSSEPs in a real-life BCI setup. A hybrid BCI was designed which combines SSSEPs and P 300 potentials evoked by twitches randomly embedded into the streams of tactile stimuli. The EEG of fourteen healthy subjects was recorded, while their left and right index fingers were simultaneously stimulated using frequencies selected in a screening procedure. The subjects were randomly instructed by a <b>cue</b> on a <b>screen</b> to focus attention on one or none of the fingers. Feature for SSSEPs and P 300 potentials were extracted and classified using separately trained multi-class shrinkage LDA classifiers. Three-class classification accuracies significantly better than random could be reached by nine subjects using SSSEP features and by twelve subjects using P 300 features respectively. The average classification accuracies were 48. 6 % using SSSEP and 50. 7 % using P 300 features. By means of a Monte Carlo permutation test it could be shown that twitches have an attenuation effect on the SSSEP. Significant SSSEP blocking effects time-locked to twitch positions were found in seven subjects. Our findings suggest that the attempt to combine different types of stimulation signals like repetitive signals and twitches has a mutual influence on each other, which may be the main reason for the rather moderate BCI performance. This influence is originated at the level of stimulus generation but becomes apparent as physiological effect in the SSSEP. When designing a hybrid BCI based on SSSEPs and P 300 potentials, one has to find an optimal tradeoff depending on the overall design goals or individual subjects' performance. Our results give therefore some new insights that may be useful for the successful design of hybrid BCIs...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{acknowledged}} roles speech {{may play}} in multimedia instructional packages, {{there is yet}} no consensus on how to integrate speech in multimedia learning resources. Researchers in multimedia learning advocate for clearer directions {{on the role of}} audio in multimedia instruction. This dissertation was concerned with two design guidelines for incorporating speech in multimedia instruction. Mann’s temporal speech cueing (that is, a multimedia learning environment with graphics and a brief spoken instruction, direction, or hint) and Mayer’s off-loading textual information into narration to “balance the input” (that is, a multimedia learning environment with graphics and a balance of spoken and on-screen information). Three versions of an Electric Circuits’ Tutorial (ECT) were developed ─ convergent temporal speech cueing version based on Mann’s structured sound function model, and the narrated screen text and on-screen text versions based on Mayer’s off-loading textual information into narration. The aim was to compare the learning processes in the three versions in order to determine which version would help below-average high school Physics students in Nigeria to focus their attention on critical information in the tutorial. The following research questions guided the study: How do Ilorin Senior Secondary School (SSS) (grade 11) students in the convergent temporal speech <b>cueing</b> group, narrated <b>screen</b> text group, and on-screen text group differ in their attentional focus on the electric circuits tutorial?, how do Ilorin SSS students (grade 11) in the three groups differ in their performance following the intervention with the Electric Circuits Tutorial?, and how do Ilorin SSS students (grade 11) in the three groups differ in their learning of electric circuits after a latency period of six weeks? Analyses of the self-explanations of the three experimental groups revealed that the three groups were significantly different from each other in the quality of participants’ self-explanations. However, the analyses of the posttest and delayed posttest data show that between groups modality effect was non-significant. Therefore, in order to integrate digitized speech in multimedia instruction for below-average students in Nigeria, instructional designers need to question existing design guidelines. Both the temporal speech cues and narrated text have their roles in instructional multimedia...|$|R
