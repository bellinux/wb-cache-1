40|$|This thesis gives {{insight into}} {{key aspects of}} the climate system {{response}} to anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. One characteristic is an approximately constant global mean surface air temperature (GMSAT) after <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions,</b> but also changes in GMSAT to second order. Here it is shown that these second-order GMSAT changes are positive, i. e. {{there is a small}} committed warming from previous emissions, because the warming effect from declining ocean heat uptake dominates over the cooling effect from declining atmospheric CO 2. The timing of zeroing emissions or the time horizon over which the warming commitment is calculated have minor effects on this warming commitment compared to the effect of the scenario prior to <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions.</b> Another characteristic explored is the approximately constant ratio between GMSAT change and cumulative CO 2 emissions (CE), referred to as Transient Climate Response to cumulative CO 2 emissions (TCRE). It is shown that the TCRE diverges more strongly over time from a constant value under increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration than previously suggested. But it is approximately constant over time under constant CO 2 concentration due to cancelling effects of changes in ocean heat and carbon uptake. Applying a wide range of sub-grid ocean mixing parameterizations does not change the temporal evolution of the TCRE significantly but leads to a wide range in the TCRE value. A third characteristic explored is irreversibility of sea level rise from thermal expansion (TSLR). It is shown here that TSLR under negative emissions does not return to pre-industrial levels for centuries after atmospheric CO 2 has returned to pre-industrial concentrations. This result is robust against the choice of mixing parameter, although, generally an increased parameter leads to higher TSL rise and decline rates. The results presented in this thesis suggest that setting cumulative CO 2 emission budgets in order to not exceed a certain warming target needs to be done with caution as the TCRE varies more strongly over time than previously shown and additional committed warming may lower allowable carbon budgets. Furthermore, TSLR is not linearly related to cumulative CO 2 emissions and is slow to be reversed if net negative emissions are applied...|$|E
30|$|The {{main focus}} of the work {{presented}} here is on chemical pollution of aquatic ecosystems and topics relevant for the future development of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union. The WFD {{is dedicated to the}} protection and restoration of a good ecological and chemical status of European surface waters. In the WFD daughter Directive 2013 / 39 /EU, priority substances are identified and environmental quality standards (EQS) for them are defined. For priority hazardous substances, phasing out and <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> are required within a set time frame. Prioritisation is, therefore, a central operational concept in the management of polluting chemicals in the water environment in line with the WFD. Several different approaches for prioritisation are available, with different combinations of methods for risk assessment and ranking [11]. Risk assessment and prioritisation in the WFD currently are a site-specific- and retrospective approach and are, thus, based on concentrations of chemicals already present in the environment. For future development of the WFD, {{there is a need to}} develop more comprehensive methods to evaluate hazards and risks of chemicals and their mixtures as well as options to reduce and manage these risks.|$|E
40|$|The {{severity}} of damaging human-induced climate change depends {{not only on}} the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1, 000 years after emissions stop. Following <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions,</b> removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1, 000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450 – 600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the “dust bowl” era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0. 4 – 1. 0 m if 21 st century CO 2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0. 6 – 1. 9 m for peak CO 2 concentrations exceeding ≈ 1, 000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer...|$|E

40|$|The {{hot spots}} of Io are modeled as a steady state of active areas at 600 K, {{continuing}} {{creation of new}} lava flows and calderas, cooling off of recent flows and calderas, and the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> radiation of old flows and calderas from the accumulation of insulation added by resurfacing. There are three adjustable parameters in this model: the area of active sources at 600 K, the rate of production of new area that is cooling, and the temperature <b>of</b> <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emission</b> {{as the result of}} resurfacing. The resurfacing rate sets constrains on this last parameter. The emission spectrum computed with reasonable values for these parameters is an excellent match to the spectrum from recent observations. A thermostatic mechanism is described whereby the volcanic activity is turned on {{for a long period of}} time and is then turned off for a nearly equal period. As a result the presently observed internal heat flow of approximately 1. 5 W/sq m may be as much as twice the rate of production of internal heat.

40|$|DsRed, a tetrameric {{fluorescent}} protein cloned {{from the}} Discosoma genus of coral, has shown promise as a longer-wavelength substitute for {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) mutants for in vivo protein labeling. Bulk and single-molecule studies of the recombinant protein revealed that the DsRed chromophore shows high stability against photobleaching as compared to GFP mutants. Stark modulation spectra confirm that the electronic structure of the DsRed chromophore {{is similar to that}} of GFP. However, the tetrameric nature of DsRed leads to intersubunit energy transfer, as evidenced by the molecule’s unusually low fluorescence anisotropy when immobilized (0. 23 (0. 02). This value is approximately consistent with an estimate of the energy transfer rates based on preliminary crystallographic information. The fluorescence emission bleaches at a rate linear in the applied excitation intensity, implying that the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emission</b> during pumping at 532 nm is light-driven and, consistent with the tetrameric structure, several photobleaching “steps ” were observed for individual complexes. Because more photons are emitted before bleaching, this study suggests that DsRed may be superior to some GFP-based labeling technologies as long as tetramerization is not an issue in physiological studies...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the proportional relationship between global warming and cumulative carbon emissions, yet the robustness of this relationship has not been tested over {{a broad range of}} cumulative emissions and emission rates. This study explores the path dependence of the climate and carbon cycle response using an Earth System model of intermediate complexity forced with 24 idealized emissions scenarios across five cumulative emission groups (1275 – 5275 GtC) with varying rates of emission. We find the century-scale climate and carbon cycle response after <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> to be approximately independent of emission pathway for all cumulative emission levels considered. The ratio of global mean temperature change to cumulative emissions – referred to as the transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) – is found to be constant for cumulative emissions lower than ~ 1500 GtC, but to decline with higher cumulative emissions. The TCRE is also found to decrease with increasing emission rate. The response of Arctic sea ice is found to be approximately proportional to cumulative emissions, while the response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) does not scale linearly with cumulative emissions, as its peak response is strongly dependent on emission rate. Ocean carbon uptake weakens with increasing cumulative emissions, while land carbon uptake displays non-monotonic behavior, increasing up to a cumulative emission threshold of ~ 2000 GtC and then declining...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{diagnosed}} the lifetimes of long-lived source gases emitted at {{the surface}} and removed in the stratosphere using six three-dimensional chemistry-climate models (CCMs) and a two-dimensional model. The models all used the same standard photochemical data. We investigate the effect of different definitions of lifetimes, including running the models with both mixing ratio (MBC) and flux (FBC) boundary conditions. Within the same model, the lifetimes diagnosed by different methods agree very well. Using FBCs versus MBCs leads to a different tracer burden as the implied lifetime contained in the MBC value does not necessarily match a model's own calculated lifetime. In general, there are much larger differences in the lifetimes calculated by different models, the main causes of which are variations in the modelled rates of ascent and horizontal mixing in the tropical mid-lower stratosphere. The model runs {{have been used to}} compute instantaneous and steady-state lifetimes. For chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) their atmospheric distribution was far from steady state in their growth phase through to the 1980 s and the diagnosed instantaneous lifetime is accordingly much longer. Following the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions,</b> the resulting decay of CFCs is much closer to steady-state. For 2100 conditions the model circulation speeds generally increase, but a thicker ozone layer due to recovery and climate change reduces photolysis rates. These effects compensate so the net impact on modelled lifetimes is small. For future assessments of stratospheric ozone use of FBCs would allow a consistent balance between rate of CFC removal and model circulation rate...|$|E

40|$|We present further {{observational}} {{evidence of}} the effects of a centrifugal barrier in GRO J 1744 - 28, based on continued monitoring of the source with RXTE. For X-ray pulsars, the centrifugal barrier manifests itself in the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> pulsed <b>emission</b> when the source becomes faint. We show that such phenomenon occurred repeatedly for GRO J 1744 - 28, following the decay of two X-ray outbursts. This has allowed a direct measurement of the dipole field strength for this pulsar.

40|$|Macroscopic physics are {{discussed}} {{for the case}} of a disk close to an isolated, magnetized, rotating neutron star that acts as a Faraday disk dynamo, while the disk acts as both a load and a neutral sheet. This sheet allows the polar cap current to return to the neutron star, splitting a dipolar field into two monopolar halves. The dominant energy loss is from the stellar wind torque, and the next contribution is dissipation in the auroral zones, where the current returns to the star in a 5 cm-thick sheet. The disk itself may be a source of visible radiation comparable to that in pulsed radio frequency emission. As the pulsar ages, the disk expands and narrows into a ring which, it is suggested, may lead to a <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> pulsed <b>emission</b> at periods <b>of</b> a few sec...|$|R

40|$|The climate {{response}} after <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>emissions</b> {{is examined}} here, exploiting a single equation connecting surface warming to cumulative carbon emissions. The multi-centennial {{response to an}} idealized pulse of carbon is considered by diagnosing a 1000 year integration of an Earth system model (GFDL ESM 2 M) and an ensemble of efficient Earth system model simulations. After emissions cease, surface temperature evolves according to (i) {{how much of the}} emitted carbon remains in the atmosphere and (ii) how much of the additional radiative forcing warms the surface rather than the ocean interior. The peak in surface temperature is delayed in time after carbon emissions cease through the decline in ocean heat uptake, which in turn increases the proportion of radiative forcing warming the surface. Eventually, after many centuries, surface temperature declines as the radiative forcing decreases through the excess atmospheric CO 2 being taken up by the ocean and land...|$|R
40|$|Several pulsars show sudden <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> pulsed <b>emission,</b> {{which is}} known as pulsar nulling. In this paper, the nulling {{behaviour}} of 15 pulsars is presented. The nulling fractions of these pulsars, along with the degree of reduction in the pulse energy during the null phase, are reported for these pulsars. A quasi-periodic null-burst pattern is reported for PSR J 1738 - 2330. The distributions of lengths of the null and the burst phases {{as well as the}} typical nulling time scales are estimated for eight strong pulsars. The nulling pattern of four pulsars with similar nulling fraction are found to be different from each other, suggesting that the fraction of null pulses does not quantify the nulling behaviour of a pulsar in full detail. Analysis of these distributions also indicate that while the null and the burst pulses occur in groups, the underlying distribution of the interval between a transition from the null to the burst phase and vice verse appears to be similar to that of a stochastic Poisson point process.

40|$|Pulsar nulling is a {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> sudden <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> pulse <b>emission</b> {{for a number of}} periods. The nulling fraction was often used to characterize the phenomenon. We propose a new method to analyse pulsar nulling phenomenon, by involving two key parameters, the nulling degree, χ, which is defined as the angle in a rectangular coordinates for the numbers of nulling periods and bursting periods, and the nulling scale, N, which is defined as the effective length of the consecutive nulling periods and bursting periods. The nulling degree χ can be calculated by tanχ = N_ nulling / N_ bursting and the mean is related to the nulling fraction, while the nulling scale, N, is also a newly defined fundamental parameter which indicates how often the nulling occurs. We determined the distributions of χ and N for 10 pulsars by using the data in literature. We found that the nulling degree χ indicates the relative length of nulling to that of bursting, and the nulling scale N is found {{to be related to the}} derivative of rotation frequency and hence the loss rate of rotational energy of pulsars. Their deviations reflect the randomness of the nulling process. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures. Submitted to China Science (Phys Mech Astron...|$|R
40|$|By using {{a dynamic}} branch {{enclosure}} system the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> monoterpenes from European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) was investigated during two consecutive summer vegetation periods {{in the years}} of 2002 and 2003 in Germany. All measurements were performed under field conditions {{within the framework of}} the ECHO project (Emission and Chemical Transformation of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds, AFO 2000). European beech was characterized as a substantial emitter of monoterpenes, with sabinene being the predominant compound released. The monoterpene emission from European beech was shown to be a function of light and temperature and agreed well to emission algorithms that consider a light and temperature dependent release of volatile organics. Standard emission factors that were measured from these sunlit leaves of European beech ranged up to 4 – 13 µg g- 1 h- 1 (normalized to 1000 µmol m- 2 s- 1, 30 °C) in the years of 2003 and 2002, respectively. The nighttime <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> monoterpene compounds was negligible. Also the artificial darkening of the sunlit branch during daylight conditions led to an immediate <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> monoterpene <b>emission.</b> European beech is the dominating deciduous tree species in Europe. To demonstrate the effect of an updated monoterpene emission factor for European beech in combination with the consideration of a light and temperature dependent monoterpene emission, we applied a species based model simulation on a European scale. With respect to conventional estimates of the European volatile organic compound budget, the latter simulation resulted in relative increases of 16 % by taking solely this tree species into account.

40|$|If {{anthropogenic}} CO 2 emissions were {{to suddenly}} cease, {{the evolution of}} the atmospheric CO 2 concen-trationwould depend on themagnitude and sign of natural carbon sources and sinks. Experiments usingEarth systemmodels indicate that the overall carbon sinks dominate, such that upon the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> anthropogenic <b>emissions,</b> atmospheric CO 2 levels decrease over time. However, these models have typically neglected the permafrost carbon pool, which has the potential to introduce an additional terrestrial source of carbon to the atmosphere. Here, the authors use the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM), which has recently been expanded to include permafrost carbon stocks and exchanges with the atmosphere. In a scenario of zeroed CO 2 and sulfate aerosol emissions, whether the warming induced by specified constant concentrations of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases could slow the CO 2 decline following zero emissions or even reverse this trend and cause CO 2 to increase over time is assessed. It is found that a radiative forcing from non-CO 2 gases of approximately 0. 6 Wm 22 results in a near balance <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>emissions</b> from the terrestrial bio-sphere and uptake of CO 2 by the oceans, resulting in near-constant atmospheric CO 2 concentrations for at least a century after emissions are eliminated. At higher values of non-CO 2 radiative forcing, CO 2 concen-trations increase over time, regardless <b>of</b> when <b>emissions</b> cease during the twenty-first century. Given that the present-day radiative forcing from non-CO 2 greenhouse gases is about 0. 95 Wm 22, the results suggest that if all CO 2 and aerosols emissions were eliminated without also decreasing non-CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions CO 2 levels would increase over time, resulting in a small increase in climate warming associated with this positive permafrost–carbon feedback. 1...|$|R
