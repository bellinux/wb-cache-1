40|$|AbstractIn the EU, a {{regulatory}} framework {{has been established}} which defines general <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> marketing <b>authorisation</b> approval of similar biological medicinal products (SBMPs). In addition, the framework provides product-class specific recommendations for non-clinical evaluation of specific SBMPs containing as active substance recombinant somatropin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), erythropoietin, interferon alpha, insulin or low molecular weight heparins. During the last years, a number of SBMPs have been succesfully licensed in the EU. This article summarizes the non-clinical evaluations performed for these medicinal products and provides a comparison with the current requests for non-clinical evaluation as laid down in the respective EU regulatory guidelines...|$|R
40|$|M (Environmental Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Compliance {{monitoring}} is {{a continuous}} process used {{to ensure that}} conditions stipulated in an environmental authorisation are adhered to. Compliance monitoring is {{a key component of}} Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and EIA follow-up. The aim of this research was to critically assess EIA follow-up <b>conditions</b> formulated <b>for</b> Environmental <b>Authorisations</b> in Mpumalanga Province. The practicability of conditions set out in the <b>authorisation</b> <b>for</b> EIA follow-up are of particular concern. Forty-two (42) environmental authorisations (EAs) issued under the 2010 NEMA EIA regulations were reviewed and assessed to analyse information relating to follow-up practice. In order to synthesise the data effectively and create a comprehensive analysis, the EAs were divided into project type categories rather than listed activity categories. The assessment results on the strengths and weaknesses related to compliance monitoring and enforcement of the authorisation conditions revealed that the EIA follow-up conditions in Mpumalanga do make provision of EIA follow-up. The EAs fulfils the requirements of regulation 37 of the NEMA EIA regulations 2010 by promoting compliance monitoring of impacts. However, some conditions raises difficulty in monitoring due to their impracticability. Another weakness is that conditions focus mainly on the construction phase and very little attention is paid to operational and decommissioning impacts. The analyses results show that the practicability of the authorised <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> environmental compliance monitoring had the following challenges: conditions intended to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts are generic and do not apply to specific projects or activities being authorised and there are no clearly defined timeframes <b>for</b> <b>conditions</b> requiring repetitive monitoring. Moreover, the study revealed gaps in monitoring of the authorised conditions that included poor clarity of roles of environmental control officers (ECOs) and auditors and a lack of reference to sections to be complied with pertaining to other relevant legislation. The critical assessment of the EIA follow-up <b>conditions</b> formulated <b>for</b> Environmental <b>Authorisations</b> in Mpumalanga Province indicate that the formulation of conditions have implications in ensuring that compliance is effectively implemented. Clearly defined conditions will ensure proper interpretation and correct implementation for compliance purposes. Master...|$|R

Substances of very high concern (SVHC) (e.g. PBT/vPvB) {{are included in the}} ‘candidate list’ <b>for</b> <b>authorisation,</b> based on the outcome of the scientific assessment of intrinsic properties. Substances on the ‘candidate list’ can then be prioritised <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> and finally listed in Annex XIV of the REACH regulation. Some substances may be listed with specific exemptions that do not require <b>authorisation.</b> <b>For</b> each substance included in Annex XIV, a deadline will be set after which use of that substance in the EU must stop (known as the ‘sunset date’), unless authorized by the European Commission.|$|R

Some of these tasks {{are already in the}} beginning (e.g. substance evaluation), others are ongoing, (e.g. the identification of SVHC). By September, 1 st, 84 SVHC are included in the candidate list, and 14 substances are included in Annex XIV and therefore will be subject <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> in future. To elaborate the proposals and to agree the measures in the Member State Committee was not an easy task – and therefore we congratulate also the Member States authorities, and especially ECHA.|$|R

25|$|During the transition, then-C Sir Colin McColl {{embraced a}} new, albeit limited, policy of {{openness}} towards the press and public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 {{by the government of}} John Major. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 Intelligence Services Act. Although the Act provided procedures <b>for</b> <b>authorisations</b> and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (<b>for</b> <b>authorisations)</b> and 1985 (under the Interception of Communications Act, for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.|$|R
