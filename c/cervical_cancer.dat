5|$|<b>Cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> {{nearly always}} {{involves}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous {{changes in the}} cervical epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, {{which is the most}} common area for <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer,</b> by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.|$|E

5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer,</b> and penile cancer. Genital warts and <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Protease {{activated}} receptor- 2 (PAR- 2) {{has been}} implicated in cellular proliferation, invasion and metastasis in various tumors. Lymph node metastasis is an important patient prognostic factor for uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> This prompted us to study the role of PAR- 2 in lymph node metastasis of uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> Methods Thirty patients underwent surgery for uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> PAR- 2 histoscores and mRNA levels were determined by immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Patient prognosis was analyzed with a 48 -month survival rate.

40|$|Angiogenesis {{contributes}} to the growth and secondary spreading of solid tumours. Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) is identified as such an angiogenic factor. In the present study, the prognosis of the patients with high PD-ECGF uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> was worse than those with low PD-ECGF cancers, and PD-ECGF expression correlated with cellular proliferation and with vascular density and venous invasion in uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> Therefore, PD-ECGF might contribute {{to the growth of}} uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> via angiogenesis related to vascular spreading. Furthermore, PD-ECGF and its mRNA had a wide range and were highly expressed in uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers,</b> especially squamous cell carcinoma, regardless of clinical stage. Therefore, PD-ECGF in uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> might play a role of basic angiogenesis in all processes of advancing of uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> This indicates that 5 ′-deoxy- 5 -fluorouridine might be highly effective in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, which possesses a high activity of thymidine phosphorylase to convert 5 ′-deoxy- 5 -fluorouridine to 5 -fluorouracil, and that some angiogenic inhibitors of new capillary formation might be effective in the inhibition of tumour growth and spreading associated with angiogenesis. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

5|$|<b>Cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer,</b> since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Globally, <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the fourth}} commonest cancer amongst women, {{particularly}} those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E

40|$|Angiogenesis is {{essential}} for development, growth and advancement of solid tumours. Interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP- 10) regulates lymphocyte chemotaxis, mediates vascular pericyte proliferation and acts as an angiostatic agent, thus inhibiting tumour growth. This prompted us to study the clinical implications of IP- 10 expression related to angiogenesis in uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> The levels of IP- 10 decreased with advancement, and the prognosis of the 30 patients with low IP- 10 expression in uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> was poor (66 %), whereas the 24 -month survival rate of the other patients with high IP- 10 expression was 90 %. Furthermore, IP- 10 levels significantly reverse-correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> Interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 might work on suppression of angiogenesis associated with VEGF in advancement, and can be recognised as a prognostic indicator. Furthermore, IP- 10 activation might be effective on the suppression of regrowth or recurrence after intensive treatment for advanced <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2008, <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> was the third-most common {{cancer in}} women worldwide, with rates varying {{geographically}} {{from less than}} one to more than 50 cases per 100,000 women. It is {{a leading cause of}} cancer-related death in poor countries, where delayed diagnosis leading to poor outcomes is common. The introduction of routine screening has resulted in fewer cases of (and deaths from) <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer,</b> however this has mainly taken place in developed countries. Most developing countries have limited or no screening, and 85% of the global burden occurring there.|$|E

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer.</b> Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. <b>Cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E

30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the multi functional tumor suppressor gene, p 53, was not expressed in dysplastic tissue but was strongly expressed after malignant transformation to SCC. It is well-established that the E 5 gene product of HPV types 16 or 18 can inactivate p 53 function leading to malignant transformation (Kim et al. 2010) and that p 53 is wild type but not expressed in <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers,</b> although some <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> do express mutant p 53 and not infected by HPV. Unlike <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers,</b> malignant transformation in this case might have been contributed to by a mutation in p 53, leading in turn to enhanced cell proliferative stimulation by HPV type 6 over an extended period. This is distinct, however, from a direct oncogenic effect of HPV.|$|R

To investigate the association between tumour advancement and ID expressions of uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers,</b> the levels of ID- 1, ID- 2 and ID- 3 mRNAs were determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the histoscore with the localisation of ID- 1 was determined by immunohistochemistry and patient survival in 60 patients. ID- 1 histoscores and mRNA levels both significantly (P< 0. 05) increased in uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> according to clinical stage regardless of histopathological type or lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, the 36 -month survival rate of the 30 patients with high ID- 1 was poor (60 %), whereas that of the other 30 patients with low ID- 1 was significantly higher (83 %). ID- 1 histoscores and mRNA levels significantly (P< 0. 0001) correlated with microvessel counts in uterine <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> Tumour cells show mostly diffuse to strong cytoplasmic expression of ID- 1 and also very faint expression in endothelial cells. Moreover, ID- 1 expression not only correlated with microvessel counts but also correlated significantly with histoscore.

40|$|In nuclear medicine, [F- 18]-fluorodeoxyglucose {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} ((18) FDG PET) and lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy (LM/SL) may significantly improve the staging of primary <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers.</b> Indeed, the disease progresses in a 'level by level' fashion to regional nodes through the lymphatic channels, and also to extra-nodal sites via the hematogenous stream. Additionally, the sub-optimal efficacy of routine radiological protocols, while new combined therapies are proving to be more efficient, stresses the need for alternative staging procedures. Current data suggest that LM/SL accurately reflects the regional lymph node status in early stage <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers,</b> and thus could avoid unnecessary complete lymphadenectomies. Also, whole body (18) FDG PET may provide valuable insights on extra-pelvic and distant tumor spreading, with {{a significant impact on}} treatment choices.
