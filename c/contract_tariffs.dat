If the resulting tariff increase is less than 3% it is applied automatically. If {{it is more than}} 3% the private company and the state decide about the measures to be taken. If no decision is taken within two months, the company can apply a 3% tariff increase while the contracting parties decide {{about how to deal with}} the remaining tariff increase. Increases in bulk water tariffs and in electricity production tariffs are passed on automatically to consumers, based on the principle [...] "no loss, no gain". Between 1997 and 2001 the average water tariff in Casablanca increased by 35% and the average sewerage tariff by 34%. However, the electricity tariff decreased by 6%. During public management by RAD water tariffs had increased by 60% between 1990 and 1995. However, this increase had to a large extent been due to an increase in bulk water tariffs charged by ONEP to RAD.|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionIn France, {{approximately}} 36, 000  anterior {{cruciate ligament}} (ACL) reconstruction surgical procedures are performed every year. Technical progress, in particular arthroscopy, has made surgery more precise, but more expensive. In {{a context of}} healthcare cost containment, {{the increase in the}} cost of technology must be compared to the improved outcome for the patients. The main aim {{of this study was to}} determine all material costs related to ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendons. This study also compared the material costs between the two arthroscopic techniques: standard or “all-inside”. Materials and methodsA retrospective study of material costs was performed in 2011. With the standard technique, the tibial tunnel was drilled from outside to inside, while with the all-inside technique two tunnels were drilled from inside to outside. All of the material used from the first swab to the final bandage was reported. It was classified into three categories: reusable arthroscopy material, disposable arthroscopic material, and disposable surgical supplies. The costs were those of our supplier in 2011 (Arthrex™) and based on Public Hospitals of Paris (AP–HP) public <b>contract</b> <b>tariffs.</b> ResultsStandard ligament reconstruction was less expensive than the all-inside technique: 791. 59 € versus 931. 06 € excluding taxes (hors taxes [HT]), respectively. The largest percentage of expenses was allocated to disposable material use (81 and 84 %). DiscussionPossible avenues of savings are limited: all the material used was necessary. To control costs, correct use and good maintenance of instruments are the most important elements. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Economic and decision analyses, retrospective study...|$|E

We extend the previous studies to consider a risk-averse retailer in a two-echelon fashion supply chain. Based on the classic mean-variance approach in finance, the issue of channel coordination in a fashion supply chain with risk-averse retailer and price-dependent demand is investigated. We propose both single contracts and joint contracts to achieve supply chain coordination. We find that the coordinating revenue sharing <b>contract</b> and two-part <b>tariff</b> <b>contract</b> in the supply chain with risk neutral agents are still useful to coordinate the supply chain taking into account the degree of risk aversion of fashion retailer, whereas a more complex sales rebate and penalty (SRP) contract fails to do so.

30|$|The on-demand {{delivery}} {{model for}} cloud computing resources {{offers a variety}} of benefits for business consumers: no up-front capital expenditure on (often under-utilised) compute infrastructure needed to cover peak business demand; flexibility and scale-out opportunities from the ability to start and stop VM instances at will; and reduced operational costs from outsourcing maintenance and support [6]. However, the on-demand model is not necessarily ideal for cloud providers, as they attempt to adhere to strict Service Level Agreements in the face of fluctuating demand. If providers could accurately forecast future resource demand, then they would have the opportunity to reduce costs by optimising electricity purchases, engineering staff, and hardware utilisation, etc. [7]. At present, most providers offer a choice between an on-demand tariff (“on-demand” instances, billed per hour of usage with no upfront purchase cost [8]) and a <b>contract</b> <b>tariff</b> (“reserved” instances (RIs), leased for a fixed time period and offering significant hourly usage discounts [9]). Some providers, e.g., AWS, offer an alternative spot price tariff that varies in real-time based on current supply and demand [10].

The followings are the main findings of our analysis. Under royalty licensing contract with low emission tax, all polluting firms will not buy clean technology while they will purchase it if the government imposes sufficiently high emission tax. However, both innovator's profit and social welfare will increase under two-part <b>tariff</b> licensing <b>contract.</b> Thus, two-part <b>tariff</b> licensing <b>contract</b> can induce polluting downstream firms to purchase a clean technology and improve social welfare, even though the two-part <b>tariff</b> licensing <b>contract</b> is not always socially desirable...|$|R
