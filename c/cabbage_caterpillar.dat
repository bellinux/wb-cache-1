50|$|Parasitoids {{are among}} the most widely used {{biological}} control agents. From {{the point of view of}} the farmer or horticulturalist, the most important groups are the Ichneumonid wasps, which prey mainly on caterpillars of butterflies and moths; Braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including greenfly; Chalcid wasps, which parasitise eggs and larvae of greenfly, whitefly, <b>cabbage</b> <b>caterpillars,</b> and scale insects; and Tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, adult and larval beetles, and true bugs. Commercially, there are two types of rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term low daily output with a range in production of 4-1000 million female parasitoids per week. Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems.

Extratos aquosos a 3, 5 e 10 % foram obtidos por infusão do {{material}} biológico seco triturado em água destilada e filtrado após 24 h. Dentro de 48 h após o preparo, folhas de couve foram mergulhadas nos extratos ou em água destilada e utilizadas para avaliar o efeito dos extratos na percentagem de sobrevivência e no tempo de vida das larvas. A repelência e a deterrência dos extratos foram avaliadas em testes com e sem chance de escolha de folhas tratadas ou não, avaliando-se, comparativamente, a área consumida e o número de larvas por porção foliar. Houve 100 % de mortalidade das larvas nos tratamentos, em contraste com a sobrevivência de 87 % delas no controle. Larvas alimentadas com folhas tratadas sobreviveram significativamente menos que larvas do controle. Ao contrário de extratos de folhas e frutos, extratos de sementes apresentaram efeito repelente, mas não intenso o suficiente para evitar o consumo foliar. Houve redução no consumo foliar pelas larvas submetidas ao extrato a 10 % nos experimentos com chance de escolha.

We found that the feeding of caterpillars affected primarily the mid-early and mid-late genotypes of cabbage, and that the glucosinolate content among the different cabbage genotypes varies. The highest content of the analyzed glucosinolates was established in mid-late genotypes. Glucobrassicin was the only glucosinolate found in all cabbage genotypes, yet its antixenotic effect (r= 0. 20) was very low. We found that sinalbin negatively affects the feeding of <b>cabbage</b> moth <b>caterpillars</b> in mid-early <b>cabbage</b> genotypes (r=- 0. 34), while the same effect of sinigrin {{on the extent of}} damage can be observed in mid-late genotypes (r=- 0. 27).

5000|$|Inducible {{defenses}} allow {{plants to}} be phenotypically plastic. This may confer {{an advantage over}} constitutive defenses for multiple reasons. First, it may reduce the chance that attacking insects adapt to plant defenses. [...] Simply, inducible defenses cause variations in the defense constituents of a plant, thereby making the plant a more unpredictable environment for insect herbivores. This variability has an important effect on the fitness and behaviour of herbivores. For example, the study of herbivory on radish (Raphanus sativus) by the <b>cabbage</b> looper <b>caterpillar</b> (Trichoplusia ni) demonstrated that the variation of defensive chemicals (glucosinolates) in R. sativus, due to induction, resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} the pupation rates of T. ni. In essence, defensive chemicals can be viewed as having a particular dosage-dependent effect on herbivores: it has little detrimental effect on herbivores when present at a low or moderate dose, but has dramatic effects at higher concentrations. Hence, a plant which produces variable levels of defensive chemicals is better defended than one that always produces the mean level of toxin.|$|R

Most remarkably, following 8 -h damage, the parasitoid preferred both herbivore-damaged and progressively damaged plants to plants with FD and did not significantly discriminate between herbivore and progressively damaged plants, thus indicating a similarity in plant response to herbivore and progressive mechanical damage. In addition to wind-tunnel bioassays, emitted plant volatiles were collected and analysed by thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, following 3 and 8 h of damage in order to correlate volatiles released from different damage types with the attraction of the parasitoid. Differences in volatile profiles from all damage types were similar following both 3 and 8 h of damage, with only (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate found to be emitted in significantly higher quantities by final mechanical damage compared with HD after 3 h. In conclusion, the plant's response to progressive mechanical damage was more similar to HD than final mechanical damage deployed at a single point in time, irrespective of damage duration, and C. glomerata did not significantly discriminate between progressive damage and HD...|$|R
30|$|Addition {{of organic}} {{amendments}} helped in suppression of various insect pests such as European corn borer (Phelan et al. 1996), other corn insect pests (Biradar et al. 1998), aphids and scale insects (Culliney and Pimentel 1986; Costello and Altiei 1995; Huelsman et al. 2000) and brinjal shoot and fruit borer (Sudhakar et al. 1998). Several reports also evidenced that vermicompost addition decreased {{the incidence of}} Spodoptera litura, Helicoverpa armigera, leaf miner (Apoaerema modicella), jassids (Empoasca kerri), aphids (Aphis craccivora) and spider mites on groundnuts (Rao et al. 2001; Rao 2002, 2003) and psyllids (Heteropsylla cubana) on a tropical leguminous tree (Leucaena leucocephala) (Biradar et al. 1998). Vermicompost amendment decreased the incidence of sucking pests under field conditions (Ramesh 2000) and suppressed {{the damage caused by}} of two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus spp.), aphid (Myzus persicae) (Edwards et al. 2007) and mealy bug (Pseudococcus spp.) under green house conditions (Arancon et al. 2007). Vermicompost substitution to soil less plant growth medium MetroMix 360 (MM 360) at a rate less then 50 % reduced the damage caused by infestation of pepper seedlings by M. persicae and Pseudococcus spp. and tomato seedlings by Pseudococcus spp., cabbage seedlings by M. persicae and <b>cabbage</b> white <b>caterpillars</b> (Pieris brassicae L.) (Arancon et al. 2005). Greenhouse cage experiments conducted on tomatoes and cucumber seedlings infested with M. persicae, citrus mealybug (Planococcus citri), two spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae); striped cucumber beetles (Acalymna vittatum) attacking cucumbers and tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta) attacking tomatoes proved that treatment of infested plants with aqueous extracts of vermicompost suppressed pest establishment, and their rates of reproduction. Vermicompost teas at higher dose also brought about pest mortality (Edwards et al. 2010 b). Suppression of aphid population gains importance since they are key vectors in transmission of plant viruses. Addition of solid vermicompost reduced damage by A. vittatum and spotted cucumber beetles (Diabotrica undecimpunctata) on cucumbers and larval hornworms (Manduca quinquemaculata) on tomatoes in both greenhouse and field experiments (Yardim et al. 2006). Combined application of vermicompost and vermiwash spray to chilli (Capiscum annum) significantly reduced the incidence of ‘Thrips’ (Scirtothrips dorsalis) and ‘Mites’ (Polyphagotarsonemus latus) (Saumaya et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|The green {{caterpillar}} of the Large Cabbage Worm Pieris rapae, {{with its}} narrow orange or yellow dorsal stripe, {{emerges from the}} soil for two to four weeks in order to feed on the leaves of many different species of cabbages. It then returns underground to reappear 15 days later as a white butterfly. An understanding of this life-cycle shows how the pest can be controlled {{without the use of}} chemicals. The first step is to practice crop rotation by alternating carrots or maize, for example, with <b>cabbages.</b> The <b>caterpillars</b> are then starved of their food source. By turning over the soil around the cabbage plants several times, both at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the season, the caterpillars are desiccated through exposure to air. If some escape they can be retrieved manually and destroyed. The butterflies can be controlled by using a sticky, yellow trap placed in the middle of the crop, or they can be discouraged by cultivating plants that have a strong and, to the butterflies, unpleasant, odour (onion, garlic, sage, mint, cinnamon). Other non-chemical means of control include the use of a garlic concoction made with crushed garlic cloves (five cloves to four litres of water) or by macerating neem seeds (two handfuls of crushed seed to ten litres of water over 12 hours) or even by scattering a mixture of one part salt to two parts flour on the plants after rain. The caterpillars gorge themselves on this mixture and become so bloated that they die. Another strong ally is a small wasp which lays its eggs among those of the Large Cabbage Worm and on which the young wasps feed. Wasps can be attracted by planting, for example, mint or parsley, but insecticides must be avoided because the wasps are particularly sensitive to them. However, with this array of weapons ranged against the pest, chemicals should be unnecessary.

Following transformations and extensive plant selection, insect efficacy trials were undertaken in 2008 to 2010 in north India (Murthal near New Delhi) and south India (near Bengaluru) in large scale screen-house experiments using artificial infestations on the best performing (Elite Event) plant lines and on hybrids produced from them. Plant damage was scored {{on a scale of}} 0 (no visible damage) to 4 (plant effectively destroyed). For DBM, <b>cabbage</b> cluster <b>caterpillar</b> (Crocidolomia binotalis), <b>cabbage</b> webworm (Hellula undalis) and semi-looper (Trichoplusia ni) there was zero insect survival and a zero damage score on the Elite Event lines and on their hybrids, while control plants had 50 to 100 % insect survival (depending on species, life stage and trials) and damage scores of 3. 3 to 4. Cabbage white (Pieris brassicae) and common army worm (Spodoptera litura) showed some larval survival and damage scores up to 1. 4 (especially in early trials) but no survival to pupation. Screening of DBM populations worldwide (inc. 18 populations for Cry 1 B and 13 for Cry 1 C from India) showed mean LC 50 s close to that of international susceptible strains. To date F 2 screening has not identified the presence of resistance genes in DBM in the field. Cry 1 B resistance was slowly developed artificially in the laboratory but 1 C resistance and resistance to the Cry 1 B/ 1 C combination was harder to develop and had higher fitness costs. The ‘resistant’ lines showed some extended survival of stunted DBM larvae on dual gene Bt plants but no survival to pupation. There was no cross-resistance between Cry 1 B and Cry 1 C. Resistance to both genes was autosomal and recessive. Beneficial insects were demonstrated to have the potential to provide additional mortality on rare surviving insects in Bt fields. Aphids were well controlled for the first 40 days post-transplanting using imidacloprid pelleted onto seed and, if necessary, by 1 - 2 Verticillium lecanii sprays thereafter. Surviving S. litura and Helicoverpa armigera in Bt sprayed fields were well controlled by one or two application...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{important}} {{of good and}} healthy quality of vegetables is necessary to be brought into farmers, consumers and government official. Data {{on the quality of}} vegetables based on the pesticide residues in Bengkulu province is rare, including Cabbage. Research with title: Quality improvement of Cabbage through sustainable growing crop management was conducted in Rejang Lebong, Bengkulu. The objectives was to measure the insecticide residues in cabbage that were subjected to three different growing techniques management, i. e. Organic, Integrated Pest Management, and Conventional, and grown at two different time of planting. The outcomes of the research were the method of growing cabbage that produce high quality of crop with low pesticide residue, but commercially still profitable. Research was conducted in Kecamatan Selupu Rejang, Kabupaten Rejang lebong. Two factors were applied and arranged in Factorials Randomized Completely Block Design. The first factor was time of planting, i. e. Wet (MT 1) and dry (MT 2) season; and second factor was the application of three different growing techniques management, i. e. Organic (P 1), Integrated Pest Management (P 2), and Conventional (P 3), with 3 replications and this produces 18 experimental units. Eight variables were measured includes height of plant, crop diameter, sample weight, weight of cabbage per unit area, insecticide (organophosphate) residues in crop sample, insecticide (organophosphate) residues in soil sample, number of Diamond back moth (P. Xylostella) and <b>Cabbage</b> heart <b>caterpillar</b> (C. Binotalis) in sample crops and soil, and number of nematodes in the soil. The results show that the second season (dry season), regardless the growing techniques management, significantly improved the height of plant, the diameter of crop and consequently improved the weight of crop/area. It was also found that the average weight of sample of organically grown cabbage was lowest compared to the other growing technique management i. e. IPM and conventional. Interaction were found between growing technique management and time of planting, in which during the first growing season the plants cultivated in Integrated Pest Management and Conventional techniques had higher number of leaves, but it did not improve the diameter of crop. Surprisingly, the growing techniques management did not affect the insecticide residues in the sample crops and in the soils. In addition, the nematodes in the soil that survive during the two growing seasons have decreased in number. ...|$|R
