5|$|Through their {{acquisition}} of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment's pre-1996 film library catalogue, MGM released {{a special edition}} of the film on October 2, 2001, which included documentaries, the script, and advertisements for the film. On January 23, 2001, a Hong Kong VCD edition was released online. On June 20, 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray through Sony in the United States. In late 2012, the film was re-released on Blu-ray, this time with a transfer by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which features improved sharpness compared to Sony's 2006 Blu-ray, and revised <b>color</b> <b>grading,</b> as well as expanded extra material, such as deleted scenes and a making-of feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} post-converted from 2D to 3D, {{in part because}} the {{production}} team wanted to shoot 35 mm film. Dan Mindel used Kodak Vision3 500T 5219 and 200T 5213, while the second unit shot day exteriors on Kodak Vision3 50D 5203. During the production, 20 layers of lightning CGI effects were applied to depict Electro. Jamie Foxx was photographed as Electro by KNB EFX team and the skin colors used to show the moods of the character. A total number of 1600 visual effects shots of the film was originally filmed in 2K resolution and then converted into 4K resolution with the help of <b>color</b> <b>grading.</b> To give the visual effects a realistic look, sound designers Addison Teague and Eric Norris and re-recording mixers Paul Massey and David Giammarco mixed the background music using Auro 11.1 cinema sound technology and the film's soundtrack was remixed using Dolby Atmos, Auro and Dolby 5.1.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the topographic {{characteristics of the}} posterior corneal surface after Descemet's endothelial membrane keratoplasty (DMEK) and Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and their effects on postoperative visual acuity. Nineteen eyes of 19 patients after DMEK, 23 eyes of 23 patients after DSAEK, and 18 eyes of 18 control subjects were retrospectively analyzed. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), aberration factors (higher-order aberrations [HOAs], spherical aberrations [SAs], and coma aberrations [Comas] at 6. 0 mm) were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. The posterior refractive pattern of the topography map was classified into 5 grades (0 - 5) (posterior <b>color</b> <b>grade)</b> using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Correlations between BSCVA and some factors (abbreviation factors, posterior <b>color</b> <b>grade)</b> were analyzed. BSCVA was significantly better after DMEK than after DSAEK (P < 0. 001). Posterior HOAs, SAs, and Comas after each type of endothelial keratoplasty were significantly greater compared to control (P < 0. 01). Posterior HOAs, total/anterior/posterior SAs, and posterior <b>color</b> <b>grade</b> were significantly lower in the DMEK group than in the DSAEK group at 3 months (P < 0. 024 [posterior HOAs], P = 0. 047 [total SA], P < 0. 001 [anterior SAs], P = 0. 021 [posterior SAs], and P < 0. 001 [posterior color grade]) and 6 months postoperatively (P = 0. 034 [posterior HOAs], P < 0. 001 [total SAs], P < 0. 001 [anterior SAs], P = 0. 013 [posterior SAs], and P = 0. 004 [posterior color grade]). BSCVA was significantly correlated with HOAs, SAs, and posterior <b>color</b> <b>grade</b> (P < 0. 001 for all except anterior HOAs [P = 0. 004]). High posterior <b>color</b> <b>grades</b> were associated with larger aberration factors and had {{a negative effect on}} visual function after endothelial keratoplasty.

5000|$|Most {{diamonds}} used as gemstones {{are basically}} transparent with little tint, or white diamonds. The most common impurity, nitrogen, replaces {{a small proportion}} of carbon atoms in a diamond's structure and causes a yellowish to brownish tint. This effect is present in almost all white diamonds; in only the rarest diamonds is the coloration from this effect undetectable. The GIA has developed a rating system for color in white diamonds, from D to Z (with D being [...] "colorless" [...] and Z having a bright yellow coloration), which has been widely adopted in the industry and is universally recognized, superseding several older systems. The GIA system uses a benchmark set of natural diamonds of known <b>color</b> <b>grade,</b> along with standardized and carefully controlled lighting conditions. Diamonds with higher <b>color</b> <b>grades</b> are rarer, in higher demand, and therefore more expensive, than lower <b>color</b> <b>grades.</b> Oddly enough, diamonds graded Z are also rare, and the bright yellow color is also highly valued. Diamonds graded D-F are considered [...] "colorless", G-J are considered [...] "near-colorless", K-M are [...] "slightly colored". N-Y usually appear light yellow or brown.|$|R
25|$|Diamond {{color is}} graded by {{comparing}} a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone {{is known to}} exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where {{in the range of}} color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate <b>color</b> <b>grading</b> can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards. When <b>color</b> <b>grading</b> is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of <b>color.</b> <b>Grading</b> mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.|$|E

25|$|The Coen brothers' next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), {{was another}} {{critical}} and commercial success. The title was {{borrowed from the}} Preston Sturges film Sullivan's Travels (1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned {{to make a film}} with that title. Based loosely on Homer's Odyssey (complete with a cyclops, sirens, et al.), the story is set in Mississippi in the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after absconding from a chain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried—but they have no clear perception of where they are going. The film highlighted the comic abilities of George Clooney as the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and of Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, his sidekicks. The film's bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical and commercial hit. It was the first feature film to use all-digital <b>color</b> <b>grading.</b> The film's soundtrack CD was also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD, Down from the Mountain, that coincided with a resurgence in interest in American folk music.|$|E
500|$|Creating the 3D effect {{involved}} {{taking the}} edited 2D footage {{for the right}} eye and matching it up with footage for the left eye. Editing the Melbourne footage that used only a single camera involved a separate process to create 3D effects, known as [...] "virtual second eye perspective". Several software programs were used to convert footage from 2D to 3D. The primary editing software, 3action, was developed at 3ality Digital during principal photography. It allowed the post-production team to change convergence points in each shot, and to create multiple convergence points. Left-eye and right-eye footage was assembled on separate layers, then edited together with <b>color</b> <b>grading</b> added, and eventually output in a 3D stereoscopic format for review.|$|E

500|$|In July 2011, Lindelof {{said that}} the film would rely upon {{practical}} effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that [...] "you can pretty much do anything you want" [...] with digital technology, and, [...] "Doug Trumbull {{once said to me}} 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using <b>color</b> <b>grading</b> processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E
500|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), {{supervised}} by Stefen Fangmeier, created the film's 505 visual effects-shots. The filmmakers used as few digital effects as possible, though {{the train and}} smoke for the railroad crossing scene was entirely created using computer animation. ILM also used <b>color</b> <b>grading</b> techniques for the Lake Lachrymose scene, which required complete animation for the leeches. The digital animators studied footage of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season to accurately depict Hurricane Herman, which was ILM's most ambitious use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) for the film. Nexus Productions designed the opening [...] "Littlest Elf" [...] animated sequence by modeling it after stop motion animation and completing it with computer animation. The snakes at Uncle Monty's house were a combination of real snakes and animatronics. The animatronics, primarily the Incredibly Deadly Viper, were used as reference models that ILM later enhanced using CGI. Because working with infants was sometimes risky in producing a film, four scenes involving Sunny Baudelaire required CGI with motion capture technology. Among these are the shot of Sunny hanging on to a table by her teeth, catching a spindle with her mouth and the scene where she is entangled with the Incredibly Deadly Viper. Animation supervisor Colin Brady used his baby daughter for motion capture recording. A remote controlled animatronic of Sunny was also designed by Kevin Yagher.|$|E
