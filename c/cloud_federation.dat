However, the adoption of <b>cloud</b> <b>federations</b> is hindered by federated organizations’ concerns on potential risks of data leakage and data misuse. For <b>cloud</b> <b>federations</b> to be viable, federated organizations’ privacy concerns should be alleviated by providing mechanisms that allow organizations to control which users from other federated organizations can access which data. We propose a novel identity and access management system for <b>cloud</b> <b>federations.</b> The system allows federated organizations to enforce attribute-based access control policies on their data in a privacy-preserving fashion. Users are granted access to federated data when their identity attributes match the policies, but without revealing their attributes to the federated organization owning data. The system also guarantees {{the integrity of the}} policy evaluation process by using blockchain technology and Intel SGX trusted hardware. It uses blockchain to ensure that users identity attributes and access control policies cannot be modified by a malicious user, while Intel SGX protects the integrity and confidentiality of the policy enforcement process.

In the present, single cloud provider’s method and system of resource scheduling don’t apply to the <b>cloud</b> <b>federation</b> environment.

40|$|Abstract—The {{amount of}} {{computing}} resources required by {{current and future}} data-intensive applications {{is expected to increase}} dramatically, creating high demands for cloud resources. The cloud providers ’ available resources may not be sufficient enough to cope with such demands. Therefore, the cloud providers need to reshape their business structures and seek to improve their dynamic resource scaling capabilities. Federated clouds offer a practical platform for addressing this service management issue. We introduce a <b>cloud</b> <b>federation</b> formation game that considers the cooperation of the cloud providers in offering cloud IaaS services. Based on the proposed federation formation game, we design a <b>cloud</b> <b>federation</b> formation mechanism that enables the cloud providers to dynamically form a <b>cloud</b> <b>federation</b> maximizing their profit. In addition, the proposed mechanism produces a stable <b>cloud</b> <b>federation</b> structure, that is, the participating cloud providers in the federation do not have incentives to break away from the federation. We analyze the performance of the proposed mechanism by performing extensive experiments. The results of the experiments show that the <b>cloud</b> <b>federation</b> obtained by our proposed mechanism is stable, yielding high profit for the participating cloud providers.
