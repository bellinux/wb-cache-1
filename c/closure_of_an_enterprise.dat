40|$|By {{considering}} {{an enterprise}} to be {{a system of}} agents that observe and construct theories about themselves immediately raises issues of closure. These in turn pose questions about the identity and evolution of that which is exhibiting such closure. We address these questions by assigning enterprises to a class of systems whose models are triply articulated. The existential articulation provides {{an account of the}} possible behaviours of the enterprise's agents and of their interoperation; the referential articulation specifies outcomes that its agents are required to satisfy; and the deontic articulation imposes constraints on the composition of the other two articulations sufficient to ensure that the enterprise effectively implements its specified requirements. Any of these articulations may be `under-determined' in that they admit more than one elaboration. The behavioural <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>enterprise</b> is a kind of composition (formally, a category theoretic limit construction) of its thre [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We study {{algebraic}} closure and {{its relation}} with definable closure in free groups and more generally in torsion-free hyperbolic groups. Given a torsion-free hyperbolic group G and a nonabelian subgroup <b>A</b> <b>of</b> G, we describe G as a constructible group from the algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> along cyclic subgroups. In particular, {{it follows that the}} algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> is finitely generated, quasiconvex and hyperbolic. Suppose that G is free. Then the definable <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> is <b>a</b> free factor <b>of</b> the algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and the rank of these groups is bounded by that of G. We prove that the algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> coincides with the vertex group containing A in the generalized cyclic JSJ-decomposition of G relative to A. If the rank of G is bigger than 4, then G has a subgroup A such that the definable <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> is <b>a</b> proper subgroup <b>of</b> the algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> This answers <b>a</b> question <b>of</b> Sela...|$|R
