5|$|The {{space between}} the large {{fortification}}s was covered {{by a series of}} smaller redans (<b>chevron-shaped</b> forts) and barkans (trapezoidal forts). The strongest fortification in the outer line of defences was Fort 56 in the suburb of Wola, built around the St Lawrence's Church. It was supported by Lunette 57 in front of it, and two forts (54 and 55) to the south of it. The headquarters was in Fort 73 between Rakowiec and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E
5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident <b>chevron-shaped</b> band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{tectonics}} on Enceladus is also {{derived from}} grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges. These bands, first discovered by Voyager 2, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. Grooved terrains {{such as the}} Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, <b>chevron-shaped</b> features. In other areas, these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running {{the length of the}} feature. Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts.|$|E
5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the tip is orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow <b>chevron-shaped</b> ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|The {{color pattern}} varies geographically. The head has two well-marked dark bands: {{one on the}} crown and the other between the eyes. On {{the sides of the}} head, there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is {{yellowish}} white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground-color varies from straw yellow, to light brown, to orange or reddish brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18–22 backwardly-directed, dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail. Usually these bands are roughly <b>chevron-shaped,</b> but may be more U-shaped in some areas. They also form 2–6 light and dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered dark spots. Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the lateral edges.|$|E

25|$|Reptiles often {{retain the}} {{primitive}} intercentra, which are present as small crescent-shaped bony elements lying between {{the bodies of}} adjacent vertebrae; similar structures are often found in the caudal vertebrae of mammals. In the tail, these are attached to <b>chevron-shaped</b> bones called haemal arches, which attach below {{the base of the}} spine, and help to support the musculature. These latter bones are probably homologous with the ventral ribs of fish. The number of vertebrae in the spines of reptiles is highly variable, and may be several hundred in some species of snake.|$|E
25|$|Climactichnites is {{the name}} given to surface trails and burrows that consist {{of a series of}} <b>chevron-shaped</b> raised cross bars that are usually flanked on either side by a {{parallel}} ridge. They somewhat resemble tire tracks, and are larger (typically about four inches wide) than most of the other trace fossils made by invertebrates. The trails were produced on sandy tidal flats during Cambrian time. While the identity of the animal is still conjectural, {{it may have been a}} large slug-like animal - its trails produced as it crawled over and processed the wet sand to obtain food.|$|E
25|$|The juveniles are {{distinctive}} due {{to their}} 'threadfin' appearance of having trailing anal and dorsal fin filaments which recede with age. During maturation, the species also becomes more elongate and more like that of other genera of jacks. The body is a silvery-metallic blue to blue-green colour above, being darkest {{on the head and}} upper shoulders while the underside is more silvery. The juveniles have five <b>chevron-shaped</b> dark bars on their bodies, with a black blotch {{at the base of the}} third to sixth soft dorsal fin rays. The base of the filaments is a dark blue to black, with all other fins pale to hyaline in appearance.|$|E
500|$|The {{spotted eagle}} ray's {{specialized}} <b>chevron-shaped</b> tooth structure helps it {{to crush the}} mollusks' hard shells. The jaws of these rays have developed calcified struts to help them break through the shells of mollusks, by supporting the jaws and preventing dents from hard prey. These rays have the unique behavior of digging with their snouts in the sand of the ocean. [...] While doing this, a cloud of sand surrounds the ray and sand spews from its gills. One study has shown {{that there are no}} differences in the feeding habits of males and females or in rays from different regions of Australia and Taiwan.|$|E
500|$|Fossils of chordates, the phylum {{to which}} humans belong, are very rare in Cambrian sediments. Conway Morris {{classified}} the Burgess Shale fossil Pikaia as a chordate {{because it had}} a rudimentary notochord, the rod of cartilage that evolved into the backbone of vertebrates. Doubts have been raised about this, {{because most of the}} important features are not quite like those of chordates: it has repeated blocks of muscle along its sides but they are not chevron-shaped; there is no clear evidence of anything like gills; and its throat appears to be in the upper part of its body rather than the lower. It also has [...] "tentacles" [...] on the front of its head, unlike living chordates. At best it may be a stem group chordate, in other words an evolutionary [...] "aunt" [...] of living chordates. Metaspriggina, also found in the Burgess Shale but even rarer, may be a chordate, if the repeated <b>chevron-shaped</b> structures along its sides represent muscle blocks. While Pikaia was celebrated in the mid-1970s as the earliest known chordate, three jawless fish have since been found among the Chengjiang fossils, which are about 17million years older than the Burgess Shale.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circumflex}} is a diacritic in the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts {{that is used}} in {{the written}} forms of many languages and in various romanization and transcription schemes. It received its English name from Latin circumflexus [...] "bent around"a translation of the Greek περισπωμένη (perispōménē). The circumflex in the Latin script is <b>chevron-shaped</b> ( [...] ˆ [...] ), while the Greek circumflex may be displayed either like a tilde ( [...] ˜ [...] ) or like an inverted breve ( [...] ̑ [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Conodonts resembled {{primitive}} jawless eels. They appeared 495 Ma {{and were}} wiped out 200 Ma. Initially they were known only from tooth-like microfossils called conodont elements. These [...] "teeth" [...] have been variously interpreted as filter-feeding apparatuses or as a [...] "grasping and crushing array". Conodonts ranged in length from a centimeter to the 40cm Promissum. Their large eyes had a lateral position, which makes a predatory role unlikely. The preserved musculature hints that some conodonts (Promissum at least) were efficient cruisers but incapable of bursts of speed. In 2012 researchers classify the conodonts in the phylum Chordata {{on the basis of}} their fins with fin rays, <b>chevron-shaped</b> muscles and notochord. Some researchers see them as vertebrates similar in appearance to modern hagfish and lampreys, though phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are more derived than either of these groups.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{smallest}} of extant sharks, the smalleye pygmy shark attains a maximum recorded length of [...] It is shaped like a cigar and has a bulbous, pointed snout. The eyes are relatively small, with their diameters measuring 4366% {{as long as the}} snout (compared to 6182% in S. laticaudus). The eyes of this species also differ from S. laticaudus in that the upper rim of the eye socket is <b>chevron-shaped</b> rather than nearly straight. The nostrils lack substantially expanded skin flaps in front. The mouth is nearly transverse and bears thin lips; a pair of papillae (nipple-like structures) is on the upper lip that is absent in S. laticaudus. There are 2027 upper tooth rows and 1823 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are slender and upright. The larger, broader lower teeth have angled and knife-like cusps, and interlock to form a continuous cutting surface. The five pairs of gill slits are tiny and uniform.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{or not a}} tidally locked {{planet with}} the orbital {{characteristics}} of Gliese 581g is actually habitable depends on {{the composition of the}} atmosphere {{and the nature of the}} planetary surface. A comprehensive modeling study including atmospheric dynamics, realistic radiative transfer and the physics of formation of sea ice (if the planet has an ocean) indicates that the planet can become as hot as Venus if it is dry and allows carbon dioxide to accumulate in its atmosphere. The same study identified two habitable states for a water-rich planet. If the planet has a very thin atmosphere, a thick ice crust forms over most of the surface, but the substellar point remains hot enough to yield a region of thin ice or even episodically open water. If the planet has an atmosphere with Earthlike pressures, containing approximately 20% (molar) carbon dioxide, then the greenhouse effect is sufficiently strong to maintain a pool of open water under the substellar point with temperatures comparable to the Earth's tropics. This state has been dubbed [...] "Eyeball Earth" [...] by the author. Modeling of the effect of tidal locking on Gliese 581g's possible atmosphere, using a general circulation model employing an atmosphere with Earthlike surface pressure but a highly idealized representation of radiative processes, indicates that for a solid-surface planet the locations of maximum warmth would be distributed in a sideways <b>chevron-shaped</b> pattern centered near the substellar point.|$|E
6000|$|The {{greater part}} of the vendors seemed to be women, of the buyers men; there was more {{difference}} of appearance than in any European fair, and the population about Nkulu {{seemed to be a}} very mixed race. Some were ultra-negro, of the dead dull-black type, prognathous and long-headed like apes; others were of the red variety, with hair and eyes of a brownish tinge, and a few had features which if whitewashed could hardly be distinguished from Europeans. The tattoo was remarkable as amongst the tribes of the lower Zambeze.[FN#33] There were waistcoats, epaulettes, braces and cross-belts of huge welts, and raised polished lumps which must have cost not a little suffering; the skin is pinched up between the fingers and sawn across with a bluntish knife, the deeper the better; various plants are used as styptics, and the proper size of the cicatrice is maintained by constant pressure, which makes the flesh protrude from the wound. The teeth were as barbarously mutilated as the skin; these had all the incisors sharp-tipped; those chipped a <b>chevron-shaped</b> hole in the two upper or lower frontals, and not a few seemed to attempt converting the whole denture into molars. The legs were undeniably fine; even Hieland Mary's would hardly be admired here. Whilst the brown mothers smoked and carried their babies, the men bore guns adorned with brass tacks, or leaned upon their short, straight, conical [...] "spuds" [...] and hoes, long-handled bits of iron whose points, after African fashion, passed through the wood. I nowhere saw the handsome carved spoons, the hafts and knife-sheaths figured by the Congo Expedition.|$|E
