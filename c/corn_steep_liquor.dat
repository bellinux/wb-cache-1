[...] A viscous concentrate of corn solubles which contains amino acids, vitamins and minerals, {{it is an important}} constituent of some growth media.

In July 1943, the War Production Board drew up a plan for the mass distribution of penicillin stocks to Allied troops fighting in Europe. The results of fermentation research on <b>corn</b> <b>steep</b> <b>liquor</b> at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory at Peoria, Illinois, allowed the United States to produce 2.3 million doses in time for the invasion of Normandy in the spring of 1944. After a worldwide search in 1943, a mouldy cantaloupe in a Peoria, Illinois market was found to contain the best strain of mould for production using the <b>corn</b> <b>steep</b> <b>liquor</b> process. Pfizer scientist Jasper H. Kane suggested using a deep-tank fermentation method for producing large quantities of pharmaceutical-grade penicillin.

A previous communica-tion from this laboratory (Waldroup et al., 1970) noted that this material was ac ceptable in high energy broiler feeds at levels up to 15 percent of the diet.

50|$|The corn is steeped for 30 to 48 hours, which ferments it slightly. The germ is {{separated}} from the endosperm and those two components are ground separately (still soaked).

The starch {{is separated}} from the <b>corn</b> <b>steep</b> <b>liquor,</b> the cereal germ, the fibers and the corn gluten mostly in hydrocyclones and centrifuges, and then dried. (The residue from every stage is used in animal feed and to make corn oil or other applications.) This process is called wet milling. Finally, the starch may be modified for specific purposes.|$|E
50|$|Carbon {{sources are}} {{typically}} sugars or other carbohydrates, {{although in the}} case of substrate transformations (such as the production of vinegar) the carbon source may be an alcohol or something else altogether.

More sensitive fermentations may instead use purified glucose, sucrose, glycerol or other sugars, which reduces variation and helps ensure the purity of the final product.
