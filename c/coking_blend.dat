40|$|The {{analysis}} of Carbon Footprint (CF) for technology of hydrogen production from cleaned {{coke oven gas}} was performed. On the basis of real data and simulation calculations of the production process of hydrogen from coke gas, emission indicators of carbon dioxide (CF) were calculated. These indicators are associated with net production of electricity and thermal energy and direct emission of carbon dioxide throughout a whole product life cycle. Product life cycle includes: coal extraction and its transportation to a coking plant, the process of coking coal, purification and reforming of coke oven gas, carbon capture and storage. The values were related to 1 Mg of <b>coking</b> <b>blend</b> and to 1 Mg of the hydrogen produced. The calculation {{is based on the}} configuration of hydrogen production from coke oven gas for coking technology available on a commercial scale that uses a technology of coke dry quenching (CDQ). The calculations were made using ChemCAD v. 6. 0. 2 simulator for a steady state of technological process.

40|$|Two {{lubricating}} oils, {{a plastic}} waste composed mainly of polyolefins (95 %) and their mixtures (1 : 1 w/w) were assessed for possible use as minor components of coal blends for metallurgical coke production. The addition of 2 wt% plastic waste causes {{a decrease in}} the maximum fluidity of the coal developed during thermal heating between 400 and 500 °C. At the same addition rate, the two oils are good additives for mixing with coal/plastic blends in order to partially restore the caking ability of the co-carbonizing systems. Co-carbonizations of the <b>coking</b> <b>blend</b> with the different wastes were carried out in a movable wall oven of 15 kg capacity. Although the bulk density remained unchanged, the addition of the plastic waste produced an increase in coking pressure to values that were too high for it to be considered as a safe blend. At the same time the mechanical strength of the partially gasified coke was improved as reflected by the CSR index. The oils, however, had the effect of reducing bulk density and the coking pressure generated during the process. When blended with the coal and the plastics, the oils appeared to act as good solvents of the polyolefins and also proved to be effective in decreasing coking pressure without negatively affecting coke quality...|$|E
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAH) {{are produced by}} many industrial processes and, according to many studies, the highest exposure levels have been measured in coking plants and foundries. One of the aims of this investigation is {{to determine whether or}} not the use of carbon stable isotopic analysis could aid in the identification of the source of PAHs, by the monitoring of these compounds derived from a wide range of coals of different origins. Tars from coals internationally used as components of commercial coking blends were obtained by the Gray-King test. A <b>coking</b> <b>blend,</b> prepared with different proportions of some of these coals, was also tested. The tars were preliminarily analysed by GC-MS in order to determine the concentrations of the USEPA priority pollutant PAHs, which would have implications in the eventual emissions that may take place in the industrial coking process. Further analysis of the tars by GC-IRMS was carried out, in order to determine the 13 C/ 12 C ratios (d 13 C) of the PAHs present, the results of which would detect differences depending on the origins of the coals. The values obtained by analysis of the coal blends were also compared to those of their component coals, and gave indications about the possibility of predicting both the quantity of PAHs emitted, and the d 13 C values of those PAHs, from a blend...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{addition}} of biomass to <b>coking</b> <b>blends</b> {{has the potential}} benefits of reducing the amount of expensive coking coals and reducing carbon emissions. However, there is little research in the use of biomass as additive in <b>coking</b> <b>blends.</b> The easily available biomass samples pine wood, sugar beet, and miscanthus have been chosen to study the effect of these additives on the fluidity properties of coal. High-temperature small-amplitude oscillatory-shear (SAOS) rheometry was used to determine the fluidity of the samples as a function of temperature. TGA and solid-state C- 13 NMR were also used to determine the thermal stability and compositional changes in the samples during pyrolysis. Sugar beet can be added in <b>coking</b> <b>blends</b> up to 5 wt % without altering the viscoelastic properties of the coal, whereas pine wood and miscanthus reduce the fluidity even with 2 wt % additions. No solid solid interactions were observed in the blends, but there were differences in viscoelastic behavior that were attributed to gas solid interactions. Fast heating (i. e., 180 degrees C/min) can facilitate the incorporation of pine wood and miscanthus in <b>coking</b> <b>blends.</b> The use of fast heating increases the fluidity of the coal and preserves the fluid material in the biomass at higher temperatures. As a result, the biomass acts as a regulator of fluid material development in the coal, and the viscoelastic properties of the blend are identical to those of prime coking coals. Although fast heating could also be used to produce good <b>coking</b> <b>blends</b> by combining biomass with high volatile matter, high fluidity coals, the amount of biomass required (> 5 wt %) is expected to be detrimental for coke strength...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} coking coals {{covering}} {{a wide range}} of coalification, thermoplastic properties and geographical origin were carbonized at two different scales. All the coals used are available in the international market and they are used by the cokemaking industry in blend preparation. The cokes were produced in two movable wall ovens of 15 and 300 kg capacity available at INCAR-CSIC facilities. The quality of the cokes was assessed by means of reactivity towards carbon dioxide and mechanical strength before and after the reaction with CO 2. The results obtained are very promising and a good correlation between the quality parameters of the cokes produced in the two ovens was found. The use of a semi-pilot oven against big-capacity ovens in the optimization of complex <b>coking</b> <b>blends</b> allows to obtain valuable results by using small amount of coal (15 kg vs. 300 - 400 kg) with the advantages that it is quicker, more flexible and of lower cost.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{blending}} polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET), a flexible polyurethane (FPU), {{and a car}} shredded fluff waste (CSF) on fluidity development of a bituminous coal during carbonization have been studied by means of high-torque, small-amplitude controlled-strain rheometry and in situ high-temperature H- 1 NMR spectroscopy. The most detrimental effects were caused by PET and PS, which completely destroyed the fluidity of the coal. The CSF had a deleterious effect on coal fluidity {{similar to that of}} PET, although the deleterious effect on the viscoelastic properties of the coal were less pronounced than those of PET and PS. On the contrary, the addition of 10 wt % PE caused a slight reduction in the concentration of fluid hydrogen and an increase in the minimum complex viscosity, and the addition of 10 wt % FPU reduced the concentration of fluid hydrogen without changing the viscoelastic properties of the coal. Although these results suggest that these two plastics could potentially be used as additives in <b>coking</b> <b>blends</b> without compromising coke porosity, {{it was found that the}} semicoke strengths were reduced by adding 2 wt % FPU and 5 wt % PE. Therefore, it is unlikely that more than 2 wt % of a plastic waste could be added to a coal blend without deterioration in coke quality...|$|R

40|$|Blends {{of three}} Australian coking coals and polypropylene, polystyrene, {{polyacrylonitrile}} and polyphenylene sulfide were prepared {{and the extent}} to which the blends fused on heating was monitored using proton magnetic resonance thermal analysis in order to identify interactions between them that could affect their fluidity. Different plastics had different effects. Polystyrene strongly reduced the fluidity of all of the coals, confirming previous findings. Polypropylene did not affect the fluidity of the two coking coals of lower rank. Polyphenylene sulfide reduced the fluidity of the coals at temperatures near the solidification temperature of the coals, and polyacrylonitrile appeared to increase the fluidity of the coals at temperatures near the softening temperature of the coals.

40|$|Given {{the high}} costs and general {{shortage}} of coking coals on the domestic and international markets, and because the nature and qualities {{of many of the}} coking coals available on the markets are themselves mixed products, conventional mechanisms and tried and trusted formulae for manufacturing coke products based on single coals of known qualities can no longer apply. There is therefore an urgent need to develop more effective techniques for evaluating and assessing the properties of individual coals rapidly and reliably and in a manner that could provide useful data for use in modelling the effect of new coal components in a coke blend. Towards this end, the current research has sought to find more accurate coal characterisation techniques at laboratory scale than currently exists in industry at present. Seventeen <b>coking</b> or <b>blend</b> <b>coking</b> coals from widely different sources were selected and cokes were produced from them in as close to full scale conventional conditions as possible. Both coals and cokes were analysed using conventional chemical, physical, petrographic and rheological coking methods. The results indicated that, whilst all coals had acceptable chemical, physical and petrographic properties as evaluated on individual parameters thereby indicating their potential values as prime coking coals, in fact the resultant cokes of some of the coals had properties that disproved this assessment. These anomalies were investigated by integrating all characteristics and statistically evaluating them. The result [outcome] indicated that the series of coals under review fall naturally into three distinct categories according to rank, as determined by the reflectance of vitrinite, and that the coking coals in each rank category were further characterised by parameters specific to that level of rank. In this way more accurate predictions of coke quality were obtained than has been the case to date when using single set evaluations or previously devised formulae. On this basis it was concluded that, when selecting coals for coke making, it is essential to first establish the rank of the coal by vitrinite reflectance and then to apply coke evaluating parameters specific to that level of rank. The formulae developed for this purpose held good for all coals tested, however, {{it remains to be seen}} whether this applies universally to an even wider source of coals...|$|R
