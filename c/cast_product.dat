50|$|Mold Tapering: The twin-belt {{casting machine}} differs from other moving mold casting {{machines}} in that all four mold surfaces are independent. This allows the mold surfaces {{to be tapered}} to remain {{in contact with the}} <b>cast</b> <b>product</b> as it shrinks. The high velocity cooling water, which is continuously applied to the backside of the belt, impinges on the belt and creates a force on the belt.This force acts to press the belt against the surface of the strip or slab as it shrinks, keeping the belt in close contact with the <b>cast</b> <b>product</b> throughout the mold. Each side of the mold is formed by an endless chain of dam blocks,which are held against the cast strip by adjustable spring-loaded guides.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface finish}} {{obtained}} in sand castings is generally poor (dimensionally inaccurate), and hence in many cases, the <b>cast</b> <b>product</b> {{is subjected to}} machining processes like turning or grinding {{in order to improve}} the surface finish. During machining processes, some metal is removed from the piece. To compensate for this, a machining allowance (additional material) should be given in the casting.|$|E

50|$|Flash, {{also known}} as flashing, is excess {{material}} attached to a molded, forged, or <b>cast</b> <b>product,</b> which must usually be removed. This is typically caused by leakage of the material between the two surfaces of a mold (beginning along the parting line) or between the base material and the mold (in the case of overmolding). Molding flash is seen when the optimized parameter on cull height is not calibrated. Proper design of mold parting surfaces can reduce or eliminate flash.|$|E
50|$|To carve wax, {{the proper}} {{size and shape}} of block or tube is chosen, in the {{preferred}} hardness, and cut to a rough size, as needed. Then the design is generally drawn or laid out on that, and saws, files or machine tools are used to work the wax into a finished product. The wax is easily taken to a fine finish in the end using a bit of nylon stocking or steel wool. After the wax product is finished, it may be molded or used in the lost wax casting process to create a final <b>cast</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{grey cast}} iron remelt and recycling, white iron can result in the <b>cast</b> <b>product</b> if careful control of the {{chilling}} tendency is not ensured. Many jobbing foundries are constrained in furnace types and available foundry additives that the operation always results in white irons. This study is towards ensuring grey iron is reproduced from cast iron scrap auto engine blocks, when using a diesel fired rotary furnace and a FeSi alloy for structural modification (inoculation). With varying addition rate of the FeSi alloy to the tapped molten metal, chill wedge tests were performed on two different wedge samples of type W (according to ASTM A 367 - wedge test) with cooling modulus of 0. 45 cm (W 3 ½) and 0. 54 cm (W 4). The carbon equivalents for the test casts were within hypoeutectic range (3. 85 wt. (%) to 4. 11 wt. (%)). In the W 4 wedge sample, at 2. 0 wt. (%) addition rate of the FeSi alloy, the relative clear chill was totally reduced to zero from 19. 76 %, while the relative mottled chill was brought down to 9. 59 % from 33. 71 %. The microstructure from the cast at this level of addition was free of carbidic phases; it shows randomly oriented graphite flakes evenly distributed in the iron matrix. Hardness assessment shows that increasing rate of FeSi addition results in decreasing hardness, with maximum effect at 2. 0 wt. (%) addition. With equivalent aspect ratio (cooling modulus) in a target <b>cast</b> <b>product,</b> this addition rate for this FeSi alloy under this furnace condition will attain graphitized microstructure in the <b>cast</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to ensure the {{granulated}} blast furnace (GBF) slag as an alternative mould material in foundry industry by assessing the <b>cast</b> <b>products</b> structure property correlations. Sodium silicate-CO 2 process was adopted for preparing the moulds. Three types of moulds were made with slag, silica sand individually and combination of these two with 10 % sodium silicate and 20 seconds CO 2 gassing time. A 356 alloy castings were performed on these newly developed slag moulds. The <b>cast</b> <b>products</b> were investigated for its metallography and mechanical properties. Results reveal that <b>cast</b> <b>products</b> with good surface finish and without any defects were produced.

Slag mould casting shows improved mechanical properties like hardness, compression, tensile and impact strength compared to sand mould castings. Two types of tensile fracture modes, namely cleavage pattern with flat surfaces representing Al−Si eutectic zone and the areas of broken Fe-rich intermetallic compounds which appear as flower-like morphology was observed in sand mould castings. In contrast, GBF slag mould castings exhibit majority in dimple fracture morphology with traces of cleavage fracture.
