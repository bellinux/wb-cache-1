40|$|The {{cryosphere}} of the Earth {{overlaps with}} the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere over vast areas with temperatures below zero C and pronounced H 2 O phase changes. In {{spite of its}} strong variability in space and time, the cryosphere {{plays the role of}} a global thermostat keeping the thermal regime on the Earth within rather narrow limits affording continuation of the conditions needed for the maintenance of life. Objects and processes related to cryosphere are very diverse due to the following basic reasons: anomalous thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of H 2 O, intermediate intensity of hydrogen bonds, and very wide spread of cryogenic systems all over the Earth. These features yet attract insufficient attention of research communities. <b>Cryology</b> is usually understood as a descriptive discipline within physical geography basically limited to glaciology and permafrost research. We emphasize its broad interdisciplinary landscape involving physical, chemical and biological phenomena related to the H 2 O phase transitions and various forms of ice. This paper aims to attract attention of readers to crucial importance of cryogenic anomalies which make the Earth atmosphere and the entire Earth system very specific, if not unique, objects in the universe...|$|E

Monitoring of soil temperatures at Siberian <b>cryology</b> control stations since 1970 has showed correlations between air temperatures and the depth of permafrost layer that thawed during summer season. Between the 1900 s and 1980 s, the temperature of the surface layer of permafrost increased by 2 48 C; and a further increase of 38 C is expected. Frequent outbreaks of anthrax caused the death of 1. 5 million deer in the Russian North between 1897 and 1925. Anthrax among people or cattle has been reported in 29, 000 settlements of the Russian North, including more than 200 Yakutia settlements located near the burial grounds of cattle that have died from anthrax. Statistically significant positive trends in annual average temperatures were established in 8 out of 17 administrative districts of Yakutia for which sufficient meteorological data were available. At present, it is not known whether further warming of the permafrost will lead to the release of viable anthrax organisms. Nevertheless, we suggest that it would be prudent to undertake careful monitoring of permafrost conditions in all areas where an anthrax outbreak has occurred in the past...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{dynamics}} directly {{reflecting the}} complicated land-ocean interactions {{play an important}} role in the balance of sediments, organic carbon and nutrients in the Arctic basin. Recent studies indicate that sediment input to the Arctic shelves resulting from erosion of ice-rich, permafrost-dominated coasts may be equal to or greater than input from rivers. Thus, the understanding and quantification of coastal processes is critical for interpreting the geological history of the Arctic shelves. The predictions of future behavior of these coasts in response to climatic and sea level changes is an important issue because most of the human activity that occurs at high latitudes concentrates on the Arctic coastlines. Arctic Coastal Dynamics (ACD) is a multi-disciplinary, multi-national project of the International Arctic Sciences Committee (IASC) and the International Permafrost Association (IPA). Its overall objective is to improve our understanding of circum-Arctic coastal dynamics as a function of environmental forcing, coastal geology and <b>cryology</b> and morphodynamic behavior. In particular, ACD aims to: establish the rates and magnitudes of erosion and accumulation of Arctic coasts; develop a network of long-term monitoring sites; identify and undertake focused research on critical processes; estimate the amount of sediments and organic carbon derived from coastal erosion; refine and apply an Arctic coastal classification (includes ground-ice, permafrost, geology etc.) in digital form (GIS format); extract and utilize existing information on relevant environmental forcing parameters (e. g. wind speed, sea level, fetch, sea ice etc.); produce a series of thematic and derived maps (e. g. coastal classification, ground-ice, sensitivity etc.); develop empirical models to assess the sensitivity of Arctic coasts to environmental variability and human impacts. At the present state, emphasis is on developing a reliable circum-Arctic estimate of sediment and organic carbon input from coastal erosion to the inner shelf, which involves classifying and segmenting the entire circum-Arctic coastline into common elements based primarily on morphology, ground-ice composition and erosion rates. During the third IASC-sponsored ACD workshop, held in Oslo (Norway) on 2 - 5 Dec. 2002, regional working groups continued previous efforts for their sectors and the final version of the segmentation and classification will be available at the next ACD workshop to be organized in St. Petersburg (Russia) in Nov. 2003. Additionally, representative photographs of coastal sites for each sector for inclusion in a coastal photo library available at the ACD web site were selected during the Oslo meeting. Finally, two circum-Arctic working groups focused on GIS development and extraction and presentation of environmental data, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The Tarim River basin, {{located in}} Xinjiang, NW China, {{is the largest}} endorheic river basin in China {{and one of the}} largest in all of Central Asia. Due to the {{extremely}} arid climate, with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm, the water supply along the Aksu and Tarim rivers solely depends on river water. This is linked to anthropogenic activities (e. g., agriculture) and natural and semi-natural ecosystems as both compete for water. The ongoing increase in water consumption by agriculture and other human activities in this region has been enhancing the competition for water between human needs and nature. Against this background, 11 German and 6 Chinese universities and research institutes have formed the consortium SuMaRiO (Sustainable Management of River Oases along the Tarim River; [URL]), which aims to create a holistic picture of the availability of water resources in the Tarim River basin and the impacts on anthropogenic activities and natural ecosystems caused by the water distribution within the Tarim River basin. On the basis of the results from field studies and modeling approaches as well as from suggestions by the relevant regional stakeholders, a decision support tool (DST) will be implemented that will then assist stakeholders in balancing the competition for water, acknowledging the major external effects of water allocation to agriculture and to natural ecosystems. This consortium was formed in 2011 and is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. As the data collection phase was finished this year, the paper presented here brings together the results from the fields from the disciplines of climate modeling, <b>cryology,</b> hydrology, agricultural sciences, ecology, geoinformatics, and social sciences in order to present a comprehensive picture of the effects of different water availability schemes on anthropogenic activities and natural ecosystems along the Tarim River. The second objective is to present the project structure of the whole consortium, the current status of work (i. e., major new results and findings), explain the foundation of the decision support tool as a key product of this project, and conclude with application recommendations for the region. The discharge of the Aksu River, which is the major tributary of the Tarim, has been increasing over the past 6 decades. From 1989 to 2011, agricultural area more than doubled: cotton became the major crop and there was a shift from small-scale to large-scale intensive farming. The ongoing increase in irrigated agricultural land leads to the increased threat of salinization and soil degradation caused by increased evapotranspiration. Aside from agricultural land, the major natural and semi-natural ecosystems are riparian (Tugai) forests, shrub vegetation, reed beds, and other grassland, as well as urban and peri-urban vegetation. Within the SuMaRiO cluster, focus has been set on the Tugai forests, with Populus euphratica as the dominant tree species, because these forests belong to the most productive and species-rich natural ecosystems of the Tarim River basin. At sites close to the groundwater, the annual stem diameter increments of Populus euphratica correlated with the river runoffs of the previous year. However, the natural river dynamics cease along the downstream course and thus hamper the recruitment of Populus euphratica. A study on the willingness to pay for the conservation of the natural ecosystems was conducted to estimate the concern of the people in the region and in China's capital. These household surveys revealed that there is a considerable willingness to pay for conservation of the natural ecosystems, with mitigation of dust and sandstorms considered the most important ecosystem service. Stakeholder dialogues contributed to creating a scientific basis for a sustainable management in the future...|$|E
