5|$|With {{a losing}} record, the Pros could not <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the APFA Championship. After {{the season was}} over, the team hired Max Hicks to be the coach for the {{following}} season. The Pros' 1920 record of 2–5–2 would be their best outing until 1924; the team folded two years later. Sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the 1920 All Pro team, but no player made the list.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Wojtek Wolski was the Avalanche player seen as {{favorite}} to <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the Calder Memorial Trophy; however, the scoring streak put Stastny into contention as well. Stastny's play {{was one of the reasons}} the Avalanche experienced their best run of the season towards the end, winning 15 of their last 19games but missing the playoffs by one point. Stastny ended his rookie season with 78points, finished second to Pittsburgh Penguins' Evgeni Malkin in the voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy and was named to the 2006–07 NHL All-Rookie Team.|$|E

5|$|Hurt by {{losses to}} the Akron Pros and Buffalo All-Americans, the Bulldogs did not <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the APFA trophy in 1920. Following the season, Thorpe left {{to start a}} new club {{composed}} of Native Americans in LaRue, Ohio and Cap Edwards took over as head coach. Sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the All-Pro list for the 1920 season, naming the Bulldogs' Wilbur Henry to the first team. Cub Buck, Harry Dadmun, and Joe Guyon were on the second team, and Pete Calac was on the third team. Three men who played for the 1920 Canton Bulldogs were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Thorpe and Pete Henry in 1963 and Guyon in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville in a position to <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, mature {{females of}} P. fimbriata, P. africana, P. fimbriata, P. labiata, and P. schultzi emit {{olfactory}} signals that {{reduce the risk}} that any other females, males or juveniles {{of the same species}} may <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the same prey. The effect inhibits aggressive mimicry against a prey spider even if the prey spider is visible, and also if the prey is inhabiting any part of a web. If a female of one of these Portias smells a male of the same species, the female stimulates the males to court. These Portia species do not show this behaviour when they receive olfactory signals from members of other Portia species.|$|E

However, with wins against the Gas City Tigers and the Muncie Offers More AC, the Flyers {{claimed to have}} won the Indiana State Championship. Sportswriter Bruce Copeland {{compiled}} the All-Pro list for the 1920 season, but no player from the Flyers was on the list. Ken Huffine decided to be affiliated with the Chicago Stayles after the 1920 season, and Cooney Checkaye took over the role the following season. It did not help, and the Flyers' final year in the APFA was 1921. As of 2012, no players from the 1920 Muncie Flyers have been enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi {{will try}} to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a {{dragline}} made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other {{on her back and}} the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles of the same species may <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the same prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{include the}} previous year's winner Gianni Bugno. He {{also stated that}} Claudio Chiappucci would likely <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the overall crown due to his good form coming into the race. According to Paolo Viberti of El País, Bugno came in as the odds on favorite to win the race. Eugenio Capodacqua of La Repubblica and La Stampas Gianni Ranieri believed that the race was going be won by either Chiappucci or Bugno. Despite being favored to win the race, Bugno entered the race with no victories to his name that season. American Greg LeMond told the press he planned to be more competitive at this Giro than he had in years past. Other favorites to win the race were Laurent Fignon, Pedro Delgado, and Marino Lejarreta.|$|E

5|$|With Graham {{gone and}} the quarterback {{situation}} in flux, the Browns ended 1956 with a 5–7 record, Paul Brown's first losing season as a professional coach. In the next year's draft, the team selected Jim Brown out of Syracuse University. As television began to help football leapfrog baseball as America's most popular sport, Jim Brown became a larger-than-life personality. He was handsome and charismatic in private and dominant on the field. Paul Brown, however, was critical of some aspects of Jim Brown's game, including his disinclination to block. In Jim Brown's first season, the team reached the championship game, again against the Lions, but lost 59–14. The Browns did not <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the championship in the following two years, when a Baltimore Colts team coached by Brown's former protege Weeb Ewbank won a pair of titles.|$|E
5|$|Among the pre-race {{favorites}} was {{the entire}} Spanish contingent of riders. It included two winners of Grand Tours in Alberto Contador and Carlos Sastre, along with highly regarded countrymen Alejandro Valverde, {{winner of the}} 2008 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and the reigning Spanish national road race champion, and Samuel Sánchez, who had won three stages in the 2007 Vuelta a España. They also had 2008 Tour de France points classification winner and three-time world champion Óscar Freire available {{to work on their}} behalf. Valverde was seen as the strongest threat among the Spaniards. Other medal hopefuls included the defending Olympic champion Paolo Bettini of Italy, Germany's Stefan Schumacher, and Australian Cadel Evans, twice a runner-up in the Tour de France (2007 and 2008). It was thought that members of the overall strong squads from Germany and Luxembourg could also <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> victory. The German team contained Schumacher and many veterans of Grand Tours such as Jens Voigt to work in support, while Luxembourg had the Schleck brothers Andy and Fränk, along with Kim Kirchen, all of whom had worn leader's jerseys during the 2008 Tour de France.|$|E
5|$|After the Predators' {{regular season}} success in 2005–06, the team bolstered their lineup by {{acquiring}} centre Jason Arnott and winger Jean-Pierre Dumont. In response to Arnott's signing, Kariya {{commented that the}} centre position, as well as size, were weaknesses for the team the previous year, especially when they matched up against the Sharks' top two centres, Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau, in the playoffs. Leading up to the 2006–07 season, the Predators were picked by many analysts in the media (including those from The Globe and Mail and ESPN) to <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the Stanley Cup. Prior {{to the start of}} the campaign, the Predators announced defenceman Kimmo Timonen as the team's new captain, while naming Kariya and Steve Sullivan as alternates (the two served in that role the previous season, as well, but not on a permanent basis). With Kariya leading the team in scoring, the team boasted the top record in the league by the All-Star break. At the NHL trade deadline, the team further bolstered their lineup by acquiring high-profile centre Peter Forsberg from Philadelphia. Forsberg joined Kariya on the top line, though not consistently. With 76 points (24 goals and 52 assists)—the second highest total in team history—over 82 games, Kariya led the Predators in scoring for a second-straight year. His seven shootout goals (over 11 attempts) tied for second in the league, one behind Erik Christensen of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Predators continued to improve and finished with a new team record of 51 wins and 110 points. Despite ranking as the second-best team in the West, Nashville seeded fourth in their conference (divisional winners within the conference take the top three seeds; Detroit beat the Predators by three points in the Central Division). Playing against the San Jose Sharks for the second consecutive year, the Predators were once again eliminated in five games. Kariya struggled with two assists during the series.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Great Moravia in 907 the area could have been under the {{influence}} of Bohemian rulers. In the late 10th century Poland, ruled by Bolesław I Chrobry, began to <b>contend</b> <b>for</b> the region, which was crossed by important international routes. From 950 to 1060 it was under the rule of the Duchy of Bohemia, and from 1060 it was part of Poland. The written history explicitly about the region begins on 23 April 1155 when Cieszyn/Těšín was first mentioned in a written document, a letter from Pope Adrian IV issued for Walter, Bishop of Wrocław, where it was listed amongst other centres of castellanies. The castellany was then a part of Duchy of Silesia. In 1172 it became a part of Duchy of Racibórz, and from 1202 of Duchy of Opole and Racibórz. In {{the first half of the}} 13th century the Moravian settlement organised by Arnold von Hückeswagen from Starý Jičín castle and later accelerated by Bruno von Schauenburg, Bishop of Olomouc, began to press close to Silesian settlements. This prompted signing of a special treaty between Duke Władysław of Opole and King Ottokar II of Bohemia on December 1261 which regulated a local border between their states along the Ostravice River. In order to strengthen the border Władysław of Opole decided to found Orlová monastery in 1268. In the continued process of feudal fragmentation of Poland the Castellany of Cieszyn was eventually transformed in 1290 into the Duchy of Cieszyn, which in 1327 became an autonomic fiefdom of the Bohemian crown. Upon the death of Elizabeth Lucretia, its last ruler from the Polish Piast dynasty in 1653, it passed directly to the Czech kings from the Habsburg dynasty. When most of Silesia was conquered by Prussian king Frederick the Great in 1742, the Cieszyn region was part of the small southern portion that was retained by the Habsburg monarchy (Austrian Silesia).|$|E
