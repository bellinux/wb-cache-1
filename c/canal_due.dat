5|$|The failed Egyptian {{offensive}} {{gave the}} initiative to the Israelis, who immediately launched Operation Abiray-Lev, aiming to cross the canal between two Egyptian armies in order to encircle Egyptian forces on the east banks and cut their supply lines. Optimistically planned, the operation began smoothly, but quickly ran into problems. The Israelis faced difficulties in establishing a corridor to the <b>canal</b> <b>due</b> to unexpectedly determined resistance by Egyptian defenses, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of the Chinese Farm. After several days of heavy fighting, they were able to secure the roads to the canal, and by October 18 had two bridges laid down at Deversoir, at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake. By the next day there were three Israeli armored divisions across the canal. Two advanced south toward Suez City, while the 143rd Armored Division under Major General Ariel Sharon advanced north to seize Ismailia, hoping to sever the supply lines to three Egyptian divisions of the Second Field Army across the canal.|$|E

25|$|Because of the Six-Day War in Middle East {{which had}} closed the Suez <b>Canal</b> <b>due</b> to the Egyptian Navy's {{blockage}} in 1967, Ghazi, {{under the command}} of Commander Ahmed Tasnim, had to execute the submerged circumnavigation in 1968 from Africa to Western Europe which began from Karachi coast to Cape of Good Hope, South Africa through Atlantic Ocean and ended at the east coast of the Sea of Marmara where the Gölcük Naval Shipyard is located. Chief of Naval Staff Admiral S.M. Ahsan had arranged necessary refitting of Ghazis computers at the Karachi Engineering and Shipyard Works (KESW) from the help from the local industry such as DESTO.|$|E
50|$|As of 2013, Paynes Prairie {{receives}} {{one-third of}} its water from Newnans Lake, one-third from all other sources, and one-third from direct rainfall. The removal of the canals that same year had restored 7.95 miles of dikes and <b>canals.</b> <b>Due</b> to occasional heavy rains the rate of water from Prairie Creek to the Prairie is eliminated entirely to prevent damage to U.S. 441.|$|R
50|$|The canal is {{exploited}} by the Dalslands Kanal AB company, seated in Åmål. The <b>canal</b> <b>dues</b> are SEK50 per lock for small boats up to SEK2500 {{for the whole}} canal back and forth (in 2010). Several shipping companies offer short cruises on the canal. The Dalsland kanotmaraton + canoeing competition is partly held on lakes forming part of the canal system.|$|R
50|$|Large-scale ship canals {{such as the}} Panama Canal and Suez Canal {{continue}} to operate for cargo transportation, as do European barge <b>canals.</b> <b>Due</b> to globalization, they are becoming increasingly important, resulting in expansion projects such as the Panama Canal expansion project.

2500|$|While most large, modern {{cruise ships}} cannot pass through this <b>canal</b> <b>due</b> to {{clearance}} limits under bridges, the SuperStar Gemini has special funnels and masts {{that can be}} lowered for passage. Swan Hellenic's Minerva, P Cruises's Adonia, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines' ship Balmoral, 'Cruise & Maritime Voyages' ship MS Marco Polo, 'Oceania Cruises' Regatta, and Nautica, and MS Prinsendam of Holland America Line are able to transit the canal. Several of the Viking cruise ships are made specifically with Kiel Canal passage in mind, namely the Sea and Sky models.|$|E
50|$|Prinsendam {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of cruise ships that can transit the Kiel <b>Canal,</b> <b>due</b> to her low height above the waterline.|$|E
50|$|Dredging {{operations}} are sometimes completed by cutting {{a path through}} a coral reef, directly destroying the reef structure and killing any organisms that live on it. Operations that directly destroy coral are often intended to deepen or otherwise enlarge shipping channels or <b>canals,</b> <b>due</b> {{to the fact that}} in many areas, removal of coral requires a permit, making it more cost-effective and simple to avoid coral reefs if possible.|$|R
2500|$|The {{total cost}} is unknown since the expansion's {{contractors}} are seeking {{at least an}} addition [...] from the <b>canal</b> authority <b>due</b> to excess expenses.|$|R

40|$|In 5 holothurian {{species of}} the Aspidochirota and Elasipoda orders {{concentration}} of organic carbon in alimentary <b>canals</b> <b>due</b> to selective feeding on the average is 7 times higher than in host sediments. Concentration decreases from {{the first section of}} the alimentary canal to the last. Intestinal contents are enriched with bitumens, in which amount of oils and resins increases, while that of asphaltenes slightly decreases from the first section to the last. It is conjectured from analysis of structure and group composition of oil fraction of bitumens that heteroatomic and specifically oxygen-containing rather than purely hydrocarbon compounds have food value. Organic matter in intestines contains 6 to 9 kcal/g. Judging by changes in chemical composition of contents, only a few of these calories are utilized. Hence to assure themselves of energy they need, organisms must continuously pass sedimentary material through their alimentary canals...|$|R
5000|$|Instruments may {{separate}} (break) during {{root canal}} treatment, meaning {{a portion of}} the metal file used during the procedure remains inside the tooth. The file segment may be left behind if an acceptable level of cleaning and shaping has already been completed and attempting to remove the segment would risk damage to the tooth. While potentially disconcerting to the patient, having metal inside of a tooth is relatively common, such as with metal posts, amalgam fillings, gold crowns, and porcelain fused to metal crowns. The occurrence of file separation is proportional to the narrowness, curvature, length, calcification and number of roots on the tooth being treated. Complications resulting from incompletely cleaned <b>canals,</b> <b>due</b> to blockage from the separated file, can be addressed with surgical root canal treatment.
