50|$|However, {{after the}} impact, the {{operator}} - Stephan A. Martin - continued to apply traction power. This {{resulted in the}} rear cars continuing to push forwards, pinning {{the front of the}} train against the waiting Ravenswood on the right-angle turn of the track. With the front Lake-Dan Ryan train unable to move forward, the pressure from behind caused the <b>coupling</b> <b>bar</b> between the first two cars to bend and the coupled ends of those two cars to be pushed in the air. As motor power continued to be applied, the first three cars were pushed further upwards, until they jackknifed and fell off the tracks. The second and third cars fell {{all the way to the}} street below, while the first car fell onto a track support structure. The fourth car, pulled forward by the third, was derailed and dangled between the track edge and surface street. The last four cars remained on the track - and, in fact, still in Randolph/Wabash station.|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} more tragedies at the brickyard, the first being in 1906, when an 18-year-old worker was killed, whilst trying {{to repair a}} loose board. His clothes became {{entangled}} in an overhead revolving shaft, which was spinning at 100 revolutions a minute. Having been dragged around by the machine, he was rushed to hospital, but sadly died of multiple injuries. In the inquest, no blame {{was attached to the}} company, although the worker's father was awarded £40 compensation for the loss of his son. In 1908, a six-year-old boy was killed on Gunville Lane, while playing on one of the yard's moving steam traction-engines. The engine, pulling two trucks, was returning empty from delivering bricks to the new Naval Hospital at Osborne House. Several children were playing by swinging on one of the truck's <b>coupling</b> <b>bar,</b> without the knowledge of the driver and his mate. When one child fell, he was killed instantly by the truck's wheel passing over his head. As the operators had tried to keep children away and had no knowledge that they were still there, an accidental death ruling was given. In 1911, there was almost another tragedy, when a little girl almost drowned in a deep pool at the brickyard. However, she was rescued by a young boy named Thomas Attrill, who received recognition for his bravery.|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model of}} the classical Huygens' experiment on synchronization of pendulum clocks is examined. The model consists of two pendula coupled by an elastically supported rigid bar. The synchronized limit behaviour of the system, i. e. in-phase and anti-phase synchronization of the pendula, is studied {{as a function of}} the stiffness of the spring that supports the <b>coupling</b> <b>bar.</b> It is demonstrated that the stiffness has a large influence on the existence, stability, and oscillation frequency of the in-phase solution. The relationship between the obtained results and experimental results that have been reported in the literature, including Huygens' original observations, is stressed...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{occurrence}} of synchronization in pairs of weakly nonlinear selfsustained oscillators that interact via Huygens’ coupling, i. e. a suspended rigid bar, is treated. In the analysis, a generalized version of the classical Huygens’ experiment of synchronization of two coupled pendulum clocks is considered, in which the clocks are replaced by arbitrary self-sustained oscillators. Sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of synchronous solutions in the coupled system are derived by using the Poincar´e method. The obtained results are supported by computer simulations and experiments conducted on a dedicated experimental platform. It is demonstrated that {{the mass of the}} <b>coupling</b> <b>bar</b> is an important parameter with respect to the limit synchronous behaviour in the oscillators...|$|E

40|$|A {{miniature}} directional sound sensor was fabricated using {{micro-electromechanical system}} (MEMS) technology {{based on the}} operational principle of Ormia ochracea fly's hearing organ. The fly uses <b>coupled</b> <b>bars</b> hinged at the center to achieve the directional sound sensing by monitoring the difference in vibration amplitude between them. The MEMS sensor design employed in this thesis was fabricated using the PolyMUMPs process. The sound sensor has two primary vibrational modes (rocking and bending) which were simulated by finite element analysis and tested by actuating the sensor using both electrostatics and sound. The experimentally observed vibrational frequencies {{were found to be}} in good agreement with that of the modeling but the amplitudes of vibration were found to be relatively small compared to the expected values. The design of optimized sensors, with larger amplitude of vibration hence high sensitivity, will be discussed in this presentation. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|Thermal guiding effect plays a {{dominant}} role in beam formation of diode end-pumped lasers. Thermally induced aberrations occur for high pump density resulting in beam quality degradation. Thennal distortions in such lasers were investigated {{in this paper}} both theoretically and experimentally. It was found that severe wavefront distortions are generated outside the pump volume whereas for beam confined to pump volume the aberration effects are negligible. For high pump density these distortions result in atypical caustics shape. This effect was examined in two cases: fundamental mode laser pumped by 2 -W cw diode and multimode laser pumped by 1 O-W fiber <b>coupled</b> <b>bar.</b> Two crystals: Nd:YAG and Nd:YVO 4 were used as active media. Caustics shape and beam quality measurements, {{as well as an}} interferometric inspection of wavefront distortion were perfonned. Satisfactory agreement between theory and experiments was achieved.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} an {{extended}} fault positions method {{combined with the}} Monte Carlo method to evaluate voltage sags. The distribution function SARFI is obtained by {{taking into account the}} randomness of (i) location of faults in lines, (ii) generation dispatch, and (iii) the prefault voltage. Voltage magnitudes are calculated with power flow, while noting changes in the generation dispatch, the load, and the topology of the area of vulnerability (AOV). The method is tested in the Atlantic coast area of the National Interconnected Power System of Colombia. The distribution of the number of voltage sags per year with the magnitude in bus bars and the impact of generation on the voltage sags are determined. With a higher number of plants dispatched, voltage sags caused by faults are less severe due to the robustness of the power system and the voltage support. Operation with <b>coupled</b> <b>bars</b> had a greater impact on voltage sags compared to uncoupled bars...|$|R
