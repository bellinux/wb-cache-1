5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and double wishbone suspension, supported by <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b> To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost of}} ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
40|$|In Hermetic Compressors, {{one of the}} {{vibration}} transmission paths from main body to the shell is discharge tube. The main parts of discharge tube are tube part, <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on the tube and resonator cap. The end which is mounted to main body is excitation point. The point that tube is fixed to the shell is evaluation point to investigate the transmitted vibration energy to the shell. Â The <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on the tube has two main effects on tube. One {{of them is the}} mass effect. In usage of <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> creates additional mass to the discharge tube and it causes change of natural frequency of discharge tube. The other one is the damping effect. <b>Coil</b> <b>spring</b> on discharge tube creates impact damping effect and reduces kinetic energy of vibrating discharge tube. The <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> parameters such as spring length, location, diameter, clearance distance, and spring constant which are effects vibration and acoustics characteristics of compressor therefore these parameters should be determined carefully. In this paper, effects of <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> parameters on vibration and acoustic characteristics of compressor are studied numerically and experimentally. The numerical model is verified by using experimental results and then by using this numerical model, works on parameters will be done...|$|R

25|$|The chassis was a widened and {{reinforced}} Healey Silverstone box-section ladder-type steel frame. Independent front suspension, also Healey Silverstone, was by <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> trailing link, and a sway bar. The rear suspension featured Nash's rear end and <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> replaced the Silverstone’s leaf springs, while the beam axle was located by Panhard rod.|$|E
25|$|At {{the level}} of suspensions, the 250 GT Lusso had double {{wishbones}} and <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> at the front, while the rear suspension comprised a live axle, leaf springs, semi-elliptical concentric <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and telescopic shock absorbers. Braking was provided by four-wheel disc brakes with hydraulic control, placed behind the polished aluminum Borrani wire wheels with single knockoffs.|$|E
25|$|For the suspension, the B31 {{featured}} double wishbones, <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> over dampers with an {{anti-roll bar}} at the front, and single top links, twin lower links, twin trailing arms, <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> over dampers with an anti-roll {{bar at the}} rear. The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had rack-and-pinion steering. As the car weighed , it had a power-to-weight ratio of exactly 0.5hp/kg.|$|E

25|$|The leaf-spring {{suspension}} configuration is independent, {{because the}} movement of one wheel is not determined by {{the position of the}} other. Control arms are utilized to define the motion of the wheel as the suspension is compressed. The usual <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> are replaced with a single FRP spring, which spans the width of the car. As in independent suspension systems using <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> and unlike the common leaf-spring supported Hotchkiss rear axle, the suspension kinematics are defined only by the control arms.|$|E
25|$|The bogies for the {{new cars}} were a new design, {{specifically}} prepared by Vicers Ruwolt. The suspension was based on <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> with a secondary cast bolster with spring plank, supported on swing links and <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b> Each bogie weighed 7000kg, with a wheelbase of 2,445mm and a maximum axle load of 14 tonnes, and were designed for operation at up to 130km/h. Tread brakes were fitted, operated by Westinghouse model 250WF brake cylinders. The axle boxes utilised spherical roller bearings, and {{all parts of the}} bogie, except the wheels and axles themselves, were designed for conversion to standard gauge. This latter function was finally used in 2009 when the Mangalore to Albury line was converted to standard gauge.|$|E

25|$|The Range Rover {{broke from}} the Land Rovers {{of its time}} by using <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> instead of the then-common leaf springs. Because of its hefty weight, it also had disc brakes on all four wheels. Originally, it had no power steering, though this was added {{a few years after}} its introduction.|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover was a body-on-frame {{design with}} a box section ladder type chassis, like the {{contemporary}} Series Land Rovers. The Range Rover used <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> as opposed to leaf springs, permanent four-wheel drive, and four-wheel disc brakes. The Range Rover was originally powered by various Rover V8 engines and diesel engines.|$|E

25|$|Packaging {{is cited}} as both an {{advantage}} and disadvantage of the transverse FRP leaf spring, {{as compared to}} <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> depending on the application. The FRP spring is typically set low in the suspension, resulting in a low center of gravity. It also allows manufactures to avoid tall spring mounts, thus resulting in a flatter load floor about the suspension. James Schefter reports that, as used on the C5 and later Corvettes, the use of OEM coilover damper springs would have forced the chassis engineers to either vertically raise the shock towers or move them inward. In the rear this would have reduced trunk space. In the front this would have interfered with engine packaging. The use of the leaf spring allowed the spring to be placed under the chassis, out of the way, while keeping {{the diameter of the}} shock-absorber assembly to that of just the damper, rather than damper and spring. However, in other applications, such as race car designs, the need to span the width of the vehicle resulted in significant design limitations. Coil and torsion springs present better packaging options for racing applications. FRP springs also have limited availability and selection as compared to <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b> Higher cost has also been cited as a disadvantage, when comparing FRP springs to <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> on production road cars.|$|E
25|$|The LVSR {{is powered}} by a 15.2-litre Caterpillar C15 six-cylinder in-line turbocharged, {{water-cooled}} four-stroke diesel, developing 600 hp (448kW). This is coupled to a seven-speed Allison automatic gearbox and Oshkosh single-speed transfer case. Suspension is Oshkosh TAK-4 fully independent all-round, and by <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> on the front two axles, hydraulic on the rear three.|$|E
25|$|Braking duties were {{handled by}} 11.3-inch discs {{up front and}} drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front {{suspension}} consisted of unequal-length control arms, <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a live axle, with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a power-assisted recirculating ball design.|$|E

25|$|The updated P601 was {{introduced}} in 1964. It was essentially a facelift of the P60, with a different front fascia, bonnet, roof and rear and the original P50 underpinnings. The model remained nearly unchanged {{until the end of}} its production except for the addition of 12V electricity, rear <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and an updated dashboard for later models.|$|E
25|$|Suspension on the 1965 models was redesigned. Replacing {{the former}} leaf-spring rear {{suspension}} {{was a new}} three-link system, with <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b> Interiors featured a new instrument panel and two-way key system were introduced. The introduction of two keys was for valet parking, in that the rounded head key would only open the trunk or locked glove compartment, while the squared head key would unlock the doors and the ignition.|$|E
25|$|Since the twin-turbo V6 engine {{occupies}} {{almost as}} much space as their 3-cylinder engines, the fuel tank had to be relocated to {{the nose of the}} car, where a luggage compartment used to be.
