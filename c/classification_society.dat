This requires power, but installing gas turbines means {{shutting down the}} extraction process, losing valuable income.

25|$|Criticism of {{the design}} and {{capabilities}} were raised by safety representatives, citing eleven issues. The vessels suffered numerous issues over their first years of service, including bad wiring, premature corrosion and gearbox failure. Irving Shipbuilding responded to the claims, acknowledging the problems as minor, but stating that Canadian Coast Guard officials and representatives from the marine <b>classification</b> <b>society</b> Lloyd's Register certified the vessels. Five vessels of the class are to receive redesigned galleys after the initial ones were deemed unsafe.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May 1998, a {{flexible}} fuel hose in the ship's engine room burst. The spraying fuel ignited when it {{came into contact with}} hot machinery, and the first-response extinguishers were unable to cope with the fire's intensity. It took two hours for the fire to be extinguished, and four sailors died from carbon monoxide poisoning. A Board of Inquiry reported in December that a different type of hose inappropriate for an engine-room environment was fitted, the civilian contractors that fitted the hose had not passed the configuration changes to the Lloyd's Register <b>classification</b> <b>society</b> as required, and that personnel aboard Westralia did not have the training and qualifications required for their responsibilities. Repairs and modifications were made to the ship, and she returned to operational service during 2000.|$|E

25|$|Open {{registries}} {{have been}} branded as flags of convenience by ITF (International Transport Workers' Federation) {{to have lower}} standards for vessel, equipment, and crew than the traditional maritime countries and often have classification societies certify and inspect the vessels in their registry, instead of by their own shipping authority. This made it attractive for ship owners to change flag, whereby the ship lost the economic link and the country of registry. With this, also the link between <b>classification</b> <b>society</b> and traditional maritime country became less obvious - for instance Lloyd's with the United Kingdom and ABS with the United States. This {{made it easier to}} change class and introduced a new phenomena; class hopping. A ship owner that is dissatisfied with class can change to a different class relatively easily. This has led to more competition between classes and a relaxation of the rules. This has led to the shipping industry losing confidence in the classification societies, but also by the European Commission.|$|E

2500|$|The {{construction}} and historical {{design of the}} ship was made by Joakim Severinsson. The blueprints for the ship was approved by international <b>classification</b> <b>society</b> Det Norske Veritas in November 1995. All that {{was left of the}} Eriksbergs wharf were two-thirds of building berth number six, the large gantry crane and the dry dock. Around this, a new shipyard for building the Götheborg began to grow. A new ship's hall was built over the building berth, a timber workshop, a forge, a rigging workshop with a sail loft and some modern facilities such as a restaurant, offices and conference rooms were also added to the site. Since the wharf was built on reclaimed land, it seemed very apt to call it Terra Nova ("new land" [...] in Latin) just like the wharf where the original vessel had been built.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the world}} {{maritime}} industry, {{a key issue}} raised by the [...] "Prestige" [...] incident was whether classification societies can {{be held responsible for}} the consequences of incidents of this type. In May 2003, the Kingdom of Spain brought civil suit in the Southern District of New York against the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), the Houston-based international <b>classification</b> <b>society</b> that had certified the [...] "Prestige" [...] as [...] "in class" [...] for its final voyage. [...] The [...] "in class" [...] status states that the vessel is in compliance with all applicable rules and laws, not that it is or is not safe. [...] On 2 January 2007, the docket in that lawsuit (SDNY 03-cv-03573) was dismissed. [...] The presiding judge ruled that ABS is a [...] "person" [...] as defined by the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC) and, as such, is exempt from direct liability for pollution damage. [...] Additionally, the Judge ruled that, since the United States is not a signatory to the International CLC, the US Courts lack the necessary jurisdiction to adjudicate the case. Spain's original damage claim against ABS was some $700 million.|$|E

40|$|<b>Classification</b> <b>societies</b> require ship {{manufacturers}} to perform nondestructive examination (NDE) of ship weldments {{to ensure the}} welding quality of new-building ships.

Hence, {{a limited number of}} weldments are specified by rules of <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> to be inspected on a sampling basis. There is a variation between the rules and guidelines used by different <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> in terms of both philosophy and implementation which results in significant discrepancy in the prescribed checkpoints, numbers, and their locations. In this article, relevant sections of the rules of mainstream International Association of <b>Classification</b> <b>Societies</b> members are studied and potential ways of improving them are discussed.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve flag State {{performance}} {{in the field of}} fisheries, the involvement of <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> is proposed. However, very few documents or literature deal with such a proposal. In other words, involvement of <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> in global fisheries is undoubtedly only in the proposal phase yet. The reason why <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> are not involved in fisheries seems to be a simple lack of competence of maritime administrations over fishing vessels. This characteristic makes it unlikely that international legal instruments will include provisions that could be relevant for fishing vessels in the near future. Therefore, it is considered to be wise to start with a blank sheet and develop a potential basis for classification activities in fisheries around the globe from the scratch. The gap between the examination of a single vessel and the assessment of a flag State needs to be bridged. The study addresses the role and function of <b>classification</b> <b>societies</b> in the maritime field and prospects for a parallel role and function vis-a-vis assessments of flag states upholding agreed rules of responsible flag states in fisheries...|$|R
