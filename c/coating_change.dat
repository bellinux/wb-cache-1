For the comparative purposes the bulk WC-Co sample cutted from the WC-Co hot roller was studied as well. It was found, that WC-Co bulk sample cutted from the WC-Co hot roller was coated by WO 2 layer {{as a result}} of the 900 °C temperature air annealing. No connection between the WC-Co coating oxidation and its peeling {{as a result of the}} air annealing was found. The most stable coating in terms of peeling was the most oxidized one.

Microstructure and morphologies of the coating were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Hardness and friction wear properties were tested by nano indentation and friction wear testing machine,respectively. The {{results show that the}} WS_ 2 /TiB_ 2 coating has a columnar crystal structure and shows an obvious TiB_ 2 (001) preferred orientation. With increasing of WS_ 2 target power from 20 to 50 W,the intensity of TiB_ 2 (001) shows a descending trend,the FWHM becomes broader,and then lead to the small grain size. When the WS_ 2 target power exceed 60 W,the structure of <b>coating</b> <b>change</b> from columnar crystal to amorphous state. The WS_ 2 /TiB_ 2 coating has a high hardness (> 25 GPa) and a low friction coefficient (0. 2). The wear rate of the WS_ 2 /TiB_ 2 coating with 40 W sputtering power reaches 6 * 10 ~(- 16) m~ 3 / N m (50 % relative humidity), which is more than 300 times better than that of M_ 2 steel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} thermoelastic sliding {{frictional contact}} of the functionally graded materials (FGMs) coated half-plane under plain strain-state deformation is investigated in this paper. A rigid cylindrical punch is sliding {{over the surface}} of the FGM coating with the constant velocity, which is small compared with the Rayleigh wave velocity of the medium. Frictional heating is generated at the interface between the punch and FGM coating with its value proportional to contact pressure, friction coefficient and sliding velocity. The material properties of the <b>coating</b> <b>change</b> exponentially along the thickness direction. It is assumed that the area outside the contact region is both thermally insulated and traction-free. The Fourier integral transform method is employed to convert the problem into the Cauchy singular integral equations, which is then solved numerically to obtain the unknown contact pressure and the in-plane component of the surface stress. The effects of the gradient index, Peclet number, and friction coefficient on the thermoelastic contact characteristics are discussed in detail. Numerical results show that the change of the gradient index, Peclet number and friction coefficient can influence the distributions of the surface contact stress...|$|E

The study aims were to {{examine the effect of}} spaying and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) treatment on canine hair coat, cycle stages of hair follicles, plasma gonadotropin concentrations and mRNA transcription of luteinizing hormone (LH) and GnRH receptors in hair follicles. Fifteen female dogs were examined before and 1 year after spaying and 24 spayed dogs before and after GnRH treatment. Spaying resulted in increased plasma gonadotropin concentrations and increased anagen : telogen ratio of hair follicles, but only 20 % of the dogs developed <b>coat</b> <b>changes.</b> No differences were found in mRNA transcription of LH and GnRH receptors. GnRH treatment resulted in reduced plasma gonadotropin concentrations and improvement of <b>coat</b> <b>changes</b> in 79 % of patients.

This antenna, integrated to an existing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag, will be implanted under the skin of rats for medical research. The main purpose of this wireless telemetry system is to transmit the extracted physiological signals and indicators {{from the body of}} the rat to an external RFID reader connected to a computer. The total volume of the antenna is 9. 25 mmx 8 mmx 3. 2 mm and the larger ground plane of the RFID circuit board is utilized to improve the performance of the antenna.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} whereby the thickness and elastic modulus of a coating applied to a substrate can be calculated from measurement of the resonant bulk wave ultrasonic modes of the combined substrate and coating. The density of the coating and the material properties of the substrate are required for this method.

In this dynamic system the elastic properties of the <b>coating</b> <b>change</b> and particular resonant modes not only shift but can disappear or appear in the experimental data.

The results show that the full range of <b>coat</b> <b>changes</b> which characterize well-nourished cattle of the type used in this experiment may, irrespective of seasonal temperature, be reversed by artificially reversing the seasonal trend of daylight duration.

Cattle with sleek, summer-type coats have shown decisive heat tolerance superiority over those with deep, winter-type coats under the conditions of this experiment.

40|$|PS 304, a plasma spray {{deposited}} {{solid lubricant}} coating developed for high temperature sliding contacts was deposited on nine different substrate metals, heat treated at 650 C in either air or argon and subsequently tested for strength using a commercially available pull-off adhesion test. Some samples were examined metallographically to help elucidate {{and explain the}} results. As deposited coatings exhibit pull-off strengths typically between 16 and 20 MPa with failure occuring (cohesively) within the coating. Heat treatment in argon at 650 C results in {{a slight increase in}} coating (cohesive) strength of about 30 percent to 21 to 27 MPa.

Cross section metallographic analyses show that no microstructural <b>coating</b> <b>changes</b> occur following the argon heat treatments, however, exposure to air at 650 C gives rise to the formation of a second chromium-rich phase precipitate within the PS 304 NiCr constituent which provides a strengthening effect and a slight (approximately 5 percent) coating thickness increase.
