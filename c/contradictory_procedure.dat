For him, public opinion was mobilised based on a story radically different from the one constituted by a regular and <b>contradictory</b> <b>procedure.</b> He considered the presidential pardon granted to Mrs Sauvage as an insult made to the independence of the judiciary, to the legal profession and to the Republic. This was backed-up by the lawyer Florence Rault, who denounced the media treatment on this case, first on her blog and later published by the Figarovox, saying there was a will to “promote a victimizing feminism and to affirm the impossibility of the existence of female violence”.|$|E

Apesar disso, até recentemente, o país negligenciou princípios e fundamentos da justiça de transição previstos pelo Sistema Interamericano de Direitos Humanos, entre eles, o direito à verdade, fato que o coloca à margem daquele Sistema. O artigo pontua aspectos políticos da transição-redemocratização política que podem explicar o adiamento da instalação da Comissão Nacional da Verdade no país, criada somente em 2011, e acentua também o caráter contraditório do processo. Especificamente, a análise assinala o fato de que ao transitar da memória para a história, como pretensamente fazem as comissões da verdade, os indivíduos que se aventuram no registro histórico estarão manejando e interferindo na memória coletiva, na percepção e na identidade da qual fazem parte, o que transforma memória em poder.    Palavras-chaves: Comissão da Verdade; Memória; Relações de Poder; Direitos Humanos; Democracia.   Abstract: Overcoming the {{military}} regime, Brazil has become signatory {{of the international}} defense agreements and promotion of human rights. Yet, until recently, the country has neglected to foundations of transitional justice provided for the Inter-American System of Human Rights, between them, the right of truth, fact that stands aside that system. The article points out political aspects of transitional policy re-democratization which may explain the setting up progress of the National Truth Committee in the country, created only in 2011, and also emphasizes the <b>contradictory</b> <b>procedure.</b> Specifically, the analysis indicates the fact that going through memory to history, the way supposedly the Truth Committees do, the individuals who venture into a historical record will be managing and interfering in the collective memory, perception and identity from which they take part and change memory into power.   Keywords: The Truth Committee, Memory and Power Relations, Human Rights, Democracy...|$|E

40|$|This article explores how nonindigenous {{settlers}} in the Brazilian Amazon pursue vernacular territorial strategies {{as they attempt to}} make property legible and legitimate in an emerging order of state-led governance reforms. In Amazonia, official figurations {{for the development of the}} region have layered upon one another over the past 50 years, depositing a range of <b>contradictory</b> <b>procedures</b> for claiming, holding, and disposing of property. Ethnography shows how residents draw on the ambiguous history of property-making and their deep familiarity with surrounding landscapes to influence new environmental governance paradigms. With the goal of appearing in line with state-led tenure reform, colonists engage in a form of speculative accumulation: not an accumulation of territories as such, but of means to defend or extend one’s future land claims. Remaining viable in a possible future governance scheme requires colonists to pursue a range of surprising material and discursive practices...|$|R
40|$|The use of Glued In Rod joints for wooden constructions is an {{efficient}} technology to connect and design members in new timber structures and to rehabilitate the damaged structural elements of historical buildings. The major issue concerning {{the use of}} adhesive anchors in timber {{is the lack of}} a standard regulation in the current Eurocode 5 for timber structures. Due to the gap in knowledge of this specific topic in engineering structural design, designers' choices are still supported by test analysis which enables knowledge, and the prediction, of the structural behaviour of Glued In Rod joints. Over the last 30 years, research studies have suggested diverse and <b>contradictory</b> <b>procedures</b> for the prediction of the withdrawal capacity of adhesive anchors in timber whose application led to the relay of inconsistent information about the use of Glued In Rods in the timber engineering field. The presented research work is aimed at clarifying the contradictory nature amongst existing design rules and at proposing a correct design procedure to assess the load bearing capacity of adhesive anchors in timber, whilst also taking into consideration the high product-dependency which Glued In Rod connections are characterised by. Moreover, the thesis investigates the development of new prototypes of resin connectors in timber through the identification of innovative technical solutions in order to achieve an improved structural performance of the studied adhesive joints. An extensive experimental program has been carried out on 'traditional' and new prototypes of adhesive anchors in timber, identified respectively by smooth-cylindrical and rough-threaded internal boreholes in which 8 mm steel rods have been glued by the use of low and high viscosity epoxy resins. The tensile performance of more than 100 samples of single adhesive anchors made from solid timber and glulam has been tested by pull-compression tests in confined test regimes, in both cold states and at elevated temperatures. Experimental findings suggest that in cold states and in restrictive manufacturing conditions, the adoption of the new prototype of Glued In Rods, characterised by the presence of a threaded and rough internal bonding surface, can simultaneously provide an increase of up to 12...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend a}} {{quadrivalent}} logic of Belnap to graded truth values {{in order to}} handle graded relevance {{of positive and negative}} arguments provided in preferential information concerning ranking of a finite set of alternatives. This logic is used to design the preference modelling and exploitation phases of decision aiding with respect to the ranking problem. The graded arguments are presented on an ordinal scale and their aggregation leads to preference model in form of four graded outranking relations (true, false, unknown and <b>contradictory).</b> The exploitation <b>procedure</b> combines the min-scoring procedure with the leximin rule. Aggregation of positive and negative arguments as well as exploitation of the resulting outranking relations is concordant with an advice given by St. Ignatius of Loyola (1548) "how to make a good choice"...|$|R

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} history of {{thermostats}} {{to better understand the}} context and legacy regarding the development of this important tool, as well as thermostats' relationships to heating, cooling, and other environmental controls. We analyze the architecture, interfaces, and modes of interaction used by different types of thermostats. For over sixty years, home thermostats have translated occupants' temperature preferences into heating and cooling system operations. In this position of an intermediary, the millions of residential thermostats control almost half of household energy use, which corresponds to about 10 percent of the nation's total energy use. Thermostats are currently undergoing rapid development in response to emerging technologies, new consumer and utility demands, and declining manufacturing costs. Energy-efficient homes require more careful balancing of comfort, energy consumption, and health. At the same time, new capabilities will be added to thermostats, including scheduling, control of humidity and ventilation, responsiveness to dynamic electricity prices, and the ability to join communication networks inside homes. Recent studies have found that as many as 50 percent of residential programmable thermostats are in permanent "hold" status. Other evaluations found that homes with programmable thermostats consumed more energy than those relying on manual thermostats. Occupants find thermostats cryptic and baffling to operate because manufacturers often rely on obscure, and sometimes even <b>contradictory,</b> terms, symbols, <b>procedures,</b> and icons. It appears that many people are unable to fully exploit even the basic features in today's programmable thermostats, such as setting heating and cooling schedules. It is important that people can easily, reliably, and confidently operate thermostats in their homes so as to remain comfortable while minimizing energy use...|$|R
30|$|As the SPG has an {{important}} role on different pain syndromes, SPG blockade has {{an important}} role on the management of TN type 2. Many attempts including the removal of SPG cells, known as sphenopalatine ganglioneurectomy or radiosurgical neuroablation techniques have been described in the literature with varying success rates (Cepero et al. 1987; Karas et al. 2008). Besides, minimal invasive techniques via transnasal or infrazygomatic approaches described for modulating the action of SPG with different success rates. Transnasal or also known as intranasal approach {{one of the common}} approaches for the blockade of SPG, but topical anesthetic diffusion with cotton swabs to the SPG is unpredictable and the blockade is not durable. In addition nose abnormalities and also blunt surgical access make the success of the <b>procedure</b> <b>contradictory.</b> As a solution endoscopic transnasal approach was described by Isherwood et al. but the procedure requires endoscopic instrumentation and devices (Isherwood and Ansell 2016). Infrazygomatic approach has been commonly performed blindly on the other hand, SPG block via intra oral route roads safer compared to other percutaneous intervention for the improvement of acute symptoms, it was quick and efficient (Sanders and Zuurmond 1997). Although intra oral route is the most direct way to reach to the SPG, it was claimed as difficult, uncertain, and occasionally impossible to reach by some authors (Piagkou et al. 2012). That is partially acceptable because earlier approaches tend reach to SPG in a blinded fashion and makes the attempt unpredictable. On the other hand in our study group all the interventions were performed under the fluoroscopic guidance, therefore the procedure was noted as safe and predictable. In addition the procedures were performed under local anesthesia and well tolerated by the patients that were also superiority than the conventional transnasal approach. Furthermore more accurate positioning of the needle prevents the risk of ocular complications such as diplopia as well as blindness.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a qualitative exploratory study whose objectivewas to identify and analyze meanings and functions of student’s schoollearning through evaluation/assessment in elementary and secondary (middle) school levels based on parents’, teachers’ and students’ understanding. The datawas collected by using the focal group technique and the sample included nineteensubjects: six students, six teachers, and seven parents. Debates were carried outin contexts of two schools {{from the city of}} Chapecó, in West of the State of SantaCatarina. The individuals approached the topic by discussing five questions. Responseswere analyzed and interpreted by the researcher, which permitted to enterand better comprehend the complexity of phenomena imbricated in the relationsbetween teaching, learning and evaluation of students’ school learning. Similaritiesand differences between parents’, teachers’ and students’ understanding onschool learning evaluation are identified in the results of the study. Similaritiesinclude: importance of grades to approve or fail students {{at the end of a}} period ofstudy, the meaning of evaluation as exams, tests and tasks done by students to geta grade, comparison, classification and selection of students, evaluation as reproductionof social and market values enforced inside schools because of the systemand as a curriculum component that is able to show the degree of content retentionand the quality of students’ behavior. School learning evaluation is mostly used inthe sense of grade and not for providing meaningful feedback on students’ levelof mastery. Differences are derived from subjects’ perspectives due to their conditionof being parents, teachers or students. Parents understand school learningevaluation as a grade that indicates the degree of academic and professional successtheir children will achieve in the future; teachers understand school learningevaluation based on students’ hic et nunc (here and now) condition of being and asa complex normative curriculum component that makes them continuously choosebetween process and result rationales; students understand school learning evaluationas verification of content mastery and adequacy of behavior that is carried outthrough <b>contradictory</b> methods and <b>procedures,</b> which can affect their life insideand outside school, now and in the future...|$|R
