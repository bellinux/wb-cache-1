Its central concern is to find out in what ways Chinese <b>conditional</b> <b>construction</b> differs from the English one. The study is situated in a Chinese diplomatic discourse. Based on a qualitative analysis, it is found that four main forms of Chinese conditionals occur in the corpus in a way that might be influenced by the strategic way of delivering information in the discourse. Meanwhile, the contrast between Chinese conditionals and English conditionals has been concluded, regarding syntactic differences. This study sheds light on the cross-culture use of conditionals and offers valuable suggestions for further research into this domain...|$|E

Conditional sentences with a participle in the Hebrew protasis are discussed as well as instances where a participial phrase is substituted for the protasis. Constructions in laws and in narrative contexts are dealt with separately and single, double and complex constructions are distinguished. Participial constructions in laws are mainly translated by relative constructions. The Septuagint frequently has participial translations and the Vulgate uses a number of different constructions. In narrative contexts the Hebrew participles are used in ordinary conditional sentences after conditional particles. The translations mainly use the present tense in the protases of the conditional sentences in narrative contexts...|$|R

40|$|Despite state-driven {{language}} {{policy against}} Danish linguistic influence, the Faroese language has borrowed the Danish generic pronoun mann 'one'. As in Danish, this pronoun varies with generically used tú 'you'. An {{analysis of the}} variation in Faroese shows that Faroese tú is used more often than its Danish equivalent du (26 % vs. 16. 5 %) and that although there is extensive inter-individual variation, different linguistic factors (inclusion of the addressee in the referent of the pronoun, use in a <b>conditional</b> <b>construction</b> and verb tense) and social factor (age, gender and peripherality of location; possibly also speech style) constrain this variation in Faroese and in Danish. This suggests that extensive bilingualism has not led to sociolinguistic convergence between Faroese and Danish.

40|$|Organisational {{planning}} processes often materialise as {{a series}} of meetings, where the future of the organisation is jointly discussed and negotiated as a part of local decision-making sequences. Using conversation and discourse analytical approaches, this article investigates how proposals concerning the future can also be resisted by employing a specific device, a <b>conditional</b> <b>construction</b> (if X, then Y). The data for the study originate from a city organisation, whose customer services are being developed. The results show how the conditional constructions work in two interrelated ways. First, by introducing a problematic hypothetical situation, they outline the undesirable consequences of the proposed idea in real work life. Second, by highlighting the experience of the customer, they present the organisation as benefitting from the potential rejection of the idea. The article discusses the implications of the results for the study of proposal and decision-making sequences in longitudinal, multisemiotic discursive processes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{relationship}} between form and meaning in <b>conditional</b> <b>constructions</b> in Damascus Arabic (DA). More specifically, it treats two, main formal categories of DA conditional constructions: the conditional marker and the verb morphology and, further, how these are related to various degrees of conditional hypotheticality. Apart from the introductory section (Introduction, Aim, Method and Classification of DA), the paper consists of three larger sections: Section 2 gives a basic, theoretical background of crosslinguistic <b>conditional</b> <b>constructions</b> {{as well as what}} previous scholars have said about the crosslinguistic relationship between conditional form and meaning. It is found that many of these scholars tend to describe form, but neglect deeper discussions of meaning. This section also provides a general background of the verbal system in DA and the primary TAM (Tense-Aspect-Mood)  categories of DA verb forms. The main analysis of this thesis is found in section 3. In this section, I first suggest a method of analysis called ‘the hypotheticality continuum’ which is then employed in the following sub-sections, following Comrie (1986). Thereafter, attention is first paid to DA protasis markers and how the choice of marker is related to hypotheticality. Thirdly, I deal with verb morphology and how the choice of verb form together with a given protasis marker contributes to creating even more fine-grained distinctions of hypotheticality in DA <b>conditional</b> <b>constructions.</b> Lastly, a presentation of results and final discussion in section 4 conclude the paper...|$|R

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{synchronic}} and diachronic {{analysis of the}} use and meaning of the Luganda verbal prefix -andi-. On {{the basis of a}} text corpus of 4 million tokens, we show that the prefix, commonly described as a conditional marker, is mostly involved in the expression of modal meanings, specifically deontic necessity and epistemic possibility. Our thirteen-decade diachronic corpus analysis shows that there is a relationship between the increased use of -andi- outside syntactically complex <b>conditional</b> <b>constructions,</b> i. e. those having both a protasis and an apodosis, and an increase in its expression of modal meanings. Moreover, a reduction in the use of -andi- in complex <b>conditional</b> <b>constructions</b> {{goes hand in hand with}} a reduction in its expression of conditional meanings. It is further revealed that contrary to the common cross-linguistic tendency to rely on modality as a source for conditionality, the conditional meaning of andi- is not post-modal. It rather was primarily a conditional marker, which subsequently developed different modal meanings...|$|R
40|$|International audienceProviding {{evidence}} from Hindi, {{the present study}} determines the crucial {{role played by the}} protasis (or antecedent or P-clause) in the actualization of conditional constructions. It maintains that tense-aspect-mood elements of the protasis establish different degrees of hypotheticality in a conditional statement. The paper questions some widespread misunderstandings about the clause ordering in conditional constructions, namely that condi-tionals can exhibit both the protasis-apodosis (P-Q) and apodosis-protasis (Q-P) orderings. By examining data from Hindi and making reference to data from other languages, the paper reiterates our earlier claim that protasis-apodosis ordering in conditional constructions cannot be reversed and advances a new idea that a 'conditional string' is the defining characteristic of a <b>conditional</b> <b>construction.</b> In other words, it is either the proposition contained in the apodosis – not the entire apodosis – which is pre-posed by the speaker to accomplish different communicative tasks, or the entire 'conditional string' which is added to a non-conditional statement to give it conditional dimensions...|$|E
40|$|Many {{authors have}} hoped to {{understand}} the indicative <b>conditional</b> <b>construction</b> in everyday language by means of what are usually called conditional probabilities. Other authors have hoped to make sense of conditional probabilities {{in terms of the}} absolute probabilities of conditional statements. Although all such hopes were disappointed by the triviality theorems of Lewis (1976), there have been copious subsequent attempts both to rescue CCCP (the conditional construal of conditional probability) and to extend and to intensify the arguments against it. In this paper it will be shown that triviality is avoidable if the probability function is replaced by an alternative generalization of the deducibility relation, the measure of deductive dependence of Miller and Popper (1986). It will be suggested further that this alternative way of orchestrating conditionals is nicely in harmony with the test proposed in Ramsey (1931), and also with the idea {{that it is not the}} truth value of a conditional statement that is of primary concern but its assertability or acceptability...|$|E
40|$|Counterfactual {{interpretation}} is constructed from two evaluation contexts plus morphology {{that indicates that}} the worlds {{in one of these}} contexts are located outside the other context serving as a basis of reference (Nichols 2003 a). In Zuni (and English), the morphology used to indicate this relation between contexts is also used for 'past ' temporal reference. This study argues that 'past ' morphology in its temporal interpretation shares the same basic meaning as the modal cases: past tense specifies the type of relationship between a Reference Context and some other context of evaluation. While in English the temporal Reference Context is the Utterance Context, Zuni allows the temporal Reference Context to be shifted away from the Utterance Context. In addition to the argument that tense interpretation involves reference to contexts, the study makes the case for detailed studies distinguishing language-specific morphological idiosyncrasies from the semantic properties that form the core of the counterfactual <b>conditional</b> <b>construction.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|A cross-linguistic {{approach}} to Slavic past tense and <b>conditional</b> <b>constructions</b> The {{aim of this}} paper is to provide a formal account of the past tense and <b>conditional</b> mood <b>constructions</b> in a number of Slavic languages. As a starting point we present an analysis of these constructions in Polish using the grammatical framework of HPSG Pollard and Sag (1994). Our proposals are guided by diachronic and comparative considerations, allowing an extension of the {{approach to}} Czech, Serbo-Croatian, and Russian. Throughout Slavic, the past tense and the conditional involve the “l-participle ” form of the verb (henceforth “l-form”), which agrees with the subject in number and gender. Historically, the past tense consisted of the l-form in combination with present tense forms of the auxiliary BE, while the conditional mood consisted of the l-form along with conditional forms of BE. The auxiliary forms in these constructions have evolved in differen...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{translation}} of a particular Russian parenthetical clause, namely cto ni govori, lit. you may say what you will. This parenthetical formally corresponds to the Russian concessive <b>conditional</b> <b>construction,</b> which prototypically consists of an interrogative pronoun and the particle ‘ni’, but it {{is used as a}} parenthetical and has lost its concessive meaning. Using a parenthetical, a speaker adds emotion and expressiveness to the meaning of the utterance. The translation of cto ni govori in Dutch is problematic, since its concessive conditional counterpart in Dutch zeg wat je wil you may say what you will exists, but it does not add the same emotion and expression as it does in Russian. Both languages have different mechanisms to render these subtile subjective meaning components. Since dictionaries do not provide us with the necessary information, we turn to translation practice to gain insight in the translation problem. Examples from the practice of translation prove to be a useful didactic tool when addressing the problem of the translation of parenthetical clauses. status: publishe...|$|E
