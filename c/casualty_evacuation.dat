5|$|The Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) {{supplied}} the doctors, <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation,</b> field ambulances and hospitals for the army. The Corps was assisted in its work by voluntary {{help from the}} British Red Cross, St John's Ambulance and the Friends Ambulance Unit.|$|E
5|$|In its {{standard}} configuration the IFV {{would have a}} crew of three and carry a squad of nine. The vehicle could be reconfigured to support <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation.</b> The Army stated no preference {{as to whether the}} IFV should be tracked or wheeled but suggested that it be tracked due to the weight stemming from the requirements.|$|E
5|$|The V-22 {{deployment}} to Afghanistan was set {{to conclude}} in late 2013 with the drawdown of combat operations; however, VMM-261 was directed to extend operations for a new role, <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation,</b> {{for which it was}} better suited than helicopters as its speed better enabled casualties to reach a hospital within the 'golden hour'; they were fitted with medical equipment such as heart-monitors and basic triage supplies.|$|E
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{has carried}} out many tasks {{since the end}} of Korean War, including <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuations,</b> Royal tours and other VIP transport, and United Nations air lift operations.

50|$|The PSNI {{have one}} of the largest Air support units within the United Kingdom. In 2014 the Air Support Unit responded to over 4,000 callouts, 12 were <b>Casualty</b> <b>evacuations</b> and participated in over 250 missing people searches. All {{aircraft}} are used for investigations, anti-crime operations, traffic management, search and rescue, public order situations, crime reduction initiatives and tackling terrorism.|$|R
5|$|At 11:00, however, {{a second}} attempt to {{resupply}} B Company {{resulted in an}} Australian Iroquois helicopter being shot down by heavy ground fire, and exploding on impact. Two crew members were killed and another two injured, while another soldier was injured on the ground. With ammunition exploding among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, scrambling through the debris and removing the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety. Subsequently, another winch point was established {{to the rear of}} the Australian positions for <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation</b> and resupply.|$|E
5|$|Attached to US forces, 1 RAR was {{primarily}} employed in search and destroy operations using the newly developed doctrine of airmobile operations, utilising helicopters to insert light infantry and artillery {{into an area}} of operations, and to support them with aerial mobility, fire support, <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation,</b> and resupply. The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into War Zone D—a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces—as {{well as in the}} Iron Triangle in November.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were unable}} to {{concentrate}} sufficient combat power to launch {{an assault on the}} position and consequently they were forced to withdraw after a fierce engagement during which both sides suffered a number of casualties, reluctantly leaving behind two men who had been shot and could not be recovered due to heavy machine-gun and rifle fire. Although they were most likely dead, a battalion-attack to recover the missing soldiers was planned by the Australians for the next day, but this was cancelled by the American brigade commander due to rising casualties and the need to utilise all available helicopters for <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation.</b> The bodies of the two missing Australian soldiers were subsequently recovered more than 40 years later, and were finally returned to Australia for burial.|$|E
50|$|On February 3, 2007, HMM-161 {{embarked}} {{upon its}} fourth combat deployment {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom and the Global War on Terror by sending a small advance party back to Al Taqaddum, Iraq {{to prepare for the}} arrival of the Squadron's Main Body on March 1. The Greyhawks officially resumed their role in <b>Casualty</b> <b>Evacuations</b> and General Support on March 9, 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{task force}} was {{deactivated}} on May 26, 2015. During the operation the United States Marine Corps reported about 120 ST of relief supplies had been deployed. That included shelter kits with blankets, medical supplies, and emergency supplemental food supplies including water. They also reported the transportation of 553 personnel rescues and 69 <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuations</b> that {{were carried out}} since the operation began.|$|R
50|$|On March 28, 2007 {{the unit}} {{launched}} its first C-5 mission from Shepherd Air Field. After a brief stop at Dover Air Force Base, the aircraft continued on to Camp Lemonier, Djibouti, Africa, delivering two CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters (used for humanitarian assistance, personnel and equipment movement, and noncombatant <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuations)</b> {{and more than}} 60 marines supporting Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa.|$|R
5|$|Brumfield {{considered}} Operation Hump to be {{the least}} successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from the start, and mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses suffered by the US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation,</b> the operation had not run smoothly. The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation Crimp in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{demanded the}} right to return to Hill 82 in order to destroy the bunker system and to recover the bodies of Parker and Gillson, and he and Major John Essex-Clark—the {{operations}} officer—began planning a battalion attack. However, with American casualties rising and all available helicopters required for <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation,</b> the planned operation was cancelled. The thick jungle canopy compounded the issue, and Williamson decided to stage the casualties through an area secured by the Australians at LZ Princess. Operation Hump concluded on 9 November, with the US 1/503rd Battalion and 1 RAR being extracted by helicopter and returning to Bien Hoa in the late afternoon. Following 1 RAR's return to Bien Hoa, Brumfield continued to petition for permission to conduct the operation. A battalion attack was subsequently planned for 14 November, but Williamson later deferred it dependent {{on the availability of}} air and helicopter support, and the start date of the upcoming Operation New Life. Ultimately it was never conducted.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to the British chain of command in early 2000, he assumed the {{position}} of Commander-in-Chief, Land Command, the second-highest position in the British Army, and a post which entailed promotion to full general and membership of the Army Board. As Commander-in-Chief, Jackson was responsible for assembling forces for the 2000 British intervention in Sierra Leone, which included Brigadier David Richards—later Chief of the Defence Staff—and Jackson's son Mark. He also handled requests from the civilian authorities for assistance with the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, floods and strikes by firefighters and fuel-tanker drivers. While still Commander-in-Chief, he stood in for the Chief of the General Staff, marching behind the coffin at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. At the time of the 11 September 2001 attacks, Jackson was on a visit to the British training facility in Alberta, Canada. He managed to return to the UK the next day aboard a <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation</b> aircraft and had overall responsibility for force generation for the British Army's contribution to the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|E
50|$|During {{the whole}} week, Coalition {{aircraft}} had conducted over 250 airstrikes. Apart from U.S. aircraft, British Tornado GR4 and MQ-9 Reaper aircraft, operating from the Royal Air Force's Akrotiri base targeted ISIL positions near Sinjar and Tall Afar. CF-18 Hornet aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force were also reported to having {{contributed to the}} preparatory mission. Iraqi Security Force helicopters provided aerial MedEvac support conducting five <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuations.</b>|$|R
50|$|In April 1961, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) {{announced}} that they had selected the Westland Wessex to become the standard service helicopter from their ships and its intention to purchase roughly 30 for anti-submarine patrols, <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuations,</b> and fleet communications duties. The RAN formally accepted the first two of 27 Wessex helicopters in September 1963; 817 Squadron {{was the first to}} operate the type; the Wessex and its dunking sonar array quickly proved to be the most effective anti-submarine platform as yet seen in the RAN.|$|R
50|$|Since its formation, {{the team}} has {{continued}} {{to be one of}} the busier teams in the South West, dealing with between 40 and 60 callouts a year. Like a lot of teams around the country, many of these callouts are “non mountain rescue”—searching for vulnerable people in rural locations. However the team deals with its fair share of moorland jobs, mainly on and around Bodmin Moor, including <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuations</b> and rescue call outs directly from the ambulance service and the police (the size of the moor and vulnerability of inexperienced explorers making emergencies more probable).|$|R
5|$|The {{objective}} for the 11th as the attacking {{force was}} to capture Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina, {{after which the}} maneuver was named. The defending forces were to try to defend the airport {{and the surrounding area}} and repel the airborne assault. The entire operation would be observed by Lieutenant General McNair. His observations and reports to the U.S. War Department, and ultimately General Eisenhower, would do much to decide {{the success or failure of}} the exercise. The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December, with the troops of the 11th Airborne Division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders, with eighty-five percent of the airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, each taking off from a different airfield in the Carolinas, with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders, and between them deployed 4,800 airborne troops in the first wave. These airborne troops then seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield from the defending troops and secured the area in which the rest of the division landed, all before daylight. Having secured their initial objectives, the 11th Airborne Division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment, as well as several aerial resupply and <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuation</b> missions in coordination with transport aircraft. The exercise was judged to be a great success by those who observed it. McNair reported that the success of the maneuver pleased him, and highlighted the great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in the months between the end of Operation Husky and the Knollwood Maneuver. Due to the success of the units of the 11th Airborne Division during the exercise, the divisional-sized airborne force was deemed to be effective and was allowed by Eisenhower to remain.|$|E

The locations of their quick-readiness dispersals can still be seen to the south of the former main gate. No. 17 Squadron flew the PR.7 Canberra, and the two squadrons' [...] "in house" [...] T.4 training aircraft were combined into the so-called [...] "T4 Flight" [...] as a separate sub-unit, forming a useful additional resource for 2ATAF senior officers to use to maintain their flying hours. In the early 1960s, 88 Squadron Canberras were also based at Wildenrath. The base was also used for 'CasEvac' (emergency <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuations)</b> usually to the UK.|$|R
50|$|A {{sergeant}} {{first class}} is typically assigned as a platoon sergeant {{at the company}} level or battalion operations non-commissioned officer in charge at the battalion level, but may also hold other positions {{depending on the type}} of unit. In a combat arms role, a sergeant first class is typically in charge of from 18 soldiers and four tanks in an armor platoon to 40 soldiers in a rifle platoon. A sergeant first class' primary responsibilities are tactical logistics, tactical <b>casualty</b> <b>evacuations,</b> and serving as the senior tactical adviser to the platoon leader. Sergeant first class replaced the rank of technical sergeant in 1948. (However, the U.S. Air Force, which separated from the Army in 1947, retained the rank of technical sergeant and the U.S. Marine Corps had the rank of technical sergeant until 1959).|$|R
