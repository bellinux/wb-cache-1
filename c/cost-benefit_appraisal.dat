In a response to meet current educational needs and demands to recruit, retain, and expand enrollment of students in baccalaureate programs in nursing, the growth of online education has been dramatic. As growth continues, graduation rates and program retention are a concern. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the relationship between student motivation, academic context, <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal,</b> and intent to persist in RNBS completion online programs. The conceptual model used in this study was Student Online Academic Persistence a researcher developed model which is primarily based on the work of Tinto, Bean & Metzner, and Rosenbaum. Research questions: 1. 	Among students enrolled in RNBS completion online programs, do motivation and context predict <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal?</b> 2. 	Among students enrolled in RNBS completion online programs, what is the relationship between <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal</b> and intent to persist in the program? Data were collected via a Web-based self-report questionnaire and subjected to descriptive and inferential analyses which included the use of linear regression and correlations. From a population of 3606 students from three schools of nursing who were enrolled in an RNBS completion online program, 704 usable surveys were returned, with a response rate of 19 %. Technology self-efficacy correlated positively with goal orientation, goal commitment, satisfaction with institution and faculty, <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal</b> and intent to persist. Goal commitment to the program and satisfaction with institution were found to be important in the persistence of students. A continual decision making process involving <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal</b> was also found to impact student intention to persist in the program of study. Recommendations for faculty include assuring student technology self-efficacy and developing an online transition course designed to normalize the experience of adults engaging in online education. Future research which further tests the Student Academic Online Persistence model and explores the lived experience of the online student is suggested...|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a comprehensive review}} of theory and research on the individual-level predictors of household energy usage. Drawing on literature from across the social sciences, we examine two broad categories of variables that have been identified as potentially important for explaining variability in energy consumption and conservation: socio-demographic factors (e. g., income, employment status, dwelling type/size, home ownership, household size, stage of family life cycle) and psychological factors (e. g., beliefs and attitudes, motives and intentions, perceived behavioral control, <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisals,</b> personal and social norms). Despite an expanding literature, we find that empirical evidence of the impact of these variables has been far from consistent and conclusive to date. Such inconsistency poses challenges for drawing generalizable conclusions, and underscores the complexity of consumer behavior in this domain. In this article, we propose that a multitude of factors—whether directly, indirectly, or in interaction—influence how householders consume and conserve energy. Theory, research and practice can be greatly advanced by understanding what these factors are, and how, when, where, why and for whom they operate. We conclude by outlining some important practical implications for policymakers and directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{arose from}} the work carried out for the Cullen/Uff Joint Inquiry into Train Protection Systems. It is {{concerned}} with the problem of evaluating the benefits of safety enhancements in order to avoid rare, but catastrophic accidents, and the role of Operations Research in the process. The problems include both input values and representation of outcomes. A key input is the value of life. This paper briefly discusses why the value of life might vary from incident to incident and reviews alternative estimates before producing a 'best estimate' for rail. When the occurrence of an event is uncertain, the normal method is to apply a single 'expected' value. This paper argues that a more effective method of representing such situations is through Monte-Carlo simulation and demonstrates the use of the methodology on a case study of the decision {{as to whether or not}} advanced train protection (ATP) should have been installed on a route to the west of London. This paper suggests that the output is more informative than traditional <b>cost–benefit</b> <b>appraisals</b> or engineering event tree approaches.

40|$|Patient nonadherence to {{medication}} harms patient {{outcomes and}} raises costs via wasted and unnecessary treatment (Osterberg and Blaschke, 2005). However, current adherence measures {{are far from}} optimal (Vitolins et al., 2000), and adherence enhancing interventions rarely successful (Haynes et al., 2008). This may be a reflection of inadequate patient targeting and adherence measurement. This thesis describes the development of questionnaires intended to be clinically useful by predicting patient risk of nonadherence. A scoping review with meta-analysis was undertaken to identify predictors objectively shown {{to be associated with}} nonadherence. Any pre-existing questionnaires to measure the selected predictors were identified via literature review. Pre-existing questionnaires incorporated were the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (Horne et al., 1999), Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983), Patient Health Questionnaire (Kunik et al., 2007), and the Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (Van der Feltz-Cornelis et al., 2004). Novel items were developed to measure patient demographics, health literacy, mental health, risky health behaviours, beliefs about medicines, self-efficacy, social support, and access to medicines. These scales were incorporated into two novel questionnaires. The Patient and Lifestyle Scale (PALS), and the Wellbeing and Medications Scale (WAMS). A feasibility study was conducted with 16 patients at a GP surgery to identify limitations in research design and perform preliminary psychometric assessment. Issues with participant identification were highlighted, however, indications were that PALS and WAMS could be used to predict self-reported and prospective refill adherence. A practitioner focus group appraised the clinical utility of the questionnaires whilst acceptability and validity were assessed via six participant interviews. The PALS and WAMS were perceived to be potentially clinically useful and most items were considered acceptable. Findings also indicated that mental distress is associated with nonadherence and that long term adherence may depend more upon integrating medicines into every day habits than rational <b>cost-benefits</b> <b>appraisals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The wetland {{areas of}} England are under {{imminent}} threat of drainage for agricultural improvement. The immediate cause {{is the local}} drainage surveys produced under the Water Act 1973. Problems identified in these surveys are subjected to <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal.</b> Examination of a selection shows that these appraisals are technically defective and result in an overstatement of the benefits and in an overinvestment in land drainage. The main defects are: first, a failure to assess amenity and conservation losses; second, use of prices that contain a substantial element of income transfer which is not netted out; third, a failure to properly calculate the rate of land conversion—a crucial variable; fourth, the project appraisal period is arbitrarily chosen or treated as a variable; fifth, the use of theoretical rather than expected agricultural yields; sixth, the level of flood protection aimed at is too high for the stated objective; and, last, anticipated flood losses are not deducted. The threat to Britain's wetlands from large-scale drainage for agricultural purposes is viewed with alarm by the bodies concerned with conservation of the natural environment and the landscape, and is increasingly attracting the attention of Parliament and the Press. The scale of the threat may be demonstrated by examples...|$|E

Many of the issues had arisen during the Birmingham Integrated Transport Study (BITS) in which we were involved, and in the subsequent assessment of light rail schemes of which we have considerable experience. In subsequent discussion, the objectives were identified as being:- (i) to identify, briefly, the weaknesses with existing appraisal techniques; (ii) to develop proposals for common methods for the social <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal</b> of both urban road and rail schemes which overcome these weaknesses; (iii) to develop complementary and consistent proposals for common methods of financial appraisal of such projects; (iv) to develop proposals for variants of the methods in (ii) and (iii) which are appropriate to schemes of differing complexity and cost; (v) to consider briefly methods of treating externalities, and performance against other public sector goals, which are consistent with those developed under (ii) to (iv) above; (vi) to recommend work {{to be done in the}} second phase of the study (beyond March 1991) on the provision of input to such evaluation methods from strategic and mode-specific models, and on the testing of the proposed evaluation methods.

If the economic and financial analyses are carried out using a common numeraire, they can include issues of stakeholder impacts, poverty impact, and an assessment of the long-term sustainability of the project. We can assess the income impacts on different interest groups. This forces the analyst to do reconciliation between the economic performance, the financial performance and the distributional impacts of project.

40|$|Aim: This paper {{summarizes}} the deficiencies {{and weaknesses of}} the most frequently used methods for the allocation of health-care resources. New, more transparent and practical methods for optimizing the allocation of these resources are proposed. Method: The examples of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and efficiency frontier (EF) are analyzed to describe weaknesses and problems in decisions regulating health-care provision. After conducting a literature search and discussions with an international group of professionals, three groups of professionals were formed to discuss the assessment and appraisal of health-care services and allocation of available resources. Results: At least seven essential variables were identified that should be heeded when applying the concept of QALYs for decisions concerning health-care provision. The efficiency frontier (EF) concept can be used to set a ceiling price and perform a cost-benefit analysis of provision, but different stakeholders—a biostatistician (efficacy), an economist (costs), a clinician (effectiveness), and the patient (value) —could provide a fairer appraisal of health-care services. Efficacy and costs are often based on falsifiable data. Effectiveness and value depend on the success with which a particular clinical problem has been solved. These data cannot be falsified. The societal perspective is generated by an informal <b>cost-benefit</b> analysis including <b>appraisals</b> by the above-mentioned stakeholders and carried out by an authorized institution. Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that study results expressed in QALYs or as EF cannot be compared unless the variables included in the calculation are specified. It would be far more objective and comprehensive if an authorized institution made an informal decision based on formal assessments of the effectiveness of health-care services evaluated by health-care providers, of the value assessed by consumers, of efficacy described by biostatisticians, and of costs calculated by economists...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} formulations for {{estimating the}} economic welfare impacts of transport strategies that change land use. The formulations seek to use outputs of transport modelling typically used for transport appraisal. At present conventional <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal</b> (CBA) techniques {{focus only on}} the short-run impacts of transport schemes — changes in the generalised cost of travel — taking it as given how people live, work and play. Recent work to estimate ‘wider economic benefits’ of transport strategies augment the benefit estimates of conventional CBAs, but they still do not resolve the remarkably narrow extent of transport CBAs. By ignoring how transport strategies may alter regional populations, economic activity and employment, and land use patterns (which is all called ‘land use’ for brevity), {{it is possible that}} some major projects may be much better, and others much worse, than the currently estimated benefit-cost ratios would indicate. Economic theory, and ex post evaluations of transport schemes, suggest that it is common for major transport schemes to have relatively major changes in land use. This means the long-run impacts of transport schemes is not reduced costs of travel per se, but changed location and activity patterns of households and firms. All else equal the longer term direct benefits of such schemes must be greater than the direct benefits estimated as most people must be better off following the lifestyle and/or work change — else they would not have changed. Against this, however, are negative congestion externalities from the additional induced travel (because of the absence of efficient pricing) that in some instances could not only negate the land use change benefits, but could make the project detrimental overall to society. This paper develops new appraisal formulations to apply to the typical sorts of outputs of transport models to estimate the total net-benefits of transport schemes that induce land use change. The paper provides a microeconomic intuition to the approach, demonstrating that the additional benefits relate to changes in the context with which people express their preferences. The paper concludes with some insights learned from an application of one of the formulations to an Auckland transport scheme that land use modelling was undertaken for...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} outlines {{a framework}} {{that could be used}} by government agencies in assessing policy interventions aimed at achieving social outcomes from government construction contracts. The framework represents a rational interpretation of the information gathered during the multi-outcomes construction policies project. The multi-outcomes project focused on {{the costs and benefits of}} using public construction contracts to promote the achievement of training and employment and public art objectives. The origin of the policy framework in a <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>appraisal</b> of current policy interventions is evidenced by its emphasis on sensitivity to policy commitment and project circumstances (especially project size and scope). The quantitative and qualitative analysis conducted in the multi-outcomes project highlighted, first, that in the absence of strong industry commitment to policy objectives, policy interventions typically result in high levels of avoidance activity, substantial administrative costs and very few benefits. Thus, for policy action on, for example, training or local employment to be successful compliance issues must be adequately addressed. Currently it appears that pre-qualification schemes (similar to the Priority Access Scheme) and schemes that rely on measuring, for example, the training investments of contractors within particular projects do not achieve high levels of compliance and involve significant administrative costs. Thus, an alternative is suggested in the policy framework developed here: a levy on each public construction project – set as a proportion of the total project costs. Although a full evaluation of this policy alternative was beyond the scope of the multi-outcomes construction policies project, it appears to offer the potential to minimize the transaction costs on contractors whilst enabling the creation of a training agency dedicated to improving the supply of skilled construction labour. A recommendation is thus made that this policy alternative be fully researched and evaluated. As noted above, the outcomes of the multi-outcomes research project also highlighted the need for sensitivity to project circumstances in the development and implementation of polices for public construction projects. Ideally a policy framework would have the flexibility to respond to circumstances where contractors share a commitment to the policy objectives and are able to identify measurable social outcomes from the particular government projects they are involved in. This would involve a project-by-project negotiation of goals and performance measures. It is likely to only be practical for large, longer term projects...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simplified social cost-benefit analysis approach tested on around thirty projects of small infrastructure in Croatia, and deals {{with some of}} the specific issues encountered in this field work. In Zadar and Sibenik– Knin counties, Croatia, a Sustainable Development Project funded by CARDS -Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation- was active from 2003 to 2006 for the war-affected areas. The project aimed to support the two administrations in managing local development programs through CARDS and to prepare for the pre-accession Funds. The assistance consisted in training in EU procedures, preparing grant scheme, updating the Regional Operational Program, implementing an infrastructure project pipeline. The paper focuses on the last activity, more precisely on the project appraisal for the preparation of the pipeline, and describes the experience developed in this context through a methodology commonly used for the management and evaluation of infrastructures funded by Cohesion and Structural Funds. The methodology applied for the evaluation was social cost-benefit analysis. The challenge of this experience is represented by the reference context, where either Public Administration than local actors started only recently to cope with the EU program procedures and principles, and by the chosen operative methods, made of a cooperation of International experts and professional evaluators with local personnel. Given the financial dimension of the concerned projects (from a few hundred thousands EUR to a maximum of five millions EUR, with one exception) a simplified yet rigorous version of the standard methodology has been applied. For the data collection the input came from the contribution of local actors, either the personnel of the company appointed for the management of this program than the Public Administration and the projects promoters. Surveys, personal interviews through well-structured questionnaires, printouts' desk analysis and presentation of the main results were the activities of the involved personnel. The application of a standard methodology allows a certain degree of comparability among the projects and makes it easy to horizontally read the interventions' performance. The message of the paper is that even for small infrastructure projects CBA is a tool by means of which project analysts and decision-makers could have a useful dialogue for the planning exercise. <b>Cost-Benefit</b> Analysis, Project <b>Appraisal,</b> Water Sector, Accessing Countries...|$|R
