Since {{the action of}} Bok in triggering apoptosis seems to be redundant, {{it is difficult to}} assign a specific role to Bok in the presence of Bak and Bax. The study of cells deficient in Bak and Bok or deficient in Bax and Bok, respectively, could help to better characterize the role of Bok in apoptosis. If Bok exerts a <b>critical</b> <b>function,</b> it is likely that this function is limited to certain circumstances, e.g. specific cell types, stress conditions. Thus, these aspects should be assessed in more detail to analyze the physiological and pathological role of Bok.|$|E
500|$|The ectomycorrhizae of T.vaccinum {{has been}} the subject of {{considerable}} research. Ectomycorrhizae of Tricholoma species can vary considerably among species in the genus, and differences in the structure of [...] rhizomorphs (a cordlike fusions of hyphae resembling a root) have been used to key out species. Mycorrhizae formed with Norway spruce (Picea abies) are conspicuously hairy with numerous hyphae. The hyphae are partly densely interconnected to rhizomorphs that have a pigment in their outer membrane. The emanating hyphae mostly lack [...] "contact septae" [...] (fully developed simple septae) and contact clamps, and the rhizomorph hyphae vary markedly in diameter. The Hartig net (a network of hyphae that extend into the root) formed by T.vaccinum grows more deeply towards the epidermis, is composed of more rows of hyphae and has more tannin cells in close proximity to the epidermis, and consequently, fewer cortical cells in this position. It is here that the rhizomorphs make the closest contact with the rootlets. The mantle is prosenchymatous, meaning that the constituent hyphae are loosely organized with spaces between them. A combination of techniques including freeze fracturing and scanning electron microscopy has been used to probe the microstructure of the ectomycorrhizae, including inner mantle thickness and the nature of the interface between the Hartig net and host cells. Several fungal genes specifically expressed during ectomycorrhizal interaction between T.vaccinum and Picea abies have been identified, including some involved in a plant pathogen response, nutrient exchange and growth in the plant, signal transduction, and stress response. The first characterized fungal aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, ALD1, helps circumvent ethanol stress—a <b>critical</b> <b>function</b> in mycorrhizal habitats.|$|E

500|$|The Zany (orig. Spanish el Pelele), also {{translated}} as the Idiot by some critics, appears {{only in the}} first four chapters and again at the end of chapter seven but serves a <b>critical</b> <b>function</b> in the novel. The Zany, who [...] "looked like a corpse when he was asleep" [...] and had eyes that [...] "saw nothing, felt nothing" [...] is critical to establishing the tone of the novel and triggering the novel's action. Critic John Walker argues that, by [...] "choosing the Idiot {{as a representative of the}} innocent, the a-political, who suffer the abuses of a totalitarian regime [...] Asturias shows how dictatorship corrupts people and destroys their values to the extent that compassion for one's companion in distress ceases to exist." [...] In fact, it becomes clear that the only happiness that the Zany experiences is through the memory of his dead mother. Asturias then shows how el Pelele, a mother-loving figure, [...] "suffers at the hands of those who, long under the domination of the over-aggressive father figure, lack love and pity". Furthermore, el Pelele [...] is a tool that allows readers to see the psychological effects of living under a dictatorship ruled by terror. His murderous act seems to trigger the subsequent events of the novel and to impact on all the characters. Also important is the fact that the one moment of complete happiness experienced by the Zany in the novel takes place while he is in a dream-like state. Walker argues that this serves to highlight the harsh, nightmarish world of reality in which he has been forced to live.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a number}} of texts, {{beginning}} in the early 1980s, Barber has considered the potential for performance work to avoid its ossification into a genre category. [...] Clearly, the type of conceptual performance art that was common in the late sixties and early seventies had run its course. [...] While emerging forms of postmodern performance were appropriating mainstream forms of entertainment, their <b>critical</b> <b>function</b> was often weakened or altogether abandoned. [...] Performance could possibly withstand becoming affirmative culture (Herbert Marcuse) by rediscovering its sources in avant-garde theatre. [...] Bertolt Brecht, for instance, echoed Karl Marx's critique of philosophy when he wrote: [...] "The theatre became an affair for philosophers, but only for those philosophers as wished not just to explain the world, but also to change it." [...] Brecht coined the term umfunctionierung (functional transformation) to enable theatre to become an instrument to serve the interests of class struggle. [...] And in his famous essay, [...] "The Author as Producer," [...] Walter Benjamin extolled the virtues of the [...] "operative" [...] artist, providing as his example the communist author Sergei Tretyakov, who thought of his work not merely as descriptive reporting on reality, but an active intervention. [...] Benjamin believed that cultural practice should refuse modish commerce and should give work a revolutionary use value. [...] This meant the avoidance of the impulse to aestheticize and the ordination of critical agency as a post-aesthetic strategy, one that can contain values that are nominally subsumed under several progressive political/aesthetic ideologies. [...] In an implicit effort to politicize advanced forms of performance, Barber placed the term performance under erasure with the formulation of [...]|$|E
60|$|The great {{difficulty}} which Lothair had to apprehend {{was with his}} Roman Catholic friends. The system of the monsignori was never to let him be out of sight, and his absence from the <b>critical</b> <b>function</b> had not only disappointed but alarmed them. But the Jesuits are wise men; they never lose their temper. They know when to avoid scenes as well as when to make them. Monsignore Catesby called on Lothair as frequently as before, and never made the slightest allusion to the miscarriage of their expectations. Strange to say, the innocent Lothair, naturally so straightforward and so honorable, found himself instinctively, almost it might be said unconsciously, defending himself against his invaders with {{some of their own}} weapons. He still talked about building his cathedral, of which, not contented with more plans, he even gave orders that a model should be made, and he still received statements on points of faith from Father Coleman, on which he made marginal notes and queries. Monsignore Catesby was not altogether satisfied. He was suspicious of some disturbing cause, but at present it baffled him. Their hopes, however, were high; and they had cause to be sanguine. In a month's time or so, Lothair would be in the country to celebrate his majority; his guardian the cardinal was to be his guest; the St. Jeromes were invited, Monsignore Catesby himself. Here would be opportunity and actors to avail themselves of it.|$|E

To the horror and stupefaction of all the honest part of this nation, and indeed of all nations who are spectators, we have seen, on the credit of those very practices and principles, and to carry them further into effect, these very men placed on the sacred seat of justice in the capital city of your late kingdom. We see that in future you are to be destroyed with more form and regularity. This is not peace: it is only the introduction of a sort of discipline in their hostility. Their tyranny is complete in their justice; and their lanterne is not half so dreadful as their court.|$|E
