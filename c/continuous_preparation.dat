5000|$|A {{multiple}} {{hearth furnace}} {{also known as a}} vertical calciner, is used for <b>continuous</b> <b>preparation</b> and calcining of materials. The {{multiple hearth furnace}} consists of several circular hearths or kilns superimposed on each other.

The arms are attached to a rotating central shaft that passes {{through the center of the}} roaster. As the material is moved, the ore that is charged at the top hearth gradually moves downward as it passes through windows in the floor of each hearth or through alternate passages around the shaft and the periphery until it finally emerges at the bottom. The oxidizing gases flow upward, i.e. , counter current to the descending charge. In a well - insulated roaster, external heating is unnecessary except when the charge is highly moist. The hearth at the top of the roaster dries and heats the charge. [...] and oxidation of the charge occur lower down.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis process {{based on the}} properties of the powders of carbon and tungsten, and methods for producing semi-finished products of them. It was revealed that the most common and effective way is to compaction of powder compositions of tungsten and carbon in press-dies. Carbon and tungsten powders have a several special properties that significantly affect the quality of semi-finished and require special organization of the production cycle. Thus the self-diffusion coefficients of the low carbon and tungsten, a high elastic modulus require plasticizers and binders, for acceptable strength of semifinished after compaction. High adsorptive capacity of the powdered compositions, is the cause of low pour density and a large amount of gases which must be removed from the press-die cavity during the compaction. Speeds punch during compaction tungsten limited 2 – 2. 5 mm/s, the preform obtained by compacting high speeds have defects such as cracks.

5000|$|Participation and {{interaction}} between participants and instructors involves significant and <b>continuous</b> <b>preparation.</b> Online educators are often {{members of a}} larger team consisting of instructional and graphic designers and information technology specialists; being open to becoming {{a member of the}} team will assist in a smooth transition to online teaching. Expectations of learners to be self-motivated, able to manage their time effectively, contribute to course discussions and have a willingness to teach others is not unlike what is expected in a traditional classroom. The instructor's role is to encourage learners to evaluate and analyze information, then connect the information to course content which may assist in learner success. With the potential for learners to feel disconnected from peers within the course, the instructor will need to work to create spaces and encounters which promote socialization. A few recommendations are to create a [...] "student lounge" [...] as an informal space for socialization not related to coursework. Also, incorporating team projects can help alleviate feelings of isolation. Online instructors should be cognizant of where participants are physically located; when members of the course span two or more time zones, the timing of the course can become problematic. Initial preparation of an online course is often more time consuming than preparation for the classroom. The material must be prepared and posted, in its entirety, prior to the course start. In addition to preparation, faculty experienced in online instruction spend about 30% more time on courses conducted online. The mentoring of novice online educators from those with experience can assist with the transition from classroom to the virtual environment.|$|E

In order to overcome those problems, the MSCP (Multielectromagnetic Stirring <b>Continuous</b> <b>Preparation)</b> process has been developed by GRINM.

Particle structural, morphological and luminescence characteristics were studied based on X-ray powder diffractometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM), thermal analysis, UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence measurements (PL). The generated so-called secondary particles have a hexagonal ZnO wurtzite-type crystalline structure with preferred orientation of (101) plane and quasi-spherical in shape. It was shown that such particle structural and morphological features are independent on the precursor solution concentrations used. All the PL spectra illustrate a strong green-yellow typical emission band exhibiting the corresponding redshift and variation of direct band gap from 3. 22 to 3. 12 eV with the increase in precursor concentration. The thermal analysis confirmed high thermal nanoparticles stability.

The particle size, size distribution, and morphology of the explosives are essential physical characteristics which significantly influence their sensitivities.

However, it is quite being difficult to produce nanoscale particles from traditional method including solvent-nonsovent recrystallization, sol-gel, and spray drying and supercritical fluid technique [16]. The abovementioned methods are effective at the lab scale, and the large-scale preparation of nanoscale energetic materials involves great difficulties.

The use of doped electrodes results in a thousand-fold increase in the mass production rate as compared to intrinsic silicon. Pure and oxidised uniformly sized silicon nanoparticles with a primary particle diameter of 3 – 5 nm are produced.
