5|$|Skin {{toxicity}} evolved alongside bright coloration, perhaps preceding it. Toxicity {{may have}} relied on a shift in diet to alkaloid-rich arthropods, which likely occurred {{at least four times}} among the dendrobatids. Conspicuous coloration in these frogs is further associated with diet specialization, body mass, aerobic <b>capacity,</b> <b>and</b> chemical defense. Either aposematism and aerobic capacity preceded greater resource gathering, making it easier for frogs to go out and gather the ants and mites required for diet specialization, contrary to classical aposematic theory, which assumes that toxicity from diet arises before signaling. Alternatively, diet specialization preceded higher aerobic <b>capacity,</b> <b>and</b> aposematism evolved to allow dendrobatids to gather resources without predation.|$|E

The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel <b>capacity,</b> <b>and</b> were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{producing}} electricity, the dam {{is intended}} to increase the Yangtze River's shipping <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> reduce the potential for floods downstream by providing flood storage space. China regards the project as monumental {{as well as a}} success socially and economically, with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines, and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people, and is causing significant ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides. The dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} role of {{vertical}} structure in determining generating <b>capacities</b> <b>and</b> retail prices in the electricity industry. Allowing for uncertain demand, we compare three market configurations: (i) integrated monopoly, (ii) integrated duopoly with wholesale trade, and (iii) separated duopoly with wholesale trade. We find that equilibrium <b>capacities</b> <b>and</b> retail prices are such that welfare is highest (lowest) under separated (integrated) duopoly. The driving force behind this result is the risk of rent extraction faced by competing integrated generators on the wholesale market. Our analysis suggests that vertical structure {{plays an important role}} in determining generating <b>capacities</b> <b>and</b> retail prices...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo analyse {{the link}} between unimanual <b>capacities</b> <b>and</b> bimanual {{performance}} in cerebral-palsied (CP) hemiplegic children, aged between 5 and 18 years old, studying specifically the impact of synkinesis. Material and methodsSeventy-one CP hemiplegic children (35 boys and 36 girls, mean age 8, 5 years; MACS levels from I to III; GMFCS from I to IV) {{took part in a}} transversal study, assessed – Melbourne Test (MUUL) for unimanual <b>capacities,</b> <b>and</b> Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) for bimanual performance – with a specific scale to analyze synkinesis during Box and Block test for affected and healthy hands, collecting synkinesis type, duration and intensity. ResultsThere is a strong correlation between unimanual <b>capacities</b> (MUUL) <b>and</b> bimanual performance (AHA) (r= 0. 871). Neither age nor gender contribute to bimanual performance (AHA). Multiple linear regression shows that MUUL contributes to bimanual performance variance (AHA) by 70 %. Synkinesis partly correlated to <b>capacities</b> (MUUL) <b>and</b> accounts for 10 % of the variance of the gap between <b>capacities</b> <b>and</b> bimanual performance. ConclusionA high relationship between unimanual <b>capacities</b> <b>and</b> bimanual performance is confirmed by this study; some authors demonstrated impact of sensory troubles [1], we demonstrate that synkinesis influences the use of unimanual capacities in bimanual performance...|$|R
