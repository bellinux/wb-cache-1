5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} {{aeronautical engineer}} Paul MacCready {{to build a}} half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with a ground-based winch. It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically <b>correct</b> <b>and</b> embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|In his (1991) novel Roman Blood, Steven Saylor renders a fictionalized, yet informed, {{rendition}} {{of how the}} Roman punishment poena cullei might occur.

5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realisation that {{there was no need for}} the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven <b>correct,</b> <b>and</b> his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E
5|$|Black and the FBI {{investigate}} the crime scene; Black not only realises the bomber's proficiency with explosives, but {{is able to}} work out that he viewed the bombing from the parking garage. In a bin in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is <b>correct,</b> <b>and</b> as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} {{suggestion}} that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be <b>correct</b> <b>and</b> he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E

5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were <b>correct</b> <b>and</b> that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|John and Kanyenke {{return and}} drive Warwick's forces from Brunswick, but Warwick and Stuart are gone. John {{realizes that the}} Circle of Ossus has returned. Kanyenke {{believes}} that his sister, Nonahkee, could be in danger, too, and the pair leaves for New England. Kanyenke's suspicions prove <b>correct</b> <b>and</b> they confront Warwick again when he attacks Nonahkee's village hoping to extract John's location from her. After the battle it is revealed that John Black and Nonahkee are in love, but are keeping it a secret from Kanyenke until a more peaceful time, although it is seen that Kanyenke is aware of this.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 2014, West ejected Jonathan Papelbon for the lewd act of {{adjusting}} his groin, {{resulting in}} a confrontation where West grabbed Papelbon's jersey. MLB subsequently suspended Papelbon for seven games for his lewd act and West for one game for initiating contact with Papelbon, marking the first umpire suspension since Fieldin Culbreth's May 2013 suspension for misapplication of baseball rules and the first on-field misconduct suspension of an umpire since Bob Davidson's May 2012 suspension for situation handling violations related to his ejection of Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel. West later claimed Papelbon had initiated first contact, but Major League Baseball determined that the video replay showed West was not <b>correct,</b> <b>and</b> that the contact was initiated by West.|$|E

5|$|The friends, {{followers}} of the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, were self-taught mathematical astronomers who had worked methodically to <b>correct</b> <b>and</b> improve Kepler's Rudolphine tables by observation and measurement. In 1639, Horrocks was the only astronomer to realise that a transit of Venus was imminent; others became aware of it only after the event when Horrocks's report of it was circulated. Although the friends both died within five years of making their observations, their ground-breaking work was influential in establishing {{the size of the}} Solar System; for this and their other achievements Horrocks and Crabtree, along with their correspondent William Gascoigne, are considered to be the founding fathers of British research astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The pitch {{invasion}} occurred while Gregory {{halted the}} match by not sending out {{a replacement for}} Murdoch. The New South Wales skipper called on Lord Harris to remove umpire Coulthard, whom he considered to be inept or biased, but his English counterpart declined. The other umpire, Edmund Barton, defended Coulthard and Lord Harris, saying that the decision against Murdoch was <b>correct</b> <b>and</b> that the English had conducted themselves appropriately. Eventually, Gregory agreed to resume the match without the removal of Coulthard. However, the crowd continued to disrupt proceedings, and play was abandoned for the day. Upon resumption after the Sunday rest day, Lord Harris's men won convincingly by an innings.|$|E

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is <b>correct,</b> <b>and</b> of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
