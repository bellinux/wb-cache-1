25|$|Gilbert de Glanvill, Bishop of Rochester, in 1190, early {{during the}} reign of Richard I founded a {{hospital}} in Strood, east of the church, which was afterwards called the Newark or Stroud Hospital, the Yoke or North Yoke being a small manor in Strood. Newark Hospital was important in raising the profile of Strood, however there was <b>constant</b> <b>concern</b> about it financial management, and the rivalry between it and the Rochester Priory.|$|E
25|$|By 500 BCE, Greeks {{arrived in}} the desert. Greek traders spread along the eastern coast of the desert, {{establishing}} trading colonies along the Red Sea. The Carthaginians explored the Atlantic coast of the desert, but the turbulence of the waters {{and the lack of}} markets caused a lack of presence further south than modern Morocco. Centralized states thus surrounded the desert on the north and east; it remained outside the control of these states.

25|$|Harlan greatly {{enjoyed his}} time as a justice, serving {{until his death in}} 1911. From the start, he {{established}} good relationships with his fellow justices and he was close friends with a number of them. Still, money problems continually plagued him, particularly as he began to put his three sons through college. Debt was a <b>constant</b> <b>concern,</b> and in the early 1880s, he considered resigning from the Court and returning to private practice. He ultimately decided to remain on the Court, but supplemented his income by teaching constitutional law at the Columbian Law School, which later became the law school of George Washington University.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} extra space was a <b>constant</b> <b>concern</b> for the SMSA. In 1852 a {{petition}} {{was presented to}} the Legislative Council seeking permission for the SMSA to sell or swap a parcel of land set aside for it in George Street South for the purpose of purchasing a site in a more central location. With the funds available the SMSA Committee was able to move quickly when the neighbouring building, the Independent Chapel, was put on the market on 7 January 1855. Purchasing this site gave the School the opportunity to double the size of its building without having to relocate. With this in mind, a public appeal for donations to fund proposed works was advertised in newspapers from 1856.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{problems}} which Fourteenth Army would face were logistical. The advancing troops {{would need to}} be supplied over crude roads stretching for far greater distances than were ever encountered in Europe. Although expedients such as locally constructed river transport and temporary all-weather coverings for roads (made from coarse hessian sacking material impregnated with bitumen and diesel oil) were to be used, transport aircraft were to be vital for supplying the forward units. Disaster threatened as early as 16 December 1944, when 75 American transport aircraft were abruptly transferred to China, where the Japanese Operation Ichi-Go was threatening American airfields. Although aircraft were hastily transferred from the Mediterranean theatre to replace those despatched to China, continuing threats to deprive Fourteenth Army of the support of American transport aircraft were to be a <b>constant</b> <b>concern</b> for Slim during the forthcoming battles.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{made many}} {{attempts}} at conforming to traditional Jewish laws, {{there were more}} instances where Herod was insensitive, which constitutes {{one of the major}} Jewish complaints towards Herod as highlighted in Jewish Antiquities. In Jerusalem, Herod introduced foreign forms of entertainment, and erected a golden eagle at the entrance of the Temple, which suggested a greater interest in the welfare of Rome than of Jews. Herod's taxes garnered a bad reputation - his <b>constant</b> <b>concern</b> for his reputation led him to make frequent, expensive gifts, increasingly emptying the kingdom's coffers, and such lavish spending upset his Jewish subjects. The two major Jewish sects during his reign, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, both showed opposition to Herod. The Pharisees were angry because Herod disregarded many of their demands for the Temple's construction. At the same time the Sadducees, who were known for their priestly responsibilities in the Temple, opposed Herod because he replaced their high priests with outsiders from Babylonia and Alexandria, in an effort to gain support from the Jewish Diaspora. These efforts proved ineffective, {{and at the end of}} Herod's reign, anger and dissatisfaction were common amongst Jews. Heavy outbreaks of violence and riots followed Herod's death in many cities, including Jerusalem, as all the built-up grievances against him were unleashed. The momentum from these revolts led to an increased demand for Jewish freedom from Roman rule. Herod's leadership caused enough anger for it to become a prime cause of the Great Revolt of 70 C.E.|$|E
500|$|However, in {{the last}} decade or so this view has been challenged. For example, Bennett claims that Mary Shelley's works reveal a {{consistent}} commitment to Romantic idealism and political reform and Jane Blumberg's study of Shelley's early novels argues that her career cannot be easily divided into radical and conservative halves. She contends that [...] "Shelley was never a passionate radical like her husband and her later lifestyle was not abruptly assumed nor was it a betrayal. She was in fact challenging the political and literary influences of her circle in her first work." [...] In this reading, Shelley's early works are interpreted as a challenge to Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley's radicalism. Victor Frankenstein's [...] "thoughtless rejection of family", for example, is seen as evidence of Shelley's <b>constant</b> <b>concern</b> for the domestic.|$|E

[...] Crawford commented: [...] "Like all of the families {{who lived in the}} Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive." [...] The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost <b>constant</b> <b>concern</b> for people living in {{one of the oldest and}} poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool.

500|$|The {{class in}} both {{as-built}} and modified forms has {{been subject to}} a range of divergent opinions. The utilisation of welded steel construction and the various innovations that had not previously been seen in British locomotive design meant that the class earned Bulleid the title [...] "Last Giant of Steam". The <b>constant</b> <b>concern</b> for ease of maintenance and utility had not previously been seen on locomotives of older design, whilst their highly efficient boilers represented the ultimate in British steam technology, the hallmark of a successful locomotive design. Despite this, the number of innovations introduced at the same time made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain during {{the first few years of}} service. Many of these difficulties were overcome during the rebuilding, leading to D.L. Bradley's statement that the modified locomotives were [...] "the finest express locomotives to work in the country". Overall, the class was largely successful, with half of the locomotives completing more than 1 million miles in revenue-earning service.|$|E
500|$|In exile Rosas was not destitute, but {{he lived}} {{modestly}} amid financial constraints during {{the remainder of}} his life. A very few loyal friends sent him money, but it was never enough. He sold one of his estancias before the confiscation and became a tenant farmer in Swaythling, near Southampton. He employed a housekeeper and two to four laborers, to whom he paid above-average wages. Despite <b>constant</b> <b>concern</b> over his shortage of funds, Rosas found joy in farm life, once remarking: [...] "I now consider myself happy on this farm, living in modest circumstances as you see, earning a living the hard way by the sweat of my brow". A contemporary described him in final years: [...] "He was then eighty, a man still handsome and imposing; his manners were most refined, and the modest environment did nothing to lessen his air of a great lord, inherited from his family." [...] After a walk on a cold day, Rosas caught pneumonia and died at 07:00 on the morning of 14 March 1877. Following a private mass attended by his family and a few friends, he was buried in the town cemetery of Southampton.|$|E
500|$|It was a {{year before}} Horrocks {{recovered}} sufficiently to tell Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), that he was [...] "very anxious to be given another corps". Restored to the acting rank of lieutenant-general in August 1944, {{he was sent to}} France to assume command of XXXCorps during the cataclysm engulfing the trapped German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army in the Falaise Pocket. Montgomery had been dissatisfied with the performance of the corps and its commander, Gerard C. Bucknall, since the landings in Normandy two months earlier. Horrocks retained control of XXXCorps during the advance through Belgium, taking Brussels, and at one point advanced [...] in only six days. Supplies were a <b>constant</b> <b>concern,</b> with the major French deep-water ports still in German hands, and Allied supply lines stretching perilously back to the Normandy beaches. Montgomery's 21st Army Group was by now operating [...] from its portsâ€”twice the distance logistical planners had accounted forâ€”so XXXCorps was diverted towards Antwerp to secure its docks and harbour. The city and port fell to the 11thArmoured Division in early September, but Montgomery halted XXXCorps for resupply short of the wide Albert Canal {{to the north of the}} city, which consequently remained in enemy hands. Horrocks regretted this after the war, believing that his corps might have advanced another [...] with the fuel available, although it is doubtful this could have been achieved without delays. Unknown to the Allies, at that time XXXCorps was opposed by only a single German division. The pause allowed the Germans to regroup around the Scheldt River, and by the time the Allies resumed their advance, General Student's First Paratroop Army had arrived and set up strong defensive positions along the opposite side of the canal. The task of breaking the strengthened German line, which stretched from Antwerp to the North Sea along the Scheldt River, would fall to the First Canadian Army in the month-long, costly Battle of the Scheldt. By mid-September, XXXCorps had been diverted again, this time to the east.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a deputy}} and senator, Estournelles de <b>Constant</b> <b>concerned</b> himself with colonial issues, {{consistently}} opposing Third Republic colonial policy.

In particular, he violently opposed the establishment of French colonial rule in Madagascar and the Great Powers' dismemberment of China. In domestic affairs, he was concerned particularly with what the terminology of the day called [...] "outrages against morality" [...] (outrages aux bonnes mÅ“urs).
