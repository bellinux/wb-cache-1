Cultural events are organized with local school and cultural centers. In addition there are handcrafts, regional food, amusement rides, folk dance as the crowning of a “Flor de Jícara” beauty queen. Carnival is an important annual event. It begins in January with the “quema de mal humor” or burning of bad mood using a paper mache figure. From then until Ash Wednesday, there are dances and people with lavish outfits, especially on Sundays accompanied by son music.Traditional dress for women consists of a long, full skirt with flowered patterns and a white cotton blouse with embroidery around the collar.

5000|$|The {{next step}} in a hot air balloon flight is {{unpacking}} the balloon from its <b>carrying</b> <b>bag,</b> laying {{it out on the}} ground, and connecting it to the basket and burner. A fan, often gasoline-powered, is used to blow cold (outside) air into the envelope. The cold air partially inflates the balloon to establish its basic shape before the burner flame is aimed into the mouth heating the air inside. A crew member stationed opposite the mouth, holds a rope (crown line) tied to the apex (crown) of the envelope. Some balloons, AX7 and larger, may have two (or more) crown lines. The [...] "crown-man" [...] role is twofold: one is to prevent the envelope from excessive sway, and two is to prevent the envelope from rising before it is sufficiently buoyant. Once the balloon is upright, pilot and passengers climb into the basket. When the pilot is ready for launch, more heat is directed into the envelope and the balloon lifts off.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{options for the}} {{mounting}} of a pony bottle. The most common way pony bottle is carried is by fixing it {{to the side of}} the primary (back gas) scuba cylinder by straps or clamps, which may include a quick-release system. The most common alternative is [...] "slinging" [...] it between two D-rings on the diver's scuba harness or buoyancy compensator.Another possibility is to mount the bottle in a small <b>carrying</b> <b>bag,</b> from which the pony bottle may be easily removed. This affords the opportunity of [...] "handing off" [...] the entire system to a buddy diver if that buddy needs to share air. This is a much safer procedure than the buddies having to have to be connected through use of hosed regulators. The addition of a pony bottle to the divers equipment will add an off-balanced weight to the side on which it is mounted. To compensate for this an equal balancing weight is often added to the tank band on the opposite side of the pony, or in an off-side weight pocket. Attention must also be paid to where the pony bottle second stage regulator is placed during the pre-dive buddy check.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a topological {{approach}} for monitoring human activities is presented. This approach makes possible {{to protect the}} person’s privacy hiding details that are not essential for processing a security alarm. First, a stack of human silhouettes, extracted by background subtraction and thresholding, are glued through their gravity centers, forming a 3 D digital binary image I. Secondly, different orders of the simplices are applied on a simplicial complex obtained from I, which capture relations among {{the parts of the}} human body when walking. Finally, a topological signature is extracted from the persistence diagrams according to each order. The measure cosine is used to give a similarity value between topological signatures. In this way, the powerful topological tool known as persistent homology is novelty adapted to deal with gender classification, person identification, <b>carrying</b> <b>bag</b> detection and simple action recognition. Four experiments show the strength of the topological feature used; three of they use the CASIA-B database, and the fourth use the KTH database to present the results in the case of simple actions recognition. In the first experiment the named topological signature is evaluated, obtaining 98. 8 % (lateral view) of correct classification rates for gender identification. In the second one are shown results for person identification, obtaining an average of 98. 5 %. In the third one the result obtained is 93. 8 % for <b>carrying</b> <b>bag</b> detection. And in the last experiment the results were 97. 7 % walking and 97. 5 % running, which were the actions took from the KTH database...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. Our Institute has {{investigated}} the expressed needs of many severely disabled people. One requirement {{was for a}} portable bidet that would fit on a standard toilet, {{so that they could}} still have some of the advantages of their automatic washing/drying/flushing toilet when away from their own house. Potential users were consulted, from the specification stage through to final production model testing, to ensure that the desired device was produced. The Port-a-Bidet is a lightweight device, with its own water container, spray unit, pump and power supply. It allows a user with very weak arms to wash themselves with warm water, and a hands-free drying method is explained in the instruction booklet. The whole unit is transported in a discreet <b>carrying</b> <b>bag,</b> and can easily be set up by an unskilled person.

Acoustic MCTBs are currently in use on ISS to reduce the noise generated by the T 2 treadmill, which reaches the hazard limit at high speeds. The development of the AMCTB included identification of keep out zones, acoustic properties, deployment considerations, and structural testing. Features developed for these considerations are applicable to MCTBs for all crew outfitting applications...|$|E
40|$|Packaged {{goods are}} shipped {{globally}} using various means of transportation. Over {{the past two}} decades, {{there has been a}} continuous increase in studies that measure and analyse dynamic events that occur to packages during transportation and handling. These data offer useful information to design and test pack-ages, and provide protection from potential hazards like drops and impacts. However, none of the past studies are directed towards single packages regarded as ‘smalls’. ‘Smalls ’ or small-package product systems are defined as those with volume of less than 0. 013 m 3, a longest dimension of 0. 356 m and a weight of 4. 54 kg or less. Packages that qualify for these specifications are often mixed together in a large <b>carrying</b> <b>bag</b> and handled with other single parcel shipments. This study measured and analysed the effect of moving this category of single packages through expedited shipments in the USA. The results showed that these packages experienced as many as 27 events comprising of drops or tosses in a one-way shipment, and a maximum of 5. 01 m of near-zero G travel distance representing long ‘tosses’.

40|$|Background: Control {{of balance}} {{is a complex}} motor skill that {{involves}} integration of sensory inputs and the planning and execution of flexible movement patterns. Carrying side packs is famous in our society especially shoulder side packs. Most students carry shoulder side packs and they don't care about the way to carry {{them to be more}} balanced. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of carrying shoulder side pack on dynamic postural stability and to determine the best way of carrying a shoulder side pack either on the dominant side or non-dominant side that doesn’t affect dynamic postural stability in young healthy female. Methods: Sixty female volunteers aged from 18 to 25 years old participated in the study. Biodex balance system was used to measure the dynamic postural stability in three different occasions (without carrying a shoulder side pack, with carrying a shoulder side pack on the dominant side, and on the non-dominant side) with a rest period in between. Results: Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test were used to compare dynamic posture balance without carrying and during carrying a shoulder side pack on dominant and non-dominant sides. Analysis revealed that overall, anteroposterior and mediolateral stability indexes reduced significantly (P< 0. 0001) when carrying shoulder side pack on dominant side in comparison with when carrying shoulder side pack on non-dominant side and without <b>carrying</b> <b>bag.</b> Conclusion: It was concluded that carrying a shoulder side pack on the non-dominant side didn't disturb the postural stability when compared to carrying on the dominant side so, we recommend the students to carry shoulder side packs on the non-dominant side...|$|E
