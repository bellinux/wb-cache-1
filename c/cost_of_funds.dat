A few lenders use their own <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> as an index, rather than using other indices. This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually {{be related to the}} index. Consequently, {{payments}} made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate (alternatively, the term of the loan may change). This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing payment amounts but a fixed interest rate.

We find a strong negative relation between investors' opportunity <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> and over-subscription. Since investors are required to make upfront payment {{at the time of}} IPO applications, lengthy offer period increases investors' opportunity <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> and thus reduces their interests in the IPOs. To increase over-subscription, firms should time their IPOs to coincide with periods of large positive initial returns and low volume of IPO activity.

40|$|This paper combine two {{strands of}} the literature: one {{that looks at}} the effects of legal-institutional factors and one {{that focuses on the}} impact of social capital in the credit markets. The chapter sheds light on the {{determinants}} <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for SMEs in the euro area. In particular, the authors’ goal is to verify whether features such as the institutional and legal framework and the level of social capital significantly affect the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for SMEs in the euro area. The authors perform an empirical analysis based on a large sample of 22, 295 firm-level observations from 2009 to 2013 for a sample of 11 euro area countries, taken from the SAFE. Their findings show that a less efficient judicial system as well as a higher degree of concentration in the banking industry increases the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for SMEs. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for SMEs is, instead, reduced when the market share of cooperative banks and the social capital are higher. Overall, the study supports the view that a better institutional environment and a wider presence of social capital produce positive externalities in the credit market...|$|R

50|$|In economics, {{the excess}} burden of taxation, {{also known as}} the {{deadweight}} cost or deadweight loss of taxation, is one of the economic losses that society suffers as the result of taxes or subsidies. Economic theory posits that distortions change the amount and type of economic behavior from that which would occur in a free market without the tax. Excess burdens can be measured using the average <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> or the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> (MCF). Excess burdens were first discussed by Adam Smith.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> index or COFI is a {{regional}} average of interest expenses incurred by financial institutions, {{which in turn}} is used as a base for calculating variable rate loans. The interest rate on an adjustable rate mortgage, for example, is often linked to {{a regional}} COFI specified in the particular loan documents. COFIs, in turn, are usually calculated by a self-regulatory agency like Federal Home Loan Banks. In California, for example, many home mortgage loans are indexed to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. Interest rates on COFI loans and mortgages tend to fluctuate more slowly than variable-rate loans linked to other indexes. An index used to determine interest rate changes for some adjustable-rate mortgages. The 11th District <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>Funds</b> Index was first introduced in December 1982.

Using newly available data linking over 3, 000, mostly privately-held, non-financial firms to their bank(s), we find that increases in Italian banks' CDS spreads and decreases in their equity valuations lead younger and smaller firms to cut investment, employment, and borrowing. We conclude that financial market fluctuations affect even private firms' real decisions by affecting the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> their banks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates bank-specific and {{macroeconomic}} {{factors that}} determine the liquidity of Indian banks. To explore the association, we perform OLS, fixed effect and random effect estimates on a data set of 59 banks from 2000 to 2013. Studied bank-specific factors include bank size, profitability, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> capital adequacy and deposits. GDP, inflation and unemployment are the macroeconomic factors considered. We also perform liquidity trend analysis of Indian banks based on ownership. Findings reveal that bank ownership affects liquidity of banks. Based on panel data analysis, {{we suggest that}} bank-specific (except <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding)</b> and macroeconomic (except unemployment) factors significantly affect bank liquidity. These include bank size, deposits, profitability, capital adequacy, GDP and inflation. Further, bank size and GDP {{were found to have}} a negative effect on bank liquidity. On the other hand, deposits, profitability, capital adequacy and inflation showed a positive effect on bank liquidity. <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> and unemployment showed an insignificant effect on bank liquidity.

50|$|One of the {{functions}} of the FO loan program is to assist farmers, especially beginning farmers, in the purchase and enlargement of farms. An eligible borrower must be unable to obtain sufficient credit from a commercial lender, but must assure reasonable prospects of success in the farm operation. Loans are made for up to 40 years. The interest rate is determined by USDA, and cannot exceed the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to the Government plus 1 percentage point. However, direct loans to limited resource borrowers can be made at significantly below the federal <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> The interest rate on guaranteed loans is negotiated between the borrower and the lender. USDA guarantees the timely repayment of 90% of principal and interest on guaranteed loans, and in some cases can subsidize the interest rate on these loans. The amount USDA can directly lend or guarantee each year is determined in the annual congressional appropriations process.|$|E
