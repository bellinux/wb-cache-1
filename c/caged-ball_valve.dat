40|$|In {{this case}} report, {{we present a}} patient 28 years after mitral valve {{replacement}} with the Starr-Edwards prosthesis complicated by peri-prosthetic leak with severe aortic stenosis and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. We successfully repaired the periprosthetic regurgita-tion in a patient with extensive mitral annular calcification, without replacement of the valve. No apparent structural deterioration on the <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valve</b> was found. Moreover, aortic valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty were performed. One month after reoperation, the patient remained stable with improved clinical status and without any evidence for further paravalvular leak...|$|E
40|$|Although the Starr-Edwards <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valve</b> {{remains a}} {{standard}} of comparison for more recently introduced prostheses, a substantial incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications prompted our evaluation of the Hancock glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine xenograft. We have compared the results of 435 aortic valve replacements using the Starr- Edwards valve (SE-AVR), 515 mitral valve replacements (SE-MVR), and 121 double-valve replacements (SE-AVRMVR) with 251 aortic valve replacements using the xenograft aortic valve (X-AVR), 338 mitral valve replacements (X-MVR), and 88 double-valve replacements (X-AVR-MVR). The Starr- Edwards valves were used during the period 1963 through 1973 and the xenograft valves between 1971 and 1976. No significant differences in patient age, sex, or preoperative hemodynamic data were noted between comparable groups. All patients with Starr-Edwards valves received long-term anticoagulation while anticoagulants were used only for specific indications in patients with xenograft valves. Total follow up was 3944 patient years for the Starr-Edwards patients and 947 patient years for the xenograft patients. Hospital mortality was not significantly different for comparable groups: SE-AVR 6. 9 % vs. X-AVR 6. 4 %, SE-MVR 9. 7 % vs X-MVR 8. 6 %, and SE-AVR-MVR 7. 5 % vs. X-AVR-MVR 10. 2 %.

50|$|Impact {{wear and}} {{friction}} wear dictate {{the loss of}} material in MHV. Impact wear usually occurs in the hinge regions of bileaflets, between the occluder and ring in tilting-discs, and between the ball and cage in <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valves.</b> Friction wear occurs between the occluder and strut in tilting-discs, and between the leaflet pivots and hinge cavities in bileaflets.|$|R
2500|$|... where A {{represents}} the cross-sectional area, P is pressure, [...] is density, and V is the velocity. As cross-sectional area decreases in the valve, velocity increases and pressure drops as a result. This effect is more dramatic in <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valves</b> than in tilting-disc and bileaflet valves. A larger systolic pressure {{is required to}} drive flow forward in order to compensate for a large pressure drop, so it should be minimized.|$|R
25|$|Regurgitation {{is the sum}} of {{retrograde}} flow {{during the}} closing motion of the valve and leakage flow after closure. It is directly proportional to valve size and is also dependent on <b>valve</b> type. Typically, <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valves</b> have a low amount of regurgitation as there is very little leakage. Tilting-disc and bileaflet valves are comparable, with the bileaflet valves have a slightly larger regurgitation volume. Bioprosthetics prevail over MHV in this case, as they have virtually no regurgitation volume.|$|R
25|$|Turbulence {{and high}} shear {{stresses}} are also major issues with MHV, {{as they can}} fracture the valve housing or components, or induce blood damage. A large flow gradient can lead to these factors, so flow separation and stagnation should be as small as possible. High stresses are created {{at the edges of}} the annular jet in <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valves,</b> in narrow regions {{at the edges of the}} major orifice jet in tilting-disc valves, and in regions immediately distal to the valve leaflets in bileaflet valves. The implications of blood damage from these stresses are discussed in the next section.|$|R
40|$|Background and {{aim of the}} study: Bj√∂rk-Shiley Delrin (BSD) tilting-disc {{mechanical}} valve occluders {{have demonstrated}} good performance, with superior patient survival and low incidence of obstruction phenomena compared to <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valves.</b> Unfortunately, the use of Delrin as the occluder material was problematic, and in 1971 this led to its replacement with a pyrolitic carbon-coated occluder. The study aim was to report and to determine the mechanism of wear on BSD valve discs. To achieve this, three BSD valves which had {{been in place for}} between 312 and 355 months were explanted and analyzed. Methods: Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate material imperfections or damage to the housing and occluder components of the explanted valves. Results: The valve discs showed more than one type of wear pattern. Notably, the wear pattern observed on the surface and edge of the disc did not affect correct in-vivo function of the valves, as indicated by their long implantation period. No cracks, fractures or perforations of the Delrin discs were observed, but clear imprints caused by the impact of the struts on the inlet and outlet disc surfaces were detected. The depth of the strut imprints was indicative of a hindered disc rotation. A reduction in the diameter of the Delrin disc (ca. 1. 44 mm) was detected in valve # 3. Conclusion: The results obtained for the three BSD valves were in agreement with data reported elsewhere, and showed good performance of this mechanical valve. Although the clinical follow up for these second-generation mechanical valves is extensive and supportive of their good clinical performance, they may in time fail due to wear of the polymer surface...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{pathologic}} and echocardiographic findings {{observed in}} 87 patients with mitral valve obstruction were reviewed {{to ascertain the}} incidence of pannus formation versus that of thrombosis, {{the relationship between the}} two, and the time to the occurrence of pannus versus the time to thrombosis. Methods. Pannus morphology (concentric or eccentric), its location on the valve (atrial, ventricular, atrioventricular), and the presence and relationship of associated thrombi (atrial, ventricular, atrioventricular) were analyzed. The times between valve replacement and the occurrence of obstruction were also compared. Results. There were 10 <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valves,</b> 65 tilting-disc valves, and 12 bileaflet valves. Seventy-two patients underwent prosthetic replacement, and 15 underwent thrombolysis. Pannus alone was found in 27, pannus and thrombus in 39, and thrombus alone in 21. Primary thrombosis occurred earlier than pannus formation (p = 0. 04); this was true for patients with bileaflet valves (p = 0. 006) and those with tilting-disc valves (p = 0. 04). Pannus was atrial in 19. 7 % (13 / 66), ventricular in 21. 2 % (14 / 66), and atrioventricular in 59. 1 % (39 / 66). Pannus morphology was concentric in 22. 7 % (15 / 66) and eccentric in 77. 3 % (51 / 66). Atrial secondary thrombi occur more often in patients with atrioventricular pannus (p = 0. 04). Eight patients had reobstruction; this was caused by pannus formation in 5 and by thrombosis in 3. Five underwent reoperation, and 3 underwent thrombolysis. Reobstruction occurred earlier than the first event. Conclusions. The frequency of pannus formation is much higher than that of thrombus formation, but thrombosis is of earlier onset than pannus formation. Thrombosis is due to the deposit deposition of clots on the prosthesis, and a pannus occurs as the result of an inflammatory reaction developing on both valve surfaces.

2500|$|The first {{artificial}} heart <b>valve</b> was the <b>caged-ball,</b> which utilizes a metal cage to house a silicone elastomer ball. When {{blood pressure in}} the chamber of the heart exceeds that of {{the pressure on the}} outside of the chamber the ball is pushed against the cage and allows blood to flow. At the completion of the heart's contraction, the pressure inside the chamber drops and is lower than beyond the valve, so the ball moves back against the base of the valve forming a seal. In 1952, Charles A. Hufnagel implanted <b>caged-ball</b> heart <b>valves</b> in ten patients (six survived the operation), marking the first long-term success in prosthetic heart valves. A similar valve was invented by Miles [...] "Lowell" [...] Edwards and Albert Starr in 1960 (commonly referred to as the Starr-Edwards Silastic Ball Valve). The first human implant was on Sept 21, 1960. It consisted of a silicone ball enclosed in a cage formed by wires originating from the valve housing. Caged ball valves have a high tendency to form blood clots, so the patient must have a high degree of anti-coagulation, usually with a target INR of 2.5-3.5. Edwards Lifesciences discontinued production of the Starr-Edwards valve in 2007.|$|R
40|$|Three hundred eighty-five valve {{prostheses}} {{were implanted}} between 1974 and 1981 {{in patients with}} isolated mitral disease: 157 <b>caged-ball</b> <b>valves</b> (156 Starr-Edwards; 1 Smeloff-Cutter) (group A), 107 tilting-disc valves (44 Bjork-Shiley, 49 Sorin, 14 Lillehei-Kaster) (group B), 121 porcine bioprostheses (45 Carpentier-Edwards, 66 Liotta, 10 Hancock) (group C).
