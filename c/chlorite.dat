5|$|The {{action of}} {{metamorphism}} {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as <b>chlorite,</b> epidote and actinolite that formed during metamorphism. After metamorphism occurred, these rocks were folded and faulted into a system of mountains by the Algoman orogeny.|$|E
5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, <b>chlorite,</b> copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{and fine}} silt, {{dominated}} by lutite, were {{deposited in the}} lake. Closer to the shore, sand was also emplaced. Deltaic deposits have been found as well. Minerals identified include biotite, <b>chlorite,</b> illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and muscovite, with varying colors depending {{on the origin of}} the sediments. The material deposited by Lake Cahuilla is also known as the Cahuilla formation. The Borrego and Pleistocene Brawley formations may also be linked to Lake Cahuilla. These lacustrine materials bury {{the northern part of the}} Colorado River Delta, and they give the ground a grayish color. The clays left by the lake were used for the production of ceramic by the inhabitants of the region; likewise Lake Cahuilla is responsible for the fertile soils of the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley, an important agricultural province of the United States. Halite deposits left by the lake were mined in the 19-20th century.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, kaolinite, prehnite, and <b>chlorite.</b> Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Authigenic llites and <b>chlorites</b> from elastic reservoirs, {{offshore}} Norway, {{have been}} studied by analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM). Present-day reservoir conditions range from 1600 m burial depth and 70 ~ to 4400 m and 160 ~ The reservoir units have xperienced continuous subsidence since arly Cretaceous, and are presently atmaximum burial. Textural and morphological evidence indicates that the authigenic illites and <b>chlorites</b> investigated are late diagenetic products, except for an early-formed berthierine in the shallowest reservoir. While the illites show very limited chemical variability at temperatures between 140 ~ and 160 ~ the <b>chlorites</b> exhibit definite compositional trends with increasing temperatures. Tetrahedral Ai increases substantially from 100 ~ 176 and the octahedral vacancy decreases correspondingly. These observations i dicate that continuous recrystalliza-tion of authigenic clays has taken place. This is also supported by the chemical composition f present-day porewaters, which are close to equilibrium with the clay mineral assemblage. Illites and <b>chlorites</b> are diagenetic minerals of considerable importance both because of their general geochemical reorganization during diagenesis and also their influence on the production of hydrocarbons from elastic reservoirs.

40|$|A B S T RA C T: The {{relationships}} between the composition and the crystallization temperature of <b>chlorites</b> and illites have been investigated in different geothermal fields {{and in particular the}} Los Azufres ystem in Mexico, considered to be a natural analogue to experimental l boratories, as the main changes in physical and chemical conditions and mineralogy are related to progressively increasing temperature with depth. Temperature was estimated from combined geothermometric approaches, and especially from fluid inclusion studies on quartz coexisting with clays. The Al(lv) content in the tetrahedral site of <b>chlorites,</b> and the K content and total interlayer occupancy of illites increase with temperature. These chemical changes are mainly related to the marked ecrease in the molar fraction of the Si(lv) -rich end-members (kaolinite for <b>chlorites,</b> and pyrophyllite for illites) which become negligible at ~ 300 ~ Other chemical changes, uch as the variation in Fe and Mg contents, are partly influenced by temperature, but are strongly dependent on the geological environment, and consequently on the solution composition.

40|$|Chlorine dioxide {{is widely}} used to replace sodium {{hypochlorite}} in the disinfection of surface waters for human consumption, {{in order to avoid}} or reduce the formation of organohalogenated compounds with mutagenic and carcinogenic activity.
