40|$|<b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} and craft for diverse purposes. Although this special energy form {{has a lot of}} technical advantages, it has {{to be taken into account}} that the energy comsumpiton of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> is considerably high. In Germany, these systems consume as much electricity as the Deutsche Bahn (German railways) for traction or as 1. 3 nuclear power plants. Nevertheless, according to an EU study published in 2001 (Radgen, 2001), approx, one third of this energy could be saved profitably. The "efficient compressed air" campaign addresses sthes huge saving potentials by porviding information about energy and cost efficient <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> for all industrial users, mostly via interne, expert press artivles, seminars, conferences, and networks. The results show that the information and the instruments offerde by the campaigne are appreciated by the target groups. Above this, companies are invited to have their <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> (the whole range from the compressor to the end use device) analyzed by <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> experts, in order to detect weak-points and subsequently to show solutions for improvement of both the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> quality and the energy efficiency. Due to public and private funding, this analysis can be provided free of charge for about 100 companies until the end of 2002. The results will be worked out as branch-spedifid case studies which wil be distributed among the industrial users.

Although the development of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is very expensive, this energy cost is rarely evaluated within the plant operation and is commonly overlooked when energy reduction opportunities are assessed. It is a common practice in facilities to simply add compressor capacity when faced with supply pressure or volume deficiencies, increasing the energy consumption associated with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> in industry. Additionally, in recent years, compressor plant installations and enhancements have trended toward minimizing the first cost of installation {{at the expense of}} increased operating costs.

40|$|Air {{compressors}} are {{a significant}} industrial energy user. Based on a survey (conducted by Oregon State University and the Bonneville Power Administration) of energy audit reports from 125 plants, air compressors account for roughly 10 % of total plant energy use. Furthermore, air compression is inefficient with up to 95 % of compressor power dissipated as heat. Thus even minor improvements in system operation, control strategies, and efficiency can yield large energy savings and significant non-energy or productivity benefits from reliable <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> is often called the ""fourth utility"" in industrial facilities after electricity, natural gas, and water. It provides motive power for machinery, cooling, materials handling, and hand tools. It is a safe, flexible, and powerful resource, but one that is seldom run for low operating costs or best productivity. Learning the basics of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> represents the beginning of both reducing energy costs and enjoying the productive benefits of reliable <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> management <b>systems,</b> including a system approach to managing demand, stabilizing pressure, reducing leaks and compressor controls, can allow the industrial end user to save 20 % - 50 % of their air compressor electricity usage. The monitoring capabilities of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> management <b>systems</b> provide a useful tool through power, pressure and flow trending to maintain both the energy savings and increased system reliability. More efficiently managed <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> are less costly to maintain and have less impact on the environment. The most important issues of industrial <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> in relation to energy efficiency and management are: 1. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> is an essential industrial utility; 2. <b>Compressing</b> <b>air</b> is a fundamentally inefficient energy transformation process; 3. Optimal operation of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> in industrial plants is seldom a priority and adequate management infonnation is rare, resulting in negative impacts on production and even less efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Demand Side Management (DSM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} viable and {{sustainable}} short term methods to address the shortfall in electricity generation in South Africa. This is because DSM projects can be implemented relatively quickly and inexpensively when compared with alternative generation options. This specifically applies to the mining industry. South African mines presently consume 15 % of Eskom-generated electricity. Mine <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> are some of the biggest users, consuming approximately 21 % of mine electricity consumption. Electricity savings on <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> are therefore important. With this study, various Energy Efficiency methods on <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> were investigated. These methods include variable speed drives on compressor motors, temperature control of compressor discharge, minimising pressure drops in the <b>air</b> distribution <b>systems,</b> eliminating <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> leaks, and optimising compressor selection and control. The most efficient strategies were identified, taking into account factors such as financial viability, sustainability, and ease of implementation. The best strategies were found to be the optimised control and selection of compressors, minimising <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> leaks, and the optimal control of system pressure. These strategies were implemented and tested on large <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> in gold and platinum mines. Savings of between 10 % and 35 % on the maximum demand of the systems were achieved. In present monetary terms this translates to as much as R 108 million savings for the mines per year at the end of 2009 tariffs. If total mine <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> electricity consumption can reduce by 30 %, it will result in nearly a 1 % reduction in total Eskom demand. This shows that mine <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> savings can make a significant contribution to the drive for Energy Efficiency in South Africa. Master...|$|R
