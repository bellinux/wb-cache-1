40|$|Kacang goat {{is one of}} Indonesian local goat {{which has}} not been {{optimized}} in exploration. Kacang goat has potency as a dairy goat. Milk and colostrum from this type of goat is one of lactoferrin sources which has various benefit, such as antimicrobial activity. The milk as a lactoferrin source {{is expected to be a}} solution for bacterial 9 astrointestinal infection cases which is a major problem in Indonesia. This research described the identification of lactoferrin from milk and colostrum of kacang goat by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). SRID is based on the diffusion of whey protein from a circular well into a homogeneous gel containing anti-lactoferrin. SDS-PAGE was performed in 7. 5 % polyacrylamide gel. Both methods were able to identify lactoferrin in colostrum and milk from the sample, but SRID showed low sensitivity toward low concentration of lactoferrin in both <b>colostrums</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk.</b> The estimation of lactoferrin molecular weight by relative mobility of protein from the bands that perform of colostrum and milk of kacang goat is approximately 74, 100 Dalton. Based on the ring diameter of the precipitin, the lactoferin level in colostrum and milk increased until 48 hours after postpartum and subsequently decrease...|$|E
40|$|Para {{tuberculosis}} or Johne's Disease, is {{a disease}} of the digestive tract of animals caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies Para tuberculosis (M. a. Para tuberculosis). Para tuberculosis has been registered in many countries and it today presents {{one of the most}} widely-spread bacterial diseases in ruminants that causes severe economic damages. In our country, Para tuberculosis has not been studied extensively. The disease was registered {{for the first time in}} Serbia in 1995 in an isolated herd of sheep of the II-de-France breed, and serologically positive cattle were determined in 2001. Infection with M. a. Para tuberculosis occurs mostly in young animals which are the most sensitive to infection. The main source of infection is the feces of diseased animals. Furthermore, <b>colostrums</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> of diseased animals can contain micro bacteria, and there is a possibility also of intra-uterine infection. A long period of incubation, a chronic course, and not always clear clinical picture render diagnosis of Para tuberculosis very complex, in spite of the existence of numerous diagnostic methods. There are a number of serological tests with which it is possible to detect antibodies against M. a. Para tuberculosis in infected animals. The most frequently used are complement binding reaction (CBR), the agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID), and the immunioenzyme test (ELISA). The isolation of causes or parts of their genome, present important methods in the diagnosis of Para tuberculosis. Pieces of tissue obtained through autopsies or biopsies, feces or milk samples, can serve as material for isolation. A diagnosis of Para tuberculosis for dead or sacrificed animals is made on the grounds of path anatomical or path histological findings. Para tuberculosis of ruminants has certain similarities with Crohn's Disease in humans, from the clinical, morphological, and etiological aspects...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Due to {{inadequate}} data on {{the dynamics}} of {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) infection in buffalo, the present work was aimed at investigating some virological and immunological aspects of FMD virus (FMDV) SAT 2 infection in naturally exposed and vaccinated buffalo cows and their calves. Materials and Methods: The study employed clinical observation and examination, virus isolation in mice brain and cell culture, in addition to virus detection using complement fixation test; indirect sandwitch enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and demonstration of RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for confirmation the results. Results: FMD type SAT 2 antibodies was detected in a protective level by the 1 st week post infection and 3 rd week post vaccination and peak titers were recorded by the 3 rd week, 12 th week in infected and vaccinated buffaloes, respectively. These titers began to decline to reach their lowest protective levels by the 36 th week, 12 nd week in infected and vaccinated buffaloes respectively. The SAT 2 antibodies in calves born to vaccinated and infected buffalo cows were detected on the 1 st day post parturation through the suckling of their Dam’s colostrums. The highest maternal antibody titers were recorded in sera by the 2 nd day post parturation. These antibodies declined gradually to reach their lowest protective levels on 14 th week, 16 th week post parturition in calves rom vaccinated and infected buffaloes, respectively. High antibody titers in the <b>colostrums</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> of vaccinated and naturally infected buffalo cows were recorded at parturition, and they began to decrease gradually recording their lowest protective titers by 10 th and 12 nd week post parturition respectively. Conclusion: FMDV serotype SAT 2 was confirmed as a causative agent of the suspected FMD signs in pregnant buffalo at El-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt, during 2012. Vaccinated and naturally infected buffalo cows were able to provide their calves with high levels of maternal derived antibodies through their colostrums, which could protect new born calves for not less than 14 week post parturation...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence and compare levels of soluble cytokines in paired samples of human <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk.</b> Methods: Levels of 27 cytokines were measured in 9 paired samples of human colostrum (day 2 after delivery) <b>and</b> breast <b>milk</b> (day 4 or 5 after delivery) by using multiplex technology. RESULTS: The majority of cytokines and chemokines investigated have been previously described in colostrum and/or breast milk. For the first time, we describe the presence of IL- 9 in both human <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk.</b> Of the 27 cytokines investigated, only IL- 5 was absent in both <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk,</b> whereas IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 15, IL- 17, and MIP- 1 α were present in colostrum, but not in breast milk.

40|$|The porcine {{immunoglobulins}} M (IgM), A (IgA), and G (IgG) {{were isolated}} and purified {{and some of}} the properties of the porcine milk IgA were examined. Monospecific antisera which were prepared against these immunoglobulins in rabbits were then used to absorb a particular class of immunoglobulin from sow serum, <b>colostrum,</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> in an attempt to identify the immunoglobulin classes of neutralizing antibodies to the porcine enteric virus, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). The results of these absorption studies suggest that in <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> from sows experimentally (orally) or naturally infected with live virulent TGE virus, IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin class of TGE antibodies. Both IgA and IgG TGE antibodies appeared to be present in the serum from these sows, but with IgG TGE antibodies predominating. In contrast, in the serum, <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> from sows vaccinated intramuscularly or intramammarily with live attenuated TGE virus, the TGE antibody activity was associated mainly with the IgG class of immunoglobulins. These results provide additional data indicating that the route of infection or vaccination markedly influences the immunoglobulin class of antibodies in <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk.</b> Secondly, IgA antibodies in mammary secretions are probably essential for providing optimal passive immunity of nursing pigs against infection with TGE virus...|$|R

Very different data of the composition of milk {{can be found in}} the literature, therefore the goal was to compare the literature data and verify the possibility of monitoring the quality of <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> mare´s <b>milk.</b> The work provides an overview of the identified values of the individual components of milk compared with the indicative values obtained by analysis of two mares milk. Individual differences were clearly identified in fat content, protein, casein, lactose, urea, and the number of somatic cells in <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> during the reference period. Work demonstrates the need for detailed and extensive monitoring of milk compositio...|$|R

40|$|The {{total amount}} of {{cholesterol}} found in <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> is comparatively low. The amount of cholesterol found in colostrum declines at an ever decreasing rate as milk secretion develops until at 48 hours the cholesterol is nearly {{the same as that}} found in milk 3 months or 7 months after parturition.

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{independent}} {{studies have}} presented {{evidence for the}} involvement of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in the aetiology of human breast cancer, while others have reported the opposite findings. Here, we have analysed by a high sensitive multiplex PCR-based method the prevalence of alpha mucosal and beta cutaneous HPV DNA in 90 ductal lavages, <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk.</b> Ten of the 70 DLs analyzed (14 %) contained a single or multiple beta HPV types, while DNA from mucosal high-risk HPV types was detected in only one sample (1 / 70). A strong reduction of HPV positivity in DL fluids was observed in 45 specimens collected after removal of the superficial layers of the nipple epidermis. All DLs were negative for the mucosal low-risk HPV types 6 and 11. Finally, HPV positivity was low in <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk.</b> Our data show that DNA of alpha mucosa and beta cutaneous HPV types are rarely present in the breast fluids and suggest that a direct role of HPV in breast carcinogenesis is unlikely...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to compare the composition of <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> of cows <b>and</b> sows (content of dry matter, protein, <b>milk</b> fat <b>and</b> lactose, concentration of IGF-I and insulin) in samples taken on the first, second, third and seventh day after parturition, and then based on the differences in composition to determine a biological significance of nutrition of newborn during the earliest stages of their life. The investigation inluded 14 cows of Holstein breed and 14 sows of Landrace breed. The content of dry matter and the concentration of proteins in both <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> samples were statistically significantly higher in regard to sows mammary glands secretion, taken {{on the first day}} after the parturition (p< 0, 01 and p< 0, 001, individually), but their decrease in mammary glands secretion was more pronounced in the cows than the sows, during the first seven days. The concentration IGF-I was statistically significantly higher in the cows <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> in regard to the sows during the whole investigation period, while the concentration of insulin was significantly higher in the sows in regard to the cows during the same period. The concentrations of <b>milk</b> fat <b>and</b> lactose in cows milk samples were significantly lower in regard to the sows in all period of the study. On the basis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that there are significant differences in the composition of <b>milk</b> <b>and</b> <b>colostrum</b> of both the investigated animal species. The differences are probably the result of evolutionary adaptation of mammal gland function to nutrition, energy and protection requirements of these young animals in their early postnatal life.

40|$|<b>Colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> {{are complex}} mammary {{secretions}} providing the puppy with many nutritional and immunological factors, which {{play a crucial}} role for its correct development and survival. In the case of colostrum and/or milk intake deficiency, puppies are at increased risk of infectious diseases. This work reviews the various nutritional hyperimmune supplementations proposed to provide a passive immune protection and to positively impact puppies' health. Some strategies rely on canine immunoglobulins: canine <b>colostrum</b> banking <b>and</b> canine serum/plasma supplementation. Others involve heterologous sources of antibodies and other immune factors: bovine colostrum or hyperimmune egg powder. Among the different solutions evaluated from birth to weaning, canine plasma and hyperimmune egg powder showed promising beneficial effect on puppies' health. Canine plasma seems to positively impact not only growth (increased growth during the neonatal period), but also digestive health (higher species richness of intestinal microbiota) and the general health (tendency of lower morbidity). Puppies supplemented with hyperimmune egg powder presented increased neonatal growth and decreased risk of canine parvovirus infection. Nevertheless, natural canine maternal <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> ingestion remains the optimal guarantee for puppies' health and survival, as a source of immunity, energy and growth factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{proportion}} of IgA, IgG and IgM in sow <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> that {{is derived from}} serum has been determined by measuring the transfer of 125 I-labelled immunoglobulin from serum. All colostral IgG and a high {{proportion of}} IgM are derived from serum as is 40 per cent of IgA. Thus it would appear that colostrum is not a true secretion since 90 per cent of its immunoglobulin content is of serum origin...|$|R
40|$|Colostrum is {{the main}} {{external}} resource providing piglets with nutrients and maternal immune molecules. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) {{have been used as}} immunopotentiators in vitro and several animal models. This study aimed {{to determine the effects of}} APS on immune factors in sow <b>colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk.</b> The sow diet was supplemented with APS one week before the expected delivery date. <b>Colostrum</b> <b>and</b> <b>milk</b> were collected <b>and</b> designated as 0 [*]h- (onset of parturition), 12 [*]h-, and 24 [*]h-colostrum and 36 [*]h-milk postpartum. Samples were measured using porcine immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, classical swine fever virus antibody (CSFV Ab), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin-like growth factor- (IGF-) 1 ELISA Quantitation Kits. Dietary supplementation of APS significantly enhanced the presence of IgG, IgM, EGF, and IGF- 1 in 0 [*]h-colostrum (P< 0. 001). The blocking rates of CSFV Ab were increased in samples from APS-supplemented sow when compared to those from the matched samples without APS treatment. The results indicate that supplement of APS could improve the immune components in sow <b>colostrum</b> and/or milk; <b>and</b> status of some specific vaccination could be determined through using colostrum or early milk in sow...|$|R
