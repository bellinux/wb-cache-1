40|$|OBJECTIVE: To prospectively {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} <b>contrast</b> material <b>concentration</b> on enhancement in cardiac CT by using a biphasic single-injection protocol. METHODS: Sixty-four-row multidetector cardiac CT angiography was performed in 159 patients randomised to a moderate or high <b>contrast</b> medium <b>concentration.</b> <b>Contrast</b> material injection included a first phase for enhancement of the coronary arteries and a second phase, at half the iodine flux, targeted at enhancement of the right ventricle. Contrast medium injection {{was followed by a}} saline flush. For both concentrations, injection duration (and thus total iodine dose) was adapted to the duration of the CT data acquisition and iodine flux was adjusted to patient weight. Attenuation was measured at various levels in the heart and vessels and the two concentrations compared, overall and per weight group. RESULTS: Enhancement of the aorta and left ventricle was significantly greater with the moderate than with the high <b>concentration</b> <b>contrast</b> medium.

In patient studies, Isovue 300 (iopamidol) was injected intravenously at a dosage of 1 ml/kg patient body weight. It was followed by serial head scanning of the tumor and arterial blood sampling to measure the <b>contrast</b> <b>concentration</b> in tumor and arterial plasma respectively. The leakage of iopamidol into the brain through the blood-brain barrier was modelled as an exchange process between two compartments, namely, the intravascular plasma space and the tissue interstitial space. Using this compartmental model and concentration measurement in tissue and blood plasma, quantitative estimates of K and Vdollarlcub prcubdollar were obtained with non-linear regression.;In a preliminary study of 12 patients, the average K and Vdollarlcub prcubdollar in brain tumors {{were found to be}} 0. 0273 dollar±dollar 0. 0060 ml/min/g and 0. 068 dollar±dollar 0. 11 ml/g respectively.

40|$|To {{quantify}} cerebral perfusion with dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSC-MRI), {{one needs}} to measure the arterial input function (AIF). Conventionally, one derives the <b>contrast</b> <b>concentration</b> from the DSC sequence by monitoring changes in either the amplitude or the phase signal {{on the assumption that}} the signal arises completely from blood. In practice, partial volume artifacts are inevitable because a compromise has to be reached between the temporal and spatial resolution of the DSC acquisition. As the concentration of the contrast agent increases, the vector of the complex blood signal follows a spiral-like trajectory. In the case of a partial-volume voxel, the spiral is located around the static contribution of the surrounding tissue. If the static contribution of the background tissue is disregarded, estimations of the <b>contrast</b> <b>concentration</b> will be incorrect. By optimizing the correspondence between phase information and amplitude information one can estimate the origin of the spiral, and thereupon correct for partial volume artifacts. This correction is shown to be accurate at low spatial resolutions for phantom data and to improve the AIF determination in a clinical example. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
30|$|Nonetheless, similar {{concerns}} among SPECT/CT users have limited the wider adoption of contrast-enhanced CT protocols {{as part of}} clinical SPECT/CT imaging. If CT contrast is indicated and used then most SPECT/CT imaging protocols entail a non-enhanced, low-dose CT {{for the purpose of}} attenuation correction and a contrast-enhanced CT for the purpose of advanced image fusion. Prior studies on the effect of CT contrast in SPECT/CT are sparse. Römer et al. reported [26] IV and positive oral contrast to have only a minor influence on calculated attenuation coefficients.

40|$|A {{precondition}} for quantitative angiography is strict standardization of all geometric parameters, i. e., {{position of the}} patient and radiation-source-object-image geometry. Correction for respiratory and cardiac cycles is equally important. When all these variables are controlled, the absolute size of a vessel can be {{a major source of}} error, since border recognition becomes progressively difficult with decreasing vascular diameter. Finally, contrast density, independent of vascular geometry, will induce errors by virtual magnification of minimal diameters. The results in this paper show the influences of image intensifier position, angulation of the imaging device, and <b>contrast</b> <b>concentration</b> on the geometry of model coronary stenoses when evaluated with computer-assisted quantitative methods. Increase of object-image intensifier distance led to an underestimation of size which increased with decreasing vascular diameter.

40|$|Objectives. Transthoracic {{echocardiography}} (TTE) {{is fundamental}} in managing patients supported with ventricular assist devices (VAD).

The aim was to assess <b>contrast</b> <b>concentration</b> following passage through a VAD utilising a mock circulation loop (MCL). Methods. Heartware continuous flow (CF) VAD was incorporated into a MCL. Definity® contrast was infused into the MCL with imaging before and after CF-VAD. 5 [*]mm 2 regions of interest were used to obtain signal intensity (decibels), as a surrogate of <b>contrast</b> <b>concentration.</b> Results. Four pump speeds revealed significant reduction in contrast signal intensity after CF-VAD compared to before CF-VAD (all p< 0. 0001). Combined pre- and postpump data at all speeds showed a 22. 2 % absolute reduction in contrast signal intensity across the CF-VAD (14. 8 ± 0. 8 [*]dB prepump versus 11. 6 ± 1. 4 [*]dB postpump; p< 0. 0001). Mean signal intensity reduction at each speed showed an inverse relationship between speed and relative reduction in signal intensity. Conclusion. Contrast microsphere transit through a CF-VAD within a MCL resulted in significant reduction in signal intensity, consistent with destruction within the pump.

First pass of iodinated contrast injected intravenously is a second method, more widely available. Both methods are proven to be robust and quantitative, thanks to the linear relationship between <b>contrast</b> <b>concentration</b> and x-ray attenuation. For the CT methods, concern regarding x-ray doses delivered to the patients need to be addressed.

In this in vitro study we investigated diffusion and equilibrium distribution of an anionic contrast agent in human {{articular cartilage}} and related the results to tissue composition and integrity. MethodsOsteochondral cylinders (d= 4. 0 mm, n= 24) were prepared from femoral medial condyles (FMCs, cartilage thickness 2. 13 ± 0. 54 mm, mean±standard deviation [SD]), and tibial medial plateaus ([TMPs] 1. 99 ± 0. 38 mm) of human cadaver knees.

The X-ray absorption maps and profiles were measured before immersion, and after every 2 h of immersion using clinical peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). ResultsAn increase in X-ray attenuation along cartilage depth, indicating a characteristic density profile increasing from superficial to deep tissue, {{could be seen in}} pQCT images acquired without contrast agent. The complete diffusion of the contrast agent into cartilage took more than 12 h. However, the uronic acid concentration correlated with the <b>contrast</b> agent <b>concentration</b> in femoral cartilage (r=− 0. 76, n= 12, P= 0. 004) as early as after 2 h of immersion, and the linear correlation was virtually unchanged during the remaining 22 h. Similarly, the histological tissue integrity (Mankin score) correlated positively with the <b>contrast</b> agent <b>concentration</b> in tibial cartilage (r=+ 0. 75, P= 0. 005) after 2 h of immersion. The X-ray absorption profiles before immersion, i. e., without the contrast agent, and after 24 h of immersion were significantly correlated (r=− 0. 76 ± 0. 34, mean±SD). ConclusionsAlthough the complete contrast agent diffusion into human articular cartilage in vitro took more than 12 h, significant apparent correlations were revealed between the spatial proteoglycan (PG) and contrast agent distributions already after 2 h of immersion.
