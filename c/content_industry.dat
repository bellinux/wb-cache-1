[...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town.

Creative industries embrace both traditional and contemporary culture, but exportable industries are primarily content-driven.

The concern of this paper therefore is on the synergy between financial and creative inputs into production, distribution, and marketing of film and television.

The impact of the foresight on policy was limited as it did not lead to direct policy measures, nevertheless, it confirmed some issues of major importance seen from the perspective of different stakeholders.

The study is {{the first of its kind}} to investigate to what extent and how digital content workers’ learning needs are being met by adult education and training in Australia and Singapore. The pilot project involved consolidating key theoretical literature, studies, policies, programs and statistical data relevant to the digital <b>content</b> <b>industries</b> in Australia and Singapore. This had not been done before, and represented new knowledge generation. Digital content workers include professionals within and beyond the creative industries as follows: Visual effects and animation (including virtual reality and 3 D products); Interactive multimedia (e. g. websites, CD-ROMs) and software development; Computer and online games; and Digital film & TV production and film & TV post-production. In the last decade, the digital <b>content</b> <b>industries</b> have been recognised as an industry sector of strong and increasing significance. The project compared Australia and Singapore on aspects of the digital content industries’ labour market, skill requirements, human capital challenges, the role of adult education in building a workforce for the digital <b>content</b> <b>industries,</b> and innovation policies.

The current OECD definition of the MCI sector is discussed, as regards {{the limitations of the}} definition itself and of its operationalization. The approach taken in the collection of data, and also problems with data availability, are dealt with. The official data sources consulted include Eurostat data for EU Member States, the OECD and national statistical offices. In addition, the report draws on a number of non-official sources which complement official statistics and contribute to a better analysis and understanding of the economic profile of the MCI sector, particularly when describing new developments not (yet) covered by official statistics. Data from non-official sources to describe some emerging trends regarding the effect of ICT on the MCI are also provided.
