5|$|On February23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} convection in the Mozambique Channel. On February25, Météo France (MF) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 13 {{when the}} system was located along the southwest coast of Madagascar. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, noting that environmental conditions favored development, including weak wind shear. The system developed organized convection in a <b>circular</b> <b>pattern,</b> and on February26, the MF and JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 13 and Tropical Cyclone 19S, respectively. With a mid-level ridge to the south, the depression moved generally westward, and after intensifying further, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Japhet by the Direction de la Météorologie et de l'Hydrologie of Madagascar late on February26.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Au-catalyzed {{growth of}} nanocrystalline Si by pulse jet {{chemical}} vapor deposition has been investigated. Au thin film was first deposited on thermally oxidized Si(100), then CH 3 SiH 3 pulse jets were irradiated onto the Au/SiO 2 /Si(100) surface. The irradiation of the CH 3 SiH 3 jets at 1150 °C resulted in <b>circular</b> <b>patterns</b> with a diameter of ~ 40 µm on the sample surfaces. In {{the center of the}} <b>circular</b> <b>patterns,</b> agglomerations of Au were observed. It was found that the oxide layer was etched and that nanocrystalline Si with diameters ~ 500 nm was formed in the <b>circular</b> <b>patterns.</b> These results indicate that the nanocrystalline Si was grown by the VLS process in which Si atoms were supplied from the oxide layer, Si substrate, and CH 3 SiH 3 molecules...|$|R

5|$|In {{line with}} Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided {{creating}} a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed {{during his time}} in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the <b>circular</b> <b>pattern</b> of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that make it appear like the figures are in motion.|$|E
5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a <b>circular</b> <b>pattern.</b> Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} corn crake {{population had}} begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a <b>circular</b> <b>pattern</b> from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.|$|E

5|$|The first Allied {{landings}} on {{the beach}} occurred on 9 September, with two regiments of Middleton's 45th Infantry Division, the 157th and 179th Infantry, landing the following day. The other regiment of the division, the 180th, would land at a different point and be held in reserve by Clark. Middleton was responsible for ten miles of beachhead between the British X Corps and the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The German defensive positions pounded the Allies, who gained little ground {{in the first few}} days of the operation. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking the troops back off the beaches. Middleton, telling his staff that they were not leaving, spread around the word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting. On the morning of 14 September units of the Forty-fifth did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory, consisting of five imposing stone buildings in a somewhat <b>circular</b> <b>pattern.</b> The Germans were dug in here, and repulsed the Americans initially, but with the aid of some naval gun fire, the Germans were eventually pushed back. Clark visited the front later that day, and was convinced that his army was going to stay.|$|E

First, a solution-dipping template strategy is used to create TiO 2 films with hexagonally arranged pores on Au-coated Si substrate, resulting in hexagonally arranged <b>circular</b> <b>patterns</b> of catalysts surrounded by TiO 2 films. Then the patterned catalysts guide the growth of SiO 2 NWs with the original TiO 2 films preserved, realizing the composite structures. Such composite architectures combine the photoluminescence (PL) properties of the two components, and also present more favorable PL property, laying a foundation for future advanced nano-optoelectronic devices...|$|R

25|$|Periods {{of rapid}} climate change {{generally}} saw {{a collapse of}} this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with subsistence agricultural foodstuffs; and transhumance pastoralism became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a <b>circular</b> <b>pattern</b> north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It {{has been suggested that}} the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms. During the periods of the collapse of Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia and the First Intermediate Period of Egypt, the Hyksos invasions {{and the end of the}} Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late Bronze Age collapse, trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree Assyria, withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the Philistine and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from Kadesh Barnea, through Hebron, Lachish, Jerusalem, Bethel, Samaria, Shechem, Shiloh through Galilee to Jezreel, Hazor and Megiddo. Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from Eilath, Timna, Edom (Seir), Moab, Ammon and thence to the Aramean states of Damascus and Palmyra. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and Tyrians in the case of Judah and Samaria, for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.|$|E
