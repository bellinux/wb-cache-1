[...] The characters in a cartoon were often of one race, and negative focus on the foibles of particular races or cultures worked its way into the mainstream. [...] Such cartoons did not help to soothe racial tensions that were simmering then. [...] The situation erupted with the racial riots of 1969, and for several years after these incidents relationships among the races were raw and fragile. [...] According to Redza, Lat soothed the nation's racial woes with his works. [...] Drawing members of various races in his crowd scenes and showing their interactions with one another, Lat portrayed Malaysians in a gentle and unbiased comic manner. [...] Redza pointed out although one may argue that Lat was forced into the role of racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>mediator</b> (because of his employment with his country's [...] "leading English-language newspaper serving a multi-racial readership"), he possessed the necessary qualities—intimate knowledge of various races and culture—to succeed in the job. [...] Lat's fans recognised the trademark of his oeuvre as [...] "a safe and nice humour that made everyone feel good and nostalgic by appealing to their benevolent sides rather than by poking at their bad sides". [...] It proved to be a successful formula; more than 850,000copies of his books were sold in the twelve years after the first compilation of his editorial cartoons went on sale in 1977. [...] The comfort that readers sought from his works was such that when in September 2008 Lat deviated from his usual style, to draw a cartoon about racially charged politicking in his country, it shocked journalist Kalimullah Hassan. [...] She found the illustration of a group of Malaysians huddled under an umbrella, taking shelter from a rain of xenophobic phrases, full of profound sadness.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{the last}} 10 years {{migration}} processes have progressively increased worldwide and in Italy about 5 millions of residing migrants are estimated. To meet health {{needs of these}} new residents, effective relational and communication tools, which allow a reciprocal intercultural interaction within health care structures, are therefore necessary.

RESULTS: Within the activity of HIV phone counselling operated by Psyco-socio-behavioural, Communication and Training Operating Unit of National Institute of Health in Italy, an intercultural approach was successfully experienced in a project targeted to migrants (2007 - 2008).

40|$|In foreign {{language}} education, {{the teaching of}} culture remains a hotly debated issue. What is culture? What is its relation to language? Which and whose culture should be taught?

5000|$|Later, from 1914 onwards Storer {{was one of}} the {{principal}} contributors to the Egoist (An Individualist Review) with short articles on modern poetry, painting, sculpture, translations etc. (which at the time) was considered as propaganda for imagism or at least advertising for the imagists. In 1916 he wrote a noteworthy article on the Free verse form noting 'every man's free verse is different'.In 1916 Storer moved to Italy and from 1917 to 1941 lived in Rome. Here he founded and edited [...] "Atys" [...] - [...] "Foglio d’Arte e di Letteratura Internazionale/Occasional Broadsheet of Art and Literature" [...] from 1918 to 1921. During this period he was in close contact with Italian painters and poets who belonged to the second Futurism: he created a particular movement not well defined and not officially recognized, but with specific features. It included some Dadaist aspects and its main goal was substantially to enhance the value of spiritualism in a laic way. In particular, Storer was in touch with Francesco Meriano and Enrico Prampolini, who illustrated [...] "Atys".During his staying in Italy he translated Pirandello’s plays (Six Characters in Search of an Author and Henry IV, translations based on the first editions of Pirandello’s plays) and also devoted to the Italian dramatist some critical essays.

Informal networking is not primarily based on sociality ties and mutual exchange, as is often assumed; instead, publishers use informal contacts {{to keep an eye}} on each other, they share communalities with authors in more private settings and they exchange specific content in more formal ways. Personal ties involve different loyalties and motives which elevate or increase tensions between career and conglomerate and between culture and commerce.

By moving beyond dichotomies of emotion –business and culture–commerce, we aim to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of both networks and place in cultural industries...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{illustrate}} how nurses can promote family wellness and facilitate acculturation for involuntary migrant families as conceptualized by bilingual interpreters and <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> with own past refugee experience.   Due {{to the nature}} of involuntary migration and accompanying acculturation, refugee families face a complex transition, exposing them to vulnerability in cohesion and family function. Involuntary migrant health needs are largely managed within the Primary Health Care sector where Primary Health Care Nurses (PHCN) play an important role. Additionally, bilingual interpreters and <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> with personal experience of being refugees and subsequent acculturation {{play a critical role in}} bridging the language and cultural gap between migrant families and PHCNs. Methods: The study is descriptive and explorative in design with a phenomenographic approach. Data was collected in Southern Sweden utilizing in-depth interviews with ten bilingual interpreters and <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> originating from the Balkans, Kurdistan, Eritrea and Somalia. A contextual analysis with reference to phenomenography was used in interpreting the data material. Results: Three separate themes illustrated the meaning of family wellness: a sense of belonging to the new homeland, the maintenance of self-esteem and stable family interrelationships. The analysis demonstrated that the way ex-refugee bilingual interpreters and <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> perceived of how to promote family wellness, fell into three qualitative different conceptions: (1) Promotion of family wellness is the responsibility of the family itself, manifested in its attitude in wanting to adjust to change, (2) Promotion of family wellness is the consideration of those outside the family and is marked by understanding and respectful attitudes, (3) Promotion of family wellness is a societal responsibility to which successful integration is a prerequisite. Conclusions: The promotion of health of involuntary migrant families in cultural transition is complex due to families, other members of the society and society at large all contributing to family wellness in the process of acculturation. For nurses to facilitate a healthy transition for involuntary migrant families, a holistic approach working with the entire family in a psychosocial way and cooperating with other health care professionals, community authorities and ethnic organizations maybe a future direction in encounters with involuntary migrant families with health problems. Adopting a family system approach will enable nurses to provide culturally and transition-competent quality care by enabling stabilizing interfamily relationships through supportive conversations about changes and its subsequent reactions and possible coping of the family as a unit. Further research in order to enhance health promotion would preferable take on a participatory approach. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies {{processes}} of cultural mediation {{and the role}} of digital media within them. It is based on the experiences of a group of <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> within a particular music scene in contemporary Chile, and focuses on actors’ meaningful repertoires of action, their material arrangements and their relation with information and communication technologies (ICTs). ‘Mediation’ in a broader sense means processes through which human and non-human agencies produce and shape meanings, attaching them to various cultural flows such as information, images, and identities. As <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators,</b> actors define the music scene, curating and circulating through digital media various flows which they deem worthy of being considered by audiences, and distinguishing themselves across different fields. The thesis is based on nine months of fieldwork (2011) in Santiago, following the everyday practices of the creators of eight music websites through which global and local cultural flows are mediated, organised, and circulated. It analyses how various technological devices facilitate individuals’ construction of networks where cultural flows circulate, and through which their uses of taste are displayed and objectified. It proposes the concept of ‘digital capital’ as an assemblage of actors, practices, objects, and meanings, which is convertible into other types of capital (e. g. economic) and exchangeable in various fields. It is a mode of practice and expertise through which, using digital technologies, individuals create networks where cultural flows circulate. Through the making of websites, music fans become <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators,</b> developing their digital capital as cultural and technical expertise. This expertise is convertible into economic capital and positionality across different fields, especially the field of advertising. Digital capital can be summarised in the question: ‘what are the connections and associations between technical knowledge, cultural flows, and social position, as well as conversions of capital, behind someone who is using Twitter or Facebook, or making a website about a music scene?’ Against this backdrop, it is explored how actors produce and perform ‘cultures of mediation’, commoditising culture as consumption goods...|$|R
40|$|The {{literary}} translator as a <b>cultural</b> <b>mediator</b> The translation process is an intercultural transfer {{that does not}} only take place between two languages, but between two cultures, as the source and target text are each embedded in a communicative situation in their respective cultures. The {{literary translator}} is thus faced {{with the problem of}} how to handle the cultural aspects implicit in a source text, and of choosing the most suitable technique to convey these aspects to the target text successfully while keeping in mind the characteristics of the intended readers. The translator can thus be regarded as a <b>cultural</b> <b>mediator</b> who facilitates communication and understanding between people or groups who differ with regard to language and culture. The various culture-specific words and concepts in Dalene Matthee’s “Fiela se kind” have far-reaching implications for translation. The extent to which the translator – Matthee herself – succeeded in functioning as a <b>cultural</b> <b>mediator</b> in “Fiela’s child” is investigated in this article by means of contrastive analysis. It is argued that a decisive loss of meaning and emotional value occured during the translation process to the detriment of the target text as a literary work. The contention of this article is that Matthee’s way of handling translation problems on a microstructural level brought about macrotextual semantic shifts in the target text, and that she did not succeed in fulfilling her role as a <b>cultural</b> <b>mediator</b> at all the levels of the text...|$|E

40|$|L 2 {{translation}} is increasingly {{viewed as a}} legitimate and consolidated area of research within Translation Studies. In this paper, the feasibility of training L 2 translators as <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> is examined. The analysis {{is presented in the}} form of a case study of advanced L 2 students translating from Italian into English. This sample was assessed primarily in terms of cultural mediation. Given this emphasis, the source text (ST) was taken from the domain of cultural information for the general public. The principal assessment criterion was the source language (SL) conventional metaphor “percorso”, a pervasive JOURNEY metaphor, widely used in that domain. This trope was chosen because it combines significant source culture (SC) attitudes to communicative style and expresses values attributed to official culture itself. The paper analyses how students responded to the challenge of negotiating between SC values, situational context, possible target language (TL) models and legitimate target text (TT) reader expectations. The sample is then assessed referring to Bennett's (1993) Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity. Significantly different levels of cultural competence emerged, and these accounted for important differences in the effectiveness of the translations. On the basis of this preliminary case study, a tentative model of advanced L 2 <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> is proposed...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that interpreters {{need to have}} knowledge of the cultures represented by the languages they work with (e. g. Roy 2002, Angelelli 2004, Wadensjŏ 2008). However, {{it is not clear}} what interpreters are expected to do with this knowledge. Some scholars recommend that interpreters be <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> (e. g. Katan 2004 & 2014). As an attempt to examine existing guidelines on interpreters’ roles in the face of cultures/cultural issues, the research reported in this paper compares and contrasts the codes of conduct for interpreters from a number of associations and institutions in the UK, the US and China. The research has collected three different sets of data and has sought to investigate (1) in what ways interpreters are expected to do with their knowledge of cultures; (2) to what extent interpreters’ role as <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> is referred to or defined in these codes of conduct; and (3) whether or not relevant guidelines are practically helpful for interpreters to deal with the range of cultural issues they may encounter in interpreting. Data analysis suggests that while cultural knowledge is a requisite for interpreters, the expectation for them to be <b>cultural</b> <b>mediators</b> may depend on the types of interpreting setting they work with and further guidelines are needed so that interpreters are clear on what they are required to do in dealing with cultural issues. The paper then discusses the implications of these findings and points to some directions for future research. Key references Brunette, L., G Bastin, I. Hemlin and H. Clarke (ed.).
