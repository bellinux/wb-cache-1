5|$|Filipino cuisine {{has evolved}} over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic, <b>Chinese,</b> <b>American,</b> and other Asian {{influences}} that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} change in the perceptions about <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans.</b> In as little as 100 years of American history, stereotypes of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> have changed to portraying a hard working and educated minority. Thus, most <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> work as white collar professionals, many of whom are highly educated, salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed in management, professional, and related occupations such as engineering, medicine, investment banking, law, and academia. 53.1% of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> work in many white collar professions compared with 48.1% for all Asian Americans and a national average of 35.1%. They make up 2% of working physicians in the United States. <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> also make up a third of the Asian American high tech professional workforce and a tenth of the entire Silicon Valley workforce. <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> also hold lower unemployment rates than the population average with a figure of 4.7% compared to a national rate of 5.9% in 2010.|$|R

5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was first}} {{described}} as a genus in 1923, by Henry Fairfield Osborn. He named the type species P. mongoliensis, for the location of its discovery in Mongolia, placing it in the new family Psittacosauridae. Remains of this dinosaur were first discovered the year before, on the third American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, {{when one of the}} expedition's drivers found the type specimen (AMNH6254), which preserves a nearly complete skull, as well as a post cranial skeleton lacking sections of the limbs. This same expedition turned up the remains of many other famous Mongolian dinosaurs, including Protoceratops, Oviraptor, and Velociraptor. Many later expeditions by various combinations of Mongolian, Russian, <b>Chinese,</b> <b>American,</b> Polish, Japanese, and Canadian paleontologists also recovered specimens from throughout Mongolia and northern China. In these areas, Psittacosaurus mongoliensis fossils are found in most sedimentary strata dating to the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 125 to 100Ma (million years ago). Fossil remains of over 75 individuals have been recovered, including nearly 20 complete skeletons with skulls. Individuals of all ages are known, from hatchlings less than 13centimetres (5in) long, to very old adults reaching nearly 2metres (6.5ft) in length.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinction}} between Korean American and <b>Chinese</b> <b>American</b> English speakers {{can be found}} in the timing of spoken syllables, or rhythm. <b>Chinese</b> <b>American</b> speakers (in particular, males), tended to speak with a more regular timing of syllables than Korean American speakers.|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of literature}} {{has suggested that the}} public portrayal of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> as a high-achieving, well-adjusting “model minority” might not reflect the entire reality of their mental health conditions. This study examined depression risks and correlates among different generations of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans,</b> using non-Hispanic whites as a comparison group. A nationally representative sample of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> (n = 600) from the Comprehensive Psychiatric Epidemiological Survey was used. Results of the study indicate that <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> in general have a lower risk of depression than non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, the prevalence and correlates of depression do not show a linear trend of difference from first to second to third-or-higher generation <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans,</b> and then to non-Hispanic whites; rather, the risk of depression and its association with social relational factors presents in distinctive patterns for first and second generation <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans,</b> compared to third-or-higher generation <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> and non-Hispanic whites. Specifically, friend network and relative group play different roles in influencing depression for different generations of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans.</b> The findings contributed to the growing {{body of literature}} on acculturation and mental health among immigrants, shedding lights on the complicated sociocultural contexts that could influence the mental well-being of individuals. Mental health service providers {{need to be aware of}} the complex and nuanced association between social relational factors and depression in their prevention, management, and treatment efforts...|$|R

50|$|Analysis {{indicated}} that most non-Asian Americans do not differentiate between <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> and East Asian Americans generally, {{and perceptions of}} both groups are nearly identical. A 2001 survey of Americans' attitudes toward Asian <b>Americans</b> and <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> {{indicated that}} one fourth of the respondents had somewhat or very negative attitude toward <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> in general. The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as entrepreneurs (77%); high value on education (67%).|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{population}} of Chinese in the United States increasing dramatically, there are few sociological studies focusing on the economic dimension of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans?</b> assimilation into the White-dominant society. The lack of study {{can be explained by}} three major reasons: the traditional research approach which grouped <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> into Asian Americans, the contradiction between the influential majority-minority paradigm and the socioeconomic achievements of <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans,</b> and data limitation. The following study examines whether <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans,</b> by U. S. nativity and U. S. educational experience, have lower earnings than non-Hispanic native-born Whites and investigate their earning returns to occupational status. Based on the 2008 to 2012 sample data from American Community Survey, the result of this study indicates that U. S. -born <b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> have achieved overall earnings parity with their White counterparts, while U. S. -educated Chinese immigrants must attain more education in order to achieve earnings parity with native workers; only the foreign-educated Chinese immigrants {{are most likely to be}} at a significant disadvantage in earnings...|$|R

50|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>Americans</b> were an {{important}} source of funds for Han revolutionaries during the later Qing dynasty, and Sun Yat-sen was raising money in America {{at the time of the}} Xinhai Revolution, which established the Republic of China.
