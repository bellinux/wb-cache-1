This southern headland, called Odde, is marked by continuous loss of land.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the parameters that must be controlled during in vivo resonance frequency measurements with a <b>custom</b> Osstelltrade <b>mark</b> transducer for <b>custom</b> implants in the guinea pig animal model. A numerical study and in vitro measurements were performed to determine the influence of the boundary conditions as well as the transducer orientation on the resonance frequency measured by the <b>custom</b> Osstelltrade <b>mark</b> transducer. In the reported guinea pig model, the type of boundary condition, the orientation of the transducer (parallel or perpendicular to the long axis of the bone) and the length of the modelled bone have a large influence on the resonance frequency values. This implies that a follow-up in time of the stability of an implant requires the boundary conditions applied to the bone in which the implant is installed as well as the orientation of the transducer to be highly repeatable. Applying controlled boundary conditions during in vivo measurements had a highly positive influence on the repeatability of the Osstell measurements. This improves the possibility of the technique to measure changes in the implant-bone interface during healing of the implant. status: publishe...|$|R

From his own experience, Ansai believed that certain Shinto customs and rituals (such as funeral practices) reflected Confucian values. His Yamato shōgaku (Japanese Elementary Learning), published in 1658, although {{more focused on}} general social <b>customs,</b> <b>marks</b> {{a turning point in}} Ansai's thought, with its inclusion of various Shinto elements. In the latter part of his life, Ansai began a project of combining Neo-Confucian morality (based on Zhu Xi) with the religious elements of Shinto.

On November 23, 1672, he created the Record of the Fuji no mori Shrine (Fuji no mori yuzuemandokoro no ki), an essay that generally summarizes Ansai's views on Shinto and its connection to Neo-Confucian metaphysics.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark V action {{remained}} relatively unchanged {{during the first}} five years of production. Shortly after, manufacturing moved from PFI in the U.S. to J. P. Sauer in Germany. In addition, the safety was redesigned and moved from the receiver to the bolt, which was changed from a smooth to a fluted surface. The first major change came in 1963 when Weatherby designed a shorter and more trim Mark V action for their 224 Weatherby Magnum varmint round, new for 1964. The bolt in this smaller Mark V action only had six locking lugs, versus the nine found on its bigger brother. Rifles chambered for the new 224 Wby Magnum were dubbed [...] "Varmintmaster." [...] The Varmintmaster was later offered in 22-250 Remington, making this the first non-Weatherby cartridge offered in the Mark V. In 1967, the 9-lug Mark V action was offered for the first time in 30-06. These two cartridges, the 30-06 and 22-250, remained the only two non-Weatherby chamberings offered in production Mark V rifles until the mid-1990s. (Though Weatherby would build a <b>custom</b> <b>Mark</b> V to a customer's specifications in virtually any caliber.) Today, all non-Weatherby standard calibers (not magnum cartridges) are only offered in 6-lug versions of the action. This makes 9-lug, 30-06 Mark Vs (whether made in Germany or Japan) somewhat of a rarity.|$|R

40|$|The given {{publication}} {{is devoted}} research of one sign on a medieval amphora from Chersonesos (Byzantine Cherson). The {{mark in the}} form of a cross on a rectangular base is put on a neck of an import vessel of the last third of the X-XI centuries found in a cistern excavation in dwelling house of the IX-XI centuries in Cherson. Among medieval graffiti from Cherson the exact analogy of this image is unknown. There are some examples of drawing of a similar symbol on transport vessels of the Byzantine time from the Eastern Crimea and Sarkel. Crosses of different kinds have received a wide spreading as building marks on a tile during a medieval time. The cross on a base, so called the cross on the Golgotha, is known among the graffiti on the churches of ancient Kiev. The theme of the cross on an eminence is traced in symbolical images of Christian temples; such drawings were found in the church of Cyril in Kiev and on Early Bulgarian strengthened settlement Tzar Asen. The cross on a base is a traditional image on coins and the seals of Byzantine Cherson. In researches of the studying of medieval graffiti there is no common opinion about appointment of this symbol: a sign on the owner of a thing, a workshop sign, <b>customs</b> <b>marks,</b> capacity of container and the description of the goods. Possibly, in this case it is necessary to consider studying experience amphorae stamps and to draw parallels from images on coins to signs on ceramics. Early such communications have already been established at studying of labels-abbreviations and monograms on building ceramics and coins of Chersonesos in the IX-XI centuries...|$|R
