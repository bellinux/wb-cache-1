2500|$|From about 1848 a {{circular}} {{form of the}} buddle was introduced. The crushed ore, suspended in water was introduced onto a central cone and spread outwards over a slightly inclined <b>conical</b> <b>surface.</b> The [...] "heads" [...] would settle near the centre and the [...] "tailings" [...] at the outer edge. The main innovation of the circular buddle was a set of sweep arms, powered by a waterwheel, which rotated above the buddle and carried brushes or pieces of fabric that dragged {{across the surface of}} the settling deposits. By continuously disturbing the surface of the deposit, these stopped the formation of rivulets and allowed better separation to be obtained. The buddle would be run until the deposit built up to between 6 and 12inches (15 and 30cm.) deep. The deposits would then be dug out in three portions, the [...] "middles" [...] often being reprocessed in another buddle of a slightly different specification.|$|E

40|$|Current {{algorithm}} {{system of}} the Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) widely adopts the least-squares (LS) method for form error quality inspections. This LS algorithm provides an approximate solution for form error evaluation only, with possible actual error overestimation and further leading some of acceptable mechanical components to be rejected. Moreover, the existing method {{for the evaluation of}} conicity error is actually infrequent. Thus, the paper elaborates a heuristic approach using an umbrella-shaped mechanical model for precisely evaluating the minimum zone conicity error based on minimum potential energy principle. The umbrella-shaped mechanical model consists of two coaxial and equal-vertex-angle <b>conical</b> <b>surfaces</b> by a fictitious spring connection. All measured data points are enclosed within two <b>conical</b> <b>surfaces</b> which are mathematically determined by the coordinates of 7 active data points. To allow the error assessment being conducted precisely, the non-linear model provides seven degrees of freedom to handle various possible situations. The shrinking spring reduces simulated mechanical system potential energy, yielding two new coaxial cones with smaller normal separation and new contact points on <b>conical</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The system eventually reaches a stable state with a minimum elastic potential energy. The normal separation between such two <b>conical</b> <b>surfaces</b> is minimum zone of conical form error. A direct searching technique based on the derived minimum zone criterion is demonstrated, and a fast and flexible computational algorithm is also proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The parabola is the locus of points in that plane that are equidistant from both the directrix and the focus. Another {{description of}} a parabola is as a conic section, created from the intersection of a right circular <b>conical</b> <b>surface</b> and a plane which is parallel to another plane which is tangential to the <b>conical</b> <b>surface.</b> A third description is algebraic.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of ceramic head of hip joint endoprosthesis destructions in vivo, and with assessing the impact of shape deflections of <b>conical</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the tensile stress in the head. There are assumed two material characteristics of the stem – the first is linear elastic and the second is bilinear plastic modelled austenitic steel used in the bio-implants. Concerned are shape deviations from the ideal <b>conical</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the stem {{and the head of the}} endoprosthesis. The shape deviations may be modelled at the macro-level - this concerns model shape inaccuracies such as deviation from the nominal degree of taper, at the micro-level - when the stochastic distribution of unevenness on the contact areas is respected.

40|$|The {{simplicity}} of the results and favorable properties of a class of conically cambered delta wings with subsonic leading edges in a supersonic stream, studied in Part I, has suggested that one look into the possibility of obtaining useful minimum drag shapes when the basic solutions are linearly combined in a Lagrange multiplier formulation. To this end, the classical problem of minimum drag wings for a given total lift is solved by linearly combining the basic twist distributions in combinations of two, three and four using the Lagrange multiplier method. The optimal <b>conical</b> <b>surfaces</b> reported appear to be of practical use because of small surface waviness and a washout in incidence near the leading edge. The lift-to-drag ratios {{are close to the}} plane delta with suction and their off-design properties are expected to be better than those of Tsien (1955) and Holla (1967).

This downstream section of this valve body is conical and free to move axially.

50|$|A simpler {{approach}} is to overcome the instability by locating the main weight of the aircraft a significant distance below the wing, so that gravity will tend to maintain the aircraft in a horizontal attitude and so counteract any aerodynamic instability, as in the paraglider. However, in practice this is seldom sufficient to provide stability on its own, and typically is augmented by the aerodynamic techniques described. A classic example is the Rogallo wing hang glider, which uses the same sweepback, washout and <b>conical</b> <b>surface</b> as Dunne.|$|E
