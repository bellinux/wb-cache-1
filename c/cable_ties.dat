Some ties include a tab that can be depressed to release the ratchet so that the tie can be loosened or removed, and possibly reused.|$|R
25|$|Apart from pure metal chains, <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> {{are also}} {{often used as}} {{a quick way to}} tie someone up securely.

The nose drill bits are used for creating and perfecting the nostrils of the doll. Acetone or a paint thinner medium is needed for removing the factory paint from the doll. Hair is an optional choice to add to a doll. Fine mohair, human hair, or wigs are usually used, but it is found in a variety of types. Rooting tools are utilized for this process and are available in numerous sizes 20,36,38, 40, and 42. The smaller the number the thicker the needle which will grab more hair and leave a bigger hole in the head of the doll. Eyes for a reborn doll are offered in a variety of brands and sizes.|$|E
2500|$|As police {{began to}} conduct {{thorough}} inquiries into Taylor's background, {{they discovered that}} he was a frequent user of lonely hearts advertisements. Through his telephone records they identified the women he had contacted in this way and began to interview them. One woman who had dated Taylor disclosed that Taylor told her he liked tying women up and locking them in a cupboard. Another said that Taylor had told her that he had a fetish for [...] "bondage, whips and ties", and [...] said that he wanted to tie her daughter up with <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> and have sexual intercourse with her. A former girlfriend, who had briefly lived with Taylor, told police that she had often visited Lindley Woods with him while they were dating, and that she had eventually broke off the relationship with him because of his bondage fetish and the feeling [...] "that she was being raped". When asked by police to describe how Taylor would tie her, she described his practice of securing a plastic cable tie around each of her wrists, then tying her hands behind her back by using a third cable tie to link them. This was exactly how Tiernan had been found. She also said that Taylor kept a bundle of the <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> in a drawer next to his bed. Two other women also said that Taylor enjoyed bondage during sex, and had bound their breasts and hands with <b>cable</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> {{consists}} of a flexible nylon tape with an integrated gear rack, and on one end a ratchet within a small open case. Once the pointed tip of the <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> has been pulled through the case and past the ratchet, it {{is prevented from being}} pulled back; the resulting loop may only be pulled tighter. This allows several cables to be bound together into a cable bundle and/or to form a cable tree.|$|R

There was no evidence of a sexual assault, but the absence of her jacket and boots and the position of her underwear were among forensic evidence indicating a sexual motive.

Ana finds Christian attractive as well as intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview and leaves Christian's office believing it went poorly. Ana does not expect to meet Christian again, but he appears at the hardware store where she works. While he purchases various items including <b>cable</b> <b>ties,</b> masking tape, and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to illustrate her article about him. Christian gives Ana his phone number. Later, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend, José Rodriguez.|$|E

25|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>tie,</b> {{also known}} as a zip tie or tie-wrap, is a type of fastener, {{especially}} for binding several electronic cables or wires together and to organize cables and wires.

The <b>cable</b> <b>tie,</b> originally known as the Ty-Rap, was invented in 1958 by Maurus C. Logan, who worked for many years at Thomas & Betts.

When asked why he had abducted Tiernan, he replied: [...] "I have no idea". When police challenged his version of taking the body to Lindley Woods soon after the murder, he claimed that he had first kept the body hidden underneath pallets in his back garden, and then stored her inside his sofa.|$|R

This is a prospective case series of patients with complex anal fistula i. e. recurrent fistula or encircling > 30 % of external anal sphincter, managed with <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> seton from March 2003 to March 2009. Patients were seen in the clinic after 72 hours of seton insertion under anesthesia and then every other week.

Seventy nine patients were treated {{during the study period}} with the age (mean ± standard deviation) of 41 ± 10. 6 years and. The seton was tightened with a median of six times (3 – 15 times range). Complete healing was achieved in 11. 2 ± 5. 7 weeks.

40|$|Premise of the study: Dendrometer {{bands are}} a useful {{way to make}} {{sequential}} repeated measurements of tree growth, but traditional dendrometer bands can be expensive, time consuming, and difficult to construct in the field. An alternative to the traditional method of band construction is to adapt commercially available materials. This paper describes how to construct and install dendrometer bands using smooth-edged, stainless steel, <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> banding and attachable rollerball heads. Methods and Results: As a performance comparison, both traditional and <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> dendrometer bands were installed on baldcypress trees at the National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, Louisiana, by both an experienced and a novice worker. Band installation times were recorded, and growth of the trees as estimated by the two band types was measured after approximately one year, demonstrating equivalence of the two methods. Conclusions: This efficient approach to dendrometer band construction can help advance the knowledge of long-term tree growth in ecological studies...|$|R
