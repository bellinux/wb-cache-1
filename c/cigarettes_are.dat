5|$|Those {{who have}} hard {{currency}} can easily buy imported cigarettes from hard currency shops, although these will also stock the best domestic brands (such as Pak Ma, comparable in quality to makhorka) to convince tourists {{of the quality}} of North Korean tobacco. <b>Cigarettes</b> <b>are</b> popular gifts, and tourists are recommended to give Western brand cigarettes to tour guides.

5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol <b>cigarettes</b> <b>are</b> virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E

50|$|In many POW camps, <b>cigarettes</b> <b>were</b> {{widely used}} as {{currency}} known as 'commodity money'. They performed {{the functions of}} money as a medium of exchange, because they were generally accepted among the prisoners for settling payments or debts, and the function of money as a unit of account, because prices of other goods were {{expressed in terms of}} cigarettes. Compared with other goods, the supply of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>was</b> more stable, as they were rationed in the POW camps, and <b>cigarettes</b> <b>were</b> more divisible, portable, and homogeneous.|$|R

25|$|Syrian {{cigarette}} smokers tend {{to start}} smoking in their teens, either in school, amongst family members, or (for males) in military service. <b>Cigarettes</b> <b>are</b> mainly {{perceived as a}} means of stress management, coping, relaxation, and improvement in concentration.|$|E
25|$|Price {{increases}} {{on local}} brands of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>are</b> unlikely to increase illegal smuggling of foreign brands into Syria, as foreign brands are typically only bought by wealthier habitual smokers or irregular smokers. The majority smoking population (low-income habitual smokers) is therefore unlikely to supplement higher priced local brands with smuggled in foreign brands.|$|E

25|$|Most tobacco smokers begin during {{adolescence}} or early adulthood. Smoking has elements of risk-taking and rebellion, which often appeal to young people.

25|$|Before 2009, many tobacco {{companies}} made flavored tobacco packaged often in colorful candy like wrappers {{to attract new}} users, {{many of which were}} a younger audience. However these flavored cigarettes were banned on September 22, 2009 by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Despite this initiative, flavored <b>cigarettes</b> <b>are</b> still on the rise because {{tobacco companies}} change their products slightly so they are filtered or slim cigarettes, which are not banned by the act.|$|E

25|$|Smoking {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of {{recreational}} drug use. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practiced by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. <b>Cigarettes</b> <b>are</b> primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the changes}} were related to toning down more mature content as well; the two scaled back on {{references}} to Aika being assaulted by Vigaro when captured by him, and of references to Ramirez obsessively talking about Galcian in later scenes of the game. Additionally, all traces of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>are</b> removed, shops serve Loqua juice instead of alcohol, and the female character Bellena's attire is altered to be less revealing.

25|$|The active {{substances}} in tobacco, especially <b>cigarettes,</b> <b>are</b> administered by {{burning the leaves}} and inhaling the vaporized gas that results. This quickly and effectively delivers substances into the bloodstream by absorption through the alveoli in the lungs. The lungs contain some 300 million alveoli, which amounts to a surface area of over 70m2 (about {{the size of a}} tennis court). This method is not completely efficient as not all of the smoke will be inhaled, and some amount of the {{active substances}} will be lost in the process of combustion, pyrolysis. Pipe and Cigar smoke are not inhaled because of its high alkalinity, which are irritating to the trachea and lungs. However, because of its higher alkalinity (pH 8.5) compared to cigarette smoke (pH 5.3), non-ionized nicotine is more readily absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth. Nicotine absorption from cigar and pipe, however, is much less than that from cigarette smoke. Nicotine and cocaine activate similar patterns of neurons, which supports the existence of common substrates among these drugs.|$|E

500|$|Physicians in the Third Reich {{were aware}} that smoking was {{responsible}} for cardiac diseases, which {{were considered to be}} the most serious diseases resulting from smoking. Use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increasing reports of myocardial infarction in the country. In the later years of World War II, researchers considered nicotine a factor behind the coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in the Eastern Front. A pathologist of the Heer examined thirty-two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front, and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were [...] "enthusiastic smokers".
