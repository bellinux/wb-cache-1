5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E
5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> power {{directly to}} an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.|$|E

"The homemaker should approach this from a very economical standpoint," said Mary Lou Williamson {{during a recent interview}} in Oklahoma city. ...|$|R
50|$|Canned {{goods and}} <b>canning</b> <b>supplies</b> sell {{particularly}} well {{in times of}} recession due to the tendency of financially stressed individuals to engage in cocooning, a term used by retail analysts to describe the phenomenon in which people choose {{to stay at home}} instead of adding expenditures to their budget by dining out and socializing outside the home.|$|R
5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|E
5|$|Suillus brevipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, and {{it develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E
25|$|Biomechanics {{is closely}} related to engineering, because it often uses {{traditional}} engineering sciences to analyse biological systems. Some simple applications of Newtonian mechanics and/or materials sciences <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems.|$|E
50|$|Entities such as governments or cartels <b>can</b> reduce <b>supply</b> to {{the world}} market by {{limiting}} access to the supply through nationalizing oil, cutting back on production, limiting drilling rights, imposing taxes, etc. International sanctions, corruption, and military conflicts <b>can</b> also reduce <b>supply.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fattening pens can {{be outside}} or in a greenhouse. High summer {{temperatures}} and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This {{is more a}} problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a horticultural system or common lawn sprinklers) <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.|$|E
25|$|With {{concern over}} global warming, new methods for the {{thorough}} and efficient capture of CO2 are being sought out. The carbon dioxide that a carbon-fuel burning plant produces can feed into open or closed algae systems, fixing the CO2 and accelerating algae growth. Untreated sewage <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> additional nutrients, thus turning two pollutants into valuable commodities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} day {{plausible}} deniability allows the supply of arms by governments to insurgents {{without the need for}} over elaborate ruses. For example, the sheer number of AKM (an upgraded version of the AK-47 rifle) manufacturers and users in the world means that governments <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> these weapons to insurgents with plausible deniability as to exactly from where and from whom the guns were acquired.|$|E

25|$|Special guy-wired wind turbines, {{which could}} be laid on the ground within forty-five minutes when a {{hurricane}} or storm comes, were installed on Terre-de-Bas. In 2007, these seven machines could produce three million kWh a year, allowing Terre-de-Bas, and all the archipelago of les Saintes to be surplus in electricity. Thanks to this, les Saintes <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> electricity {{to the south of}} Basse-Terre (Guadeloupe).|$|E
25|$|A {{low-pressure}} compressor {{is often}} the air supply of choice for surface-supplied diving, as it is virtually unlimited {{in the amount of}} air it <b>can</b> <b>supply,</b> provided the delivery volume and pressure are adequate for the application. A low-pressure compressor can run for tens of hours, needing only refueling, periodical filter drainage and occasional running checks, and is therefore more convenient than high-pressure storage cylinders for primary air supply.|$|E
25|$|The {{short-term}} ECCS subsystem {{consists of}} two groups of six accumulator tanks, containing water blanketed with nitrogen under pressure of 10MPa, connected by fast-acting valves to the reactor. Each group <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> 50% of the maximum coolant flow to the damaged half of the reactor. The third group {{is a set of}} electrical pumps drawing water from the deaerators. The short-term pumps can be powered by the spindown of the main turbogenerators.|$|E

25|$|For larger specimens, or {{species with}} stiffer wood, bonsai artists also use {{mechanical}} devices for shaping trunks and branches. The most common are screw-based clamps, which can straighten or bend {{a part of}} the bonsai using much greater force than wiring <b>can</b> <b>supply.</b> To prevent damage to the tree, the clamps are tightened {{a little at a time}} and make their changes over a period of months or years.|$|E
25|$|However, {{nuclear power}} is {{relatively}} inflexible; although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since {{the cost of}} nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs, the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for baseload. By way of contrast, hydroelectricity <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for load following.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of using}} a set of {{switched}} capacitors, an unloaded synchronous motor <b>can</b> <b>supply</b> reactive power. The reactive power drawn by the synchronous motor {{is a function of}} its field excitation. This is referred to as a synchronous condenser. It is started and connected to the electrical network. It operates at a leading power factor and puts vars onto the network as required to support a system's voltage or to maintain the system power factor at a specified level.|$|E
