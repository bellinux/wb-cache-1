40|$|The Dutch {{practice}} of {{assessment of the}} noise reducing properties of pavements according to the CPX (<b>Close</b> <b>Proximity)</b> <b>Method</b> has revealed that relatively large differences may occur between test results produced by different CPX operators. Due to these differences road authorities are facing questions and uncertainties about the acoustical quality of the pavements tested. In order to obtain a reliable picture of the actually existing differences between the test results of the various CPX trailers and the causes for these differences a comparison test between all CPX trailers in operation in The Netherlands was executed in autumn 2008 under assignment of CROW. According to the operators and / or producers all participating trailers satisfied the requirements and specifications of {{the current version of}} ISO/CD 11819 - 2 at that time. The results of this comparison test were analysed statistically and evaluated from the perspectives of acoustics and measuring technique [2].

40|$|Road {{traffic noise}} is {{associated}} with several health problems and welfare; such as sleep disturbances and annoyance. Accordingly, it becomes essential to characterize road noise not only based on acoustic indicators, but also based on psychoacoustic indicators. The acoustic indicators are required to assure compliance with European legislation and to define vehicle detection thresholds, the psychoacoustic indicators describe better annoyance rates. In this context, this work aimed to explore tyre-road noise measurements acquired on eight road pavements at eight speeds, {{from the point of}} view of psychoacoustics. In the analysis three psychoacoustic indicators (Loudness, Sharpness, Roughness) and one acoustic indicator (LAmax) were determined on 64 tyre-road noise samples acquired through the <b>Close</b> <b>Proximity</b> <b>Method</b> (CPX). It was confirmed that all psychoacoustic indicators are appropriated to describe tyre-road noise. This work was financed by FEDER grants through the Operational Competitiveness Program – COMPETE and ON. 2 – Novo Norte (Programa Operacional Regional do Norte 2007 / 2013) integrated in the structural funds QREN and the project PEst-OE/ECI/UI 4047 / 2014 supported by Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology...|$|E
40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{introduced}} to describe acoustical properties of road pavements in situ, such as the extended surface technique (Adrienne), the Statistical Pass-By and <b>Close</b> <b>Proximity</b> <b>methods.</b> In general the aim of these techniques, normed in ISO standards, is to evaluate some indexes that may be representative of noise generation and propagation with respect to tyre-road interaction and surface absorption. In this paper we use results obtained in the LEOPOLDO project, that involves measurements carried out on many sites all over Tuscany Region characterized by typical conditions of Italian roads, to review the state-of-the-art of acoustical parameters in the modeling of road vehicles showed in the HARMONOISE documents. This task has been accomplished by comparing the theoretical results obtained from the HARMONOISE prediction method with the energy levels measured at the microphone locations close to the road borders, in order to apply corrections to the parameters influencing sound generation and propagation. As a consequence, we introduce a new parameter, related to transfer function between source and receiver sound energy levels, which involves ground reflection effects, obtaining a more suitable characterization of road surface acoustical behaviour...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} the influence of the road surfaces characteristics on the emission of noise by road traffic is the so-called <b>Close</b> <b>Proximity</b> (CPX) <b>method,</b> which measures the noise emission of the tyre-road contact in the near field of a sound radiating tyre. These measurements are executed with CPX measurement trailers. Experience in the Netherlands and in other European countries has shown that CPX measurements may suffer from a relatively large measurement uncertainty. In order to quantify the actual measurement uncertainty for the Dutch CPX trailers and to develop guidelines for further reduction of the measurement uncertainty a round robin test was held in the Netherlands in 2008. In 2011 this investigation was repeated and enlarged by the participation of three CPXtrailers from other European countries...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{eliminate}} the noise of the vehicle after measuring the friction noise obtained from the NCPX (Noble <b>Close</b> <b>ProXimity)</b> <b>method.</b> The pure friction noise between the tire and road pavement could be determined from filtering the compositeness of sound and the influence of the vehicle noise. METHODS: The noise magnitude could be determined by analyzing the sound pressure level (SPL) and sound power level (PWL) along with the noise frequency of a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis as well as CPB (Constant Percentage Bandwidth) analysis. RESULTS: When the test for measuring the friction noise originated somewhere between tire and road pavement is performed with NCPX method, it must be fulfilled by attaching the surface microphone near the tire. In this condition, the surface microphone can measure the friction noise occurred at between tire and pavement, the chassis noise from the engine and power transfer units, the fluctuating aerodynamic noise, and the turbulence noise directly affected to the surface microphone. By using the NCPX method, the noise occurred at the vehicle must be eliminated for measuring the friction noise between tire and pavement from the traffic noise. CONCLUSIONS: The vehicle's testing engine noise depends on the vehicle and road types. The effect of vehicle's engine noise is less tha...|$|E

In this early stage, it aims at establishing guidelines for decision makers {{to support their}} noise reduction policies {{and the development of}} a classification system adapted to the European recommendations. A ranking to provide guidance on tire-road noise emission levels for immediate use by decision makers, road authorities, contracting parties and environmental officers will be established. This research was based on the results provided by three early studies covering more than ten different surfaces, among which, rubberized asphalt and experimental non conventional surfaces with optimized grading. On each road trial, the tire-road noise generated by light vehicles and heavy trucks at three speed levels were measured by means of the Controlled Pass-By method (CPB). Three of these runs were also tested by the <b>Close</b> <b>ProXimity</b> <b>method</b> (CPX). Additionally, tests to characterize texture and skid resistance were performed. The early noise classification studies of road pavements focused only on the CPB tests. Three groups with similar acoustical performance were identified.

40|$|AbstractThe use of road {{surfaces}} {{with low}} noise emission characteristics {{is one of}} the actions mostly applied {{all over the world to}} decrease the number of road traffic noise annoyed people. Since many Italian roads are going to be paved with such surfaces, the LEOPOLDO project (funded by the Tuscany Region and the Italian Ministry of Transportation) was planned to check the efficacy in time of this action. Among all solutions, rubberized road surface {{is one of the}} most applied in USA, Canada, Europe and Asia. This paper describes results obtained by monitoring four rubberized surfaces one year after the laying and by evaluating the time stability of LEOPOLDO one by means of the <b>Close</b> <b>Proximity</b> <b>method</b> (CPX). All surfaces here analyzed are laid in real scenarios, so the actual efficacy of this action is evaluated. The results on the LEOPOLDO surface show spatial homogeneity, a good time stability and a significant noise emission reduction. Instead, analysis of the four rubberized surfaces shows variability in the results, probably due to the pavement installation quality, as supported by the data. Thus, the rubberized road surface looks to be a very efficient mitigation technology, providing the installation have been carried out with care and proficiency...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An active {{interference}} cancellation {{scheme is}} presented to mitigate interference between Bluetooth and {{wireless local area network}} (IEEE 802. 11 b) radios operating in <b>close</b> <b>proximity.</b> This <b>method</b> is extensible to other mutually interfering radio devices. A reference signal correlated to the original interferer is used to generate a cancellation signal by means of amplitude and phase alignment, and filtration. The filter employed emulates the coupling channel responsible for interference. An implementation of this procedure in 0. 18 - m Si-complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integrated-circuit (IC) technology is also presented. The circuits fabricated are tunable and are controlled by a closed-loop adaptive process including an error minimization method. The cancellation system designed achieves 15 – 30 dB of interference suppression for different cases. A total power of 14 mW is dissipated by the CMOS ICs designed.

40|$|The {{road traffic}} noise {{is one of}} the major {{contributors}} to environmental noise, which can cause considerable impact on public health and quality of life of populations. However, road noise raises several questions because, if on one hand is associated with several health problems and welfare, on the other hand its lack affects the detection of the sound sources, and consequently it constitutes a risk to the safety of road users. Thus, it becomes essential to classify road pavements not only based on acoustic indicators but also based on psychoacoustic indicators. Therefore, this work aims to contribute to pavement classification from the point of view of psychoacoustics. An innovative approach leading to important methodological advantages was done by using the <b>Close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>Method</b> (CPX) method to acquire tyre-road noise. This work presents the acoustic characterization of five different types of pavement by using three acoustic and psychoacoustic indicators (LAmax, LAeq and Loudness) as a function of speed. Each variable was related to the sound intensity and annoyance evaluation responses of twenty six individuals subjected to the acquired noise. As main results, loudness proved to be a more sensitive variable to vehicle speed and type of pavement than LAmax and LAeq and fits better with individual's responses...|$|E

RESULTS: The tested sections of general concrete pavement surface and two different types of rumble strips were evaluated, using 1 / 3 octave band frequency analysis and overall noise level. From the analyzed results, it can be concluded that rumble strips generate a relatively huge noise levels when compared to the concrete pavement surface.

40|$|Abstract—Current {{image-based}} {{individual human}} recognition methods, such as fingerprints, face, or iris biometric modalities generally require a cooperative subject, views from certain aspects, and physical contact or <b>close</b> <b>proximity.</b> These <b>methods</b> cannot reliably recognize non-cooperating individuals {{at a distance}} {{in the real world}} under changing environmental conditions. Gait, which concerns recognizing individuals by the way they walk, is a relatively new biometric without these disadvantages. The inherent gait characteristic of an individual makes it irreplaceable and useful in visual surveillance. In this paper, an efficient gait recognition system for human identification by extracting two features namely width vector of the binary silhouette and the MPEG- 7 -based region-based shape descriptors is proposed. In the proposed method, foreground objects i. e., human and other moving objects are extracted by estimating background information by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and subsequently, median filtering operation is performed for removing noises in the background subtracted image. A moving target classification algorithm is used to separate human being (i. e., pedestrian) from other foreground objects (viz., vehicles). Shape and boundary information is used in the moving target classification algorithm. Subsequently, width vector of the outer contour of binary silhouette and the MPEG- 7 Angular Radial Transform coefficients are taken as the feature vector. Next, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the selected feature vector to reduce its dimensionality. These extracted feature vectors are used to train an Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for identification of some individuals. The proposed system is evaluated using some gait sequences and the experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

The objective {{of this study is to}} design a motion based detection and tracking multiple walking pedestrians randomly in different directions. In our proposed method, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to determine moving persons in image sequences. It reacts to changes that take place in the scene like different illumination; moving objects start and stop often, etc. Background noise in the scene is eliminated through applying morphological operations and the motions of tracked people which is determined by using the Kalman filter. The Kalman filter is applied to predict the tracked location in each frame and to determine the likelihood of each detection. We used a benchmark data set for the evaluation based on a side wall stationary camera.
