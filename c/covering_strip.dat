50|$|A {{strip search}} is a {{practice}} of searching a person for weapons or other contraband suspected of being hidden on their body or inside their clothing, and not found by performing a frisk search, by requiring the person to remove {{some or all of}} his or her clothing. The search may involve an official performing an Intimate Person Search and inspecting their personal effects and body cavities (mouth, vagina, anus etc.). A strip search is more intrusive than a frisk and requires legal authority. Regulations <b>covering</b> <b>strip</b> searches vary considerably, and may be mandatory in some situations or discretionary in others.|$|E
5000|$|The shield {{was made}} principally from wood, now perished, to a design later {{known as a}} [...] "Gaulish Shield" [...] that {{originated}} {{in the seventh century}} BC. What remains is an almost complete facing that had been made to cover its surface. The sheeting is 0.2-0.3 mm thick and was designed to be applied to a wooden backing estimated at 8 mm thick. There are two main sheets that meet at the midpoint of the shield. Each of these sheets is just over one metre long. The join is not neat, and it is hidden from view by a <b>covering</b> <b>strip.</b> The shield is decorated with a central spindle boss, on which are pieces of red coral that are thought to have come from the Mediterranean area.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the Mixtec writing system is unknown, but other Mesoamerican pre-Columbian writing systems, {{such as that of}} the Aztecs, are found to have similar traits. The Mixtec writing system is found on codices dating to the Post-Classic period {{preceding}} the arrival of the Europeans in 1520 AD. The Mixtec codices are writings recorded on decorated strips of bark and animal hide. The term codex (singular) is usually applied to bound books, though scholars use it to refer to Mesoamerican writings. The codices are constructed by folding bark over to form an accordion-like book, or by <b>covering</b> <b>strips</b> of bark and leather with plaster to form a smooth writing surface.|$|R

40|$|Given a set {{of objects}} with {{durations}} (jobs) that cover a base region, can we schedule the jobs to maximize the duration the original region remains covered? We call this problem the sensor cover problem. This problem arises {{in the context of}} covering a region with sensors. For example, suppose you wish to monitor activity along a fence by sensors placed at various fixed locations. Each sensor has a range and limited battery life. The problem is to schedule when to turn on the sensors so that the fence is fully monitored for as long as possible. This one dimensional problem involves intervals on the real line. Associating a duration to each yields {{a set of}} rectangles in space and time, each specified by a pair of fixed horizontal endpoints and a height. The objective is to assign a position to each rectangle to maximize the height at which the spanning interval is fully covered. We call this one dimensional problem restricted <b>strip</b> <b>covering.</b> If we replace the covering constraint by a packing constraint, the problem is identical to dynamic storage allocation, a scheduling problem that is a restricted case of the strip packing problem. We show that the restricted <b>strip</b> <b>covering</b> problem is NP-hard and present an O(log log n) -approximation algorithm. We present better approximations or exact algorithms for some special cases. For the uniform-duration case of restricted <b>strip</b> <b>covering</b> we give a polynomial-time, exact algorithm but prove that the uniform-duration case for higher-dimensional regions is NP-hard. Finally, we consider regions that are arbitrary sets, and we present an O(log n) -approximation algorithm. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

The bug skipped through mud where the Boltwoods' Gomez had slogged and rolled. Its pilot drove up behind her car, and leaped out. He trotted forward to Claire and Zolzac. His eyes were twenty-seven or eight, but his pink cheeks were twenty, and when he smiled--shyly, radiantly--he was no age at all, but eternal boy. Claire had a blurred impression {{that she had seen}} him before, some place along the road.|$|R

50|$|In September 1900, {{the great}} {{hurricane}} struck and Ball High School was not spared from {{the fury of}} its waves and wind. The west wall slipped; the roof blew off; plaster crumbled; windowpanes crashed; and the metal <b>covering</b> was <b>stripped</b> from the ball of the dome, showing its skeleton of steel ribs. In the storm's aftermath, citizens of the City of Galveston contributed and raised the $45,000 required to repair {{the high school and}} the other Galveston schools and also to pay the teacher's salaries. Because of the devastating loss of life and property during the storm, school attendance decreased by some 25 percent, creating an excess of teachers. Other Texas communities came to the rescue in many ways, perhaps most importantly by providing jobs to these Galveston teachers whose services were no longer needed in the island community.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recent product {{development}} has focussed on developing {{a range of}} higher strength structural grades, <b>covering</b> the <b>strip</b> thickness range 0. 9 - 1. 5 mm, utilising Nb microalloying. A wide range of Nb levels have been successfully strip cast by the CASTRIP ® process. Niobium was found to retard austenite grain refinement and substantially enhanced hardenability, which produced significant microstructural hardening and higher strength hot band. Niobium was retained in solid solution enabling further significant strengthening to be achieved from an age hardening heat treatment. Strength levels ranging from 400 MPa to in excess of 550 MPa, in combination with high ductility, were achieved in the age hardened and hot dip galvanised condition, utilising the annealing furnaces of a conventional hot dip galvanising line. The effect of microalloying content and processing conditions on the microstructure and final mechanical properties of Nb microalloyed UCS products produced by the CASTRIP process are described...|$|R

Its main objective is to produce a forest map of China using Interferometric Land-Use (ILU) images generated from ERS tandem data with the Interferometric Quick-Look (IQL) processor. The generation of a large-scale forest map requires solving problems such as the georeferencing and mosaicking of very long image <b>strips</b> <b>covering</b> huge regions and the adaptation of the classification algorithm to account for radiometric differences.

50|$|The {{cultivation}} process involves {{removal of}} weeds, applying insecticides, covering the fruits with plastics to prevent loss due to close contact, also enclosing the bananas with plastic bags filled with insecticide, protecting plant stocks by <b>covering</b> them with <b>strips</b> of plastic coated with insecticide, removal {{of yellow and}} dead leaves, and providing support by propping up the plants with wooden stakes. The growth phases are monitored by tying coloured bands to the stalks. Thus, there are three stages of monitoring which are: harvesting fruit-laden stalks, transporting them to the packing plant, cutting the remaining stems after harvest.|$|R
2500|$|Appointed {{chief of}} staff of the 165th Regiment, Donovan fought in another battle that took place near Landres-et-Saint-Georges on October 14–15, 1918. Going into battle, Donovan [...] "ignored the officers' custom of <b>covering</b> or <b>stripping</b> off {{insignia}} of rank (targets for snipers) and instead sallied forth wearing his medals", according to Evan Thomas. [...] "They can't hit me and they won't hit you!" [...] he told his men. Struck in the knee by a bullet, he [...] "refused to be evacuated and continued to direct his men until even American tanks were turning back under withering German fire." [...] After lobbying by his friend Father Francis Duffy, a famous and widely revered Army chaplain, Donovan was awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster{to what medal?} for his service in that battle. After the Armistice, Donovan remained in Europe as part of the occupation. On returning to New York in April 1919, Donovan, now a colonel, was widely discussed as a possible candidate for governor, but he rejected the idea, proclaiming his intention to return to Buffalo and resume the practice of law.|$|R

Many authors have pro-duced more robust versions of this estimator by replacing the square by something else, such as the absolute value. In this article a different approach is introduced in which the sum is replaced by the median of the squared resid-uals. The resulting estimator can resist the effect of nearly 50 % of contamination in the data. In the special case of simple regression, it corresponds to finding the narrowest <b>strip</b> <b>covering</b> half of the observations.
