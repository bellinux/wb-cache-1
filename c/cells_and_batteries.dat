2500|$|As the {{broadcasting}} {{time was}} limited, {{it was decided}} that the direct reception receivers would only be installed in 2400 villages in six regions spread across the country. Technical and social criteria were used to select suitable areas to conduct this experiment. A computer program was specially designed at ISRO to help make this selection. As one of the aims of the experiment was to study the potential of TV as a medium of development, the villages were chosen specifically for their backwardness. According to the 1971 census of India, the states having the most number of backward districts in the country were Orissa, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Karnataka. Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were eventually left out, as they were slated to get terrestrial television by the time SITE would end. SITE was launched in twenty districts spread across the other six states. Each of the states thus selected was called a [...] "cluster". In each cluster, 3–4 districts, each containing around 1000 villages, were identified. Finally, around 400 villages were chosen in each cluster. Close to 80% villages selected for SITE did not have electricity in the buildings where the SITE TV sets would be installed. A special project called Operation Electricity was launched to urgently electrify the villages before the start of SITE. 150 villages would have television sets running on solar <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> <b>batteries.</b> These sets were specially designed by Indian engineers with help from NASA.|$|E

No warming-up process and free from carno cycle, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle(FCEV) has a high energy convert efficiency and is friendly to environment. Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle does not have these advantages. At the same time FCEV still keeps the acceleration performance, high speed, long distance running, safety and comfort as traditional IC Engine Vehicle. Fuel cell is the power source of a Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle, it converts the chemistry energy into electric energy directly, and then the electric energy drive the electrical machine to make the vehicle move. FCEV's complete power train has four kinds of propulsion mode, they are fuel cell(FC) mode, fuel <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> <b>battery</b> mode(FC+B), fuel <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> capacitance(FC+C) mode <b>and</b> fuel <b>cell</b> <b>and</b> <b>battery</b> <b>and</b> capacitance(FC+B+C) mode.

On this exciting perspective, fuel <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> flow <b>batteries</b> play a key role, the former in converting energy into propulsion, the latter in storing renewable energy surplus. Nevertheless, some main technological issues still must be overcome, such as limited peak performances often caused by poor fluid-mechanic efficiency.
