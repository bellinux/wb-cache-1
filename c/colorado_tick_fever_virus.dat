40|$|From 1974 to 1989, sera from {{symptomatic}} {{patients with}} histories of recent travel outside Canada were tested for antibodies to several arboviruses, principally of the alphavirus and flavivirus families. Diagnostic seroconversions were documented in 84 individuals from six provinces, including one alphavirus (Chikungunya) and 83 flavivirus seroconvertors. Dengue 1 virus was {{isolated from the}} blood of one patient. Most flavivirus seroconvertors were likely infected with dengue virus, but infections with tick-borne encephalitis, St Louis encephalitis and Powassan viruses were also recognized. Patients had histories of recent travel to the Caribbean, South America, Asia, Africa, North America (outside Canada), Tahiti, Fiji and Europe.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in DUB/ICR mice with minute virus of mice (MVM), a single stranded DNA <b>virus,</b> and <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> (CTF) <b>virus,</b> a double stranded RNA Virus, to determine if CTF virus had teratogenic potential and to characterize further MVM and its teratogenic effects. MVM is a known teratogen, whereas CTF virus had never been investigated previously for teratogenic potential. In characterization studies of MVM infectivity, the following were determined: (a) Rat embryo cells proved to be superior to six cell lines in assaying for MVM infectivity; (b) MVM infectivity could be inactivated with common laboratory disinfectants, ultraviolet radiation, temperatures 45 C to 100 C, and acid treatment: although in some cases a resistant population of MVM was detected; (0) MVM was relatively stable at 4 C and was very stable when stored in liquid nitrogen; (d) In the infected mouse, MVM {{was found to be}} firmly associated with the erythrocyte fraction of the blood; (e) MVM was a poor inducer of interferon, but was sensitive to the action of interferon. In teratogenic studies with MVM infection in mice, incidences of 5 % stillbirths and 12 to 25 % neonatal deaths were noted. In addition, between 77 % to 91 % of fetuses, and up to 51 % of surviving neonates (to four weeks of age) had detectable MVM. Growth rates, weight gains, and developmental characteristics were normal for mice delivered of mothers inoculated with MVM. Teratogenic studies with <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> (CTF) <b>virus</b> infection in mice revealed a high incidence of stillbirths (6 to 45 %) and neonatal deaths (26 to 50 %). CTF was demonstrated to cross the placenta and to replicate in the placenta and fetus and could be isolated from stillborns, newborns, and dead neonates. Several developmental aberrations were noted in neonates; however, there was no weight nor growth rate abnormality noted in the survivors. The teratogenic effects of CTF virus were inhibited significantly by neutralization with specific CTF antiserum, proving that the teratogenic effects seen were due to CTF virus...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{strains of}} <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> (CTF) <b>virus,</b> {{isolated}} from ticks, mammals and humans, and two antigenic relatives of CTF virus were compared in cross-neutralization tests. Viruses were tested using single-inoculation sera prepared in hamsters. Antigenic variation, {{as measured by}} differences detected in the neutral-ization test, was noted among the virus isolates identified as strains of CTF virus. The virus strains isolated from humans appeared to vary the most in serological reactions. The two antigenic relatives of CTF virus are clearly distinct from strains of CTF and are different from each other. Antigenic relationships between these two viruses were established using two sets of single-inoculation a tisera nd both complement fixation and neutralization tests. Six distinct antigenic variants of CTF virus isolated from humans and the virus strain from ticks (75 V 1906) that showed the least antigenic variation, were tested against 49 coded serum pairs from clinically diagnosed cases of CTF.

25|$|Coltivirus is a genus {{of viruses}} (belonging to the Reoviridae family) that infects vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. It {{includes}} the causative agent of Colorado tick fever. <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> {{can cause a}} fever, chills, headache, photophobia, myalgia, arthralgia, and lethargy.

25|$|The main {{species of}} Coltivirus, <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (CTF), infects the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). This species of tick {{can be found}} in areas with shrubs, lightly wooded locations, grasslands, and on hiking or biking trails. All life stages of this tick can infect {{vertebrates}} with <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (larva, nymph, and adult). Unfortunately, mature D. andersoni prefer to feed on medium or large mammals that are walking around the knee-high plants. Oftentimes, this infection takes place when the tick larvae feed on rodents, like squirrels, that are already infected with virus. The tick's saliva then contains the virus, and it becomes infectious for life. The adult tick then transmits the virus to humans through a bite, where it infects bone marrow cells.|$|E
25|$|For diagnosis, the {{erythrocytes}} can {{be isolated}} by injecting {{them into a}} tissue culture and {{checking to see if}} they are infected. Also, the antigen for <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> can be identified using the immunofluorescence microscopy. In this method, the antigens {{on the surface of the}} erythrocytes are marked with fluorescence and examined under a fluorescence microscope.|$|E
40|$|Of {{more than}} 500 arboviruses {{recognized}} worldwide, 5 were first isolated in Canada and 58 were first {{isolated in the}} United States. Six of these viruses are human pathogens: western equine encephalitis (WEE) and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and Powassan (POW) viruses (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), LaCrosse (LAC) virus (Bunyaviridae, Bunyavirus), and <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> (CTF) <b>virus</b> (Reoviridae, Coltivirus). Their scientific histories, geographic distributions, virology, epidemiology, vectors, vertebrate hosts, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical and differential diagnoses, control, treatment, and laboratory diagnosis are reviewed. In addition, mention is made of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), which periodically cause human and equine disease in North America. WEE, EEE, and SLE viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes between birds; POW and CTF viruses, between wild mammals by ticks; LAC virus, between small mammals by mosquitoes; and VEE viruses, between small or large mammals by mosquitoes. Human infections are tangential to the natural cycle. Such infections range from rare to focal but are relatively frequent where they occur. Epidemics of WEE, EEE, VEE, and SLE viruses have been recorded at periodic intervals, but prevalence of infections with LAC and CTF viruses typically are constant, related {{to the degree of}} exposure to infected vectors. Infections with POW virus appear to be rare. Adequate diagnostic tools are available, but treatment is mainly supportive, and greater efforts at educating the public and the medical community are suggested if infections are to be prevented...|$|R
40|$|<b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> (CTF) <b>virus</b> elicits {{an acute}} illness in humans, {{producing}} nonspecific flu-like symptoms and a biphasic fever in approximately 50 % of patients. The disease is transmitted by the adult Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), and therefore incidence {{is limited by}} the habitat and life cycle of that vector. The early symptoms of infection are difficult to distinguish from those of several other agents, especially Rickettsia rickettsii. Serologic testing is usually unable to provide evidence of CTF viral infection during the acute phase because of the late appearance of the various antibodies. Here we report the development and clinical application of a test to diagnose this disease during the acute stages. Oligonucleotide primers to the S 2 segment of CTF (Florio) virus were made, and these were used in the amplification of a 528 -bp fragment of DNA, transcribed from the double-stranded CTF virus RNA template by reverse transcriptase PCR. RNAs processed from 16 CTF virus isolates yielded similar results when analyzed on agarose gels. These were distinguishable from their antigenic relatives Eyach, S 6 - 14 - 03, and T 5 - 2092 and from other coltiviruses and an orbivirus but not from the antigenically distinct CTF virus-related isolate 720896. A mouse model demonstrated the utility of this method with whole-blood specimens, and CTF virus was successfully detected in human sera from the initial day of the onset of symptoms to 8 days later. The reverse transcriptase PCR method is a promising tool for the early diagnosis of CTF viral infection, or for ruling out CTF virus as th...|$|R

25|$|The European Eyach {{virus and}} the <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> are known {{relatives}} due to cognate genes, 55% to 88% of amino acid similarity, and similarities at the microscopic level that cannot be distinguished. To find these similarities, a genome sequence analysis was completed. One theory {{of how the}} European Eyach virus is proposed to have come about in Europe is by the migration of lagomorphs from North America over fifty million years ago. Since then, the virus took on some differences, and is now considered its own species of virus. European Eyach virus was isolated in 1976 from Ixodes ricinus ticks in Europe and in 1981 from the same species along with Ixodes ventalloi in 1981.|$|E

We designed a multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction system {{that allowed the}} simultaneous and specific amplification of three genomic segments from as little as 0. 01 plaque-forming units. Another system in the S 2 viral segment permitted the differential diagnosis of American and European viral isolates. We also discuss some improvements of previous ELISAs, and the results obtained with paired sera from <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> (CTF) virus– infected individuals. Western blot analysis was developed that allowed the detection of antibodies to a 38 -kD viral protein in all tested sera. It also enabled the detection of anti-CTF virus antibodies in ELISA-negative sera. Specific IgM antibodies against a synthetic viral peptide could be detected in sera at the acute stage of the infection. Together, these results should permit the diagnosis of Coltivirus infection at any stage of the pathology. <b>Colorado</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> (CTF) is a severe tick-borne disease that is usually self-limited.
