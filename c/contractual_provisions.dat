25|$|Linked to this {{category}} {{is the problem}} of unincorporated associations. Unincorporated associations cannot hold rights (chattels or land) on their own account. When they dissolve, the question is then what to do with property that has been transferred to the association. The traditional view, as laid out in Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, is that the members of the association hold these rights on purpose trust. Where the money was raised from identified individuals, the property should be held on resulting trust for donors upon the failure of the purpose trust. Where it is impossible or impractical, the property should be passed to the Crown as bona vacantia. The more modern view developed from Walton J's judgment in Re Bucks Constabulary Benevolent Fund. This is that dissolving a society and distributing property to its members is a matter of contract, not trusts law. As such, the contract between the association's members should be the deciding factor in how the property is to be distributed, and {{there is no need to}} involve resulting trusts. If the <b>contractual</b> <b>provisions</b> identify how to distribute property, they will be followed; if not, the property will be distributed according to an implied term, usually in equal shares.|$|E

2500|$|Where the Wilko Court, {{rather than}} those misinterpreting it, had {{significantly}} erred, Gaitis wrote, was in confusing restricted and unrestricted arbitration submissions. [...] "The catalyst for that error {{appears to be the}} unfounded supposition that to determine whether there are any restrictions on the scope of the arbitral tribunals' authority, an arbitration provision contained within a contract must be examined in utter isolation without giving consideration to other significant <b>contractual</b> <b>provisions,</b> particularly including a choice of law clause." [...] Wilko's agreement with Hayden Stone had specified that the 1934 Act controlled, but the Court, having read the arbitration clause in isolation {{from the rest of the}} contract, decided that that language probably included the 1933 Act as well, since the arbitration clause had not specified any controlling law for the procedure. By thus suggesting that an unrestricted submission was subject to the [...] "manifest disregard" [...] principle for vacatur, the Court contradicted the precedent it was relying on. [...] "Under the very cases cited by the Wilko Court," [...] Gaitis observed, [...] "arbitrators acting under an unrestricted submission are free to manifestly and knowingly disregard the law should they elect to resolve the ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{specific}} contracts, such {{as those}} for sales of goods, between a landlord and tenant, or in employment, the courts imply standardised contractual terms (or terms [...] "implied in law"). Such terms set out a menu of [...] "default rules" [...] that generally apply in absence of true agreement to the contrary. In one instance of partial codification, the Sale of Goods Act 1893 summed up all the standard <b>contractual</b> <b>provisions</b> in typical commercial sales agreements developed by the common law. This is now updated in the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and in default of people agreeing something different in general its terms will apply. For instance, under section 12-14, any contract for sale of goods carries the implied terms that the seller has legal title, that it will match prior descriptions {{and that it is}} of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. Similarly the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 section 13 says services must be performed with reasonable care and skill. As a matter of common law the test is what terms are a [...] "necessary incident" [...] to the specific type of contract in question. This test derives from Liverpool City Council v Irwin where the House of Lords held that, although fulfilled on the facts of the case, a landlord owes a duty to tenants in a block of flats to keep the common parts in reasonable repair. In employment contracts, multiple standardised implied terms arise also, even before statute comes into play, for instance to give employees adequate information to make a judgment about how to take advantage of their pension entitlements. The primary standardised employment term is that both employer and worker owe one another an obligation of [...] "mutual trust and confidence". Mutual trust and confidence can be undermined in multiple ways, primarily where an employer's repulsive conduct means a worker can treat herself as being constructively dismissed. In Mahmud and Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA the House of Lords held the duty was breached by the employer running the business as a cover for numerous illegal activities. The House of Lords has repeated that the term may always be excluded, but this has been disputed because unlike a contract for goods or services among commercial parties, an employment relation is characterised by unequal bargaining power between employer and worker. In Johnstone v Bloomsbury Health Authority the Court of Appeal all held that a junior doctor could not be made to work at an average of 88 hours a week, even though this was an express term of his contract, where it would damage his health. However, one judge said that result followed from application of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, one judge said it was because at common law express terms could be construed in the light of implied terms, and one judge said implied terms may override express terms. Even in employment, or in consumer affairs, English courts remain divided {{about the extent to which}} they should depart from the basic paradigm of contractual freedom, that is, in absence of legislation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{governing}} documents may {{be limited}} by public policy, and state or federal statutes. However, in some cases because of the constitutional prohibition against [...] "impairment of contract," [...] a covenant provision may [...] "trump" [...] a statute. This occurs where a later-enacted statute adversely affects a substantive <b>contractual</b> <b>provision</b> that existed before the statute was enacted. Predictably, {{there is also an}} exception to the exception; a <b>contractual</b> <b>provision</b> that is rendered illegal by later enacted state or federal law cannot be constitutionally protected. For example, a developer-drafted covenant giving the developer sole rights to amend the CC&Rs was declared unenforceable as a matter of public policy in at least one state, where the developer attempted to amend years after he had sold all the property. That state's legislature later codified that public policy. [...] Racial exclusions covenants have been ruled to be unconstitutional and unenforceable.

50|$|All law, {{including}} {{the common law}} of contract, is subject to constitutional control. The Constitution therefore exerts a strong if indirect influence {{on the law of}} contract: ‘The principles of administrative justice frame the contractual relationship, it has been said, and the Constitution requires that all administrative action must be lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair’. To what extent the Constitution can be invoked directly to challenge the validity of a <b>contractual</b> <b>provision</b> between private parties is a contentious question. The Constitutional Court appears to prefer an indirect application of the Constitution between private parties: an approach that tests the validity of a private <b>contractual</b> <b>provision</b> against the requirements of public policy, but also recognises that public policy is now determined with reference to the fundamental values embodied in the Constitution, and particularly in the Bill of Rights. The courts have shown a willingness to intervene if a party exercises a contractual power in a manner that fails to respect the constitutional rights of another party, and may even, in appropriate circumstances, be willing to compel one party to contract with another on constitutional grounds.|$|R

50|$|If an {{employer}} dismisses an employee without legally required notice then the employee {{is usually not}} bound by restrictive covenants (increasingly though courts treat pay in lieu of notice as curing lack of notice).

40|$|Inclement {{weather is}} a major risk in {{construction}} project delay. Employers could transfer such weather risk to contractors by deleting the corresponding <b>contractual</b> <b>provision</b> for extension {{of time in the}} contract, but in return, the tender sums would be inflated to reflect the costs of this risk. Previous studies have provided very little guidance for employers to assess the costs involved in such risk transfer. Therefore, knowledge of contractors' pricing behaviour for weather risk becomes essential in the optimization of contract cost. This study aims at finding out contractors' behavioural pattern in pricing weather risk in tenders by investigating the relationships among their risk perceptions, attitudes and behaviours. With questionnaire data collected from different size groups of building contractors in Hong Kong, their behaviours are analyzed statistically. The results reveal that the risk-pricing behaviours of contractors of various sizes are different and smaller contractors are more willing to absorb weather risks in tenders. It is generally more cost efficient for employers to delete the <b>contractual</b> <b>provision</b> for extension of time due to inclement weather as contractors' allowance of weather-caused delays (in monetary terms) in tenders is less than the actual number of days of inclement weather obtained from weather records.
