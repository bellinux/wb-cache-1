5|$|M1 {{is similar}} to M2, but {{somewhat}} smaller. The ectoflexus is less apparent, the stylar shelf is narrower, there is no crest behind the metaconule, and the lingual <b>cingulum</b> is continuous. The condition of the parastyle more closely resembles that in Afrotarsius.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} lower molar, the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are {{separated}} by an anteromedian fossette. The second lower molar bears a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps, the protoconid and metaconid, that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (anterolabial <b>cingulum)</b> at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The third lower molar also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial <b>cingulum.</b> The first lower molar has large roots at the front and back of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one at the front and one at the back.|$|E
5|$|The anterolabial <b>cingulum</b> and anteroconid {{are both}} absent on m3. The mesolophid is usually absent. As in m2, {{there are two}} roots at the front in A.donovani and only one in A.praeuniversitatis, but the front roots are usually fused in A.donovani.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro mahabo is a mammal {{from the}} middle Jurassic (about 167 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species of the genus Ambondro, it is known from a fragmentary lower jaw with three teeth, {{interpreted}} as the last premolar and the first two molars. The premolar consists of a central cusp {{with one or two}} smaller cusps and a <b>cingulum</b> (shelf) on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth. The molars also have such a lingual <b>cingulum.</b> They consist of two groups of cusps: a trigonid of three cusps at the front and a talonid with a main cusp, a smaller cusp, and a crest at the back. Features of the talonid suggest that Ambondro had tribosphenic molars, the basic arrangement of molar features also present in marsupial and placental mammals. It is the oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic teeth; {{at the time of its}} discovery it antedated the second oldest example by about 25 million years.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Swiss {{zoologist}} Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major {{suggested the}} inclusion of O. johnstoni in the extinct giraffid subfamily Palaeotraginae. However, the species was placed in its own subfamily Okapiinae, by Swedish palaeontologist Birger Bohlin in 1926, mainly {{due to the lack}} of a <b>cingulum,</b> a major feature of the palaeotragids. In 1986, Okapia was finally established as a sister genus of Giraffa on the basis of cladistic analysis. The two genera together with Palaeotragus constitute the tribe Giraffini.|$|E
5|$|There is no anteroconid in m2 and {{the tooth}} lacks an {{additional}} crest (the anterolophid) {{in front of}} the metaconid, but there is an anterolabial <b>cingulum</b> {{in front of the}} protoconid. There is a mesolophid. In addition to a large root at the back, there are two roots at the front in A.donovani, which are sometimes partially fused, but only one in A.praeuniversitatis.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell {{and colleagues}} in their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and monotremes, but argued that Ambondro was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior <b>cingulum</b> in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and the contrast between the talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Zhe-Xi Luo {{and colleagues}} {{alternatively}} proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare Figure 3, top)—once {{giving rise to}} the marsupials and placentals (Boreosphenida), and once producing Ambondro, the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos, and the living monotremes, which {{first appeared in the}} Cretaceous (united as Australosphenida). They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a <b>cingulum</b> on the outer front corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.|$|E
5|$|Isolated lower premolars {{are known}} from I.kamlialensis. A p3, YGSP 33157, {{resembles that of}} YGSP 32727 in {{possessing}} a single large cusp connected to crests at the front and back. A heel is present at the back, part of a small talonid. The tooth has two roots. The p4, represented by YGSP 24338, is an elongate, two-rooted tooth with a distinct trigonid at the front and talonid at the back. The protoconid is the highest cusp of the trigonid. Two crests descend from it at right angles in a lingual direction (towards the inner side of the tooth): the protolophid towards the front, ending at the low paraconid, and the metalophid towards the back, reaching the elongate metaconid. The talonid basin is open lingually; on the labial side, the hypoconid cusp is present. A crest, the cristid obliqua, reaches from the hypoconid forward towards the trigonid. No other cusps are visible in the talonid, but the specimen is worn and poorly preserved; the posterolophid, a crest descending from the hypoconid, may end in a small hypoconulid. A weak <b>cingulum</b> is present on the labial side of the tooth between the protoconid and hypoconid. Another tooth, YGSP 32151, is interpreted as a dp4. It has a more closed trigonid (with the protolophid and metalophid making a more acute angle), the protolophid is shorter, and the paraconid is indistinct. In the talonid, the hypoconulid and entoconid are distinct. The labial <b>cingulum</b> is strong.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus zapfei can be {{identified}} as a Miniopterus {{on the basis of}} the possession of three lower premolars (designated p2, p3, and p4, because the original first premolar has been lost); a two-rooted p3; and the nyctalodont molars, with the posterolophid (a crest at the back of the molar) behind the entoconid cusp. M.zapfei is about 30% larger than M.fossilis and has a more slender p4. Compared to living Miniopterus, the <b>cingulum</b> (shelf) that surrounds the P4 is less well-developed and the parastyle crest is weaker.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus zapfei is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus {{from the middle}} Miocene of France. First {{described}} in 2002, it is known only {{from the site of}} La Grive M, where it occurs with another fossil Miniopterus species, the smaller and more common Miniopterus fossilis. M.zapfei is known from five mandibles (lower jaws) and an isolated fourth upper premolar (P4). The fourth lower premolar is more slender than in M.fossilis and the <b>cingulum</b> shelf surrounding the P4 is less well-developed than in living Miniopterus. The length of the first lower molar is 1.57 to 1.60mm.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Luo {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a more thorough}} analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian Bishops to Australosphenida. They mentioned {{the condition of the}} hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character and noted that Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were united, to the exclusion of Ambondro, by the presence of a V-shaped notch in the distal metacristid. In the same year, Asfaltomylos was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to Ambondro, this animal lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual <b>cingulum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} upper tooth of Indraloris is an M3, YGSP 46009. It is broken {{at the back}} labial corner. The main cusp is protocone; among the other two cusps, the paracone is higher but the metacone larger. There is a spur {{at the back of}} the protocone, {{suggesting}} a rudimentary hypocone. The protocone is connected to the paracone by a protoloph, which lacks a small cusp (the paraconule). No crest connects the protocone to the metacone, but there is a <b>cingulum</b> at the back margin of the tooth. The tooth bears a strong parastyle (accessory cusp at the front labial corner) and has three roots.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent <b>cingulum</b> (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent <b>cingulum</b> (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (<b>cingulum)</b> separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that there was no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
5|$|The anteroconid on m1 (the frontmost cusp, {{corresponding}} to the anterocone) contains an internal hollow, an anteromedian fossettid. There is an ectolophid, an accessory crest in the valley between the protoconid (the cusp on the labial side, behind the anteroconid) and the hypoconid (the cusp behind the protoconid, at the back labial corner of the tooth). On {{the other side of}} the tooth, the mesolophid (another accessory crest) is also present. On each of the lower molars, an anterolabial <b>cingulum</b> (a shelf on the front labial corner) is present. On m2 and m3, an anterolophid is present—a crest in front of the metaconid (the cusp on the front lingual corner of the tooth).|$|E
5|$|The maxillary toothrows are {{parallel}} to each other. The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests) and brachyodont (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a <b>cingulum</b> (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike {{in most of the}} closest relatives of Pennatomys, there is no additional labial root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at the front and back and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at the front and back. Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4mm.|$|E
5|$|The talonid, {{another group}} of cusps, makes {{up the back of}} the tooth. It is wider than long and {{contains}} a well-developed cusp, the hypoconid, on the outer side and a depression, the talonid basin, in the middle. The cristid obliqua connects to the hypoconid. The smaller hypoconulid cusp is present towards the inner side of the tooth, and the hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by a cutting edge which is suggestive of the presence of a metacone cusp on the upper molars. Further towards the inner side, a crest, the entocristid, rims the talonid basin; on m1, it is swollen and on m2, it contains two small cuspules, but a distinct entoconid cusp is absent. This entocristid is continuous with the lingual <b>cingulum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The upper molars of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} are triangular {{in overall}} shape and much broader than long, with the narrow {{end of the}} triangle pointing lingually. The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in D.chimaera is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species, but otherwise very similar. The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the buccal side of the tooth, the paracone and metacone, are well-developed, together forming a long W-shaped ridge. D.chimaera resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone {{and in front of}} the metacone form an acute angle with each other, so that together they form a V; their shape rather resembles an U in the Sunda colugo. A <b>cingulum</b> (shelf) is present on the buccal margin of the tooth, but this <b>cingulum</b> is rather weak in the Pakistani fossil. On the M2, smaller cusps, the paraconule and metaconule, are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone, but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and ridgelike. The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2. A third major cusp, the protocone, is present on the lingual side of both upper molars. This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos, but less so in D.chimaera. Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a buccal direction. These crests end in small cusps (protoconules) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone. The living colugos lack these protoconules. The enamel is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and, in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens, on the lingual side of the protocone. Enamel wrinkling is also seen in some Philippine colugos.|$|E
5|$|Afrasia {{is known}} from four {{isolated}} teeth: a first upper molar (M1), with {{a length of}} 2.13mm and width of 3.06mm; a second upper molar (M2), the holotype, of 2.27mm by 3.35mm; a second lower molar (m2) of 2.09mm by 1.41mm; and a third lower molar (m3) of 2.05mm by 1.27mm. Like other eosimiiforms, {{it was a small}} primate that weighed around , which is estimated based on the measurements of its m2 and M1, respectively. It is generally similar to other eosimiiforms in general and Afrotarsius in particular; some distinguishing features are the well-developed small cusps (conules) on the upper molars, the variable development of the lingual <b>cingulum</b> (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) of the upper molars, and the unreduced talonid (posterior portion) on the m3. Its teeth are smaller than those of the eosimiids Phenacopithecus, Bahinia, and Phileosimias.|$|E
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the outer front corner of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual <b>cingulum</b> is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{formula is}} , {{as in all}} lemurids. The toothcomb—a comblike {{structure}} formed by the lower front teeth, characteristic of lemurs and lorisoids—is {{similar to that of}} other lemurids. The two halves of the mandible (lower jaw) do not fuse at the mandibular symphysis. However, there are some differences in tooth morphology from the living brown and ring-tailed lemurs, similar to those between the ruffed lemurs and the other genera. In Pachylemur, the talonid basin (a basin at the back end of the lower molars) is more elongate, and it is not lined by an entoconid cusp. In the first two upper molars, the lingual <b>cingulum</b> (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) is expanded towards the front. The two species differ in details of tooth morphology. P.insignis had narrower lower premolars and molars, and the buccal (outer) cusps on these teeth are located to the front of their lingual counterparts. Relative to the ruffed lemurs, Pachylemur has more massive jaws and larger molars.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial <b>cingulum)</b> is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E
5|$|The m1 is {{long and}} narrow. The anteroconid, the cusp {{at the front of}} the tooth, is {{oriented}} perpendicularly to the main axis of the tooth and on the lingual (inner) side is separated from the metaconid cusp. The protoconid, another cusp on the labial (outer) side, is connected at its back to a longitudinal crest, which in turn anchors the transverse mesolophid crest, and then joins the hypoconid labial cusp. In front of the hypoconid, an ectostylid (a smaller cuspule) is present. The entoconid cusp, located lingually, is relatively high and is separated from the mesolophid before it by a deep valley. Another crest, the posterolophid, is present behind the hypoconid. At the front of the m2, crests known as the anterolophid and anterolabial <b>cingulum</b> are present before the protoconid and the metaconid. As on the m1, a transverse mesolophid and an ectostylid are present. The hypoconid and the entoconid are present, as is the posterolophid behind them. Within the posterolophid, there is a small valley that is absent in N.rufus. Both m1 and m2 have two roots; m3 is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The m1 is unknown. In m2, {{there are}} two {{well-developed}} transverse crests and one smaller one behind them. The first one consists of two cusps, the anteroconid (labial) and the metaconid (lingual) and the second one joins the protoconid at the labial side with the entoconid at the lingual side. The second crest is weakly joined to the third one, which joins the hypoconid at the labial side to the posteroconid at the back. In one specimen, a <b>cingulum</b> (ridge) is present {{at the back of}} the tooth and a small cusp, the ectostylid, is also present. The m3 becomes narrower towards the back, rendering its form triangular, and contains three crests. The first one again consists of the anteroconid and the metaconid and the second of the protoconid and the entoconid. The third is smaller and consists of the hypoconid with the posteroconid in one specimen, but in the other the posteroconid is reduced to a narrow crest, the posterolophid. Unlike in B.albicauda, the hypoconid remains separate from the posterolophid and is not fused to it. Both m2 and m3 have two roots.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla of Paranthodon {{preserves}} the tooth row, and {{shows that there}} is little to no overhang. This differs from ankylosaurians, where there is a large amount of overhang of the maxilla. The teeth also have a middle ridge, with five fewer prominent ridges on either side. This is similar to the size ridges seen on Kentrosaurus. Like all stegosaurians, the denticles on the teeth are rounded at the tips, in contrast to ankylosaurians. Also, like Huayangosaurus, but unlike Kentrosaurus and Stegosaurus, Paranthodon possesses a prominent buccal margination (a ridge beside the tooth row). Paranthodon teeth preserve wear, but wear is absent on most teeth, similar to Huayangosaurus, meaning it is likely that Paranthodon lacked occlusion between teeth. Paranthodon is distinguished from other stegosaurs by a long, wide, posterior process of the premaxilla, teeth in the maxilla with a very large <b>cingulum,</b> and large ridges on the tooth crowns. Not all of these features were considered valid in a 2008 review of Stegosauria, with the only autapomorphy found being the possession of a partial second bony palate on the maxilla.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris molars {{are short}} and {{organized}} in two main lophs (lobes). They differ from Sivaladapis teeth in being shorter and broader, with a shorter talonid {{and a smaller}} hypoconulid. In Indraloris himalayensis lower molars, there are four main cusps (protoconid and metaconid in the trigonid, hypoconid and entoconid in the talonid), which give the crown a rectangular aspect, although the labial cusps (protoconid and hypoconid) are placed somewhat anterior to their lingual counterparts. In I.kamlialensis, the entoconid is distinct from the hypoconulid, which is large, but the tooth is otherwise similar. The cusps are high relative to those of extant lorises and approximately equal in height. The cristid obliqua, a crest, descends from the hypoconid to a point on the lingual side of the protoconid. On the hypoconid, this crest forms a right angle with the posterolophid, which runs towards the hypoconulid in the back lingual corner of the tooth. Between the metaconid and entoconid, the talonid basin is open. In I.himalayensis at least (the structure is damaged in the only known lower molar of I.kamlialensis) there is a well-developed hollow in the trigonid {{in front of the}} protoconid and metaconid. There is a labial <b>cingulum</b> between the protoconid and hypoconid. YGSP 32152 is so worn that little of its structure remains visible. It shows a short trigonid and a distinct entoconid. A small hypoconulid, close to the entoconid, is suggested by an enamel swelling. This specimen is fragmentary enough that it could also represent a catarrhine primate or a carnivoran.|$|E
5|$|The molars are high-crowned (hypsodont) and planar, {{with the}} main cusps {{as high as the}} crests {{connecting}} them, a configuration shared only with Holochilus and Carletonomys among oryzomyines. The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the anteroloph on the first upper molar, the posteroloph on the first and second upper molar, and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar, the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars, but two—the posteroflexid on the lower second molar and the entoflexid on the lower third molar—are closed by a wall, or <b>cingulum,</b> at the inner margin of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops goodmani {{is known}} from three mandibles (lower jaws): {{one with the}} fourth premolar (p4) and first and second molars (m1–2) and two with {{the second and third}} molars (m2–3). The jaw is {{relatively}} robust. The p4 resembles a canine, having a single cusp that is about as high as the highest cusp on m1 and lacking accessory shelves or cusps. The molars are narrow-crowned and longer than in T.menamena, P.auritus, and P.furculus. Length of m2 ranges from 1.55 to 1.57mm and width from 0.98 to 1.02mm. On m1, the trigonid (front group of cusps) is narrower and slightly higher than the talonid at the back. The protoconid, one of the main cusps in the trigonid, is the highest cusp, but is only slightly higher than the hypoconid (a cusp in the talonid); in living Madagascan Triaenops and Paratriaenops, the protoconid is substantially higher than the hypoconid. The paraconid, metaconid (both cusps in the trigonid), and entoconid (a cusp in the talonid) are lower than in Paratriaenops auritus. The hypoconulid (part of the talonid) is small but distinct and is the lowest cusp. It is separated from the entoconid by a gap. T.goodmani lacks a ridge, the preentocristid, connecting the entoconid to the metaconid. There is a crest (<b>cingulum)</b> at the front and back of the tooth. The last two molars are similar to m1, but in m2 the talonid is only slightly wider than the trigonid and in m3 the two are of equal width. In addition, a shelf is present between the protoconid and hypoconid on m2 and m3 is smaller, lacks the gap between the entoconid and hypoconulid, and has a weak ridge between the entoconid and metaconid. These characteristics are typical of Triaenops and Paratriaenops.|$|E
25|$|Cysts may be {{identified}} using the overal body shape {{but more often}} based on the characteristic furrows housing the flagella (<b>cingulum</b> and sulcus) or details of the patterns of plates covering many motiles (thecal tabulation).|$|E
500|$|The {{preserved}} alveoli {{show that}} p2 {{is about as}} large as p3, not smaller as in the [...] "tristis group" [...] of Miniopterus. The premolars in M. tao are placed closely together, which distinguishes the species from M. schreibersii and fossil European species, including M. rummeli. The p3 is robust and surrounded by a well-developed <b>cingulum</b> (shelf). The crown is trapezoid in shape. In p4, {{there is a clear}} <b>cingulum</b> at the front and labial (outer) margins. The crown is triangular and the back edge is straight, not saddle-shaped as in M.schreibersii. The molars resemble those of M. schreibersii, but are more robust, particularly the talonids (the cusp groups {{at the back of the}} teeth).|$|E
500|$|The marsh shrew's skull is {{relatively}} large, and its [...] skull length is usually greater than [...] There is a distinctive, downward-sloping curve along the snout (rostrum). Its dental formula is incisors: 1/1; unicuspids: 5/1; premolars: 1/1; molars: 3/3. Of the five upper unicuspids {{the third is}} distinctly smaller than the fourth, {{and they have a}} pigmented ridge extending to the <b>cingulum.</b> There is a large medial tine on the large upper incisor, in the anterior pigmented region. The reddish pigmentation of the enamel, the result of iron deposits, is thought to be an adaptation strengthening the enamel.|$|E
500|$|The genus is {{distinguished}} from other cheirogaleids by the toothrows on its maxilla (upper jaw), which are parallel {{and do not}} converge towards {{the front of the}} mouth. The fork-marked lemur dental formula is {{on each side of the}} mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars—a total of 36teeth. Their upper first incisor (I1) is long and curved towards the middle of the mouth (unique among lemurs), while the second upper incisor (I2) is small with a gap (diastema) between the two. The upper canines are large, with their tips curved. Their upper anterior premolars (P2) are caniniform (canine-shaped) and more pronounced than in any other living lemur. The next upper premolar (P3) is very small, with a single, pointed cusp that contacts the lingual <b>cingulum</b> (a crest or ridge on the tongue side), which circles the base of the tooth. The two cusps on the last upper premolar (P4) are a large paracone and a smaller protocone. Like other cheirogaleids, their first lower premolar (P2) is caniniform and large, while the cingulids (ridges) on the three lower premolars are more developed compared to most other cheirogaleids. The first two upper molars (M1–2) have a developed hypocone, and the buccal <b>cingulum</b> (a crest or ridge on the cheek side) is well developed on all three upper molars. The molars are relatively small compared to other cheirogaleids, with the second upper and lower molars (M2 and M2) having reduced functionality compared to those of mouse lemurs.|$|E
500|$|The front {{half of the}} m1 and m2 {{consists}} of the trigonid, {{a group of three}} cusps forming a triangle: the paraconid at the front on the inner side, protoconid in the middle on the outer (labial) side, and metaconid at the back on the inner side (see Figure 2). The three cusps form a right angle with each other at the protoconid, so that the trigonid is described as [...] "open". The paraconid is higher than the metaconid. At the front margin, a <b>cingulum</b> is present that is divided into two small cusps. Unlike in various early tribosphenic mammals and close relatives, there is no additional cuspule behind the metaconid. At the back of the trigonid, the crest known as the distal metacristid is located relatively close to the outer side of the tooth and is continuous with another crest, the cristid obliqua, which is in turn connected {{to the back of the}} tooth.|$|E
500|$|Like other cheirogaleids, {{the dental}} formula for giant mouse lemurs is {{on each side}} of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars—a total of 36teeth. Their upper teeth {{converge}} towards the front of the mouth, but are straighter than those in mouse lemurs. The first upper premolar (P2) is relatively small, but nearly as tall as the next premolar (P3). Unlike mouse lemurs and more like dwarf lemurs, giant mouse lemurs have a prominent anterior lower premolar (P2). Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs, the first two upper molars (M1–2) have a more anterior hypocone that sits opposite the metacone, compared to the mouse lemurs' more posterior hypocone, which is presumably a symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait. Also on M1 and M2, the <b>cingulum</b> (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small cuspules. In all other dental characteristics, giant mouse lemurs are noticeably similar to both dwarf and mouse lemurs.|$|E
