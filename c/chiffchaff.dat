5|$|The common <b>chiffchaff,</b> {{or simply}} the <b>chiffchaff,</b> (Phylloscopus collybita) {{is a common}} and {{widespread}} leaf warbler which breeds in open woodlands throughout northern and temperate Europe and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The British naturalist Gilbert White {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to {{separate}} the similar-looking common <b>chiffchaff,</b> willow warbler and wood warbler by their songs, as detailed in 1789 in The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne, but the common <b>chiffchaff</b> was first formally described as Sylvia collybita by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817 in his Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>chiffchaff</b> is {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} brood parasitic cuckoos, including the common and Horsfield's cuckoos, but it recognises and rejects non-mimetic eggs and is therefore only rarely successfully brood-parasitised. Like other passerine birds, the common <b>chiffchaff</b> can also acquire intestinal nematode parasites and external ticks.|$|E
50|$|Pulborough Brooks {{is known}} for its birds. Firecrests, <b>chiffchaffs,</b> little ringed plovers are all notable species.|$|R
50|$|This small {{wood was}} planted in 1984 with ash, field maple and oak. Birds include blackcaps and <b>chiffchaffs,</b> {{and there are}} peacock, orange-tip and {{speckled}} wood butterflies.|$|R
25|$|Thousands {{of birds}} pass through {{each year on}} their way to their {{breeding}} or wintering grounds. <b>Chiffchaffs,</b> goldcrests and wheatears are usually the first to pass through, followed by sedge warblers and willow warblers, whitethroats and spotted flycatchers.|$|R
5|$|P. sindianus, the {{mountain}} <b>chiffchaff,</b> {{is found in}} the Caucasus (P. s. lorenzii) and Himalayas (P. s. sindianus), and is an altitudinal migrant, moving to lower levels in winter. The nominate subspecies is similar to P. c. tristis, but with a finer darker bill, browner upperparts and buff flanks; its song is almost identical to P. collybita, but the call is a weak psew. P. s. lorenzii is warmer and darker brown than the nominate race; it is sympatric with common <b>chiffchaff</b> in a small area in the Western Caucasus, but interbreeding occurs rarely, if ever. The mountain <b>chiffchaff</b> differs from tristis in vocalisations, external morphology, and mtDNA sequences. Its two subspecies appear to be distinct vocally, and also show some difference in mtDNA sequences; they are maintained at subspecies rank pending further research.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} challenge is distinguishing non-singing birds of the nominate subspecies from Iberian <b>chiffchaff</b> in the field. In Great Britain and the Netherlands, all accepted records of vagrant Iberian chiffchaffs relate to singing males.|$|E
5|$|Short-distance {{passerine}} migrants {{have two}} evolutionary origins. Those that have long-distance migrants {{in the same}} family, such as the common <b>chiffchaff</b> Phylloscopus collybita, are species of southern hemisphere origins that have progressively shortened their return migration {{to stay in the}} northern hemisphere.|$|E
40|$|Sound {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the life of many animals, including many bird species. Typically, male birds sing to defend a territory and to attract mates. Ambient noise may negatively affect the signal efficiency of their songs, which may be critical to reproductive success. Consequently, anthropogenic noise may be detrimental to individual birds and to populations in cities and along highways. Several bird species that are still common in urban areas have been shown to sing at higher frequency at locations where there is more low-frequency traffic noise. Here we show that <b>chiffchaffs</b> along noisy highways also sing with a higher minimum frequency than <b>chiffchaffs</b> nearby at a quiet riverside. Furthermore, through experimental exposure to highway noise we show that these birds are capable of making such adjustments over a very short time scale. The first 10 songs sung during the noise exposure revealed an immediate shift to higher frequencies, with a return to pre-exposure levels in recordings without noise the following day. In a transmission re-recording experiment we tested the impact of a potential measurement artifact by recording playback of the same songs repeatedly under different controlled noise conditions. We found an upward shift in the minimum frequency measurement associated with more noisy recordings of the same song, but this artifact was not of a scale that it could explain the noise-dependent spectral shifts in <b>chiffchaffs...</b>|$|R
50|$|The site {{is mainly}} woodland, but {{additional}} habitats are grassland, hedges and ponds. There {{is also the}} remains of an eighteenth-century pleasure garden. 558 species of fungi have been found, two of which have not been recorded previously in Britain and over 100 which are scarce in Hertfordshire. Birds include blackcaps, <b>chiffchaffs</b> and nuthatches.|$|R
50|$|This {{habitat is}} home to badgers, foxes, voles, shrews and weasels, and {{pipistrelle}} and long-eared bats. Jays, green and great spotted woodpeckers are frequently seen, and rarer sightings include yellowhammers, <b>chiffchaffs</b> and tree pipits. Many butterflies, such as the comma and hedge brown thrive here. Also found are turtle doves, nightingales, grey and red-legged partridges, and barn and long-eared owls.|$|R
5|$|The common <b>chiffchaff</b> {{has three}} still {{commonly}} accepted subspecies, together with {{some from the}} Iberian Peninsula, the Canary Islands, and the Caucasus which are now more often treated as full species.|$|E
5|$|The song {{differs from}} that of the Iberian <b>chiffchaff,</b> which has a shorter djup djup djup wheep wheep chittichittichiittichitta. However, mixed singers occur in the {{hybridisation}} zone and elsewhere, and can be difficult to allocate to species.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the major}} {{subspecies}} is under threat, but exsul, as noted above, is probably extinct. There is a slow population increase of common <b>chiffchaff</b> in the Czech Republic. The range of at least P. c. collybita seems to be expanding, with northward advances in Scotland, Norway and Sweden and a large population increase in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The {{main effect}} of humans on this species is indirect, through {{woodland}} clearance which affects the habitat, predation by cats, and collisions with windows, buildings and cars. Only {{the first of these}} has the potential to seriously affect populations, but given the huge geographical spread of P. c. abietinus and P. c. tristis, and woodland conservation policies in the range of P. c. collybita, the <b>chiffchaff's</b> future seems assured.|$|R
50|$|Bradlaugh Fields {{nature reserve}} has ancient hedgerows and {{unimproved}} grassland. Birds include blue tits, <b>chiffchaffs,</b> great spotted woodpeckers, sparrowhawks, redwings and fieldfares. Hill and Holes {{is an ancient}} disused quarry which has grassed ridges and hollows, some of them steeply sloping. There {{are a variety of}} habitats including limestone grassland. Scrub Field has a diverse selection of wild flowers, including Knautia arvensis and knapweed in higher areas, and bird's-foot trefoil and yellow rattle lower down.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} owned {{in the late}} nineteenth century by Benjamin Disraeli, and the {{woodland}} is much older. It is semi-natural beech woodland on chalk, which is an unusual habitat, and it also has considerable wych elm. Its rich ground flora includes some ancient woodland and nationally restricted species, and many wild flowers, which is unusual in beech woodland. There are a number of badger setts and a varied invertebrate fauna. Birds include great spotted woodpeckers and <b>chiffchaffs.</b>|$|R
5|$|P. canariensis, the Canary Islands <b>chiffchaff</b> is a {{non-migratory}} species formerly occurring on {{the major}} Canary Islands, which is differentiated from P. collybita by morphology, vocalisations and genetic characteristics, and, of course, is not sympatric with any other chiffchaffs. The nominate western subspecies P. c. canariensis of El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria is smaller than common <b>chiffchaff,</b> and has shorter, rounder wings. It is olive-brown above and has a buff breast and flanks; it has a rich deep chip-cheep-cheep-chip-chip-cheep song, and a call similar to the nominate race. The eastern P. c. exsul of Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura is paler above and less rufous below than its western relative, and had a harsher call; {{it might have been}} a distinct species, but it became extinct in 1986 at latest, probably much earlier. The reasons for its extinction are unclear, but it appears always to have been scarce and localised, occurring only in the Haria Valley of Lanzarote.|$|E
5|$|Like most Old World warblers, {{this small}} species is insectivorous, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been {{recorded}} as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, particularly those of the winter moth. The <b>chiffchaff</b> has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>chiffchaff</b> breeds across Europe and Asia east {{to eastern}} Siberia and north to about 70Â°N, with {{isolated}} populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, {{but it is}} one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5metres (16ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the willow warbler (P. trochilus) prefers younger trees, while the wood warbler (P. sibilatrix) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common <b>chiffchaff</b> uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis, so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.|$|E
40|$|Capsule Iberian <b>Chiffchaffs</b> Phylloscopus (collybita) brehmii are genetically, morphologically and bioacoustically {{different}} from European <b>Chiffchaffs</b> (P [c. ] collybita). Aim To examine {{the difference in}} migratory pattern between brehmii and collybita. Methods We inferred variation in distance of migration between brehmii and collybita by analysing differences in flight-related morphology (wing-length, wing shape and tail-length) between individuals breeding or wintering in the Iberian Peninsula. Results Controlling for body size and allometry of feather dimensions, birds captured in spring had more pointed wings (more concave wing shapes and pointed wing tips) and a shorter tail than birds caught in winter, although no spring-to-winter difference was found for wing-length. Conclusion Iberian breeders appear better suited to long-distance migration (their traits are likely to give a higher speed and a lower energy consumption during long non-stop flights) than wintering individuals, which strongly supports the hypothesis that brehmii move south of the Sahara in autumn and are substituted by central European collybita populations in winter. This different migration pattern of brehmii and collybita {{has important implications for}} the maintenance of differentiation in their contact zone, because selection against hybrids with maladaptive, intermediate migratory behaviours might contribute to reproductive isolation...|$|R
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} concerning between-year winter site fidelity in passerines suggests {{there might}} be important inter-specific and regional variations in recurrence rates (the proportion of birds recaptured in years subsequent to marking). However, there are virtually no studies reporting low recurrence rates that show this not to be simply the result of low recapture probabilities. This problem can be particularly acute for partly nomadic and mostly non-territorial species in their winter quarters. The present study shows that, {{in spite of the}} apparently nomadic behaviour of wintering <b>Chiffchaffs</b> Phylloscopus collybita, some individuals can become temporarily sedentary. Temporarily sedentary <b>Chiffchaffs</b> have very small linear home-ranges (ca. 200 m) and their calculated recapture probability (by re-sighting of colour-ringed birds) is high. In spite of that, recurrence rate of temporarily sedentary birds is very low, suggesting {{that the majority of the}} surviving individuals are not site faithful. This is in contrast to what has been found in several detailed studies in other Sylviidae and also Parulidae involving mostly territorial birds. The type of approach developed here should be used in other studies before any comparisons and generalisations involving winter-site fidelity results are attempted...|$|R
5000|$|Bohill Forest Nature Reserve is a {{small area}} within the forest where trees had {{previously}} been felled and the land was allowed to naturally regrow. This woodland consists of holly, oak, rowan, birch, hazel and oak trees. Patches that are still clear of tree cover contain bracken, bilberry and heather. The habitat is ideal for the previously rare holly blue butterfly, which the nature reserve {{was set up to}} protect. Other fauna in the woodland includes the speckled wood butterfly, red deer, goldcrests, jays, <b>chiffchaffs</b> and blackcaps.|$|R
5|$|The male common <b>chiffchaff</b> {{is highly}} {{territorial}} during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20metres (66ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds {{may also be}} attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the stoat if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the Eurasian jay. His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears {{to be used to}} advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.|$|E
5|$|P. (c.) tristis, the Siberian <b>chiffchaff,</b> breeds in Siberia {{east of the}} Pechora River and {{winters in}} the lower Himalayas. It is also {{regularly}} recorded in western Europe in winter, {{and it is likely}} that the numbers involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria, lack of good data and recording policies (Sweden and Finland only accept trapped birds). It is a dull subspecies, grey or brownish above and whitish below, with little yellow in the plumage, and the buff-white supercilium is often longer than in the western subspecies. It has a higher pitched suitsistsuisit song and a short high-pitched cheet call. It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations, being similar to P. s. sindianus in these respects. Nominate P. c. collybita and P. c. tristis do not recognize each other's songs. Pending resolution of the status of P. (c.) fulvescens, which is found where the ranges of P. c. abietinus and P. c. tristis connect and may or may not be a hybrid between these, tristis is maintained in P. collybita.|$|E
5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds. Some records prove problematic, and for some species, it has taken the committee {{many years to come}} to a decision. This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britainâexamples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, accepted in 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, accepted in 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, accepted in 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, accepted in 2004 after a second set of notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, accepted in 2003), Iberian <b>chiffchaff</b> (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, accepted in 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, accepted in 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.|$|E
5|$|Described by German {{zoologist}} Friedrich Boie in 1826, {{the genus}} Phylloscopus contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below. The genus was formerly {{part of the}} Old World warbler family Sylvidae, but has now been split off as a separate family Phylloscopidae. The <b>chiffchaff's</b> closest relatives, other than former subspecies, are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes, a yellow rump or obvious wing bars; they include the willow, Bonelli's, wood and plain leaf warblers.|$|R

5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, {{small groups of}} goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species foraging flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. A consequence of feeding in a flock is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, coal tits and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger willow and European crested tits used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of willow and crested tits was artificially reduced, goldcrests and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but {{did not do so}} where the larger tits were retained. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the common <b>chiffchaff</b> and blackcap.|$|E

500|$|P. c. abietinus {{occurs in}} Scandinavia and {{northern}} Russia, and winters from southeastern Europe and northeastern Africa east to Iraq and western Iran. It is intermediate in appearance between P. c. tristis and P. c. collybita, being grey-washed olive-green above with a pale yellow supercilium, and underparts whiter than in P. c. collybita, {{but it has}} very similar vocalisations to the nominate subspecies. Due to individual variation, {{it can be difficult}} to reliably separate P. c. abietinus and P. c. collybita outside their main breeding and wintering ranges.

5|$|From time to time, BBRC has re-reviewed {{records that}} it {{previously}} accepted, {{to ensure they}} are acceptable {{in the light of}} improved knowledge of the species in question. These reviews are carried out on a species-by-species basis. Old World warblers have proved particularly in need of re-review. A review of greenish warbler records was initiated in 1983. The purpose of this review was to establish whether records, particular those in late autumn and winter, of drab grey Phylloscopus warblers, which had previously been accepted as greenish warbler, were in fact this species, or were common <b>chiffchaffs</b> of the Siberian race tristis. 48 records between 1958 and 1970 were examined. Of these, 20 were rejected. A review of Arctic warbler records was begun in 1991, with the aim of determining whether any greenish warblers had been mistakenly accepted as Arctics. The review was completed in 1994, although as of 2009, the results had not been published.|$|R
