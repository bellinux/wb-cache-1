2500|$|The Lexus LFA's {{frame is}} made from an {{in-house}} designed and manufactured carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) center monocoque with aluminum front and rear subframes. The subframes, which can be removed and replaced minimizing potential repair costs, are joined to the monocoque using a newly developed aluminum flanged collar designed to create a stronger joint. According to the manufacturer, {{the quality of the}} CRFP material matches that of aeronautical grades and is woven by a laser monitored <b>circular</b> <b>loom,</b> one of only two in the world. Overall 65% of the vehicle's total body mass is CFRP material while the remaining 35% is aluminum. Manufacturer data indicates that the use of CFRP saves [...] over equivalent aluminum materials.|$|E
5000|$|... 1855 - Redgate {{combines}} a <b>circular</b> <b>loom</b> with a {{warp knitting machine}} ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{warp yarns}} are staged on a creel, which will feed them {{lengthwise}} down through a <b>circular</b> <b>loom.</b> Two filler bobbins with the filler yarn {{are put in}} place in the loom.|$|E
5000|$|The {{machines}} made by {{the firm}} included: Silk <b>looms,</b> <b>circular</b> and drop-box <b>looms,</b> fustian looms, Turkish towel looms, jacquard looms, dobby looms, Bradford looms, sheeting, linen and sailcloth looms, etc., for weaving all kinds of cotton, linen, worsted, silk, flax, hemp, jute, and woollen goods of various widths and strength - principally shirtings, jaconets, domestic tablecloths, twills, sheetings, counterpanes, checks, ginghams, quiltings, toilet cloths, handkerchiefs, Turkish towels, fustians, nankeens, cotton velvets, bedticks, cambrics, drapers, hucks, damask, towels, &c. Also all kinds of preparing machinery, viz., slasher sizing machines, pirning machines, beaming machines, cloth folding and measuring machines, hydraulic cloth presses, steam drying machines, &c.|$|R
60|$|The top of {{the rising}} ground was reached. It was pitch dark, and the men when they halted fell up against one another {{trying to get a}} {{foothold}} on the sodden ground. But Pierre seemed to have eyes like a cat. He only paused one moment to get his bearings, then--still without a word--he set to work. A large barn and a group of small <b>circular</b> straw ricks <b>loomed</b> like solid masses out of the darkness--black, silhouetted against the black of the stormy sky. Pierre turned toward the barn: those of his comrades who were in the forefront of the small crowd saw him disappearing inside one of those solid shadowy masses that looked so ghostlike in the night.|$|R
40|$|In {{this passage}} the Latin term oscillum {{refers to a}} {{particular}} class of objects: a small face or mask hung on trees during certain religious feasts celebrated by the Ausones in honour of Bacchus (Fig. 1). The Roman oscilla most probably derives from the Aἰῶραι, small images related to Dionysus hung on trees during the Aἰῶρα, an Athenian public feast. They were believed to purify the air as they swung in the wind. Both the Greek and the Latin words refer to objects used during particular sacred feasts, {{in the first case}} public and in the second case private, inside villae. However, the term oscillum has also been applied to certain shapes (circular and semicircular) of loom weights (Fig. 2). Italian archaeologists in particular have traditionally used the term oscillum to refer to these weights, reserving the term ‘peso da telaio’ (loom weight) for the traditional shapes (truncated pyramid and truncated cone). Most of the archaeological literature identifies <b>circular</b> and semicircular <b>loom</b> weights as such, although there have been contrasting interpretations of their function ever since the late 19 th century. What caused the term oscilla to be transferred from sacred objects to loom weights must surely have been the latter’s unconventional shape and their decorations and inscriptions. But when and why did this take place...|$|R
50|$|Typically made {{of cotton}} textile in a {{stockinette}} or jersey, knit, {{it has a}} distinctively pliable texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. The majority of modern versions have a body made from a continuously woven tube, on a <b>circular</b> <b>loom,</b> so that the torso has no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated and may include fabric cutting by laser or water jet.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>circular</b> <b>loom</b> is used {{to create}} a {{seamless}} tube of fabric for products such as hosiery, sacks, clothing, fabric hose (such as fire hose) and the like. Circular looms can be small jigs used for Circular knitting or large high-speed machines for modern garments. [...] Modern circular looms use up to ten shuttles driven from below in a circular motion by electromagnets for the weft yarns, and cams to control the warp threads. The warps rise and fall with each shuttle passage, unlike the common practice of lifting all of them at once.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855 Redgate {{combined}} {{the principles of}} a <b>circular</b> <b>loom</b> with those of warp knit. A German firm used this machine to produce [...] "Raschel" [...] shawls, named after the French actress Élisabeth Félice Rachel. In 1859 Wilhelm Barfuss improved the machine to create the Raschel machines. The Jacquard apparatus was adapted {{to it in the}} 1870s. The Raschel machine could work at higher speeds than the Leavers machine and proved the most adaptable to the new synthetic fibres, such as nylon and polyester, in the 1950s. Most contemporary machine-made lace is made on Raschel machines.|$|E

5000|$|Marx {{discusses}} {{tools and}} machines and their application {{to the process of}} production. Marx claims that many experts, including himself, cannot distinguish between {{tools and machines}}. Marx states that they [...] "call a tool a simple machine and a machine a complex tool." [...] Marx continues to elaborate on this misinterpretation of definition, explaining that some people distinguish between a tool and a machine [...] "by saying {{that in the case of}} the tool, man is the motive power, whereas the power behind the machine is a natural force independent of man, for instance an animal, water, wind and so on." [...] Marx explains a flaw with this approach comparing two examples. He points out that a plow, which is powered by an animal, would be considered to be a machine and Claussen's <b>circular</b> <b>loom,</b> which is able to weave at a tremendous speed, is in fact powered by one worker and therefore considered to be a tool. Marx gives a precise definition of the machine when he says [...] "The machine, therefore, is a mechanism that, after being set in motion, performs with its tools the same operation as the worker formerly did with similar tools. Whether the motive power is derived from man, or in turn from a machine, makes no difference here." ...|$|E

Four different packaging systems were tried, among which gusseted type high density polyethylene woven sacks having either <b>circular</b> <b>loom</b> or traditional loom laminated with 100 gauge low density polyethylene {{were found to be}} best suited for dry fish packaging as they could withstand the hazards of handling, transportation and storage...|$|E
40|$|The Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology gives its {{visitors}} much to ponder. Established at {{the site}} in Nagoya where in 1911 Sakichi Toyoda founded his automatic loom factory (the basis of the family fortune, which later funded his son Kiichiro’s development of automobile production), the museum was opened on June 11, 1994, the 100 th anniversary of Toyoda’s birth. It is a popular stop on field trips for Japanese schoolchildren, who are required to study in the 3 rd grade the automobile industry. The messages, which Toyota wishes to instill in its young visitors, are the importance of “making things” and of “creativity and research. ” And confronting all museum visitors upon entry, having central place in the vast and largely empty first room of the exhibits, is Sakichi Toyoda’s one-of-a-kind vertical <b>circular</b> <b>loom.</b> ...|$|E
