500|$|The new {{creative}} team, {{while avoiding}} references aimed specifically at adults, {{was determined not}} to adapt the humour to children or otherwise patronise their audience. Instead, they sought to make the best use possible of the material. Norris said that her goal was [...] "to make a show that people would say was too good for <b>children...</b> <b>we</b> started out with really high ambitions." [...] To that end, adult historical satires such as Blackadder and the Monty Python films were shown at the first writers' meeting to demonstrate the proposed tone, and these influences would be visible throughout the show's run.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the rivalry}} cooled, the two clubs were still {{involved}} in engrossing battles; The Guardians Jamie Jackson wrote after a November 2007 fixture: [...] "For once here was enough spectacle {{to meet the}} pre-match hype and convince the millions watching {{around the world that}} the Premier League may just have the best footballers who can play the very best stuff." [...] In 2009, the teams met in the semi-finals of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, which United won 4–1 on aggregate. United defender Patrice Evra was blunt in his post-match assessment: [...] "It was 11 men against 11 <b>children.</b> <b>We</b> never doubted ourselves. We have much more experience and that's what made the difference." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the broad}} nature of the law, {{as it would have}} allowed the firing of public school {{employees}} for the way they voted or spoke their opinions in favor of gay rights, conservative Republican politicians spoke out against it. Primarily, former governor Ronald Reagan voiced his opinion, saying [...] "Prop. 6 is not needed to protect our <b>children.</b> <b>We</b> have that legal protection now. It could be very costly to implement and has the potential for causing undue harm to people." [...] Reagan's statement turned public opinion against the proposition almost overnight. Gay activists were not optimistic in light of the record of voter turnout against them in the previous year, but they were overwhelmed to learn that on election day more than a million voters turned out to strike down the proposition.|$|E

500|$|In 1988, {{brothers}} Rand and Robyn Miller {{were living}} {{apart in the}} United States. Robyn was taking a year off from university, writing and trying to establish state residency. Rand was a computer programmer for a bank. Rand approached his brother {{with the idea of}} making an interactive storybook using HyperCard. The brothers were not big video game players themselves, although they were familiar with Dungeons & Dragons, and had played Zork. In his parents' basement—Robyn did not own a computer himself—Robyn began drawing pictures and creating a nonlinear story that would eventually become their first game, The Manhole. The Manhole and the games that followed—Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx—were specifically aimed at children and shared the same aesthetics: black-and-white graphics, point-and-click gameplay, a first-person point of view, and explorable worlds. Robyn recalled that the games were more about exploration than narrative: [...] "In the projects we did for <b>children,</b> <b>we</b> didn't really tell stories [...] They were just these worlds that you would explore." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We Are the World" [...] is sung from a {{first person}} viewpoint, {{allowing}} {{the audience to}} [...] "internalize" [...] the message by singing the word we together. It {{has been described as}} [...] "an appeal to human compassion". The first lines in the song's repetitive chorus proclaim, [...] "We are the world, we are the <b>children,</b> <b>we</b> are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving". [...] "We Are the World" [...] opens with Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Kenny Rogers, James Ingram, Tina Turner and Billy Joel singing the first verse. Michael Jackson and Diana Ross follow, completing the first chorus together. Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson and Al Jarreau sing the second verse, before Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Loggins, Steve Perry and Daryl Hall go through the second chorus. Co-writer Jackson, Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper and Kim Carnes follow with the song's bridge. This structuring of the song is said to [...] "create a sense of continuous surprise and emotional buildup". [...] "We Are the World" [...] concludes with Bob Dylan and Ray Charles singing a full chorus, Wonder and Springsteen duetting, and ad libs from Charles and Ingram.|$|E
500|$|In April 1998, {{three years}} after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under {{criticism}} for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the [...] "increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down {{in front of a computer}} screen". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our <b>children.</b> <b>We</b> know that our membership would not want us to do that." [...] The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas.|$|E

As the plot proceeds readers see his struggle to remain loyal to the dictator {{in the face of the}} regime's increasingly horrific acts. Angel Face is faced with the challenge of reconciling his position of power among a terrorized people with his desire to fulfill a higher moral purpose. In the words of literary critic Richard Franklin, he [...] "struggles to affirm his absolute existence and to relate this to an authentic self". [...] Angel Face's linguistic intensity often reflects his inner moral struggle: 'An animal makes no mistake in its sexual reckonings,' he thought. 'We piss children into the graveyard.
