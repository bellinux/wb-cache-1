Considering the literatures may lead us that, these kinds of systems neither has been of a great concern in general topics, nor in particular fields such as distributed optimization of design, and operating rules. In order to optimize these systems, one must consider the hydraulic interactions between all of the components. Unfortunately, it has been neglected in most studies. In these two companion papers (both have published in this issue); a distributed parameter approach has been implemented for optimum planning of <b>cyclic</b> <b>storage</b> systems. For this purpose the modified and generalized form of unit response matrix has been developed and used to connect the distributed parameter groundwater simulation model to the optimization model. The resulted optimization model has a form of a nonlinear programming. In order to validate the model, it has been implemented in a hypothetical simple <b>cyclic</b> <b>storage</b> system. The {{results show that the}} modified unit response matrix method is a robust and powerful method for optimum planning of <b>cyclic</b> <b>storage</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{compare the}} {{incidence}} of microleakage associated with contemporary esthetic restorative-adhesive systems following cyclic wet and dry storage as a representation to the dry mouth condition. Methods: Standardized cervical cavities in both buccal and lingual surfaces of 100 extracted human premolars were restored in 10 groups (n= 10 with 20 cavities) using 7 contemporary esthetic restoratives and 3 adhesive systems following their manufacturers’ instructions. Cavities in groups 1 – 3 were restored with self-adhesive restoratives; conventional glass-ionomer (GI) (Ketac Molar Aplicap), resin modified glass-ionomer (RMGI) (Vitremer) and self-adhesive flowable composite (SAFC) (Fusio Liquid Dentin). Conventional flowable (FC) (Filtek Z 350 Flow), nano-hybrid (HC) (Filtek Z 250 XT) and nano-filled (NC) (Filtek Z 350 XT) methacrylate-based composites were {{used in conjunction with}} total-etch, 2 -step adhesive (Adper Single Bond 2) to restore cavities in groups 4 – 6. The same restoratives were also used to restore cavities in groups 8 – 10 in the presence of self-etch, 1 -step adhesive (Adper Easy One), while cavities in group 7 were restored with silorane-based composite (Filtek P 90) together with its specific adhesive system. Five restored teeth from each group (10 cavities) were subjected to <b>cyclic</b> <b>storage</b> in wet and dry environment, each for 12 h/day and for a total period of 30 days, while the other 5 were tested with no <b>cyclic</b> <b>storage</b> to serve as control. Using dye penetration technique, the associated microleakage was then scored from 0 to 4 for all restorations according to the depth of dye penetration at both occlusal and gingival interfaces. The incidences of each score were recorded in percentages and the numerical microleakage data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney comparisons at α= 0. 05 to stand on the significance of differences detected between groups. Results: All restorative systems showed incidences of microleakage before and following <b>cyclic</b> <b>storage</b> in wet and dry environment with no specific manner declared for any. Statistical analysis of the scored data revealed no difference between different restorative systems under no storage condition, however HC, S and FC in groups 5, 7 and 8 showed higher rates of microleakage when subjected to cyclic wet-dry storage (Mann–Whitney, P 0. 05). For each restorative system, no significant difference (Kruskal–Wallis, P> 0. 05) was recorded between microleakage values recorded at occlusal and gingival interfaces. Conclusion: Occlusal and gingival sealing ability of flowable resin composite bonded with self-etch, 1 -step adhesive is the most affected following cyclic wet-dry storage. Selection of such restorative option accordingly is not suggested for patients suffering from dry mouth...|$|E

Analysis of upstream tidal wave propagation on the Amazon River contributes {{to the understanding of}} the hydrodynamics of the lower reaches and to the quantification of the influence of sea level on sedimentation rates. Continuous over-the-year recording of water levels has been undertaken at eight locations along the lower reaches of the Amazon River and flow measurement campaigns have been organized for different river discharge rates (100000 m(3) s(- 1), 190 000 m(3), s(- 1) and 250 000 m(3) s(- 1)) and sea-tide amplitudes (2 - 3. 5 m). Damping, time-delay and deformation of the tidal wave signals, depending on water regimes and distances from the sea, have been analyzed.

The pre-stress evaluation accuracies using two core-based techniques, acoustic emission (AE) and deformation rate analysis (DRA), were investigated under different pre-stresses, delay times and curing temperatures. The experimental results validate the pre-stress evaluations using AE and DRA. The delay time and curing temperature were shown to have minor impacts on the measurement accuracy. However, although both axial strain and lateral strain {{can be used in}} DRA, the stress memory fades as the delay time increases.

40|$|A {{distinction}} is made between uniform dislocation microstructures found in deformed materials where the dislocation mobility is thermally activated and non uniform microstructures obtained in conditions where the almost athermal dislocation-dislocation interactions govern plastic flow. The former case {{is illustrated by}} a study of forest hardening in b. c. c. crystals at low temperature and shows how the lattice friction on screw dislocations induces a relationship between flow stress and dislocation density that differs from the one observed in f. c. c. crystals. The latter case is more complex. It is discussed with reference to mesoscopic simulations of dislocation dynamics and interactions in f. c. c. crystals. It is shown {{that in the early}} stages of deformation, both in monotonic and <b>cyclic</b> deformation, dislocation <b>storage</b> is directly related to the cross-slip mechanism and cannot occur in its absence. Then, strain hardening and dislocation patterning are related, since both derive from dislocation storage. Finally, some present trends in the modelling of patterning phenomena are briefly discussed, leading to the conclusion that a possible way for improving the present understanding resides in a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical investigation of the emergence of dislocation patterns at small strains. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{synthesis}} method (sol–gel or hydrothermal) in the physicochemical properties of a BaTi 0. 8 Cu 0. 2 O 3 catalyst with perovskite structure was analyzed and the catalytic performance for the NO–NO 2 oxidation and for the NOx storage was tested. The characterization of catalysts by BET, ICP-OES, XRD, XPS and H 2 -TPR reveals that only the sol–gel process allows the incorporation of copper into the perovskite structure, and that, by using the hydrothermal method, highly dispersed CuO is deposited {{on the surface of}} the BaTiO 3. The NOx <b>storage</b> <b>cyclic</b> (NSC) experiments, carried out using both catalysts, indicate that sol–gel catalyst shows a high NOx storage capacity at 400 °C whilst the hydrothermal catalyst exhibits a high NO to NO 2 oxidation activity.

40|$|Cyclic {{changes in}} {{temperature}} and humidity in real-life distribution environments decrease BCT and life-span of standard corrugated containers. As a result, BCT obtained from testing at standard TAPPI environment may be inadequate to protect the products inside from damages during real-life distribution. The corrugated containers users need to understand this concept in order to design a proper corrugated containers at a cost-efficient price that can retain BCT in these extreme {{temperature and humidity}} changes environments. Wax curtain coating {{is one of the}} most commonly used techniques to retain BCT of corrugated containers that are distributed in short-term high humidity environment, and usually found in the fresh produce, poultry and meat industries. In this study, standard and wax curtain coated corrugated containers were top-loaded with two different safety factors and conditioned in three different cyclic environments. Every 24 hours, moisture contents and heights of these loaded test containers were determined to investigate life-span and relationship between moisture content change and reduction in height. In addition, unloaded standard and wax curtain coated corrugated containers were conditioned in three different cyclic and constant environments. The reduction in BCT of these unloaded test containers in each cyclic and constant environment was investigated after the loaded test containers in that cyclic environment reached the critical deflection. The results of the experiment showed that there was a notable difference in reduction in BCT of the standard unloaded test containers after exposure to every cyclic and constant environments, but not of the wax curtain coated unloaded test containers. The life-span of loaded wax curtain coated test containers were also greater than of loaded standard test containers in every cyclic environment. The greater difference of temperature in cyclic environment resulted in greater moisture content change of corrugated material. Thus, both types of test containers experienced the greatest moisture content change in <b>cyclic</b> cold <b>storage</b> environment. However, due to its most severe temperature and relative humidity, cyclic tropical environment showed the greatest effect on reduction in BCT, reduction in height and life-span of both types of test containers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cyclic</b> gas <b>storage</b> in and {{withdrawal}} from subsurface gas fields generate {{a sequence of}} loading-unloading cycles in both the sandy permeable formation and the confining clayey caprock. A basic requirement {{for the safety of}} the underground gas disposal is that the related stress variation does not jeopardize the sealing capacity of the caprock, especially if the pore fluid pressure should exceed the original in situ value in order to increase the volume of the injected gas. Moreover, as a side effect the reservoir deformation can induce a non negligible cyclic motion of the ground surface, with possible undesired consequences for the existing civil structures and infrastructures. The present communication aims at investigating numerically the expected geomechanical effects of gas storage in a depleted gas reservoir located in Italy. Computer simulations are performed using quite realistic information on the geometrical and geomechanical properties of the field. Two disposal scenarios are assumed where the maximum pore pressure in the injection stage may increase from 120 % up to 150 % of its original value. The results show that no significant stress changes are caused in the caprock in the most unfavourable scenario as well, thus ensuring the safety of the operation. However, a shear failure condition can be locally attained in the injected formation. Such an occurrence should be carefully considered and possibly monitored, especially if the failure is predicted close to the injecting wells with potential large displacements which could damage the hole casing. Finally, the reservoir deformation can induce a cyclic vertical ground motion up to a few centimetres according to the generated pore pressure fluctuation, the burial depth and the actual rock geo-mechanical properties of the field and the overburden. Such a motion, however, is expected to occur mainly in the elastic range and is almost fully recovered over a complete injection-withdrawal sequence, with little concern {{for the safety of the}} existing civil structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy storage}} of {{photosynthesis}} {{in the green}} alga Chlorella vulgaris was determined by pulsed, time-resolved photoacoustics. The energy storage of the linear electron transfer process in photosynthesis, of cyclic photosystem (PS) I, and possibly of PSII was determined by selection of excitation wavelength and of flash interval. At 695 nm excitation, a rather large <b>cyclic</b> PSI energy <b>storage</b> of 0. 68 ± 0. 04 eV/quantum of energy at 8 ms after a 1 -μs flash was obtained. This energy remained the same at flash intervals of 0. 35 to 60 s and was independent {{of the presence of}} 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea. We tentatively assign this energy to the ferredoxin-NADP-reductase-ferredoxin and oxidized cytochrome b 6 /f complexes. An efficient distribution of energy between cyclic and linear systems is obtained with the simple assumption that the turnover time of the cyclic system is slower than that of the linear system. The energy storage of linear electron flow was determined by 655 nm excitation of Chlorella with a short flash interval of 0. 35 s per flash. It was calculated to be 0. 50 ± 0. 03 eV/hv, close to that expected for oxygen and NADPH formation. The energy storage of PSII is determined by excitation of Chlorella at 655 nm with a long flash interval of 60 s per flash. It was calculated to be 1. 07 ± 0. 05 eV/hv, consistent with the energy storage being in S-states and the secondary electron acceptor of PSII with a calculated redox energy of 1. 03 eV/hv. In the presence of 1 μm 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea, the calculated energy storage in PSII is still significant, 0. 53 ± 0. 04 eV/hv. This probably indicates a significant cyclic electron flow around PSII. These cyclic flows may contribute considerably to energy storage in photosynthesis...|$|R

Numerical experiments verified the accuracy and efficiency of the new method.

A parametric study was performed to investigate the energy charge/discharge rates for the new design. A second-law thermodynamic analysis was carried out for thermal energy storage using multiple PCMs. The exergy efficiency of energy storage units using two, three as well as five different PCMs was analyzed and compared with that using a single PCM. A novel cone-cylinder design configuration is proposed for a shell-and-tube latent heat energy storage exchanger. A finite element model was developed to simulate the coupled convection and cyclic melting/freezing phase change heat transfer occurring outside the tube. The advantages of the new configuration are examined and discussed with the help of numerical experiments. Following the new design configuration a novel multi-exchanger energy storage system is proposed. Finite element simulation results validated and extended the thermodynamic analytical results. A new solar thermal storage unit using multiple PCMs was proposed and analyzed by a finite element model. A parametric study was carried out to investigate the advantages of the new design when compared with conventional single PCM designs. Finally, a finite element model for melting and freezing heat transfer including free convection in the melt region was developed. The streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin method was employed to enhance both the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution. Using this finite element model simulations were carried out for melting of a PCM in a rectangular cavity heated from below. Flow patterns and local heat flux distributions at the heating surface are presented and discussed. In addition, melting of a PCM in a rectangular cavity with an isothermal vertical wall was simulated. To enhance the heat transfer rate during the last stage of the melting process, inverting the PCM container is shown to be an effective technique; this idea was examined with a parametric study...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{building}} energy simulation programs are used to evaluate indoor conditions and energy performance of buildings. Every building energy modeling tool calculates the heat and moisture exchange among the outdoor environment, the building envelope, and indoor environments as a fundamental component of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. While all tools account for moisture flow through the envelope by infiltration, almost no users calculate moisture diffusion through the envelope or moisture storage in the building due to excessive computation time and unavailable material properties. However, research has shown, and work in this dissertation has confirmed, that significant errors in energy consumption predictions occur when moisture exchange is ignored, especially in hot and humid climates. This dissertation explores the impact of moisture exchange in building energy models and develops recommendations for improving simplified moisture exchange calculations under circumstances where the errors are the greatest. A research model has been developed to model detailed heat and moisture transfer in building envelopes, based on the HAMT model in EnergyPlus, which allows for the examination of both vapor and liquid transport mechanisms. The detailed model is validated through international benchmark tests and {{is used as a}} reference model to test simpler methods. Models for conduction transfer function (CTF) and effective mean penetration depth (EMPD) methods have also been developed. The research explored the opportunities to improve existing simplified moisture exchange models, specifically the heat and moisture transfer function (MTF) methods and the EMPD method. The MTF method accounts for transport of moisture vapor, but ignores liquid transport mechanism. An analysis was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} liquid transport on overall heat and mass transfer under various external environmental conditions for walls made of different building construction materials. Results indicate that liquid transport mechanism can have a significant impact on moisture flow through some construction materials, specifically concrete and gypsum, at high relative humidity. However, sensible and latent fluxes on the inside surface of multi-layer walls are not significantly impacted by the presence of liquid transport in the heat and moisture transfer calculations model. It is concluded that changes to the MTF model to account for liquid transport are not warranted. The EMPD model accounts for <b>cyclic</b> moisture <b>storage</b> at the surface of building materials and assemblies. As an extension of the conventional EMPD method, which accounts for buffering only on the inside surface, a two-sided moisture penetration depth model is proposed and evaluated how much the EMPD model at the external surface would influence thermal and moisture transfer at the inside surface. The results indicate that the two-sided EMPD model has no significant impact on inside sensible and latent heat fluxes. During the research, it was observed that moisture transport through building envelope assemblies, as opposed to moisture buffering in the assemblies, is usually very small. In fact, in most cases, it may not be necessary to account for moisture transport through the assemblies. This thesis proposes a simple assessment method to evaluate the sensitivity of HVAC loads to moisture transfer through constructions under different external conditions (temperature, humidity, and solar radiation). The methodology uses the ratio of latent heat flux and sensible heat flux, which is estimated using the mean values of temperature, vapor pressure, and sensible and latent resistances. The method is validated using the detailed heat and mass transfer model. The method can be used as a pre-simulation screening tool to assess whether moisture flux is expected to be significant.

40|$|Production of {{chemicals}} via biotechnological routes are becoming rapidly {{an alternative to}} oil-based processes. Several microorganisms including yeast, bacteria, fungi and algae can transform feedstocks into high-value molecules at industrial scale. Improvement of the bioprocess performance is a key factor for making this technology economically feasible. Despite the vast knowledge on microbial metabolism, some gaps still remain open. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, metabolism of storage carbohydrates, trehalose and glycogen, is well documented. However, the lack of quantitative information limits our understanding on what is the actual role of these materials, especially regarding the in vivo reaction rates. Like in nature, in industrial bioreactors microorganisms may encounter fluctuating environments that lead to diverse metabolic responses, especially due to large-scale substrate mixing limitations. These dynamic scenarios are known to trigger the recycle of glucose through the storage carbohydrate nodes. The <b>cyclic</b> nature of <b>storage</b> carbohydrate metabolism (synthesis and degradation) {{can lead to a}} waste of metabolic energy decreasing biomass and product yields. Thus, the biological system needs to be robust enough to withstand this adverse scenario and maintain its metabolic functions. The scope of this thesis is to investigate the dynamics of storage carbohydrates, trehalose and glycogen, and its interaction with the central carbon metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae from a quantitative perspective. In this work, it is proposed to use stimulus response experiments in combination with 13 C-labeling and mathematical modeling for identifying reaction rates. In this direction, novel feast/famine experiments are proposed as a robust experimental platform for dynamic metabolic studies and estimating dynamic fluxes in time by piecewise function approximations. Hence, the main contribution of this thesis is not only the better understanding of storage carbohydrate metabolism through dynamic metabolic rates but also the used experimental platforms and modeling approach. The results obtained in this work clearly highlight the relevance of storage carbohydrates and its interaction with the central carbon metabolism. It is shown that storage carbohydrates are key metabolites for yeast robustness since these metabolites are involved in the regulation of the glycolytic flux. This work comprehensively presents the role of trehalose and glycogen metabolism in yeast from a quantitative point of view, and it is expected that this contribution will be of significant relevance for understanding yeast metabolism in both scientific and industrial environments.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. August 2012. Major: Food science. Advisor: Dr. Francisco Diez-Gonzalez. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 102 pages. Process cheese sauce is typically prepared by combining {{one or more}} natural cheeses of the same type or different varieties, mixing with emulsifying salts and other dairy ingredients, and thermal processing to temperatures above 90 °C. The processing renders the product free of all viable organisms and is considered commercially sterile. Despite the safety of process cheese sauce during processing, its low acid and high moisture environment are conducive to support the growth of bacteria contaminated by the consumer. Spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens are particularly problematic because their spores state can survive temperatures above the required reheating temperature of 60 °C and the sub-lethal heating could induce germination in the cheese sauce medium if the product is mishandled. The goal of this project {{was to assess the}} survival and germination potential of sporeforming bacteria in process cheese sauce through typical temperature-abuse schemes that could happen in a food service setting. Commercial cheese sauce was inoculated with cocktails of B. cereus and C. perfringens at 104 CFU/g and held at temperatures of 4, 12, 23, 37, and 45 °C for short-term and long-term <b>storage.</b> <b>Cyclic</b> temperature scenarios typical of commercial buffet restaurants were also evaluated, as well as the use of a common antimicrobial nisin for B. cereus. Three strains of each bacterium were combined and tested in each sample and bacterial counts were determined by direct plating on PEMB agar for B. cereus and anaerobic blood agar for C. perfringens. Bacillus cereus germinated well in the cheese sauce medium. At 37 °C the vegetative cell population reached 8 log CFU/g after 24 hours, but took 48 hours to reach the same level when the antimicrobial nisin was added. At temperatures of 23 °C and 45 °C, vegetative cell populations reached 8 log CFU/g within 48 hours and at 12 °C reached 7 log CFU/g after 1 month. When incubated at 4 °C no growth was observed even after 2 months. Almost no increase in B. cereus spore count was observed at any temperature, except at 23 °C. The B. cereus inoculated cheese sauce was subjected to cyclic temperature abuse schemes that simulated a buffet restaurant schedule. One scenario depicted samples that were not properly heated (below 60 °C) on the buffet line. Short incubation times at abusive temperatures did not influence germination, but after 24 hours of fluctuating temperatures vegetative cells began to grow. However, when the contaminated sample was reheated to temperatures above 60 °C vegetative cells actually began to decrease. The cheese sauce matrix did not support germination and growth of C. perfringens at any temperature. Even during a worst case scenario where the cheese sauce was allowed to cool from 75 °C to 4 °C in a 9 hour period, vegetative cell and spore counts declined below a detectable level. In almost all experiments the vegetative cell population level of bacteria was either maintained or increased in the cheese sauce, while the spore population was maintained. If the process cheese sauce were contaminated by the consumer the potential for an outbreak may exist if left at temperatures favorable for bacterial growth...|$|R
