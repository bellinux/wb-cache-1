50|$|While <b>combination</b> <b>boilers</b> {{have more}} moving parts {{and are thus}} widely held to be less {{reliable}} than tank systems the twin trends towards replacement of parts based on a pre-set design life and replaceable digital controls for 'traditional' systems has largely eroded this distinction.|$|R
50|$|Combination or combi boilers {{combine the}} central heating with {{domestic}} hot water (DHW) in one device. When DHW is used, a <b>combination</b> <b>boiler</b> stops pumping water to the heating circuit and diverts all the boiler's power to heating DHW. Some combis have small internal water storage vessels combining {{the energy of the}} stored water and the gas or oil burner to give faster DHW at the taps or to increase the DHW flow rate.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the methodology with which a detailed simulation {{of a typical}} <b>Combination</b> <b>Boiler</b> (multiple-fuel) was developed for use in training and analysis. The boiler that was simulated is a vintage Riley Traveling Grate Spreader Stoker-fired drum unit that is fired by crushed coal and wood bark. It is controlled by a Digital Control System (DCS) and is installed in a paper-mill powerhouse, {{which is owned by}} a major paper-manufacturing corporation. Many of the personnel who have operated this boiler for the last 30 to 40 years are nearing retirement age, and the customer felt it was important to have a tool which could be used to familiarize new personnel with boiler operations, and to provide training for current personnel as they worked their way to Operator status. In addition, it could be used to evaluate system design changes prior to them being implemented on the real system. The customer desired a simulation platform that was “open, ” that is, not dependent on a control vendor or special hardware. It needed to run in real-time to be useful for training, and it was also required that it be on a personal computer platform utilizing the Windows operating system. The simulator was constructed using general-purpose simulation software and graphic user interface (GUI) tools. The simulator system was delivered on a networked three-PC platform, with touch-screens and a special keyboard for emulating the actual DCS keyboard. The resulting simulation includes very detailed mathematical models of the combustion and steam generation processes. The simulator is used to teach startup, shutdown, maneuvering and the proper response to various system upsets. It was also utilized as the platform for testing design changes which significantly modified the over-fire air, coal and bark fuel systems, and a complete revision to the boiler control strategy...|$|E
50|$|A plate heat {{exchanger}} {{is a type of}} {{heat exchanger}} that uses metal plates to transfer heat between two fluids. This has a major advantage over a conventional heat exchanger in that the fluids are exposed to a much larger surface area because the fluids spread out over the plates. This facilitates the transfer of heat, and greatly increases the speed of the temperature change. Plate heat exchangers are now common and very small brazed versions are used in the hot-water sections of millions of <b>combination</b> <b>boilers.</b> The high heat transfer efficiency for such a small physical size has increased the domestic hot water (DHW) flowrate of <b>combination</b> <b>boilers.</b> The small {{plate heat exchanger}} has made a great impact in domestic heating and hot-water. Larger commercial versions use gaskets between the plates, whereas smaller versions tend to be brazed.|$|R

50|$|<b>Combination</b> <b>boilers</b> {{require less}} space than {{conventional}} tanked systems, and are significantly cheaper to install, since water tanks and associated pipes and controls are not required. Another {{advantage is that}} more than one unit may be used to supply separate heating zones or multiple bathrooms, giving greater time and temperature control. For example, one 'combi' might supply the downstairs heating system and another the upstairs, duplication guarding against complete loss of heating and DHW in the event that one unit fails, provided that the two systems are interconnected with valves (normally closed).|$|R

40|$|A TPV-system {{consists}} of a hot surface emitting heat radiation on a solar cell with a narrow bandgap.   A unit consisting of a boiler and a TPV-system has been constructed for testing {{of the performance of}} TPV cells. The emitter is heated by a fuel consisting of RME-oil. The radiation is collected and concentrated through two reflecting cones formed like a Faberge-egg, with an edge-type optical filter between the cones. The Faberge-egg is treated with electro-polishing in order to obtain a high reflectance of radiation. The edge filter transmits radiation of short wavelengths towards the solar cells and reflects long wavelengths back to the emitter. This increase the temperature of the emitter to prevent the TPV-cells to be overheated. The construction made was working as expected and can be used for further experiments. The performance of the TPV-cells were however very poor because of a low emitter temperature. The main problem was to obtain a good heat transport from the flame to the emitter. It is required that the emitter temperature is considerably increased for justifying a continued work on TPV-systems in <b>combination</b> with <b>boilers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Heating is {{the most}} {{important}} energy consumer for households in Belgium. The primary energy consumption of a heating system is determined by the net energy demand of the building, but also by the efficiency of the equipment and the way it is used by the inhabitants. To estimate the potential primary energy savings, today’s situation should be analysed first. Therefore, the results of two surveys are combined to sketch current practice in Belgium. The most common systems inWestern Europe, i. e. gas boilers combined with radiators, are then simulated to test their performance in dwellings with varied insulation quality. Typical internal heat gains and set temperature profiles are included, but the influence of the inhabitant behaviour on the heating efficiency is not studied as such. The results show that current practice does lead to important energy losses, resulting in overall efficiencies as low as 30 %, but improvements are possible by using intelligent controllers.

The sequencer also needs a sensor to measure the temperature of the combined output from the boilers and usually would also control a main circulation pump. What happens after a fault occurs (resequencing remaining units, passing fault messages through for display on the room controller, etc.) is also part of the sequencer functionality.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the role of heat buffers to support optimal use of combinations of traditional and renewable heat sources like geothermal heat for greenhouse heating. The objective was to determine the contribution of heat buffers to effective new combinations of resources that satisfy greenhouse heat, carbon dioxide and electricity demand at minimum cost. Tank buffers, basement buffers and aquifers were considered as short and long term buffers. Simulations were carried out for a 10 ha sweet pepper and a 30 ha tomato greenhouse (15 ha intensively lighted). Standard heating systems based on central boiler and co-generation were used as a reference and compared with <b>combinations</b> of <b>boilers,</b> co-generators, geothermal heat and heat buffer strategies. Crop production and greenhouse climate were simulated and resource demand determined for normal greenhouse operation. A linear programming algorithm was used to apply resources and equipment available to the model at minimum cost. Results show that heat buffers help to reduce the required capacity of a geothermal heat source, and increase both the utilisation degree of the source and the cover percentage of greenhouse heat demand. The technically most feasible solution for long term buffering was the basement buffer which allows high buffer volumes without loss of useful space and heat loss contributes to greenhouse heating, however this solution was economically not feasible. Also the deep aquifer was a good option, however exploitation risks and manageability are potential problems. Integration of geothermal heat with other sources resulted in the best solutions that were both technically and economically feasible. Simulation showed at gas price level 30 ¿ct. m- 3, that geothermal heat was cheaper than central boiler and even co-generation heat when hours of operation exceed 1000 h. y- 1.

References [11] and [12] proposed a system using electric boilers with heat storage tanks and demonstrated that this system could {{make a contribution to}} consume additional wind electricity. The electric boilers could increase the wind electricity consumption and enhance the flexibility of CHP units by replacing part of the heat produced by CHP units. Reference [13] developed a dispatch model to optimize the heat and power production from multiple sources, including CHP units, electric boilers, wind power and conventional units. This study demonstrated that electric boilers with heat storage tanks were effective at reducing wind curtailment and primary energy consumption. Reference [14] also introduced electric boilers and developed a stochastic partial equilibrium model of the power system. The results showed that the electric boilers could replace part of the heat production of oil-fired heat boilers and CHP plants and were beneficial for the integration of wind power and fuel saving.

40|$|Co-combustion {{of biomass}} or waste {{together}} with a base fuel in a boiler is a simple and economically suitable way to replace fossil fuels by biomass and to utilise waste. Co-combustion in a high-efficiency power station means utilisation of biomass and waste with a higher thermal efficiency than what otherwise had been possible. Due to transport limitations, the additional fuel will only supply a minor part (less than a few hundreds MWfuel) of the energy in a plant. There are several options: co-combustion with coal in pulverised or fluidised bed boilers, combustion on added grates inserted in pulverised coal boilers, combustors for added fuel coupled in parallel to the steam circuit of a power plant, external gas producers delivering its gas to replace an oil, gas or pulverised fuel burner.

40|$|AbstractThe {{overall goal}} of this work was to show {{experimentally}} using a CO 2 capture plant of reasonable capacity the contributions of plant and solvent optimization to minimizing the steam requirement. Experimental studies were conducted in an optimized CO 2 capture pilot plant to evaluate the performance of RS- 1 solvent and 5 molar aqueous MEA. The first objective was to test a highly improved plant configuration that can minimize both the amine circulation rate and the steam requirements below the values {{reported in the literature}} for a desired CO 2 recovery. The second objective was to show the superior performance of RS- 1 relative to 5  molar MEA. Both these strategies were aimed at reducing the steam requirement without increasing the size or complexity of the CO 2 capture plant. The pilot plant used for the tests was the highly optimized multi-purpose technology development plant at the International Test Center for CO 2 capture which processes 186  Nm 3 /h of flue gas to produce CO 2 with a nominal capacity of 1 tonne per day. This plant has 12 -inch ID for the absorber and stripper columns. The inlet flue gas temperature was 40 ∘C while the CO 2 concentrations in the flue gas were 4 and 8 % based on exhaust gases obtained respectively from a natural gas turbine-natural gas <b>boiler</b> <b>combination,</b> and a natural gas boiler. The results show that for flue gas containing 4 and 8 % CO 2 for a 90 % recovery or absorber efficiency, the steam duties using our optimized plant configuration were respectively 2. 03 and 1. 43  kg steam/kg CO 2 for MEA as compared to industry and literature values based on conventional plant configuration in the range of 1. 9 to 2. 5  kg steam/kg CO 2 depending on the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas. When RS- 1 solvent was used, the steam duties using the optimized plant configuration were respectively 1. 74 and 1. 35  kg steam/kg CO 2 which showed improvements over the corresponding performance of 5 molar MEA. It was interesting to observe that with a completely modified and optimized process configuration, the heat duty using RS- 1 was 1  kg steam/kg CO 2.
