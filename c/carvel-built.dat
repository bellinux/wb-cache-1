5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a <b>carvel-built</b> wooden ship.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} boats were built beside the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. Richard Dunston {{set up a}} boatyard at Thorne, on the north bank just below the lock, in 1858, after selling his {{previous}} boatyard at Torksey. He initially constructed clinker-built sailing barges, capable of carrying up to 80 tons. The boatyard was fairly self-contained, using timber which was grown locally and was sawn by hand at the yard. It included a ropewalk, which made ropes for many industries in the locality, {{as well as for}} rigging of the boats, and supplied sails, masts and chandlery to much of the Humber region. Gradually, <b>carvel-built</b> barges with their smoother hulls replaced clinker-built ones, and boat sizes became more standard, with Sheffield-sized keels and larger sloops. Shortly after Richard's grandson took over the yard in 1910, it was remodelled to build iron and steel ships, and only one wooden boat was built subsequently.|$|E
25|$|Carvel {{construction}} {{dates back}} even earlier. The {{design of the}} luzzu is believed to date {{back at least to}} Phoenician times. A luzzu is a double-ended <b>carvel-built</b> fishing boat from the Maltese islands. Traditionally, they are brightly painted in shades of yellow, red, green and blue, and the bow is normally pointed with a pair of eyes. These eyes may be the modern survival of an ancient Phoenician custom (also practiced by the ancient Greeks); they are sometimes (and probably inaccurately) referred to as the Eye of Horus or of Osiris. The luzzu has survived because it tends to be a sturdy and stable boat even in bad weather. Originally, the luzzu was equipped with sails although nowadays almost all are motorised, with onboard diesel engines being the most common.|$|E

500|$|The keel of {{the future}} Mary Celeste was laid in late 1860 at the {{shipyard}} of Joshua Dewis {{in the village of}} Spencer's Island, on the shores of the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. The ship was constructed of locally felled timber, with two masts, and was rigged as a brigantine; she was <b>carvel-built,</b> with the hull planking flush rather than overlapping. She was launched on May 18, 1861, given the name Amazon, and registered at nearby Parrsboro on June 10, 1861. Her registration documents described her as [...] in length, [...] broad, with a depth of , and of 198.42 gross tonnage. She was owned by a local consortium of nine people, headed by Dewis; among the co-owners was Robert McLellan, the ship's first captain.|$|E

The lowermost deck, the main deck at gunwale level, was the freight house. Above this, and approximately the same size, was the saloon deck, carrying much of the vessel's passenger accommodation and facilities. Uppermost was the smaller, punningly titled 'Texas' deck, carrying larger staterooms for the captain, senior crew and first class passengers. Surmounting the Texas was the pilothouse, from which the vessel was commanded. In this configuration, the Keno gross tonnage was 553.17tons.|$|E
60|$|Ten {{years ago}} all the bawleys were clinker-built--that is, with the streaks {{overlapping}} each other, as in boats; {{but the new}} bawleys are now all <b>carvel-built,</b> the planks being placed edge to edge, so as to give a smooth surface, as in yachts and large vessels. They now {{for the most part}} carry spinnakers, boomed out when running before the wind, and balloon foresails, thereby greatly adding to their speed in light winds. One peculiarity of the bawleys is that, when at anchor, the mainsail, instead of being stowed with its spars parallel to the deck, is made up on its gaff, which is then hoisted with the throat seven or eight feet up the mast, while the peak rests on the stern.|$|E

50|$|The {{ship was}} built in Frederikssund, Denmark in 1922. The hull was <b>carvel-built</b> from oak. She was rigged as a three-masted topsail schooner. The ship is 39.6 m in length overall, with a beam of 6.7 m and a draught of 3 m.|$|E
50|$|The ship is also {{significant}} for being <b>carvel-built,</b> the oldest such found in Nordic waters, which {{were at the}} time dominated by clinker-built ships. Surveys of the wreck indicate the ship had a length of 35 m and a beam of 7.5 m. The keel is oriented northeast to southwest.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the clinker design {{created a}} vessel that could twist and flex {{relative}} to the long axis of the vessel (from bow to stern). This gave it an advantage in North Atlantic rollers {{so long as the}} vessel was small in overall displacement. Increasing the beam, due to the light nature of the method, did not commensurately increase the vessel's survivability under the torsional forces of rolling waves; greater beam widths may, in fact, have made the resultant vessels more vulnerable. Thus, the greater rigidity of <b>carvel-built</b> construction became necessary for larger non-coastal cargo vessels, as the twisting forces grew in proportion to displaced (or cargo) weight. The physics of this imposed an upper limit on the size of clinker-built vessels. Later <b>carvel-built</b> sailing vessels exceeded the maximum size of clinker-built ships several times over. However, clinker construction remains to this day a valuable method of construction for small wooden vessels.|$|E
5000|$|The Bremer cog had one mast and was square-rigged, with a <b>carvel-built</b> {{bottom and}} clinch-built sides. The rib timber {{was built in}} after the hull had been made. [...] The cog was 24 m long, 8 m in the beam and just over 4 m high on the sides. These {{measurements}} would have produced an estimated load capacity of 130 tons. Other estimates put the cargo capacity at only 90 tons.|$|E

50|$|The hullform is {{designed}} for bent wood, laid with overlapping ends (clinker-built), easy for amateur builders with low budgets. However, the association has been reasonably flexible. In 1949, they approved <b>carvel-built</b> boats (ends of the hull planking butt, rather than overlap). In 1976, an inexpensive (gun-shot flock) fiberglass hull was approved. In 1999, after persistent reasonable argument by a certain Swedish aerospace engineer, the association accepted a design for an aluminum mast, whisker and spinnaker poles.|$|E

Once Freda is restored, it also will be available for sails on San Francisco Bay, as will select boats built by the Arques School of Traditional Boatbuilding.|$|E
50|$|Galleons were {{constructed}} from oak (for the keel), pine (for the masts) and various hardwoods for hull and decking. Hulls were usually <b>carvel-built.</b> The expenses involved in galleon construction were enormous. Hundreds of expert tradesmen (including carpenters, pitch-melters, blacksmiths, coopers, shipwrights, etc.) worked {{day and night}} for months before a galleon was seaworthy. To cover the expense, galleons were often funded by groups of wealthy businessmen who pooled resources for a new ship. Therefore, most galleons were originally consigned for trade, although those captured by rival states were usually put into military service.|$|E
5000|$|Hulks {{continued}} to be mentioned in use throughout the Middle Ages and into the 16th century, when it is particularly associated with the Baltic and the Hanseatic League. These late hulks could be as large as contemporary great ships. Jesus of Lübeck of 1544 was a ship of 700 tons, {{the same as the}} Mary Rose. However, how similar later medieval hulks were to their ancestors is unknown. There is some evidence of a hybridisation with the cog form, showing both hulk and post construction. [...] Others have suggested that late hulks were partially <b>carvel-built.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{constructed}} by Søren Larsen and Sons at their shipyard in Nykøbing Mors. She is 42.7 m in length overall, with {{a beam of}} 7.8 m, and a draught of 3.2 m. The hull was <b>carvel-built</b> primarily from oak and beech. She was originally galeas-rigged, with an auxiliary engine. The [...] B&W Alpha diesel could propel the ship at 7 kn. The ship's single hold was accessible through three hatches. Søren Larsen was named after her builder, {{and was one of}} the last ships produced by the shipyard.|$|E
50|$|In {{its most}} {{developed}} form, the carrack was a <b>carvel-built</b> ocean-going ship: {{large enough to}} be stable in heavy seas, and for a large cargo and the provisions needed for very long voyages. The later carracks were square-rigged on the foremast and mainmast and lateen-rigged on the mizzenmast. They had a high rounded stern with large aftcastle, forecastle and bowsprit at the stem. As the predecessor of the galleon, the carrack {{was one of the most}} influential ship designs in history; while ships became more specialized in the following centuries, the basic design remained unchanged throughout this period.|$|E
50|$|There is {{an upper}} {{limit to the}} size of clinker built vessels, which could be and was {{exceeded}} by several orders of magnitude in later large sailing vessels incorporating <b>carvel-built</b> construction. Clinker requires relatively wide planking stock compared to carvel, as carvel can employ stealers to reduce plank widths amidships where the girth is greatest. The need for sufficient lap to accept the clench fastenings drives towards wider planks in proportion to thickness that can be employed in carvel. In all other areas of construction including framing, deck, etc., clinker is as capable as carvel. Clinker construction remains to this day a valuable method of construction for small wooden vessels.|$|E

50|$|As {{guns were}} made more durable to {{withstand}} stronger gunpowder charges, they increased their potential to inflict critical {{damage to the}} vessel rather than just their crews. Since these guns were much heavier than the earlier anti-personnel weapons, {{they had to be}} placed lower in the ships, and fire from gunports, to avoid ships becoming unstable. In Northern Europe the technique of building ships with clinker planking made it difficult to cut ports in the hull; clinker-built (or clench-built) ships had much of their structural strength in the outer hull. The solution was the gradual adoption of <b>carvel-built</b> ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship. Gunports cut in the hull of ships were not introduced until 1501, at the very start of the early modern period.|$|E

50|$|Mersey flats were sailing barges {{that were}} used in the inland {{waterways}} of Northwest England. They were <b>carvel-built</b> with rounded bilges and sterns, and had a shallow draught. As originally built, the flats had a single mast that could be lowered or lifted out. Typically they were about 70 ft long by 14 ft wide. Some flats were larger and could be used as small coasters. Other flats were unrigged and were designed to be pulled by horses or tugs, but strong enough to survive conditions on the river estuaries. The waterways in which the flats were used were the rivers Mersey, Dee and Weaver, and canals and navigations such as the Bridgewater Canal, the Sankey Canal, the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, the Weaver Navigation, the Rochdale Canal, the Chester Canal and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>carvel-built</b> {{ships were}} the carracks and caravels {{of the fourteenth}} and fifteenth centuries. Both were {{developed}} in Iberia and were sailed by the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain in the early trans-oceanic voyages of the Age of Discovery. At {{the same time as}} their appearance, the centuries-long battles to expel the Muslims from Iberia were gradually swinging to the Christian side, represented by the Kingdom of Aragon and the Kingdom of Castile, which were not united into Spain until the time of Christopher Columbus. Their invention is generally credited to the Portuguese, who first explored the Atlantic islands and south along the coast of Africa, searching for a trade route to the Far East {{in order to avoid the}} costly middlemen of the Eastern Mediterranean civilizations who sat upon the routes of the spice trade. Spices, in the era, were expensive luxuries and were used medicinally.|$|E
50|$|The 'Trading Wherry' {{developed}} from the Keel. It is double-ended, its hull painted black with a white nose to aid visibility after dusk. Most trading wherries were clinker-built, but Albion, surviving today, was the sole example to be <b>carvel-built.</b> They carry a gaff rig, the sail historically also black from being treated {{with a mixture of}} tar and fish oil to protect it from the elements. The mast tops and wind vanes were often painted or shaped (respectively) to identify the wherry's owner - a traditional design is a 'Jenny Morgan', after a folk song character. Sizes varied, but many of these vessels would carry around 25 tons of goods. Wherries were able to reach larger boats just off the coast at Great Yarmouth or Lowestoft and take their cargoes off to be transported inland through the broads and rivers. The last trading wherry, Ella, was built in 1912.|$|E
5000|$|The ship is a {{descendant}} of the Saxon ship of the fifth century AD. The term [...] "keel" [...] {{is derived from the}} Anglo-Saxon word [...] "ceol", which referred to a ship built using a longitudinal strengthending beam (keel) together with a single mast and square rigging. The remains of keels from the 13th century have been excavated, and the keel is identified as a specific class of ship in the Tudor records kept by the Corporation of York. Early keels were designed to work in waterways which were only 3.5 ft deep, but could still carry 40 to 50 tonnes of cargo. Such boats were clinker-built, meaning that the planks overlapped one another, but this gradually gave way to carvel construction, where the planks join edge to edge. First the bottom of the hull was <b>carvel-built,</b> with the sides still clinker-built, and then the whole boat used the newer method.|$|E
50|$|The Blackfriars I {{was built}} frame-first, {{meaning that the}} frame of the ship was built before {{building}} the rest of the ship. This method was much faster and saved wood, and was advanced for the period. Marsden described the ship as having a <b>carvel-built</b> hull caulked with hazel twigs, mast-step and thick floors secured with nails. On the ship, a bronze votive coin of the Emperor Domitian was found in the mast of the ship. In addition, it was discovered that the ship was wrecked while carrying cargo that consisted of 26 LT of Kentish ragstone, a type of building stone. With further findings about the area of operation of the ship, Marsden suggested Blackfriars I was used for constructions purposes. The rest of the cargo included: two pottery sherds, a wooden mallet, and a piece of leather. Marsden was able to conclude, using the location and position of the wreck that it crashed into another vessel, a collision which was responsible for the ship sinking.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be able to {{navigate}} Stewart River, BYN Co. construction foreman A.E. Henderson specifically designed SS Keno for shallow water operation. As built, she was 130.5 ft long, with a beam of 29.2 ft. For comparison, the second SS Klondike, completed eight years after the Keno for service on the main river routes, was over 200 ft long and had a beam in excess of 40 ft. Most importantly, in service the Keno draught was typically only between two and three feet (0.6 to 0.9 m), and with a light load as little as 21 in. Her hull was constructed from wood, <b>carvel-built,</b> and her superstructure was arranged in a three deck configuration typical of sternwheelers.
