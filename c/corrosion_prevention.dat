25|$|The {{process of}} {{compressing}} gas into a diving cylinder removes {{moisture from the}} gas. This is good for <b>corrosion</b> <b>prevention</b> in the cylinder but means that the diver inhales very dry gas. The dry gas extracts moisture from the diver's lungs while underwater contributing to dehydration, which is also {{thought to be a}} predisposing risk factor of decompression sickness. It is also uncomfortable, causing a dry mouth and throat and making the diver thirsty. This problem is reduced in rebreathers because the soda lime reaction, which removes carbon dioxide, also puts moisture back into the breathing gas. In hot climates, open circuit diving can accelerate heat exhaustion because of dehydration. Another concern with regard to moisture content is the tendency of moisture to condense as the gas is decompressed while passing through the regulator; this coupled with the extreme reduction in temperature, also due to the decompression can cause the moisture to solidify as ice. This icing up in a regulator can cause moving parts to seize and the regulator to fail or free flow.|$|E

The influence of steam {{concentration in the}} gas phase on chloride-induced corrosion process was presented.

The effect of alkali metals chlorides in gas phase (Na,K) Cl on formation of (Na,K) FeO 2 in the passive oxide scale layer (FeO/Fe 3 O 4 /Fe 2 O 3) was analysed. Condensation of (Na,K) Cl vapors, formation of low-melting eutectic mixtures in deposits and consequences of this process on corrosion process were examined. Additionally, the role of SO 2 in chlorination and oxidation process of steel in melted ash deposits was discussed as well.

However, this business case analysis did not evaluate the impact of the use of advanced boat lifts on potential improvements to small boat acquisition costs. Navy officials told GAO that the use of advanced boat lifts would not significantly contribute to extending the service life of the boats or produce any other additional benefits that would lead to reduced small boat acquisition costs. This is primarily because a critical feature of current procurement strategies is to select, specify, or design boats that are made from corrosion-resistant materials and use components that are corrosion resistant.

40|$|The {{significant}} dollar {{losses that}} can occur when metallic products are damaged or lost, due to rust and corrosion, force many manufacturers to concentrate efforts on <b>corrosion</b> control and <b>prevention</b> during packaging, shipping and storage. Many people often simply accept corrosion as an inevitable problem. Actually, something {{can and should be}} done to prolong the life of many metals exposed to corrosive environments. Many of the standard methods to control corrosion, paint, grease and wax, for example, are messy, time consuming and expensive. These methods also pose a potential threat to the environment unless properly treated and disposed. An alternative way to protect metals against corrosion - without dipping, cleaning, expensive waste treatment and without damaging the environment is represented by volatile corrosion inhibitors. Volatile (or vapor) corrosion inhibitors (VCI) condition an enclosed atmosphere with a protective vapor that condenses on all metal surfaces including recessed areas and cavities not reached with conventional methods. The VCI ions form a thin, monomolecular protective film at the metal surface, forming a barrier that self -replenishes through further condensation on the vapor 2. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare and evaluate the corrosion protection capabilities of packaging materials treated with volatile corrosion inhibitors. The hypothesis of this particular study was that combinations of VCI treated packaging materials (LDPE and LLDPE films, foam and emitters) can offer a moderate to high degree of protection for multi-metal machined parts exposed to a highly corrosive environment. The study determined that VCI materials, when properly applied, can provide high levels of protection for machined metal parts...|$|R
