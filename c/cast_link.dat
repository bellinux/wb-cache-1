40|$|A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a {{temporary}} and infrastructure less dynamic network in which all nodes are mobiles and they {{communicate with each other}} via wireless connections. There is no central control and this network demands new networking strategies because of the topology of this network is regularly changing due to the frequent mobility of nodes. MANET is using the TCP/IP traditional structure and needs redefinition or alterations in each layer because of the limited resource and mobility. In MANET, routing is a challenging task and it requires the development of different routing protocol, new dynamic and routing techniques. This paper provides an overview and analysis of various basic routing techniques, strategies, clustering, MANET architectures and protocols. Further, this work specifically studies and analysis the unicast, multicast, broad <b>cast,</b> <b>link</b> state and distance-vector routing protocols and also discusses the cluster based routing techniques. The link-state or distance-vector routing technique is used in the topology based protocols. Link state routing is better for large network because of fast convergence, loop less convergence and support of multiple metrics. So the link state routing is better than the distance vector routing...|$|E

5000|$|The {{roots of}} Berlin iron {{jewellery}} in Berlin {{can be traced}} back to the establishment of the Königliche Eisengiesserei bei Berlin or Royal Berlin Foundry in 1804. The Royal Berlin Foundry started with the production of iron goods such as vases, knife stands, candelabra, bowls, plaques and medallions, as well as more commercial articles such as fences, bridges and garden furniture. The first jewellery items, such as long chains with <b>cast</b> <b>links,</b> were produced in 1806. Later, necklaces consisting of medallions and joined with links and wirework mesh were manufactured. When Napoleon took Berlin in 1806 the moulds appear to have been taken back to France where further production took place for some years.|$|R

50|$|Almost immediately, {{however, the}} concept for the {{historical}} octology ran into trouble. Messina {{had wanted to}} shoot the eight sequential history plays in chronological order of the events they depicted, with <b>linked</b> <b>casting</b> and the same director for all eight adaptations (David Giles), with the sequence spread out over the entire six season run. During the early planning stages for King Richard the Second and The First Part of King Henry the Fourth however, the plan for <b>linked</b> <b>casting</b> fell apart, when {{it was discovered that}} although Jon Finch (Henry Bolingbroke in Richard) could return as Henry IV, Jeremy Bulloch as Hotspur and David Swift as the Earl of Northumberland were unable to do so, and the parts would have to be recast, thus undermining the concept of shooting the plays as one sequence. Ultimately, during the first season, King Richard the Second, although still directed by Giles, was treated as a stand-alone piece, whilst The First Part of King Henry the Fourth, The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth and The Life of Henry the Fift (all also directed by Giles) were treated as a trilogy during the second season, with <b>linked</b> <b>casting</b> between them. Additionally, in an attempt to establish a connection with the first season's Richard, Jon Finch returned as Henry IV, and The First Part of King Henry the Fourth opened with the murder of Richard from the previous play. The second set of four plays were then directed by Jane Howell as one unit, with a common set and <b>linked</b> <b>casting,</b> airing during the fifth season.|$|R

50|$|On 11 August actual {{construction}} began; on 16 August Tritton {{decided to}} fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It {{soon became clear that}} the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the bottom profile was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the track sagged and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balatá belting and flat wire ropes. Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to <b>cast</b> <b>links</b> and incorporated guides to engage {{on the inside of the}} track frame. The track frames as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed.|$|R
5000|$|Apparently {{the metal}} workers of ancient Igbo-Ukwu {{were not aware}} of {{commonly}} used techniques such as wire making, soldering or riveting which suggests an independent development and long isolation of their metal working tradition. It is therefore perplexing {{that they were able to}} create objects with such fine surface detail that they depict, for example small insects which seem to have landed on the surface. Though these appear to have been riveted or soldered on to the artifacts, they were actually cast in one piece. The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art describes them as being [...] "among the most inventive and technically accomplished bronzes ever made." [...] Although the lost wax casting process was used to produce the bronzes, latex was probably used in Igbo-Ukwu instead of beeswax which would explain how the artists were able to produce such fine and filigrann surface detail. Some of the techniques used by the ancient smiths are not known to have been used outside Igbo-Ukwu such as the production of complex objects in stages with the different parts later fixed together by brazing or by <b>casting</b> <b>linking</b> sections to join them. However the complexity of some of the Igbo-Ukwu objects has led to considerable altercation between various metallurgic experts and debates regarding the actual production process which is an affidavit for the highly developed and intricate work of the ancient artists.|$|R

40|$|Probabilistic record linkage, {{the task}} of merging two or more {{databases}} {{in the absence of}} a unique identifier, is a perennial and challenging problem. It is closely related to the problem of deduplicating a single database, which can be <b>cast</b> as <b>linking</b> a single database against itself. In both cases the number of possible links grows rapidly in the size of the databases under consideration, and in most applications it is necessary to first reduce the number of record pairs that will be compared.

These methods go under a variety of names, including indexing and blocking, and have seen significant development. However, methods for inferring linkage structure that account for indexing, blocking, and additional filtering steps have not seen commensurate development. In this paper we review the implications of indexing, blocking and filtering within the popular Fellegi-Sunter framework, and propose a new model to account for particular forms of indexing and filtering...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel task of {{automatically}} link-ing Wikipedia excerpts describing events to past news arti-cles. Constantly evolving Wikipedia articles tend to sum-marize past events by abstracting fine-grained details that mattered when the event happened. On the other hand, contemporary news articles provide details of events, as they had happened. With connections between these two orthog-onal information sources in place, a user could jump between them to acquire a holistic view on past events. We <b>cast</b> the <b>linking</b> problems into two retrieval tasks and propose a sin-gle framework for addressing them. In addition, we delin-eate challenges involved in both these tasks and propose a framework to address these challenges. To build {{a better understanding of the}} problem, we ini-tially consider the simpler task of linking Wikipedia events that are systematically curated into years, decades and cen-turies, to relevant news articles from the past. These events come with a short textual description and a date indicating when the event happened. We present a two-stage cascade approach that leverages the temporal information associated to a given event for improving the linking effectiveness. We additionally design several baselines and show that our ap-proach outperforms all the baselines. Through the results of studying the simplified task we come a step closer to solving the larger problem proposed in this paper. As future work, we plan to build an automatic linking system that answers to the challenges identified in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Location-based social {{networks}} (LBSNs) are {{one kind of}} online {{social networks}} offering geographic services and have been attracting much attention in recent years. LBSNs usually have complex structures, involving heterogeneous nodes and links. Many recommendation services in LBSNs (e. g., friend and location recommendation) can be <b>cast</b> as <b>link</b> prediction problems (e. g., social link and location link prediction). Traditional link prediction researches on LBSNs mostly focus on predicting either social links or location links, assuming the prediction tasks {{of different types of}} links to be independent. However, in many real-world LBSNs, the prediction tasks for social links and location links are strongly correlated and mutually influential. Another key challenge in link prediction on LBSNs is the data sparsity problem (i. e., “new network ” problem), which can be encountered when LBSNs branch into new geographic areas or social groups. Actually, nowadays, many users are involved in multiple networks simultaneously and users who just join one LBSN may have been using other LBSNs for a long time. In this paper, we study the problem of predicting multiple types of links simultaneously for a new LBSN across partially aligned LBSNs and propose a novel method TRAIL (TRAnsfer heterogeneous lInks across LBSNs). TRAIL can accumulate information for locations from online posts and extract heterogeneous features for both social links and location links. TRAIL can predict multiple types of links simultaneously. In addition, TRAIL can transfer information from other aligned networks to the new network {{to solve the problem of}} lacking information. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world aligned LBSNs show that TRAIL can achieve very good performance and substantially outperform the baseline methods...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) {{has been studying}} the feasibility of provisioning the Quality-of-Service in such a network. One major factor that makes this a difficult task is the node mobility, which induces a dynamic network topology and makes a multi-hop path susceptible to abrupt breakage when any of its constituent links breaks. It is therefore desirable to acquire predictive knowledge of the path lifetime, which reflects its reliability and is {{closely associated with the}} lifetime of each constituent link. We first study how node mobility impacts the lifetime of a path in the MANET, and propose three algorithms that employ link age as the decision parameter to select the best path from all available paths between the sender (source) and recipient (destination) of data for transmissions. Performance evaluation results show that these path-selection algorithms achieve a robust performance in choosing a path that meets a specified path-lifetime requirement. We next propose the Mobile-projected Trajectory (MPT) algorithm that employs four periodically measured distances between two nodes of a link to compute the relative movement trajectory and the remaining lifetime of a link. This algorithm is based on linear curve fitting, and does not require any knowledge of node position, speed, and direction. To account for the frequent occurrences of velocity change during the link lifetime, we propose a simple velocity-change detection test that is augmented to the MPT. The new algorithm, Mobile-Projected Trajectory with Velocity Change Detection, improves the performance of the algorithm by recomputing the remaining link lifetime more accurately after a velocity change is detected. We also propose a novel link lifetime prediction algorithm based on the Unscented Kalman Filter, which <b>casts</b> the <b>link</b> lifetime as a non-linear dynamic system model, and recursively estimates its states to compute the remaining link lifetime. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm demonstrates robust performance to estimate the link lifetime while nodes move along various trajectories induced by velocity changes...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} {{literature}} on economic growth there is disagreement over {{the relationship between}} growth and volatility and their relative benefits and costs in welfare terms. An analytical resolution of this issue, which has serious implications for domestic and international development policies, has been seen to be contingent upon how relative risk aversion and intertemporal substitutability are related in frameworks characterizing utility maximization of representative agents. It is commonly assumed that these aspects of preferences are rigidly <b>linked,</b> <b>casting</b> doubt on the expected utility maximizing paradigm as an appropriate modeling methodology for analyzing this important issue. In this paper it is first shown that these concerns are only relevant for special functional forms that enforce a unitary consumption elasticity of wealth. Next, a theoretical approach is employed to specify a more general relationship between risk aversion and intertemporal substitutability. The theoretical model is developed {{in the context of}} a two country representative agent model where risk affects domestic and direct foreign investment in both countries. The two country orientation is also capable of interpretation of the relationship between one country and the rest of the world. In a preliminary empirical application of the methodology to South African data, we attempt estimation of the parameters of generalized functions for preferences and technology which are capable of distinguishing between risk aversion and intertemporal substitutability. ...|$|R
