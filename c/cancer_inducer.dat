40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to investigate the effect of Phyllanthus amarus extracts on serum biochemical changes in azaserine induced pancreatic cancer in Wistar rats. Materials and Methods: Pancreatic cancer was developed in Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of azaserine (<b>cancer</b> <b>inducer)</b> for 21 days at the concentration of 5 mg/kg body weight. Aqueous and alcoholic extracts were given to rats of different groups as per protocol. Results: The results data revealed that oral administration of P. amarus extracts had {{a significant change in}} pancreatic amylase, lipase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Conclusion: We concluded that extract of P. amarus possessed chemoprotective activity against azaserine induced pancreatic cancer in Wistar rats...|$|E
40|$|The tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4 -(N-methyl-N-nitrosoamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK), is {{a potent}} lung <b>cancer</b> <b>inducer.</b> However, how NNK induces lung cancer is still largely unknown. Haem oxygenase (HO) - 1 was {{evaluated}} in 30 pairs of lung cancer tumour samples and matched nontumour tissues from patients {{with a history of}} cigarette smoking. Expression of HO- 1, p 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1 /Cid 1 (p 21), B-cell lymphoma (Bcl) - 2 family members, mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor (NF) -κB was also studied in lung cancer cells treated with NNK. The levels of HO- 1 and p 21 were significantly increased in lung tumour tissues. There was a positive relationship between these two proteins in the tumour. NNK stimulated lung cell proliferation and elevated the levels of HO- 1, p 21, inhibitor of apoptosis protein (c-IAP) 2 and Bcl- 2, but downregulated Bad. These effects of NNK were blocked by zinc protoporphyrin-XII, an HO- 1 inhibitor. The NNK-mediated expression of HO- 1 was governed by NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2, since blocking either of these prevented the stimulatory effect of NNK on HO- 1, as well as molecules downstream of HO- 1, such as p 21, c-IAP 2, Bcl- 2 and Bad. In conclusion, haem oxygenase- 1 plays a central role in NNK-mediated cell proliferation by promoting the expression of p 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1 /Cid 1, inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 and B-cell lymphoma- 2 but inhibiting the activity of Bad. Nuclear factor-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 function upstream of haem oxygenase- 1. Therefore, haem oxygenase- 1 {{is likely to be a}} potential target in the treatment of smoking-related lung cancer. Copyright©ERS Journals Ltd 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Radiotherapy is the {{feasible}} treatment {{approach for}} many malignant diseases and cancers. New radiotherapy {{techniques such as}} ion therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and intensity modulated radiation therapy deliver higher low dose radiation to large volume of normal tissues and are in debating as more secondary <b>cancers</b> <b>inducers.</b> A secondary <b>cancer</b> after radiotherapy {{is an important issue}} that reduces treatment efficiency and should be decreased. Radioprotective compounds are of importance in clinical radiation therapy for saving normal tissues. In the present study, we are so interest to introduce, suggest and review the application of biological radioprotectors in radiotherapy. We propose probiotics, prebiotics, gas, vitamin and nanoparticle producing microorganisms as new biological systems based radioprotectors to protect normal tissues. Also, we reviewed the main biological pathways, molecules and also radioadaptive response that act as radioprotectors. In this review we tried to address the secondary cancer induction by radiotherapy and also main biological radiation protection approaches, although there is a wealth of data in this subject.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Among the PAH {{class of}} compounds, high {{molecular}} weight PAH are now considered as relevant <b>cancer</b> <b>inducers,</b> {{but not all of}} them have the same biological activity. However, their analysis is difficult, mainly due to the presence of numerous isomers and due to their low volatility. Retention indices (Ri) for 13 dibenzopyrenes and homologues were determined by high-resolution capillary gas chromatography (GC) with four different stationary phases: a 5 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane column (DB- 5 ms), a 35 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane column (BPX- 35), a 50 % phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane column (BPX- 50), and a 35 % trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane stationary phase (Rtx- 200). Correlations for retention on each phase were investigated by using 8 independent molecular descriptors. Ri {{has been shown to be}} linearly correlated to PAH volume, polarisability alpha, Hückel-pi energy on the four examined columns. Ionisation potential Ip is a fourth variable which improves the regression model for DB- 5 ms, BPX- 35, and BPX- 50 column. Correlation coefficients ranging from r 2 = 0. 935 to r 2 = 0. 952 are then observed. Application of these indices to the identification and quantification of PAH with MW 302 in certified diesel particulate matter SRM 1650 a is presented and discussed.

Beavis, A. Tahtouh, M. Ribaux, O. Kirkbride, P. Roux, C. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2015 - 01 Forensic Science International 24655 - 64 <![CDATA[This study focuses on methylamphetamine (MA) seizures made by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to investigate the use of chemical profiling in an intelligence perspective. Correlation coefficients were used to obtain a similarity degree between a population of linked samples and a population of unlinked samples. Although it was demonstrated that a general framework can be followed for the use of any forensic case data in an intelligence-led perspective, threshold values have to be re-evaluated for each type of illicit drug investigated. Unlike the results obtained in a previous study on 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) seizures, chemical profiles of MA samples coming from the same seizure showed relative inhomogeneity, limiting their ability to link seizures. Different hypotheses were investigated to obtain a better understanding of this inhomogeneity although no trend was observed. These findings raise an interesting discussion in regards to the homogeneity and representativeness of illicit drug seizures (for intelligence purposes). Further, it also provides some grounds to discuss the initial hypotheses and assumptions that most forensic science studies are based on...|$|R
40|$|As a novel {{target for}} breast <b>cancer,</b> {{interferon}} <b>inducers</b> have found {{its role as}} anti-angiogenic agents with diethylaminoethyl dextran (DEAE-Dextran) being a molecule used for centuries as a transfection agent. Our results herein offer {{an explanation for the}} emergence of DEAE-Dextran as an anti-tumor agent for TNBC with in-depth mechanistic approach as an anti-angiogenic molecule. DEAE-Dextran has found to possess cytotoxic activity demonstrated during the various in vitro cytotoxicity assays; moreover, as an anti-oxidant, DEAE-Dextran has shown to possess excellent reactive oxygen species scavenging activity. The interferon inducing capacity of DEAE-Dextran was determined qualitatively as well as quantitatively specifically demonstrating overexpression of β-interferon. As a measure of anti-proliferative activity, DEAE-Dextran exhibited reduced ki 67, p 53, and PCNA levels. Also, overexpression of CK 5 / 6 and p 63 in DEAE-Dextran treated animals indicated improvement in breast cell morphology along with an improvement in cell–cell adhesion by virtue of upregulation of β-catenin and E-cadherin. Anti-angiogenic property of DEAE-Dextran was concluded by the downregulation of CD 31, VEGF, and NOTCH 1 both in vivo and in vitro. Further, apoptosis due to DEAE-Dextran, initially determined by downregulation of Bcl 2, was confirmed with flow cytometry. Overall, results are defensive of DEAE-Dextran as an emerging anti-tumor agent with mechanisms pertaining to β-interferon induction with probable VEGF and NOTCH 1 inhibition as well as apoptosis which still needs to be studied in further depth...|$|R
50|$|Different {{transcription}} {{factors that}} have been reported responsible for the regulation of fhl2 expression include the well-known tumor suppressor protein p53, serum response factor (SRF), speciﬁcity protein 1 (Sp1). the pleiotropic factor IL-1β, MEF-2, and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Apart from being regulated by different transcription factors, FHL2 is itself involved extensively in regulating the expression of other genes. FHL2 exerts its transcriptional regulatory effects by functioning as an adaptor protein interacting indirectly with the targeted genes. In fact, LIM domain is a platform {{for the formation of}} multimeric protein complexes. Therefore, FHL2 can contribute to human carcinogenesis by interacting with transcription factors of cancer-related genes and modulates the signaling pathways underlying the expression of these genes. Different types of cancer are associated with FHL2 which act either as the <b>cancer</b> suppressor or <b>inducer,</b> for example in breast cancer, gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, liver cancer and prostate cancer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{sensitivity}} of {{human melanoma cells}} to photoactivated Hypericin (Hyp) compared to aluminium(III) phthalocyanine chloride tetrasulphonate (AlPcS 4 Cl) is reported in this study. Melanoma cells (A 375 cell line) were treated with various concentrations of Hyp or AlPcS 4 Cl alone, for 1, 4, and 24 hrs; varying doses of laser irradiation alone (594 or 682 nm); or optimal concentrations of PSs combined with laser irradiation. Changes in cellmorphology, viability, membrane integrity, and proliferation after treatment of cells were determined using inverted microscopy, Trypan blue cell exclusion, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) membrane integrity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cell proliferation assay, respectively. More than 60 %of cell survival was observed when cells were treated with 2. 5 Mof Hyp or AlPcS 4 Cl alone at all incubation times or with 5 J/cm 2 of 594 or 682 nm laser alone. Combination of PSs and respective lasers leads to a statistically significant incubation time-dependent decrease in survival of cells. Flow cytometry using the FITC Annexin V/PI apoptosis kit demonstrated that cell death induced after Hyp-PDT is via early and late apoptosis whereas early apoptosis was the main mechanism observed with AlPcS 4 Cl-PDT. Hyp-PDT compared to AlPcS 4 Cl-PDT is indicated {{to be a more}} effective <b>cancer</b> cell death <b>inducer</b> in melanoma cells...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{development}} {{in the field of}} nanotechnology is increasingly yielding novel applications of nanoparticles. The unique properties of nanoparticles in particular their high aspect ratio (length : width ratio), however could pose potential risks to the user. A high throughput genetic screening platform, RISCI (robotic single cDNA investigation), was previously established for the systematic evaluation of single gene activities. Here, RISCI was utilised to identify pro-apoptotic genes as well as genes involved in the positive and negative regulation of silica nanoparticle-induced cell death. This project describes the further development of the screening platform by harnessing its capability to screen a cDNA library comprising approximately 30, 000 full length, completely annotated, and sequenced human genes for novel regulators of apoptosis. It integrates an extensive skill sets and is broadly organised into three major phases: Setup, Screen and Analysis. The integration of a pro-apoptosis treatment to screen for inhibitors and sensitizers is a novel aspect of the current experimental setup, along with the low redundancy library. The extensive setup phase focused on technical aspects. The cDNA library, acquired as plasmid DNA, was transformed into a bacterial host for replication and subsequent DNA isolation. A new high-throughput process was developed encompassing the production of competent bacteria and a heat shock transformation protocol, which was subsequently transferred onto the robotic platform. In parallel, the software controlling the robots was redeveloped to allow for execution of user-defined protocols while novel transfection protocols were adapted for automation. The screen identified 699 apoptosis inducers, 1, 141 inhibitors and 626 sensitizers. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the inducers were highly enriched for cell death associated terms, while the inhibitors were strongly associated with <b>cancer</b> profiles. Both <b>inducers</b> and sensitizers were predominantly achieving the functional effect on the protein level, but inhibitors were mainly transcription based. Enriched metal response genes also suggest that the silica nanoparticles were causing their toxicity through reactive oxygen species generation. Intriguingly, the screen identified many noncoding sequences as being functionally capable of regulating apoptosis. These noncoding candidates are capable of regulating the protein coding counterparts identified from the screen. The truly interesting part of the project outcome remains those unknown candidates that were implicated in apoptosis regulation for the first time. Dissemination of the consolidated candidate list would help accelerate the experimental validation of these candidates and aid other researchers in deriving novel hypotheses when the candidates are placed in their research context.
