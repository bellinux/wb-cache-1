50|$|The sig tag {{community}} is notable by {{its emphasis on}} sharing, mutual support, advice and appreciation. In fact, a conventional <b>classing</b> <b>system</b> (Novice, Moderate, Intermediate, Semi-Professional, Professional) is sometimes used to rank people on their skills in making sig tags. Many sig tag websites feature a busy forum and tutorials and users are encouraged to download images. Increasingly, these sites tend to be membership-based.|$|E

The other is a file system repository that contains mappings from metadata to literal configuration. These are combined to form the literal configuration specifications for clients.|$|E
40|$|Length {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} attributes of cotton fibers because it has direct impacts on spinning efficiency, yarn strength, and hairiness, and thus on the properties of fabrics [1 – 6]. Measuring the length and distribution of cot-ton fibers has been a vital component in the current cotton <b>classing</b> <b>system</b> [7]. In principle, the testing methods for fiber length measurement can be grouped as indirect and direct measurements. The indirect measurements include weight-based and photo-based (light-transmission) methods. A commonly used weight-based method is the array method [8], in which fibers are separated manually into different length groups and each group is weighed. From the weight-length data, the upper-quartile length, mean length, and coeffi-cient of length variation are calculated. This method, how...|$|E
50|$|Settla {{features}} a noun <b>class</b> <b>system</b> that differs from standard Swahili, which like most Bantu languages contains a rich noun <b>class</b> <b>system.</b> Since most Settla speakers are native speakers of English, which lacks a complex noun <b>class</b> <b>system,</b> Settla appears to {{also have a}} less complex noun <b>class</b> <b>system</b> than standard Swahili.

50|$|Others {{argue the}} contrary. According to anthropological evidence, for the {{majority}} of the time the human species has been in existence, humans have lived in a manner in which the land and resources were not privately owned. Also, when social ranking did occur, it was not antagonistic or hostile like the current <b>class</b> <b>system.</b> This evidence has been used to support the idea that the existence of a social <b>class</b> <b>system</b> is unnecessary. Overall, society has neither come to a consensus over the necessity of the <b>class</b> <b>system,</b> nor been able to deal with the hostility and prejudice that occurs because of the <b>class</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

The British, coming from a society rigidly divided by class, attempted to equate India's castes with British social classes.

This ranges all the way to zero, which is the case in Komo D23, whose noun <b>class</b> <b>system</b> has faded out over time. Languages that have approximately six classes paired for singular and plural and about six other classes that are not paired (e.g. infinitive and locative classes) are classified as canonical noun <b>class</b> <b>systems,</b> systems that have many noun <b>classes.</b> These <b>systems</b> are far more typical of Bantu languages than the alternative, reduced noun <b>class</b> <b>systems,</b> such as Komo D23 and other languages that have limited noun classes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Scheme {{language}} report advocates language {{design as}} {{the composition of}} a small set of orthogonal constructs, instead of a large accumulation of features. In this paper, we demonstrate how such a design scales {{with the addition of}} a <b>class</b> <b>system</b> to Scheme. Specifically, the PLT Scheme <b>class</b> <b>system</b> is a collection of orthogonal linguistic constructs for creating classes in arbitrary lexical scopes and for manipulating them as first-class values. Due to the smooth integration of classes and the core language, programmers can express mixins and traits, two major recent innovations in the object-oriented world. The <b>class</b> <b>system</b> is implemented as a macro in terms of procedures and a record-type generator; the mixin and trait patterns, in turn, are naturally codified as macros over the <b>class</b> <b>system.</b> 1 Growing a Language The Revised 5 Report on the Scheme programming language [20] starts with the famous proclamation that “[p]rogramming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additiona...|$|R
