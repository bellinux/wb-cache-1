5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over <b>convertibility</b> rested with the five banks of issue. The period of <b>convertibility</b> lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of <b>convertibility</b> was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the <b>convertibility</b> of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency <b>convertibility,</b> in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual <b>convertibility</b> was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, {{a series}} of deposit runs began to have a severe impact {{on the health of}} the banking system, leading the Argentine {{authorities}} to impose a partial deposit freeze. With Argentina no longer in compliance with the conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements. At the end of December, in a climate of severe political and social unrest, the country partially defaulted on its international obligations; in January 2002, it formally abandoned the <b>convertibility</b> regime.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 2015 Macri {{released}} the exchange restrictions, which meant, {{according to the}} opinion of some, that the peso undergoes a devaluation near 40%, It would be the largest recorded since 2002, when <b>convertibility</b> ended. In January 2016 it devaluated again strongly, climbing to 44 Cents Also, the measure of some products for a contraction of consumption. To top it off, unemployment will reach double digits {{as a result of}} current economic measures and the multiplication of layoffs in the public and private sector. Layoffs in the private sector have increased five-fold.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the <b>convertibility</b> of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded {{that this would be a}} bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
5|$|The swiftgate scandal {{broke out}} in 1990, as American investors were damaged by a case of corruption, and asked for {{assistance}} from the United States' Ambassador Terence Todman. Most of the ministers resigned {{as a result of}} it. Cavallo was reassigned as minister of economy, and his successful economic plan turned him into a prominent figure in Menem's cabinet. Cavallo brought a number of independent economists to the cabinet, and Menem supported him by replacing Peronist politicians. Both teams complemented each other. Both Menem and Cavallo tried to be recognized as the designer of the <b>convertibility</b> plan.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, during Sarmiento's presidency, {{total debt}} {{amounted}} to 48 million gold pesos. A year later, it had almost doubled. Avellaneda became president {{after winning the}} 1874 presidential election. The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido Autonomista Nacional, Argentina's first national party; all the presidents until 1916 would come from this party. Avellaneda undertook the tough actions {{needed to get the}} debt under control. In 1876 <b>convertibility</b> was suspended. The inflation rate rose to almost 20% in the following year, but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted. Avellaneda's administration was the first to deliver a balance in the fiscal accounts since the mid-1850s. Avellaneda passed on to his successor, Julio Argentino Roca, a much more manageable economic environment.|$|E
5|$|Menem {{supported}} the Washington Consensus, and tackled inflation with the <b>Convertibility</b> plan in 1991. The plan was complemented {{by a series}} of privatizations, and was a success. Argentina re-established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, suspended since the 1982 Falklands War, and developed special relations with the United States. The country suffered two terrorist attacks. The Peronist victory in the 1993 midterm elections allowed him to force Alfonsín to sign the Pact of Olivos for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. This amendment allowed Menem to run for re-election in 1995, which he won. A new economic crisis began, and the opposing parties formed a political coalition that won the 1997 midterm elections and the 1999 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>Convertibility</b> {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the <b>convertibility</b> plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E
5|$|His fourth {{minister}} of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991. He deepened the neoliberal reforms. The <b>Convertibility</b> plan was {{sanctioned by the}} Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new Argentine peso, which replaced the Austral. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. There was increased free trade to reduce inflation, and high taxes on sales and earnings {{to reduce the deficit}} caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flights ended, interest and inflation rates were lowered, and economic activity increased. The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was privatized as well, but the state kept {{a good portion of the}} shares. The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well. Buenos Aires Province was helped with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner ran for {{governor}} of Santa Cruz in 1991. Although he received only 30 percent of the vote, below the 36 percent of the UCR, he was elected due to the Ley de Lemas that added the votes for the Peronist faction of Puricelli to his own. When Kirchner took office, Santa Cruz was experiencing an economic crisis, with high unemployment and a budget deficit equal to 1.2 billion pesos, which amounted to {{an equal number of}} U.S. dollars because of the <b>Convertibility</b> plan. He expanded the number of provincial Supreme Court justices from three members to five and appointed three judges loyal to him; this gave him control of the provincial judiciary. Kirchner was criticized for preventing the investigation of corruption cases. Santa Cruz received 535 million pesos in oil royalties in 1993, which Kirchner deposited in a foreign bank. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly which drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution proposed by the Peronist president Carlos Menem. Kirchner voted against the amendment that would allow the reelection of the president, which was approved. Locally, he proposed an amendment to the provincial constitution authorizing indefinite reelection of the governor. Menem and Kirchner were reelected to their respective offices in 1995. Kirchner established a faction in the PJ opposing Menem's neoliberal economic policies, but Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the populous Buenos Aires province, ignored him and rallied a stronger opposition to Menem within the PJ.|$|E
25|$|<b>Convertibility</b> Law: The {{so-called}} <b>Convertibility</b> Law {{fixed the}} exchange-rate between australs and dollars, and introduced some reforms to the Civil Code's regime. This law, No. 23,928, allowed to convene that the pacted obligations {{in a foreign}} currency were to be resolved only in the stipulated currency. This reforms survived the abandoning of the <b>convertibility</b> regime by the Law No. 25,561.|$|E
25|$|<b>Convertibility</b> {{to common}} stock.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{important}} {{structural changes}} {{eventually led to}} the breakdown of international monetary management. One change was the development of a high level of monetary interdependence. The stage was set for monetary interdependence by the return to <b>convertibility</b> of the Western European currencies at the end of 1958 and of the Japanese yen in 1964. <b>Convertibility</b> facilitated the vast expansion of international financial transactions, which deepened monetary interdependence.|$|E
25|$|The loan {{was made}} subject to conditions, the most {{damaging}} {{of which was the}} <b>convertibility</b> of sterling. Though not the intention, the effect of <b>convertibility</b> was to worsen British post-war economic problems. International sterling balances became convertible one year after the loan was ratified, on 15 July 1947. Within a month, nations with sterling balances (e.g. pounds which they had earned from buying British exports, and which they were now permitted to sell to Britain in exchange for dollars) had drawn almost a billion dollars from British dollar reserves, forcing the British government to suspend <b>convertibility</b> and to begin immediate drastic cuts in domestic and overseas expenditure. The rapid loss of dollar reserves also highlighted the weakness of sterling, which was duly devalued in 1949 from $4.02 to $2.80.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Bretton Woods System was that nations could only enforce gold <b>convertibility</b> on the anchor currency—the United States' dollar. Gold <b>convertibility</b> {{enforcement}} was not required, but instead, allowed. Nations could forgo converting dollars to gold, and instead hold dollars. Rather than full <b>convertibility,</b> it provided a fixed price for sales between central banks. However, there was still an open gold market. For the Bretton Woods system to remain workable, it would either have to alter the peg of the dollar to gold, or {{it would have to}} maintain the free market price for gold near the $35 per ounce official price. The greater the gap between free market gold prices and central bank gold prices, the greater the temptation to deal with internal economic issues by buying gold at the Bretton Woods price and selling it on the open market.|$|E
25|$|In November 1993 the Third Plenum of the Fourteenth CPC Central Committee {{approved}} a comprehensive reform strategy in which foreign exchange management reforms were highlighted {{as a key}} element for a market-oriented economy. A floating exchange rate regime and <b>convertibility</b> for RMB were seen as {{the ultimate goal of}} the reform. Conditional <b>convertibility</b> under current account was achieved by allowing firms to surrender their foreign exchange earning from current account transactions and purchase foreign exchange as needed. Restrictions on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was also loosened and capital inflows to China surged.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, President Richard Nixon {{unilaterally}} {{ordered the}} cancellation of the direct <b>convertibility</b> of the United States dollar to gold. This act {{was known as the}} Nixon Shock.|$|E
25|$|RBI also {{exercises}} {{a system}} of capital controls in addition to intervention (through active trading) in currency markets. On the current account, there are no currency-conversion restrictions hindering buying or selling foreign exchange (although trade barriers exist). On the capital account, foreign institutional investors have <b>convertibility</b> to bring money {{into and out of}} the country and buy securities (subject to quantitative restrictions). Local firms are able to take capital out of the country in order to expand globally. However, local households are restricted in their ability to diversify globally. Because of the expansion of the current and capital accounts, India is increasingly moving towards full de facto <b>convertibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|The United States, under President Richard Nixon, reacted {{strongly}} to end an inflationary spiral, and unilaterally, without consultation with international leaders, abolished the direct <b>convertibility</b> of the United States dollar into gold {{in a series}} of measures known as the Nixon Shock.|$|E
25|$|Some {{economic}} {{studies have indicated}} that just as the downturn was spread worldwide by the rigidities of the Gold Standard, it was suspending gold <b>convertibility</b> (or devaluing the currency in gold terms) that did the most to make recovery possible.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the peso}} m$n was convertible, with {{a value of}} one peso oro sellado. <b>Convertibility</b> was {{maintained}} off and on, with decreasing value in gold, until it was finally abandoned in 1929, when m$n 2.2727 was equivalent to one peso oro.|$|E
25|$|Free trade {{relied on}} the free <b>convertibility</b> of currencies. Negotiators at the Bretton Woods conference, fresh from what they {{perceived}} as a disastrous experience with floating rates in the 1930s, concluded that major monetary fluctuations could stall {{the free flow of}} trade.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Japan {{prohibited}} {{the export of}} gold in 1917, as did many countries such as the United States. Gold <b>convertibility</b> was again shortly established in January 1930, only to be abandoned in 1931 when Great Britain abandoned the gold standard. Conversion of banknotes into gold was suspended.|$|E
25|$|After {{the sharp}} {{devaluation}} in 1991 and transition to current account <b>convertibility</b> in 1994, {{the value of}} the rupee has been largely determined by market forces. The rupee has been fairly stable during the decade 2000–2010. In September 2013, the rupee touched an all-time low 68.27 to the US dollar.|$|E
25|$|The free {{movement}} of capital involves {{the elimination of the}} various restrictions such as foreign exchange controls and allowing for the <b>convertibility</b> of currencies (already in effect) or a single currency and capital market integration via a regional stock exchange. The member states have also signed and ratified an Intra-Regional Double Taxation Agreement.|$|E
25|$|Also {{affecting}} <b>convertibility</b> is {{a series}} of customs regulations restricting the import and export of rupees. Legally, foreign nationals are forbidden from importing or exporting rupees; Indian nationals can import and export only up to 7,500 at a time, and the possession of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in Nepal is prohibited.|$|E
25|$|Between 1968 and 1975, {{a variety}} of pegs to gold were put in place, {{eventually}} culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971, to the <b>convertibility</b> of dollars to gold later dubbed the Nixon Shock. The last peg was $42.22 per ounce before the U.S. dollar was let to freely float on currency markets.|$|E
25|$|The Bretton Woods system prevailed until 1971, {{when the}} United States {{government}} suspended the <b>convertibility</b> of the US$ (and dollar reserves held by other governments) into gold. This {{is known as}} the Nixon Shock. The changes to the IMF articles of agreement reflecting these changes were ratified by the 1976 Jamaica Accords.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major shift}} in {{automation}} is the increased demand for flexibility and <b>convertibility</b> in manufacturing processes. Manufacturers are increasingly demanding the ability to easily switch from manufacturing Product A to manufacturing Product B without having to completely rebuild the production lines. Flexibility and distributed processes {{have led to the}} introduction of Automated Guided Vehicles with Natural Features Navigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} Bretton Woods, {{set forth in}} the {{articles}} of agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), provided for a system of fixed exchange rates. The rules further sought to encourage an open system by committing members to the <b>convertibility</b> of their respective currencies into other currencies and to free trade.|$|E
25|$|Cavallo was the ideologist {{behind the}} <b>Convertibility</b> Plan, which created a {{currency}} board that fixed the dollar-peso exchange rate at 1 peso per US dollar; he signed his plan into law on April 1, 1991. Cavallo thus succeeded in defeating inflation, which had averaged over 220% {{a year from}} 1975 to 1988, had leapt to 5000% in 1989, and remained at 1300% as late as 1990.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{there was}} a period of hyperinflation, running at up to 12,000% per year in 1989. Foreign {{investment}} was mostly stagnant. Under the presidency of Carlos Menem, the country saw some economic stability. The favorable exchange rate on the Argentine peso during the <b>convertibility</b> period saw an influx of foreign investment. However this period also saw a dramatic drop in domestic consumption.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{compatibility}} {{characters are}} those {{that would not have}} been encoded except for compatibility and round-trip <b>convertibility</b> with other standards. However, the amount of CJK ideographs within any non-Unicode standard is too big to fit into Unicode's CJK Compatibility Ideographs blocks. Instead, code points are assigned when the affected characters are approved by the Unicode Consortium, but have yet to assign any code points within the CJK Unified Ideographs blocks.|$|E
25|$|During {{his short}} tenure {{as head of}} Ecuador’s Monetary Board (August 1996-February 1997) Noboa owned a small bank, Banco Litoral, and collaborated {{as part of an}} {{economic}} team that included Domingo Cavallo, the architect of Argentina’s monetary <b>convertibility</b> policy during the 1990s and special foreign advisor to Bucaram, David Goldbaum, head of the National Finance Corporation and owner of Banco Territorial, and Roberto Isaias, then-president of now-defunct Filanbanco, one of Ecuador’s largest banks, who served as economic advisor.|$|E
