40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A capacitor-run motor is often necessary where silent running, low starting current, high efficiency and power factor and overload capacity are required. When a capacitor· motor is used in control or similar applications {{a knowledge of the}} variation in performance over a range of supply frequency is often important, and this has been investigated by previous workers using analyses of varying validity. For example, in early studies it was common to base performance calculations on the revolving field theory, when a general lack of agreement was found between calculated and test values. This occurred particularly in the starting wlnding under running conditions, and was attributed usually to saturation and to space harmonics of mmf. The crossfield theory provides a useful alternative to the revolving-field theory for analyses of single-phase motors, and when applied to the <b>capacitor</b> <b>motor</b> it is found that a much more accurate prediction of the machine performance is obtained. This thesis investigates the behaviour of a small singlephase capacitor-run induction motor with relation to variable frequency supplies and different capacitor values. The performance of the <b>capacitor</b> <b>motor</b> is calculated, using an equivalent circuit developed from basic cross-field theory considerations. However, before calculating the performance of the motor, the experimental determination of the parameters involved is necessary. From the equivalent circuit for no-load and locked rotor conditions, a set of voltage/current equations was obtained. Use of these equations requires a very complicated set of mathematical procedures to determine the required parameters, and no solution could be found. This difficulty was overcome by the extensive use of a digital computer, enabling the parameters to be obtained by the Newton-Raphson method of numerical iteration. Using these parameters, the predicted performance of the machine was compared with that obtained from an extensive experimental investigation. The agreement which was found to exist confirms both the validity of the theoretical analysis and the accuracy of the measurement from which the parameters were derived...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{some results}} of {{experiment}} on modification of induction motor into generator are described. Not as usually done on three-phase motor, the modification {{has been done}} on capacitor motors normally supplied with single-phase source. The resulted induction generator should be able to self-excite and has been intended for low-power, low-speed applications. These applications are prospective for example in rural renewable energy generations and as motors for some special electric vehicles. Machine modification instead of total design-production or new machine acquisition is considered more appropriate for remote rural electrification. Distance and transportation difficulties, unavailability of nearby machine industry, lack of human resources with ‘high-tech savvy 2 ̆ 7, besides the low purchasing power of population in remote rural areas are some reasons behind the consideration. Experiment results indicated that voltage generation up to nominal value is not always easy to attain in a <b>capacitor</b> <b>motor,</b> even when functioning beyond its synchronous speed. An additional pre-charged capacitor should be used to initiate voltage generation. During start-up, load and the pre-charged capacitor had to be removed from generator to avoid capacitor discharge. Load could then be added gradually once generator approached its nominal output value. It was also shown that in order to generate power the generator must be rotating over its synchronous speed. The resulted frequency values did not vary linearly to the rotation speed and the obtained efficiency was still low...|$|E
40|$|Electric motors consume {{over half}} of the {{electrical}} energy produced by power stations, almost the three-quarters of the electrical consumption in industry and almost the half of commercial electrical consumption in developed countries. Motors are by far the most important type of electric charges, and so constitute the main targets to achieve energy saving. Owing to their simple and robust construction, the asynchronous motors and especially those of squirrel-cage types, represent about 90 - 95 % of the electrical energy consumption of electric motors, which is equivalent to about 53 % of total electrical energy consumption. They are widely used as electrical drives in industrial, commercial, public service, traction and domestic applications. Owing to the importance of induction motors, this thesis is aimed at contributing to energy saving efforts, more specifically in the field of low power induction motors. A contribution is kept in perspective by taking into consideration the energy saving potential during the motor design stage as well as during its operation. Every effort to save energy in motor application can be made by always attempting to use energy only as much as what needed during its operation. The best way is to exploit the saving potential during motor design, {{while at the same time}} taking into account its intended application. It can be achieved either through the improvement of motor design or through the reduction of its input electrical energy when the motor has already been built. These two efforts are studied, elaborated and worked out thoroughly in this thesis. To attain this objective, a synthesis has been started with the description of how to model an induction motor. To obtain a better model, an improvement is proposed by using the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping to calculate the slot leakage inductance in induction motor. With such method, slot-leakage inductance can be determined more precisely, resulting in more accurate prediction of motor characteristics. It is based on the stored magnetic energy calculation using two-directional field distribution in the slot. The air gap influence can be observed easily, so that a reasonable slot leakage definition can be adopted. Unlike the conventional method, which is only suitable for rectangular slots (otherwise empirical corrections are required), the proposed general slot form can be extended to any desired polygonal slot form. Consideration of saturation is also indispensable because ignoring it could result in inaccuracy in motor performance prediction. Considering the saturation is essential owing to its important role in self-excitation phenomenon to establish voltage build-up in induction generator. However, the self-excitation phenomenon is undesirable in certain group of capacitor motors as it may hinder the switching-off process and mechanical braking at a desired moment. The undesirable switching-off failure condition is to be avoided by properly designing the <b>capacitor</b> <b>motor.</b> Like in this <b>capacitor</b> <b>motor</b> special application, where a proper design is useful from the point of view of operation safety, designing properly a motor is also very important in energy saving efforts. Motor design and optimization to minimize losses as well as to make possible wide speed-range motor operation are some of the efforts. However, when induction motor has already been built, saving energy is only possible by managing its supplying electrical energy. Various strategies are possible and a particular emphasis on the use of triac to reduce motor input voltage is presented. Besides, a brief economic saving evaluation is given to draw attention to the energy saving potential...|$|E
