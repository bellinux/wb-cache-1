6000|$|I was {{certainly}} far from reassured by this {{sketch of the}} class of literature in which I was to make my first appearance; but I said no more, and possessed my soul in patience, until the day came when I received a copy of a newspaper marked in the corner, [...] "Compliments of J.P." [...] I opened it with sensible shrinkings; and there, wedged between an account of a prize-fight and a skittish article upon chiropody--think of <b>chiropody</b> treated with a leer!--I came upon a column and a half in which myself and my poor statue were embalmed. Like the editor with the first of the series, I did but glance my eye down the head-lines, and was more than satisfied.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chiropody</b> {{became a}} {{registered}} profession in New Zealand in 1969 with {{the requirement that}} all applicants take a recognized three-year course of training.

50|$|At its inception, {{the only}} {{admission}} requirement {{to the college}} {{was a high school}} diploma. The original course of study was 8 months in length including night classes, and the degree granted was the Doctor of Surgical <b>Chiropody</b> (D.S.C.). Along with the decades and successive physical expansion of the college came an increase in academic standards. In 1932, the curriculum was expanded to 3 years of full-time study, as the field of <b>chiropody</b> was expanding tremendously with the opening of other <b>chiropody</b> schools around the country. In 1938 the college began requiring applications to have at least one year of full-time study in the liberal arts or sciences from an accredited university prior to being admitted and a decade later the D.S.C. curriculum was extended to a full 4 years of study. By the middle of the century, the American Podiatric Medical Association's Council on Podiatric Medical Education standardized the curricula and entrance requirements for all podiatric schools, and replaced the term <b>chiropody</b> with podiatry to reflect the increase in training. The College became the Ohio College of Podiatry in 1963, and stated that applicants must take at least 60 credits of undergraduate work before applying, however preferred bachelor's degree. For a short time, the graduates were granted the degrees Doctor of Podiatry (D.P.). By 1969, the field was reorganized for the last time, and all schools and colleges became institutions of podiatric medicine, and thus the college became the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine and granted the D.P.M.|$|E
