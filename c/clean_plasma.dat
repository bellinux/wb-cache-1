40|$|Bioanalytical {{chemistry}} is a challenging field, often involving complex samples, such as blood, plasma, serum or urine. In many applications, sample cleanup {{is the most}} demanding and time-consuming step. In the work underlying this thesis a novel dynamic miniature extractor, known as a hollow-fibre liquid-phase microextractor (HF-LPME), was designed, evaluated and studied closely when used to <b>clean</b> <b>plasma</b> samples. Aqueous-organic-aqueous liquid extraction, in which the organic liquid is immobilised in a porous polypropylene membrane, was the principle upon which the extractor was based, and this is discussed in all the papers associated with this thesis. This type of extraction is known as supported-liquid membrane extraction (SLM). The aim of this work was {{the development of a}} dynamic system for SLM. It was essential that the system could handle small sample volumes and had the potential for hyphenations and on-line connections to, for instance, LC/electrospray-MS. The design of a miniaturised HF-LPME device is presented in Paper I. The extraction method was developed for some weakly acidic pesticides and these were also used for evaluation. In the work described in Paper II, the method was optimised on the basis of an experimental design using spiked human plasma samples. Paper III presents a detailed study of the mass-transfer over the liquid membrane. The diffusion through the membrane pores was illustrated by a computer-simulation. Not surprisingly, the more lipophilic, the greater the retention of the compounds, as a result of dispersive forces. The main focus of the work described in Paper IV was to make the HF/LPME system more versatile and user-friendly; therefore, the extractor was automated by hyphenation to a SIA system.

40|$|Abstract. The two {{experimental}} {{campaign with}} lithium gettering of the T- 10 chamber were carried out. The experiments were aimed {{to prove the}} lithium abilities to obtain high performance discharges with lithium cover of the wall and limiters with reduced recycling of the working gas and the impurities level in ohmic and heated with the high ECR power tokamak discharges. The second goal of the T- 10 experiments were to extend the operational space of discharge parameters in T- 10 limiter configuration with graphite limiters in conditions of the <b>clean</b> <b>plasma</b> with low recycling and to test compatibility of the Li-gettering with the proper work of the primary vacuum windows of the T- 10 ECRH system. The lithium element was manufactured {{on the base of}} the kapillar porous system. The lithium element was placed in the same port as the graphite rail and circular limiters. It was introduced to the vacuum chamber by means of the special transport vacuum system. The inner heater was able to heat it up to the 550 0 C. Typically, about one gram of Li was evaporated each time at the temperature 450 C 0 during 20 minutes. Such technique was sufficient to reduce density decay time from about 1. 5 s to 0. 075 s. The significant decrease of the recycling was sustained during 10 discharges. The SXR emission decreased in a factor of 10. The central radiative losses and the total radiative losses decreased in a factors of 4 and 2 respectively. This corresponds to the decrease of the high Z impurities in a factor of 4, oxygen in 7, while the main carbon impurity decrease up to 2 times and Zeff from 1. 8 to 1. 15. Thus th...|$|E
40|$|Plasma-wall {{interactions}} {{have been}} studied in the full-W ASDEX Upgrade during its dedicated helium campaign. Relatively <b>clean</b> <b>plasmas</b> with a He content of[*][*]> 80 % could be obtained by applying ion cyclotron wall conditioning (ICWC) discharges upon changeover from D to He. However, co-deposited layers with significant amounts of He and D were measured on W samples exposed to ICWC plasmas at the low-field side (outer) midplane. This {{is a sign of}} local migration and accumulation of materials and residual fuel in regions shadowed from direct plasma exposure albeit globally D was removed from the vessel. When exposing W samples to ELMy H-mode helium plasmas in the outer strike-point region, no net erosion was observed but the surfaces had been covered with co-deposited layers mainly consisting of W, B, C, and D and being the thickest on rough and modified surfaces. This is different from the typical erosion-deposition patterns in D plasmas, where usually sharp net-erosion peaks surrounded by prominent net-deposition maxima for W are observed close to the strike point. Moreover, no clear signs of W nanostructure growth or destruction could be seen. The growth of deposited layers may impact the operation of future fusion reactors and is attributed to strong sources in the main chamber that under suitable conditions may switch the balance from net erosion into net deposition, even close to the strike points. In addition, the absence of noticeable chemical erosion in helium plasmas may have affected the thickness of the deposited layers. Retention of He, for its part, remained small and uniform throughout the strike-point region although our results indicate that samples with smooth surfaces can contain an order of magnitude less He than their rough counterparts...|$|R
