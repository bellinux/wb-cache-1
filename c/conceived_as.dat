5|$|Harmonic {{manipulations}} {{of this kind}} {{create a sense of}} standstill, of arrest of time and motion; they often suggest a feeling of detachment, of entering a new dimension, independent of the preceding material, such as the realm of dreams and memories (if the preceding material is <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> reality); some tonally detached passages may convey a feeling of an alienated, inhospitable environment, an exile (if the preceding material is <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> home).|$|E

5000|$|.....there is an evident absurdity in {{pretending to}} {{demonstrate}} a matter of fact, or to prove it by any arguments a priori. Nothing is demonstrable, unless the contrary implies a contradiction. Nothing, that is distinctly conceivable, implies a contradiction. Whatever we <b>conceive</b> <b>as</b> existent, we can also <b>conceive</b> <b>as</b> non-existent. There is no being, therefore, whose non-existence implies a contradiction. Consequently there is no being, whose existence is demonstrable.|$|R

5|$|Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes is a fangame {{developed}} by the international team Kajar Laboratories as a ROM hack of Square's role-playing video game Chrono Trigger for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

5000|$|Spinoza denied Descartes' [...] "real distinction" [...] between {{mind and}} matter. Substance, {{according}} to Spinoza, is one and indivisible, but has multiple [...] "attributes". He regards an attribute, though, as [...] "what we <b>conceive</b> <b>as</b> constituting the single essence of substance". The single essence of one substance can be <b>conceived</b> of <b>as</b> material and also, consistently, as mental. What is ordinarily called the natural world, together {{with all the}} individuals in it, is immanent in God: hence his famous phrase deus sive natura ("God or Nature").|$|R
50|$|Most of his prints have no {{surviving}} preparatory drawings, and {{in general}} {{the question of whether}} Campagnola designed them himself or engraved then after drawings provided by other artists remains open. Most historians, however, see him as an independent artist responsible for <b>conceiving</b> <b>as</b> well as executing most of his prints, rather than a precursor of Marcantonio Raimondi or Domenico Campagnola who acted as a technical collaborator with a greater artist who supplied the designs.|$|R
5|$|Whaam! is {{sometimes}} said {{to belong to}} the same anti-war genre as Picasso's Guernica, a suggestion dismissed by Bradford R. Collins. Instead, Collins views the painting as a revenge fantasy against Lichtenstein's first wife Isabel, <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> it was during their bitter divorce battle (the couple separated in 1961 and divorced in 1965).|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the fourth series. During a school trip, the youngsters find an alien in distress and have to help it without revealing its presence {{to the rest of}} their friends. This notion was <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> a 'Sarah Jane-lite' narrative which would allow Elisabeth Sladen a break in production.|$|E
5|$|Adventure was <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> a {{graphical}} {{version of}} the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E

5|$|After leaving TSR in 1985 {{over issues}} {{with its new}} {{majority}} owner, Gygax continued to create role-playing game titles independently, beginning with the multi-genre Dangerous Journeys in 1992. He designed another gaming system called Lejendary Adventure, released in 1999. In 2005, Gygax {{was involved in the}} Castles & Crusades role-playing game, which was <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> a hybrid between the third edition of D and the original version of the game conceived by Gygax.|$|E
5|$|Alpha, Beta, and Gamma {{were the}} first audio dramas based on Steins;Gate, and were <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> a trilogy of stories.

5|$|As {{the lead}} ship of the Majestic-class of light {{aircraft}} carriers, Melbourne was <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> {{a modified version}} of the Colossus-class carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability. Majestic- and Colossus-class carriers were almost identical in hull design and both were considered subclasses of the '1942 design' light aircraft carrier program. These carriers were intended as 'disposable warships': to be disposed of at the end of World War II or within three years of entering service.|$|E

5|$|Bedsitcom {{was created}} by Peter James and Andrew O'Connor, and was <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> a parody of both reality {{television}} and the traditional sitcom.

After being commissioned for Channel 4 by Danielle Lux, Bedsitcom was produced by Matt Crook and Kirsty Smith of Objective Productions.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1995 at Millenium Interactive in Cambridge under the working title of Dead Man Dan. The visuals are heavily {{influenced}} by Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Originally <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> an arcade-style shooter for platforms such as Windows and the Sega Saturn, Sony's purchase of SCE Cambridge Studio evolved the game into a PlayStation title. The game received mostly positive praise from critics upon release, with praise including its blend of Halloween themed visuals but was criticised for its controls and cumbersome camera work.|$|E
5|$|Far Side Virtual is the thirtieth studio album by the American {{electronic}} musician James Ferraro, {{released on}} October 25, 2011 by the record label Hippos in Tanks. First <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> {{a series of}} ringtones, the album marked Ferraro's transition from his previous lo-fi recording approach to a sharply produced, electronic aesthetic that deliberately evokes sources such as elevator music, corporate mood music, easy-listening, and outdated computer sound design. The album has been interpreted as engaging with themes such as hyperreality, disposable consumer culture, 1990s retro-futurism, advertising, and musical kitsch.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{formulate}} a principle that explains the working of the Japanese number system with respect to Japanese nouns and that defines the kinds of nouns and contexts that condition the forms of number expressions. It is the author's theory that in applying numbers to nouns, the Japanese make a formal distinction between things they <b>conceive</b> <b>as</b> being independent and self-contained and things they <b>conceive</b> <b>as</b> being dependent and attributive. A form containing a classifier implies that the object of quantification is felt to be independent; a form that omits the classifier implies that the object is felt to be attributive to something else. The author enlarges upon these theories and discusses exceptions which {{can be attributed to}} language styles or particular derivations. He establishes the categories of count noun, numeral suffix, numeral adjunct, and numerical compound to formalize his discussion. Concluding remarks concern Chinese. (VM) t...|$|R

The plot revolves around a wealthy industrialist's son who secretly marries the daughter of his family estate's accountant, only for his father to discover it and burn down the estate along with his son's pregnant wife, who is inside. The remainder of the film reveals the truth behind how she and her progeny survive.|$|E
