2500|$|The {{net result}} of the {{modifications}} was a [...] reduction in cargo capacity of about 10percent {{in the case of}} the tankers, but almost 30percent for the grain ships, the higher figure on account of the space taken up by the hangar. [...] The modifications themselves were conceptually simple and with standardised designs and extensive use (about 51percent by weight of steel) of prefabricated components, the average <b>conversion</b> <b>time</b> was just over five months, but there were significant differences between the average time required to convert new-builds (about 14weeks) and existing ships (about 27weeks). [...] There were wide variations within groups; the first 'Triple Twelve', Rapana, was converted in five months while the final one, Macoma, took ten months. [...] Delays arose through a variety of reasons, including labour relations and conflicting priorities in the shipyards, but the supply of arrester gear which was also in high demand for the escort carrier programme was a particular bottleneck that limited the rate at which MACs could be completed.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on the Fe₃O₄/FeO metal oxide system under pure methane and pure steam environments in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) and a prototype-miniaturised micro-reactor. Experimental results show that during a typical fuel oxidation step the concentration of methane in the product gas stream gradually decreases while Fe₃O₄ is being reduced to FeO. However, on or about a fractional conversion of 60 % {{the slope of the}} CH₄ plot sharply increases due to catalytic effects of FeO on methane decomposition.

50|$|The dual-slope {{conversion}} {{can take}} a long time: a thousand or so clock ticks in the scheme described above. That limits how often a measurement can be made (dead time). Resolution of 1 ps with a 100 MHz (10 ns) clock requires a stretch ratio of 10,000 and implies a <b>conversion</b> <b>time</b> of 150 &mu;s. To decrease the <b>conversion</b> <b>time,</b> the interpolator circuit can be used twice in a residual interpolator technique. The fast ramp is used initially as above to determine the time. The slow ramp is only at 1/100. The slow ramp will cross zero at some time during the clock period. When the ramp crosses zero, the fast ramp is turned on again to measure the crossing time (tresidual). Consequently, the time can be determined to 1 part in 10,000.|$|E

40|$|The {{recognition}} that labor contracts imperfectly specify {{the rate at}} which labor time is converted into labor effort has necessitated a teevaluation of standard microeconomic models [30, 31, 61].

This has led to a renaissance in economic interest regarding the origin of institutions and their role in the process of economic development [5, 25, 43, 52, 54].
