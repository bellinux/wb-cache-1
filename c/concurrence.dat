40|$|We {{consider}} an entangled but non-interacting qubit pair a 1 and b 1 that is independently coupled {{to a set}} of local qubit systems, aI and bJ, of 0 bit value, respectively. We derive rules for the transfer of entanglement from the pair a 1 &# 8211;b 1 to an arbitrary pair aI&# 8211;bJ, for the case of qubit-number conserving local interactions. It is shown that the transfer rule depends strongly on the initial entangled state. If the initial entanglement {{is in the form of}} the Bell state corresponding to anti-correlated qubits, the sum of the square of the nonlocal pairwise <b>concurrences</b> is conserved. If the initial state is the Bell state with correlated qubits, this sum can be reduced, even to zero in some cases, to reveal a complete and abrupt loss of all nonlocal pairwise entanglement. We also identify that for the nonlocal bipartitions A&# 8211;bJ involving all qubits at one location, with one qubit bJ at the other location, the <b>concurrences</b> satisfy a simple addition rule for both cases of the Bell states that the sum of the square of the nonlocal <b>concurrences</b> is conserved...|$|R

Federalist William Murray led opposition to the resolutions in the House but was the only dissenting vote on five of the nine; John Pope led similarly unsuccessful Federalist opposition in the Senate.

5|$|The 1985 Election Day floods (also {{known as}} the Killer Floods of 1985 in West Virginia) {{produced}} the costliest floods in both West Virginia and Virginia in November 1985.

Juan moved northward into Canada, but spawned another system that spread moderate rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic States, wetting soils. On November3, a low pressure area developed south of Florida and moved northeastward along a cold front, bringing a plume of moisture influenced by Juan's previous track. The storm moved through the southeastern United States, stalling on November5 west of Washington, D.C. before turning out to sea the next day.
