40|$|This work {{presents}} a new haptic device that integrates <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> feedback with grounded point-force dis-play. The system {{consists of a}} thimble-based mechanism at-tached to the endpoint of a Phantom R robotic arm. <b>Contact</b> <b>location</b> is rendered using a small tactile element that moves {{along the length of}} the user’s fingerpad. The Phantom R robot applies reaction forces to the user’s finger through this tactile element, bringing it into and out of contact with the user as required. Force and <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> are thus displayed concurrently. During operation, the system con-tinually adjusts the position of the contact element based on finger motion and expected or actual contact with the two-dimensional virtual environment. The finger is modeled as an arc segment, and the environment as a series of lines and arcs. Haptic rendering is driven by a virtual finger proxy, employing collision detection and collision anticipation al-gorithms. A series of human subject tests compared <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> feedback to standard force feedback. Subjects com-pleted a contour following task in less time and with fewer failures when <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> information was available. The system’s success indicates a simple yet promising new avenue for the design of haptic displays. ...|$|E

While force-feedback technology has matured over the last decade, tactile displays providing information at the skin are coming into the limelight due to the significance of tactile information in various manual tasks. This thesis investigates the effect of <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> information rendered with a tactile display on the perception of shape primitives and thus to provide design specifications in developing state-of-the-art tactile displays. A series of experiments were conducted to assess how <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> information affects human perception of virtual shape primitives. The results from the first study on edge sharpness perception indicated that <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> information alone could convey edge sharpness information. However, when it was presented together with force feedback, it was dominated by the force cues. In a second study, the perception of virtual curvature was matched {{to that of a}} real one and the relation between virtual and real curvatures was modeled. Finally, the role of <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> information in the perception of surface bumps during contour following was investigated. The results showed that the addition of <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> information to force feedback improved the participants 2 ̆ 7 ability to identify surface features due to the improved identification of small, as opposed to large, surface bumps. No improvement was observed for contour following. Overall, the results of this thesis reveals the extent to which <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> information plays a role in the perception of shape primitives, providing useful references for developing effective tactile displays. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{effect of}} <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> {{information}} on virtual edge perception {{was investigated in}} two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants discriminated edge sharpness under force-alone and force-plus-contact-location conditions using a 4. 8 mm radius contact roller. Virtual objects were 2 D profiles of edges with two adjoining surfaces. For both conditions, the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) in change of edge radius increased from 2. 3 to 7. 4 mm as edge radii increased from 2. 5 to 20. 0 mm; {{there was no significant}} difference between the two conditions. A follow-up experiment with <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> alone resulted in higher edge sharpness JNDs. In Experiment 2, the same edge sharpness discrimination task was performed using a smaller contact roller (R = 1. 5 mm) to investigate the effect of roller size. The JNDs for the smaller roller were not statistically significant from those of the larger roller. Our results suggest that 1) <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> cues alone are capable of conveying edge sharpness information, but that force cues are dominant when both types of cues are available; and 2) the radius of the contact roller does not significantly affect the user’s ability to discriminate edge sharpness, indicating that the participants could use the changes in <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> to judge curvature.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{method by which}} a robot learns to predict {{effective}} <b>contact</b> <b>locations</b> for pushing {{as a function of}} object shape. The robot performs push experiments at many <b>contact</b> <b>locations</b> on multiple objects and records local and global shape features at each point of contact. Each trial attempts to either push the object in a straight line or to rotate the object to a new orientation. The robot observes the outcome trajectories of the manipulations and computes either a push-stability or rotate-push score for each trial. The robot then learns a regression function for each score in order to predict push effectiveness as a function of object shape. With this mapping, the robot can infer effective push locations for subsequent objects from their shapes, regardless of whether they belong to a previously encountered object class. These results are demonstrated on a mobile manipulator robot pushing a variety of household objects on a tabletop surface. I...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of in-vivo {{glenohumeral}} joint biomechanics after total shoulder arthroplasty {{are important for}} the improvement of patient function, implant longevity and surgical technique. No data has been published on the in-vivo {{glenohumeral joint}} <b>contact</b> <b>locations</b> in patients after total shoulder arthroplasty. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were to determine the in-vivo glenohumeral joint <b>contact</b> <b>locations</b> and humeral head translations in patients after total shoulder arthroplasty. First, a non-invasive three dimensional fluoroscopic image matching method was developed and validated for use in the shoulder joint complex. Next, a group of patients that have undergone clinically successful total shoulder arthroplasty surgeries were recruited for study and imaged by the fluoroscopic imaging technique. The fluoroscopic imaging system was recreated in a virtual environment and the in vivo kinematics that were recorded by the fluoroscopes were recreated with three dimensional models. The contact centroids of the glenohumeral joint and humeral head translations were measured using solid modeling software. In summary, this thesis quantified the in-vivo glenohumeral joint <b>contact</b> <b>locations</b> and humeral head translations after total shoulder arthroplasty. These data provides surgeons and engineers valuable information for developing surgical treatments that may better help recreate 'normal' motion of the shoulder after total shoulder arthroplasty. by Daniel Frank Massimini.

The contactor is remotely driven by push-pull wires to reduce the effective inertia of the device at the user’s fingertip; however, this design results in significant mechanical backlash. This backlash is characterized and partially compensated for in software. An experiment was used to evaluate several methods of rendering tactile feedback, each using a different method of prepositioning the contactor.

40|$|Current {{state-of-the-art}} haptic interfaces {{only provide}} kinesthetic (force) feedback, yet {{studies have shown}} that providing tactile feedback in concert with kinesthetic information can dramatically improve a person’s ability to dexterously interact with and explore virtual environments. In this research, tactile feedback was provided by a device, called a <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> display (CLD), which is capable of rendering the center of contact to a user. The chief goal of the present work was to develop algorithms that allow the CLD to be used with polygonal geometric models, and to do this without the resulting <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> feedback being overwhelmed by the perception of polygonal edges and vertices. Two haptic shading algorithms were developed to address this issue and successfully extend the use of the CLD to 2 D and 3 D polygonal environments. Two experiments were run to evaluate these haptic shading algorithms. The first measured perception thresholds for rendering faceted objects as smooth objects. It was found that the addition of <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> feedback significantly increased user sensitivity to edges and that the use of shading algorithms was able to significantly reduce the number of polygons needed for objects to feel smooth. The second experiment explored the CLD device’s ability to facilitate exploration and shape recognition within a 3 D environment. While this study provided a validation of our 3 D algorithm, as people were able to identify the rendered objects with reasonable accuracy, this study underscored the need for improvements in the CLD device design in order to be effectively used in general 3 D environments...|$|E

The analytical description of <b>contact</b> <b>locations,</b> <b>contact</b> forces and beam deflections results in an exact modelling of the phenomenon (no penetration allowed). Despite the apparent complexity of the problem, the analytical relations leading to two-point boundary and integro-restrained differential equations are formally written. An iterative resolution of these equations is adopted by converting the problem into a single-point boundary value one. Due to a proper selection of the global unknowns, namely the contact forces and their locations, the proposed method is particularly efficient {{in the context of}} evolving structures. The resolution is illustrated on a simple example, and comparisons with the finite element method are given as persuasive arguments. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{to predict the}} shift of the contact ellipse between the meshing teeth in a spiral bevel gear set is presented in this report. The contact ellipse shift of interest is {{the motion of the}} nominal tooth <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> on each tooth from the ideal pitch point to the point of contact between the two teeth considering the elastic motions of the gears and their supporting shafts. This is the shift of the pitch point from the ideal, unloaded position on each tooth to the nominal <b>contact</b> <b>location</b> on the tooth when the gears are fully loaded. It is assumed that the major contributors of this motion are the elastic deflections of the gear shafts, the slopes of the shafts under load and the radial deflections of the four gear shaft bearings. The motions of the two pitch point locations on the pinion and the gear tooth surfaces are calculated in a FORTRAN program which also calculates the size and orientation of the Hertzian contact ellipse on the tooth faces. Based on the curvatures of the two spiral bevel gear teeth {{and the size of the}} contact ellipse, the program also predicts the basic dynamic capacity of the tooth pair.
