50|$|Recent {{developments}} in semiconductor <b>curve</b> <b>tracer</b> systems now allow three core types of curve tracing: current-voltage (I-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V), and ultra-fast transient or pulsed current-voltage (I-V). Modern <b>curve</b> <b>tracer</b> instrument designs {{tend to be}} modular, allowing system specifiers to configure them to match the applications for which they will be used. For example, new mainframe-based <b>curve</b> <b>tracer</b> systems, can be configured by specifying the number and power level of the Source Measure Units (SMUs) to be plugged into the slots in the back panel of the chassis. This modular design also provides the flexibility to incorporate other types of instrumentation to handle {{a wider range of}} applications. These mainframe-based systems typically include a self-contained PC to simplify test setup, data analysis, graphing and printing, and on-board results storage. Users of these types of systems include semiconductor researchers, device modeling engineers, reliability engineers, die sort engineers, and process development engineers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Curve</b> <b>tracers</b> usually contain {{convenient}} connection {{arrangements for}} two- or three-terminal devices, {{often in the}} form of sockets arranged to allow the plugging-in of the various common packages used for transistors and diodes.

Through a series of analytic calculations and Langevin dynamics simulations, we explore how systems cross over from equilibrium to active behavior as the activity is increased. In particular, we calculate the profiles of density and orientational order near straight or circular walls, and show the characteristic width of the boundary layers. We find a simple relationship between the enhancements of density and pressure near a wall. Based on these results, we determine how the pressure depends on wall curvature, and hence make approximate analytic predictions for the motion of <b>curved</b> <b>tracers,</b> {{as well as the}} rectification of active particles around small openings in confined geometries...|$|R

This paper presents a simple affordable and easy to fabricate instrument for tracing I-V characteristics of a PV module. It comprises of rapidly varying resistive loads centred on power resistors connected to relays and controlled by an electronic circuitry. The circuit consists of a 555 astable oscillator {{that is used to}} send clock pulses to the clock terminal of a 4017 decade counter which in turn produces a sequence of pulses. Each progression of pulse advances by one bit to sequentially turn on individual relays via driver transistors. The speed of the count is made variable from the frequency determining network of the 555 oscillator. The I-V characteristics of the module are thus measured by the sequential selection of the relays which are each connected to a selected load resistor to determine the operating point on the I-V curve. The currents and voltages are then recorded simultaneously with irradiance from a pyranometer, by a datalogger to which the instruments are connected. The circuit was tested on two monocrystalline modules to compare the effect of Harmattan dust on PV output yield...|$|R
30|$|With the {{increased}} popularity of {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) imaging in small animals, the use of kinetic modeling to study physiological function has become widespread. Many kinetic models, for example those used in the quantitative measurement of local cerebral glucose metabolism or measurement of radiotracer receptor binding, require the accurate measurement of the time-activity <b>curve</b> of the <b>tracer</b> in plasma, known as the input function (IF). In {{the case of the}} widely used tracer 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), the time-activity <b>curve</b> of <b>tracer</b> uptake in a specific brain region, combined with the IF, {{can be used in a}} classical modeling approach to calculate the kinetic rate constants governing passage from one compartment to another, and to calculate the rate of glucose metabolism. In the case of tracers used to image neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, an accurate IF facilitates kinetic modeling avoiding the assumptions of reference region models, namely that the reference region is devoid of the receptors studied and that the non-specific distribution volume is identical between reference and target region.|$|R
40|$|The {{capacitor}} charging method {{can be used}} in Photovoltaic (PV) systems for two typical applications: a very simple and cheap way (1) to trace the I-V curve of a PV generator of whatever size and (2) to track the Maximum Power Point (MPP), especially when the partial shading occurs. The problem is the correct sizing of the capacitor in order to achieve accurate, uniform and smooth results. In the first application a simplified calculation to design quickly the capacitor is carried out. This is done only {{as a function of the}} main characteristics of the PV array and the most important datasheet parameters of the PV modules. Then, the setup of I-V <b>curve</b> <b>tracers</b> at module, string and array levels is presented: these tracers are useful in the detection of underperformance of PV systems. In the second application a MPPT (MPP Tracker) circuit based on {{capacitor charging}} is designed and simulated in partial shading conditions. In these conditions the Power-Voltage (P-V) curve of a PV array is characterized by the presence of multiple maxima for the bypass diode action. The PV array is isolated from the load for a negligibly short period and is connected to an external capacitor. During the charging time, the proposed circuit tracks the global MPP. This circuit is easy to implement and shortens the duration needed for scanning the P-V curve of the arra...|$|R

30|$|More {{reliable}} grading may {{be possible}} with dynamic 18 F-FET PET, since this tracer exhibits differences in the time-activity <b>curves</b> of <b>tracer</b> uptake depending on tumor grade [34]. HGGs are characterized by an early peak around 10 – 15  min after injection followed by a decrease of 18 F-FET uptake. In contrast, LGGs typically exhibit delayed and steadily increasing tracer uptake [49]. The differential kinetics of tracer uptake in HGGs and LGGs {{appear to be a}} special property of 18 F-FET because such differences were not observed with 11 C-MET or L- 6 -[18 F]fluoro- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalnine [11, 50].
