40|$|Three-dimensional {{turbulent}} mixed convection flow using nanofluids in horizontal concentric annuli is numerically simulated. The continuity, Navier-Stokes {{and energy}} equations are solved using finite volume method (FVM) and the SIMPLE algorithm scheme {{is applied to}} examine the effects of turbulent flow on heat transfer characteristics. In this study, several parameters such as different types of nanoparticles (Al 2 O 3, CuO, SiO 2 and ZnO), different volume fractions in the range of 1 % to 4 %, different nanoparticles diameter in the range of 20 to 80 nm were used. Reynolds numbers are considered in the turbulent range of 6000 =Re = 18000. Different nanoparticle shapes (i. e., blades, platelets, <b>cylindrical,</b> <b>bricks,</b> and spherical), and effects of inner cylinder and outer cylinder heat fluxes were analyzed. Hydraulic diameter ratio was also examined. The numerical results indicate that the nanofluid with SiO 2 has the highest Nusselt number and pressure drop compared with other nanofluids types. Heat transfer characteristic increases as the volume fraction of nanoparticles increases while it decreases as the nanoparticles diameter increases. Effects of hydraulic diameter ratio, nanoparticle shapes and location of applying heat flux on heat transfer characteristics are significant...|$|R

40|$|Archaeological discoveries {{made all}} over the Mediterranean area – highly prone to {{earthquakes}} – have highlighted the use of fictile tubules for the building of walls and domes in thermal baths and masonry kilns since the Roman Empire. Fictile tubules are <b>cylindrical</b> clay <b>bricks</b> with a hollow conformation that ensures lightness and provides thermal insulation for the structural element. This well serves the purposes of thermae and kilns, since heat dispersion affects their functionality. Fictile tubules were usually either embedded in mortar or assembled with a female-male coupling system. This paper investigates the behavior of structural elements employing such technology via experimental tests and numerical analyses. First, tubules and mortar are considered separately. The behavior of each element is investigated by performing compressive and three-point bending tests to define their mechanical properties. These are inserted into existing material models in the 3 D FE software Abaqus. They are then calibrated in order to match the experimental tests. Second, the mechanical behavior of an elementary cell composed of tubules embedded in mortar is investigated. Tensile and compressive numerical tests are performed via Abaqus to derive the mechanical behavior of this homogenized material. Finally, linear and nonlinear static analyses are performed on an arch through the exploitation of the new homogenized material...|$|R

40|$|Water {{loss from}} the fresh mortar is {{believed}} to be related to mortar-brick bond strength development in masonry. Recent research on mortar-brick bond has shown that, particularly, effects of water flow on the composition and the hydration conditions of the mortar-brick interface have {{to be taken into account}} to explain bond strength development. However, many cases of unexpected bond behaviour are still registered, and apparently the insight into this complex phenomenon is still incomplete. In this paper an attempt is made to increase the understanding by analysing in more detail the hydration conditions of the mortar at the interface. To this end, models of capillary water pressure and water transport for <b>cylindrical</b> capillaries (<b>bricks)</b> and water-containing particle systems (mortars) are analysed and applied to the evaluation of a series of bond strength tests. To enhance the potential for a more extensive analysis of the test results much attention is paid to the 'hygric' characterisation of bricks and mortars of the test series. It is concluded, that not only the water flow from mortar to brick (which takes place immediately after mortar-brick contact) but also a reversed water flow from brick to mortar (occurring after compaction and initial hydration of mortar) may significantly influence the bond strength development.

5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} on a hill {{once thought to be}} an Indian shell mound or midden (and sometimes falsely rumored to be a burial mound), but which is now determined to be a natural parabolic sand dune. The top of the 105 ft tower is 153 ft above sea level. The light can be seen [...] at sea. The lighthouse structure is brick with double masonry walls. The outer wall is conical, tapering from 31.5 in (eight bricks thick) at ground level to 18 in (three bricks thick) at base of lantern.

Hurricane Jeanne in 2004 sandblasted the paint from the upper portion of the tower, and the tower was repainted using a potassium silicate mineral coating.|$|R

40|$|Current {{technology}} for producing in-situ structural materials on future missions to Mars or the moon {{relies heavily on}} energy-intensive sintering processes to produce solid bricks from regolith. This process requires heating the material up to temperatures in excess of 1000 C and results in solid regolith pieces with compressive strengths {{in the range of}} 14000 to 28000 psi, but are heavily dependent on the porosity of the final material and are brittle. This method is currently preferred over a low temperature cementation process to prevent consumption of precious water and other non-renewable materials. A high strength structural material with low energy requirements is still needed for future colonization of other planets. To fulfill these requirements, a nano-functionalization process has been developed to produce structural bricks from regolith simulant and shows promising mechanical strength results. Functionalization of granular silicate particles into alkoxides using a simple low temperature chemical process produces a high surface area zeolite particles that are held together via inter-particle oxygen bonding. Addition of water in the resulting zeolite particles produces a sol-gel reaction called "inorganic polymerization" which gives a strong solid material after a curing process at 60 C. The aqueous solution by-product of the reaction is currently being investigated for its reusability; an essential component of any ISRU technology. For this study, two batches of regolith bricks are synthesized from JSC- 1 A; the first batch from fresh solvents and chemicals, the second batch made from the water solution by-product of the first batch. This is done to determine the feasibility of recycling necessary components of the synthesis process, mainly water. Characterization including BET surface area, SEM, and EDS has been done on the regolith bricks as well as the constituent particles,. The specific surface area of 17. 53 sq m/g (average) of the granular regolith material was obtained from nitrogen adsorption isotherm measurement. The size, shape and textures of regolith from SEM shows that the particles are 25 - 50 micrometers in size and mostly irregular in shape (Figure 1 a). The elemental composition of regolith was identified from EDS analysis showed the presence of Si, Al, Fe, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, O and C (see figure 1 b). Each set of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>brick</b> samples were prepared by low energy process, and cured for 21 and 28 days, respectively to compare their compressive strength. Figure 1 c, and d shows the JSC- 1 A brick and the compressive strength measurements. The results from the 21 day cured bricks (2 bricks) have been done and yielded an aver-age strength of 3050 psi, considerably higher than Portland cement mortars (Type IV and V). This promising technology provides the benefits of construction material similar to concrete, with a low complexity, low energy synthesis process and the likelihood of complete reusability of precious resources. Compressive strength using this method can be improved by increasing the surface area of the particles, using bi-modal particle size distribution, and adding certain additives to increase inter-particle forces...|$|E
