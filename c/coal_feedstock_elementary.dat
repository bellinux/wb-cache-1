40|$|Gasification of comingled biomass and <b>coal</b> <b>feedstock</b> is an {{effective}} means of reducing the net life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in the coal gasification process while maintaining its inherent benefits of abundance and high-energy density. However, feeding a comingled biomass and <b>coal</b> <b>feedstock</b> into a pressurized gasification reactor poses a technical problem. Conventional dry feeding systems, such as lock hoppers and pressurized pneumatic transport, are complex and operationally expensive. A slurry formation of comingled biomass and <b>coal</b> <b>feedstock</b> can be easily fed into the gasification reactor but, in normal conditions, only allows for a small portion of biomass in the mixture. This is a consequence of the hydroscopic and hydrophilic nature of the biomass. The College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) at the University of California, Riverside, has developed a process producing high solid content biomass-water slurry using a hydrothermal pretreatment process. In this paper, the systematic investigation of the rheological properties (e. g., shear rate, shear stress, and viscosity) of coal-water slurries, biomass-water slurries, and comingled biomass and coal-water slurries is reported. The solid particle size distribution in the slurry and the initial solid/water ratio were investigated to determine the impact on shear rate and viscosity. This was determined using a rotational rheometer. The experimental results show that larger particle size offers better pumpability. The presence of a high percentage of biomass in solid form significantly decreases slurry pumpability. It is also shown that the solid loading of the biomass-water slurry can be increased to approximately 35 wt%with viscosity of less than 0. 7 Pa 3 s after the pretreatment process. The solid loading increased to approximately 45 wt%when the biomass is comingled with coal...|$|R
40|$|The Hynol Process for {{conversion}} of coal {{and natural gas}} to methanol as a liquid fuel consists of three consecutive unit operations: (1) hydrogasification of coal, (2) steam reforming of the methane formed and added natural gas feedstock, and (3) catalytic methanol synthesis. The Hynol Process is a total recycle process. Using a process simulation computer program, mass and energy balances and yields and efficiency data have been obtained {{for a range of}} natural gas to <b>coal</b> <b>feedstock</b> ratios. Although the methanol yield increases with natural gas to coal feed ratio, the cost of feedstock per unit methanol is insensitive over a wide range of feedstock ratios. The Hynol Process produces a 13 % increase in methanol yield compared to the equivalent of two separate conventional coal gasification and natural gas reforming plants. The CO{sub 2 } emissions are reduced by 22 % for the Hynol plant compared to the conventional processes with greater CO{sub 2 } reductions at lower gas to <b>coal</b> <b>feedstock</b> ratios. A preliminary cost estimate for a 10, 000 tons/day Hynol methanol plant indicates a lower production cost than the current cost of methanol by the conventional natural gas reforming plant.

40|$|This Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{sponsored}} project developed {{processes for}} converting <b>coal</b> <b>feedstocks</b> to carbon products, including coal-derived pitch, coke foams and fibers based on solvent extraction processes. A key {{technology is the}} use of hydrogenation accomplished at elevated temperatures and pressures to obtain a synthetic coal pitch. Hydrogenation, or partial direct liquefaction of coal, is used to modify the properties of raw coal such that a molten synthetic pitch can be obtained. The amount of hydrogen required to produce a synthetic pitch is about an order of magnitude less than the amount required to produce synthetic crude oil. Hence the conditions for synthetic pitch production consume very little hydrogen and can be accomplished at substantially lower pressure. In the molten state, hot filtration or centrifugation can be used to separate dissolved coal chemicals from mineral matter and insolubles (inertinite), resulting in the production of a purified hydrocarbon pitch. Alternatively, if hydrogenation is not used, aromatic hydrocarbon liquids appropriate for use as precursors to carbon products can obtained by dissolving coal in a solvent. As in the case for partial direct liquefaction pitches, undissolved coal is removed via hot filtration or centrifugation. Excess solvent is boiled off and recovered.

40|$|The {{viscosity}} of {{the molten}} ash (slag) {{resulting from the}} mineral constituents in carbon feedstock used in slagging gasifiers is critical for controlling the gasification process. The viscosity of two synthetic slags with compositions resembling the mineral impurities in average eastern and western <b>coal</b> <b>feedstock</b> was examined at temperatures from 1300 – 1500 °C using a rotating bob viscometer. A few combinations of atmospheres and experimental materials were investigated with respect to one another to determine slag viscosity. A CO/CO 2 atmosphere (CO/CO 2 = 1. 8, corresponding to a PO 2 = 10 – 8 atm) is required to sustain ferrous ions in FeO-containing slags, {{an environment that is}} oxidizing to most metals. Iron oxide in the slag prevents usage of Fe parts. In unpurified Ar, the Fe metal surface oxidizes. Using purified argon prevents iron measurement components from oxidation; however, the metallic surfaces act as nucleation sites for the reduction of the Fe oxide in the slag into metallic Fe. Dissolution of ceramic materials into the slag, including Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2, occurs in both atmospheres. Therefore, evaluating slag properties in the laboratory is challenging. The measured viscosities of two synthetic slags in this study diverged depending upon material selection. This difference is likely attributable to container/spindle-slag interactions. Viscosity measurements of the eastern coal slag using all ceramic parts agreed best with FactSage prediction above 1350 °C, with an average activation energy of 271. 2 kJ. For western coal slag, the dissolution of container/spindle materials was substantial during the measurement, with precipitation of crystalline phase noted.

Experiments were conducted with a hot-face temperature of 1723 K (1450 C) in a CO/CO 2 gas mixture with a ratio of 1. 8, which corresponded to an approximate oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 8 atm. Interactions between the slags and the refractory produced solid-solution spinel layers on the top interfaces of the refractory samples, whose chemistries reflected the compositions of major constituents of the starting slags. FeCr 2 O 4 formed when samples were infiltrated with slag composition rich in FeO, which was typical for coals derived from eastern USA. (Mg,Fe) Cr 2 O 4 formed when samples were infiltrated with slags, containing considerable concentrations of both MgO and FeO that were common in western US coals.

This work examines organic Rankine cycles for use in a polygeneration plant that converts <b>coal</b> <b>feedstock</b> into hydrocarbon products and electricity. Since a Fischer Tropsch reactor is the largest source of low grade heat in the polygeneration plant, rejecting heat at a constant temperature of 240 °C, the analysis in this work focuses on utilizing the waste heat from this process. Organic Rankine cycles (ORC's) are modeled in MATLAB using pure substance data available from Refprop 8. 0. Various working fluids are considered, with a particular focus on hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane. Hexane is the best option for the Fischer Tropsch heat source and the working fluids considered here. A set of ORC design concepts (building blocks) is developed to allow a cycle to be matched to a generic heat source, and is demonstrated using the Fischer Tropsch heat source profile. The low pressure steam Rankine cycle achieves a 20. 6 % conversion, while a baseline hexane organic Rankine cycle achieves a 26. 2 % conversion efficiency for the same Fischer Tropsch heat source. If the ORC building blocks are combined into a cycle targeted to match the temperature-enthalpy profile of the heat source, this customized hexane cycle achieves 28. 5 % conversion efficiency. For a polygeneration plant with a 25, 000 ton per day input of coal, the conversion efficiency is improved by 0. 3 to 0. 5 points. Moreover, by combining the ORC building blocks identified in this work into new configurations, cycle designers can create customized organic Rankine cycles that target any heat source temperature-enthalpy profile to achieve improved conversion efficiencies. by Kevin J.
