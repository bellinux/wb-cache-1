50|$|Pallas was {{the first}} warship in the Royal Navy to be fitted with <b>compound</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>engines,</b> and a high {{performance}} was expected from them; her specification claimed a speed under power of fourteen knots, which was necessary {{if she were to}} ram enemy ships who were themselves under way. On her trials, however, riding light, she achieved only 12.5 kn, while piling up an enormous bow wave. After her bow contour was hastily modified she was able to just reach 13 kn, which in the event of armed conflict would have been insufficient to allow her to fulfil her designed ramming function against any enemy ship with an operational power plant.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} success accrued to Robert Fulton's North River Steamboat (often called Clermont) in US in 1807, followed in Europe by the 45 ft [...] of 1812. Steam propulsion progressed considerably {{over the rest}} of the 19th century. Notable developments include the steam surface condenser, which eliminated the use of sea water in the ship's boilers. This, along with improvements in boiler technology, permitted higher steam pressures, and thus the use of higher efficiency multiple <b>expansion</b> (<b>compound)</b> <b>engines.</b> As the means of transmitting the engine's power, paddle wheels gave way to more efficient screw propellers.|$|R

5000|$|Admiral Dewey, {{also known}} as Georgetown and today as Helen McAllister, is a 113 ft tugboat built in 1900 at the Burlee Drydock in Port Richmond, New York.

She towed coal barges to refuel ships in the harbor. In 1955, she was sold to a Charleston, South Carolina tugboat company.

5000|$|By 1941, {{the steam}} turbine was the {{preferred}} marine steam engine {{because of its}} greater efficiency compared to earlier reciprocating compound steam engines. Steam turbine engines required very precise manufacturing techniques and balancing and a complicated reduction gear, however, and the companies capable of manufacturing them already were committed to the large construction program for warships. Therefore, a 140-ton vertical triple <b>expansion</b> <b>compound</b> steam <b>engine</b> of obsolete design was selected to power Liberty ships because it was cheaper and easier to build in the numbers required for the Liberty ship program and because more companies could manufacture it. Eighteen different companies eventually built the engine. It had the additional advantage of ruggedness and simplicity. Parts manufactured by one company were interchangeable with those made by another, and the openness of its design made most of its moving parts easy to see, access, and oil. The engine — 21 feet m long and 19 feet m tall — was designed to operate at 76 rpm and propel a Liberty ship at about [...]|$|R
