40|$|An Application of {{heterogenous}} catalysis reaction for {{synthesis of}} synthetic vanillin (3 -hydroxy- 2 -methoxybenzaldehyde) from eugenol (4 -allyl- 2 -methoxyphenol) of clove oil. It has been already known, that heterogeneous catalysts have more advantages compared to homogeneous catalysts. This research tried to utilize heterogeneous catalysts {{for an alternative}} reaction on synthesis of vanillin from eugenol of <b>clove</b> <b>stem</b> oil. This synthesis needs two steps reactions, isomerization reaction of eugenol to produce isoeugenol and oxidation reaction of isoeugenol to produce vanillin. Two types catalysts were used: (1) solid superbase, which was used on eugenol isomerization, and (2) phase transfer catalyst [18]-crown ether- 6, which was used on oxidation of isoeugenol. Solid superbase catalyst was prepared using γ- and η-alumina, treated with sodium hydroxide and sodium metal. Alumina was extracted from kaolin from Belitung island by acid process, and the yield of aluminas were 9. 0 % γ-Al 2 O 3 and 10. 28 % η-Al 2 O 3. Heterogeneous catalysis study on eugenol isomerization showed that the reaction could proceed at low temperature. The eugenol isomerization reaction conditions were : temperature 10 ºC, reaction time 9 hours, <b>clove</b> <b>stem</b> oil 25 mmol, and solid catalyst superbase γ-Al 2 O 3 /NaOH/Na 2 g. The result of products conversion were 64. 42 % trans-isoeugenol and 6. 11 % cis-isoeugenol. This study included the comparison activities study of three solid superbase catalysts : γ-Al 2 O 3 /NaOH/Na, η-Al 2 O 3 /NaOH/Na, and γ-Al 2 O 3 (E. Merck) /NaOH/Na, which showed that γ-Al 2 O 3 /NaOH/Na had better activity than those two latter solid superbase catalysts. Study on isoeugenol oxidation reaction using KMnO 4 as an oxidazing agent and phase transfer catalyst [18]-crown ether- 6, gave the indication that vanillin was produced mixed with other compounds. The yield of vanillin in acid medium (pH 2) was 0. 021 %, in neutral medium (pH 7) was 0. 028 % and in basic medium (pH 9) was 0. 015 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effects of <b>Clove</b> <b>Stem</b> Oil (Oleum caryophylli) or CSO extracts on the growth of Escherichia coli. A 4 x 3 Factorial Design was applied in this study. The first factor was 4 types of E. coli isolates that collected from native chicken (C), young cattle (A), piglet (B 1) and pig (B 2), while the second factor was 3 concentrations of CSO extract, that was 50. 00, 25. 00 and 12. 50 percents. Fifteen micro liters of CSO extract was dropped in sterile paper disks. These disk were laid on the MEU agar media previously inoculated with each of the four isolates and were incubated overnight at 370 C. The bacterial growth inhibition zones were observed and measured. The results demonstrated that the higher concentration of the CSO extracts, the higher bacterial growth inhibition effects obtained. Fhe growth inhibition effects of the CSO extracts on E. coli isolates C, A, B 1 and B 2 were significantly different at P< 0. 05. It could be concluded that the CSO extracts were effective to control the E. coli growth...|$|E

It also has antimicrobial properties and {{is used as a}} preservative in cosmetics. It occurs naturally in the sweet cherry and in <b>clove</b> <b>stems,</b> as well as in butter.|$|R
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{properties of the}} clove plant are due {{to the presence of}} eugenol, an aromatic phenolic compound. Eugenol was isolated from <b>clove</b> by <b>stem</b> distillation. The alkene group in eugenol was epoxidized resulting in the synthesis of epoxide-eugenol. The heterocyclic ring in epoxide was cleaved to a bromoalcohol derivative. The compounds synthesized epoxideeugenol, bromo alcohol and euginol were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923). Epoxide-eugenol was found to be the most effective antimicrobial agent among the three compounds tested...|$|R

Selenium dioxide (SeO 2) and germanium dioxide (GeO 2) liquid treatments significantly increased selenium (Se) and germanium (Ge) contents in garlic <b>stems,</b> garlic <b>cloves</b> and clove peels. In soil treated with ZBFC, Se contents in garlic <b>stems,</b> <b>cloves,</b> and clove peels was 13. 89 -, 12. 79 -, and 10. 96 -fold higher, respectively, than in the controls. The inorganic contents of plants grown in soil treated with functional strengthened fertilizers were also higher than in plants grown in control soil. Soil treated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) agents exhibited significantly greater spore density and root colonization rate than in untreated soil. The density of chitinolytic microorganisms in soil treated with colloidal chitin was also significantly higher than in untreated soil. The cation exchange capacities (CEC) in ZAFC-, ZBFC-, and ZBF-treated soils was 16. 05 %, 8. 95 %, and 8. 80 % higher than in control soil 28 weeks after sowing...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the performance, {{emission}} and economic evaluation {{of using the}} <b>clove</b> <b>stem</b> oil (CSO) –diesel blended fuels as alternative fuels for diesel engine have been carried out. Experiments were performed to evaluate {{the impact of the}} CSO–diesel blended fuels on the engine performance and emissions. The societal life cycle cost (LCC) was chosen as an important indicator for comparing alternative fuel operating modes. The LCC using the pure diesel fuel, 25 % CSO and 50 % CSO–diesel blended fuels in diesel engine are analysed. These costs include the vehicle first cost, fuel cost and exhaust emissions cost. A complete macroeconomic assessment of the effect of introducing the CSO–diesel blended fuels to the diesel engine is not included in the study. Engine tests show that performance parameters of the CSO–diesel blended fuels do not differ greatly from those of the pure diesel fuel. Slight power losses, combined with an increase in fuel consumption, were experienced with the CSO–diesel blended fuels. This is due to the low heating value of the CSO–diesel blended fuels. Emissions of CO and HC are low for the CSO–diesel blended fuels. NOx emissions were increased remarkably when the engine was fuelled with the 50 % CSO–diesel blended fuel operation mode. A remarkable reduction in the exhaust smoke emissions can be achieved when operating on the CSO–diesel blended fuels. Based on the LCC analysis, the CSO–diesel blended fuels would not be competitive with the pure diesel fuel, even though the environmental impact of emission is valued monetarily. This is due to the high price of the CSO...|$|E
50|$|Thai dishes use a {{wide variety}} of herbs, spices and leaves rarely found in the West. The {{characteristic}} flavor of kaffir lime leaves (bai makrut) appears in many Thai soups (e.g., the hot and sour tom yam) or curry from the southern and central areas of Thailand. The Thai lime (manao) is smaller, darker and sweeter than the kaffir lime, which has a rough looking skin with a stronger lime flavor. Kaffir lime leaves or rind is frequently combined with galangal (kha) and lemongrass (takhrai), either kept whole in simmered dishes or blended together with liberal amounts of chilies and other aromatics to make curry paste. Fresh Thai basil, distintively redolent of <b>cloves,</b> and with <b>stems</b> which are often tinged with a purple color, are used to add fragrance in certain dishes such as green curry. Other commonly used herbs in Thai cuisine include phak chi, (coriander or cilantro leaves), rak phak chi (cilantro/coriander roots), spearmint (saranae), holy basil (kraphao), ginger (khing), turmeric (khamin), fingerroot (krachai), culantro (phak chi farang), pandanus leaves (bai toei), and Thai lemon basil (maenglak). Spices and spice mixtures used in Thai cuisine include phong phalo (five-spice powder), phong kari (curry powder), and fresh and dried peppercorns (phrik thai). Northern Thai larb uses a very elaborate spice mix, called phrik lap, which includes ingredients such as cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, prickly ash seeds and cinnamon.|$|R
