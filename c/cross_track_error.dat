40|$|A {{human-in-the-loop}} {{high fidelity}} flight simulation experiment was conducted, which investigated and compared breakout procedures for Very Closely Spaced Parallel Approaches (VCSPA) with {{two and three}} runways. To understand the feasibility, usability and human factors of two and three runway VCSPA, data were collected and analyzed on the dependent variables of breakout <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> <b>error</b> and pilot workload. Independent variables included number of runways, cause of breakout and location of breakout. Results indicated larger <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> <b>error</b> and higher workload using three runways as compared to 2 -runway operations. Significant interaction effects involving breakout cause and breakout location were also observed. Across all conditions, <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> <b>error</b> values showed high levels of breakout trajectory accuracy and pilot workload remained manageable. Results suggest possible avenues of future adaptation for adopting these procedures (e. g., pilot training), while also showing potential promise of the concept. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{autonomous}} catamaran, {{based on}} a modified Prindle- 19 day-sailing Catamaran, was built to test the viability of GPS-based system identification for precision control. The catamaran was fitted with several sensors and actuators to characterize the dynamics. Using an electric trolling motor, and lead ballast to match all-up weight, several system identification passes were performed to excite system modes and model the dynamic response. LQG controllers were designed {{based on the results}} of the system identification passes, and tested with the electric trolling motor.

40|$|Simple and {{efficient}} geometric controllers, like Pure-Pursuit, {{have been widely}} used in various types of autonomous vehicles to solve tracking problems. In this paper, we have developed a new pursuit method, named CF-Pursuit, which has been based on Pure-Pursuit but with certain differences. In CF-Pursuit, in order to reduce fitting errors, we used a clothoid C 1 curve to replace the circle employed in Pure-Pursuit. This improvement to the fitting method helps the Pursuit method to decrease <b>tracking</b> <b>errors.</b> As regards the selection of look-ahead distance, we employed a fuzzy system to directly consider the path's curvature. There are three input variables in this fuzzy system, 6 mcurvature, 9 mcurvature and 12 mcurvature, calculated from the clothoid fit with the current position and the goal position on the defined path. A Sugeno fuzzy model was adapted to output a reasonable look-ahead distance using the experiences of human drivers as well as our own tests.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{proposes a}} novel application of Skid-to-Turn maneuvers for fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) inspecting locally linear infrastructure. Fixed wing UAVs, following {{the design of}} manned aircraft, commonly employ Bank-to-Turn ma- neuvers to change heading and thus direction of travel. Whilst effective, banking an aircraft during the inspection of ground based features hinders data collection, with body fixed sen- sors angled away {{from the direction of}} turn and a panning motion induced through roll rate that can reduce data quality. By adopting Skid-to-Turn maneuvers, the aircraft can change heading whilst maintaining wings level flight, thus allowing body fixed sensors to main- tain a downward facing orientation. An Image-Based Visual Servo controller is developed to directly control the position of features as captured by onboard inspection sensors. This improves on the indirect approach taken by other tracking controllers where a course over ground directly above the feature is assumed to capture it centered in the field of view. Performance of the proposed controller is compared against that of a Bank-to-Turn tracking controller driven by GPS derived <b>cross</b> <b>track</b> <b>error</b> in a simulation environment developed to replicate the field of view of a body fixed camera...|$|E
