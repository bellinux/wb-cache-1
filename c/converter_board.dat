40|$|Some {{hardware}} and software aspects of the transputer have been investigated. This involved two major areas of study. One was the development of inexpensive analog interfaces {{and the other was}} the development of an image processing system to identify carbon anode blocks used in the aluminum smelting process. The first part of this study looked at interfacing analog signals to the transputer via the transputer links. In particular, analog to digital and digital to analog converter boards, which were compatible to the industrial standard TRAM configuration, were designed and tested. The 8 bit single channel AID <b>converter</b> <b>board</b> developed was capable of handling a data rate of almost 200 thousand samples per second with a link speed of 20 Mbits/s. The multi-channel AID <b>converter</b> <b>board</b> was capable of sampling at 19. 69 thousand samples per second per channel on eight channels, and the D/ A <b>converter</b> <b>board</b> was capable of handling a data throughput of 198. 01 thousand conversions per second. The study illustrates that these maximum conversion rates are determined by the OCCAM software and not by the link speed. The second part of the study involved the development of a prototype image processing system to remotely identify carbon anodes. The software development for this was implemented in Turbo Pascal and OCCAM allowing a comparison to be made of the speed of these two implementations. The study details how the image processing techniques of connectivity analysis was applied to the pattern identification process. The use of sequential, concurrent and parallel processes in the implementation is discussed. The study showed that by using a fairly simple two dimensional pattern and a transputer for the processing, {{it would be possible to}} identify carbon anodes at several locations in a production plant within the time constraints of the production process...|$|E

40|$|A dc-dc {{converter}} {{has been developed}} for retrofitting inside the vacuum space of the HTS rotor of a synchronous generator. The heavy copper sections of the current leads used for energising the HTS field winding were replaced by cryogenic power electronics; consisting of the converter and a rotor control unit. The <b>converter</b> <b>board</b> was designed using an H-bridge configuration with two 5 A rated wires connecting the cryogenic boards to the stator control board located {{on the outside of}} the generator and drawing power from a (5 A, 50 V) dc power source. The robustness of <b>converter</b> <b>board</b> was well demonstrated when it was powered up from a cold start at 82 K. When charging the field winding with moderate currents (30 A), the heat in-leak to the ‘cold’ rotor core was only 2 W. It continued to function down to 74 K, surviving several quenches. However, the quench protection function failed when injecting 75 A into the field winding, resulting in the burn out of one of the DC-link capacitors. The magnitudes of the critical currents measured with the original current leads were compared to the quench currents, which was defined as the current which triggered quench protection protocol. The difference between the two currents was rather large, (~ 20 A). However, additional measurements using a single HTS coil in liquid nitrogen found that this reduction should not be so dramatic and in the region of 4 A. Our conclusions identified the converter’s switching voltage and its operating frequency as two parameters, which could have contributed to lowering the quench current. Magnetic fields and eddy currents are expected to be more prominent the field winding and its impact on the converter also need further investigation...|$|E
