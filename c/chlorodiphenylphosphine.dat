40|$|Chapter 1 {{reviews the}} {{literature}} concerning the principal synthetic routes to hydroxyphosphine transition-metal complexes and their reactions, which {{have led to}} the formation of some unusual diphosphoxane derivatives. The preparation and characterization of aminophosphine complexes of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten are presented in Chapter 2. The phosphorus-nitrogen bond is readily cleaved by HC 1 gas and other aqueous acids, to afford phosphorus-chlorine and phosphorus-oxygen bonded derivatives. The chromium and tungsten aminophosphine complexes have been found to be particularly useful for the preparation of <b>chlorodiphenylphosphine</b> derivatives. In addition their reactions with alcohols have also been investigated. The study of aminophosphine complexes has been extended to Pt(II) derivatives in Chapter 3. Cleavage of the phosphorus-nitrogen bond in these complexes is again observed to proceed smoothly with gaseous HC 1 and aqueous HC 1, but not with other aqueous acids. Treatment of the <b>chlorodiphenylphosphine</b> complex, cis-[PtC 12 (PPh 2 C 1) 2], with sodium sulphide afforded a four-membered metallacycle. A similar four-membered metallacycle was also obtained by refluxing the hydroxyphosphine complex, cis-[PtC 12 (PPh 2 OH) 2], in toluene for 12 h. Other reactions of the hydroxyphosphine complex with <b>chlorodiphenylphosphine</b> and dichlorophenyl- phosphine {{led to the formation of}} six-membered ring systems. The molecular structure of the complex [NHEt 3] [Pt(C?CPh) (Ph 2 PO) 2 (Ph 2 POH) ] has been established by X-ray crystallography and reveals an unsymmetrical hydrogen-bridged system. Some of the complexes have been characterised via their 1, 2 -dithiolene derivatives. Treatment of cis-[PtC 12 (PNEt 2 Ph 2) 2] with diphenacyl sulphone in the presence of silver(I) oxide afforded the metallathietane- 3, 3 -dioxide complex, L 2 Pt-CHR-S (O) 2 -CHR (L=Ph 2 PNEt 2; R = C(O) Ph).

The molecular structures of 1 a, 2 a, 3 a and 4 a,b have been established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The molecular structures reveal that even C 1 –N 1 –P 1 angle (124. 62 ∘) in compound 1 a is less obtuse compared to the corresponding C 1 –N 1 –Si 1 angles (157. 8 ∘) observed in related N-silylated 2 -iminoimidazolines and trimethylsilyl iminophosphoranes. C 1 –N 1 –P 1 angles are further widened in compounds 2 a, 3 a, and 4 a,b due to the attachment of chalcogen atoms onto phosphorus atom...|$|E
