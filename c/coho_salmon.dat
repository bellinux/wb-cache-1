5|$|Large {{populations of}} salmon {{inhabited}} the creek before urban construction altered the watershed and the stream channel, {{and in the}} 21stcentury, the creek and its tributaries still provide habitat for smaller numbers of chinook and <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Steelhead populations in Johnson Creek are within the Lower Columbia River steelhead distinct population segment and listed as threatened (2011). Chinook and <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> are listed as threatened {{as part of the}} Lower Columbia River Evolutionary Significant Unit (2011).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fish inhabiting the river include Chinook salmon, {{threatened}} <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> and rainbow trout. Fish populations are declining, however, due to low {{water quality and}} barriers such as dams and culverts.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the east}} end of the park, the {{free-flowing}} reaches of Balch Creek support a population of resident cutthroat trout. Near the west end, furthest from the city center, Miller Creek retains much of its historic nature and supports a greater diversity of aquatic organisms than other Forest Park streams. Biological field surveys of Miller Creek in 1990 noted sea-run cutthroat trout, <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> and short-head cottid, as well as abundant macroinvertebrate species including stoneflies, mayflies, caddisflies, water striders, and crayfish.|$|E
50|$|The Uda River {{is a prime}} {{habitat for}} the pink, chum, red, and <b>coho</b> <b>salmons.</b> Other fish species found in the Uda include the Siberian taimen, two forms of lenok, and Amur grayling. The river is {{especially}} important as it {{remains one of the}} last strongholds of taimen, which have dwindled in other Siberian rivers. Taimens grow to huge sizes here; specimens weighing 95 kg have been caught here.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the species}} of {{salmonids}} migrating routinely through the ladder at the Chittenden Locks are Chinook (king) <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), <b>Coho</b> (silver) <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Sockeye (red) salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss).|$|R

5|$|The Austin Heights area {{contains}} Como Lake, {{a renowned}} urban fishing and recreation area, and headwaters for the Como watershed. The watershed {{represents one of}} the last urban watersheds in the Tri-Cities that supports wild stocks of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> as well as other species at risk such as coastal cutthroat trout (both sea-run and resident) and bird species such as the great blue heron and green heron. It also contains Mundy Park, one of the largest urban parks in the Metro Vancouver area.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity River {{was once}} {{known for its}} {{prolific}} anadromous fish (salmon, steelhead and sturgeon) runs. The actual number of fish returning to the river each year to spawn, prior to European settlement, is uncertain {{due to the lack}} of records. During the first half of the 20th century, before damming, the fall chinook salmon run was estimated at anywhere between 19,000 and 75,500. The spring chinook and <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> runs were about 10,000 each and the annual steelhead run was about 50,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E
50|$|The Homathko River {{is a major}} {{producer}} of Chum and Pink salmon. Other fish include <b>Coho</b> and Chinook <b>salmon,</b> Rainbow and Steelhead trout, Cutthroat trout, Bull trout, and Dolly Varden trout.|$|R
50|$|Fecal {{coliform}} bacteria and other contaminants {{have been detected}} in the creek water. Occasionally, chinook <b>salmon,</b> <b>coho,</b> and cutthroat trout {{can be found in}} the section of creek within the park (the salmon especially in September and October).|$|R

5|$|The river {{supported}} species including chinook salmon, <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> and sockeye salmon, {{as well as}} steelhead, white sturgeon, and Pacific lamprey. It {{is known}} that before the construction of dams on the river, there were three major chinook salmon runs in the Snake River; in the spring, summer and fall, totaling about 120,000fish, and the sockeye salmon run was about 150,000. The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{operates}} the Cole M. Rivers Hatchery {{near the base}} of the dam at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogue–Elk Hatchery built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), <b>Coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the hatchery in 1973 to offset the loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate and Elk Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest salmon and steelhead hatchery in the United States.|$|E
5|$|More than 250 {{wildlife}} species, including peregrine falcon, {{bald eagle}} and northern spotted owl {{are thought to}} frequent the watershed. Migratory birds such as loons use the basin for feeding and nesting as they travel along the Pacific Flyway. Native fish species include chinook and <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific lamprey, and rainbow trout, but since 1922 the headworks dam or its successor, Dam 2, have blocked anadromous fish passage to the upper river and its tributaries. Many amphibian and reptile species thrive near streams and ponds. Roosevelt elk, American black bear, coyote, cougar, black-tailed deer, North American river otter, American mink, and North American beaver are among the mammals found in the watershed.|$|E
25|$|Muskegon Lake is a {{first class}} walleye fishery and has many other {{freshwater}} species including the Lake Perch. Lake Michigan off Muskegon hosts large numbers of <b>coho</b> and Chinook <b>salmon,</b> steelhead, brown trout, lake perch and many other game fish.|$|R

50|$|Salmon populations now {{exist in}} all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted in the late 1960s in {{response}} to the growing population of non-native alewife by the state of Michigan. Now Chinook (King), Atlantic, and <b>Coho</b> (silver) <b>salmon</b> are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide {{much in the way of}} a commercial fishery, but have led to the development of a thriving sportfishery.|$|R
5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Species {{diversity}} is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries. Threatened, endangered, or sensitive species include spring Chinook salmon, winter steelhead, chum salmon, <b>Coho</b> <b>salmon</b> and Oregon chub. In the central valley, several {{projects have been}} done to restore and protect wetlands {{in order to provide}} habitat for bald eagles, Fender's blue butterfly (of which 6,000 remain), Oregon chub, Bradshaw's desert parsley, a variety of Willamette fleabane, and Kincaid's lupine. In the early 21stcentury, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on the pesticide DDT and on the birds' ability to use power poles for nesting. Beaver populations, presumed to be much lower than historic levels, are increasing throughout the basin.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{significant}} diversity of salmonids present in the bay. Steelhead populations in California have dramatically declined due to human and natural causes; in the Bay Area, all naturally spawned anadromous steelhead populations below natural and manmade impassable barriers in California streams from the Russian River to Aptos Creek, and the drainages of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays are listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Central California Coast <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> population is the most endangered of the many troubled salmon populations {{on the west coast}} of the United States, including populations residing in tributaries to the San Francisco Bay. Industrial, mining, and other uses of mercury have resulted in a widespread distribution of that poisonous metal in the bay, with uptake in the bay's phytoplankton and contamination of its sportfish.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{low water}} quality, the Little Applegate {{watershed}} supports populations of <b>coho</b> and Chinook <b>salmon,</b> along with 138 known and 134 suspected species of other vertebrates. Sixty-four {{percent of the}} watershed is forested, although its health is slowly declining due to fire suppression.|$|R
50|$|The {{wilderness}} is home {{to several}} rare species, including wolverine, martin, fisher, northern spotted owl and Roosevelt elk. There is also black bear, black-tailed deer, and many varieties of birds. The clear streams provide spawning grounds for steelhead, <b>coho</b> and Chinook <b>salmon.</b>|$|R
25|$|Salmon {{populations have}} been {{established}} in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted {{by the state of}} Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native alewife. Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and <b>coho</b> (silver) <b>salmon</b> are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide {{much in the way of}} a commercial fishery, but have led to the development of a thriving sport fishery.|$|R
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer {{a number of}} fish for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown trout and {{cutthroat}} trout appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of trout. Bull trout {{can be found in the}} upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope cutthroat trout can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E
