50|$|CNAME {{records are}} handled {{specially}} {{in the domain}} name system, and have several restrictions on their use. When a DNS resolver encounters a CNAME record while looking for a regular resource record, it will restart the query using the <b>canonical</b> <b>name</b> instead of the original name. (If the resolver is specifically told to look for CNAME records, the <b>canonical</b> <b>name</b> (right-hand side) is returned, rather than restarting the query.) The <b>canonical</b> <b>name</b> that a CNAME record points to can be anywhere in the DNS, whether local or on a remote server in a different DNS zone.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem of}} how {{variables}} may be renamed is difficult.
