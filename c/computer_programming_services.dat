40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} innovation efforts of large, technology-intensive firms as they pertain to firm performance. The research examines two distinct groups of technology intensive firms deriving from countries with opposing stages {{of economic development}} and contrasting demographics of their populations: Rapidly Developing Economies (RDEs) and European Union (EU) countries. Technology enables firms to re-imagine their core competencies, improve existing processes, and model improved processes and routines. By understanding the return on investing in innovative pursuits, firms could adapt strategic business models to capture firm growth that has previously been under-developed and secure a competitive advantage. Likewise, local and national government agencies could offer specific incentives to help ensure longevity and sustainability to their position in world markets and identify previously untapped trading partners and strategic alliances. In addition, strategists would be better equipped to support and target R&D initiatives during declines in the market and/or industry. The results are reported according to manufacturing and service industries. The studies indicate that the most profitable firms derive from the service sector versus manufacturing. Custom Computer Programming firms represents the highest profit margins in EU countries and <b>Computer</b> <b>Programming</b> <b>Services</b> represents the highest profit margins for RDE countries. Despite more firms being represented from RDE than the EU, these firms do not spend more than large, technology firms from the EU. Upon investigating which group acquired more patents, {{it was found that}} RDE countries have more patents granted than EU countries. In addition, RDEs currently have more high-tech exports as a percentage of manufactured goods per capita than EU countries. The impact of the global recession appeared {{to have an impact on}} large, technology-intensive firms in the EU in particular, while a majority of RDE firms have already returned to or have exceeded pre-recession levels. The incorporation date was also examined to determine both the age of firms included in the study, as well as the labor capital of both groups. It was determined that RDE firms included in the study hire significantly more employees than EU firms, and more manufacturing employees were hired than those in the service sector.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{organization of}} firm activities distributes organizational resources, defines firm boundaries and determines firms 2 ̆ 7 physical structure. Yet, while resource distribution, boundary definition, and firm structure are key {{themes in the}} strategy literature, the strategic import of firms 2 ̆ 7 physical organization (i. e., the physical distribution of resources, administrative units and firm activities, and the physical design and layout of tangible resources) remains largely unexplored. This dissertation explores the strategic relevance of firms 2 ̆ 7 physical organization, unifying interconnected - but fragmented - bodies of knowledge from the fields of management, design and geography. Unlike traditional economic geography studies, I adopt a multi-level (e. g., inter- and intra-firm) and multi-scale (e. g., bird 2 ̆ 7 s-eye geographic patterns, and up-close design) view; I also emphasize firm-wide physical organization, and links to firm-level outcomes (e. g., administration, value creation and competitive advantage). This approach yields a uniquely firm-centric, strategic lens for studying the physical organization of economic activity - a 2 ̆ 7 strategic firm geography 2 ̆ 7 perspective. ^ This dissertation develops this strategic firm geography perspective, with seven main chapters organized in three parts. Part One: Foundations focuses on 2 ̆ 7 physical organization 2 ̆ 7 scholarship, investigating theoretical and empirical reasons why this subject is underexplored in contemporary management research, and proposing strategies for addressing this gap. Part Two: Building Blocks presents methods for studying firms 2 ̆ 7 physical organization, and illuminates behavioral mechanisms and processes that underlie its strategic relevance. Part Three: Applied 2 ̆ 7 Strategic Firm Geography 2 ̆ 7 shows how the theory, methods and mechanisms from Parts One and Two {{can be applied to}} two empirical settings: the U. S. <b>Computer</b> <b>Programming</b> <b>Services</b> sector, and multi-sector M 2 ̆ 6 A involving U. S. Targets (and foreign and domestic Acquirers). I explore cross-sectional and cross-year (1987 - 2002) variation in firms 2 ̆ 7 physical organization, testing for differences by type of firm activity and/or relationship, and find that firms use physical organization as a strategic tool, and still use 2 ̆ 7 physical proximity 2 ̆ 7 as an organizing tool to facilitate administrative coordination/control, even after the mainstream adoption of information and communication technologies. Together, the theory and empirics provide insight into the strategic role of firms 2 ̆ 7 physical organization, and uncover opportunities for extending broader management theory. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{lays the}} {{conceptual}} foundations {{for the study}} of the market value of information commodities. The terms “information” and “commodity” are given precise definitions in order to characterize “information commodity,” and thus to provide a sound basis for examining questions of pricing. Information is used by marketplace actors to make decisions or to control processes. Thus, we define information as the ability of a goal‐seeking system to decide or control. By “decide” we mean choosing one alternative among several that may be executed in pursuit of a well‐defined objective. “Control” means the ordering of actions. Two factors make it possible to turn something into a commodity: (1) appropriability, and (2) valuability. If something cannot be appropriated (i. e., owned), it cannot be traded; moreover, if it cannot be valued, there is no way to determine for what it might be exchanged. We define an information commodity as a commodity whose function it is to enable the user, a goal‐seeking system, to obtain information, i. e., to otain the ability to decide or control. Books, databases, <b>computer</b> <b>programs,</b> and advisory <b>services</b> are common examples of information commodities. Their market value derives from their capacity to furnish information...|$|R
