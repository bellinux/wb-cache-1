2500|$|Designed as a {{cruising}} cutter for Bering Sea service, Manning {{was built}} by Atlantic Works, East Boston, Massachusetts, for the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service. She was accepted by Captain R.M Clark for the Revenue Cutter Service on 11 August 1897. She commissioned on 8 January 1898 and was assigned cruising grounds along the New England coast. Her lines were those of ancestral clipper cutters, but with a plumb bow instead of the more graceful <b>clipper</b> <b>stem.</b> She was powered by a 2,181 horsepower triple expansion steam engine and utilized a coal fired high pressure boiler which allowed {{a top speed of}} 17 knots. The hull was of composite construction with frames placed at two foot intervals with 3/8 inch steel plate and sheathed from her bottom to two feet above the waterline with five inch thick Oregon fir planks. Below the waterline Manning was sheathed in copper and had eleven watertight bulkheads. The composite design was thought at the time better to weather the ice conditions of the Bering Sea. As tensions mounted before the Spanish–American War was declared, she carried a single bow torpedo tube. Manning and her sister ships USRC Gresham, USRC McCulloch, USRC Algonquin, and [...] were the last cruising cutters rigged for sail and carried the first electric generators installed on cutters. As a class, they were suitable for scouting, for rendering assistance, and for cruising at moderately long range. So successful was the design that these cutters furnished the general pattern for cutter construction for the ensuing 20 years.|$|E
5000|$|Magnus Mail {{was one of}} {{the last}} tramp steamers to be built with a <b>clipper</b> <b>stem.</b> [...] A {{painting}} of her from 1895 by the Italian artist Antonio Luzzo (1855-1907) shows her under sail with her two masts under schooner rig. [...] Westoll Line ships exported coal and patent fuel to Italy and Egypt and imported grain from Black Sea ports to the United Kingdom. [...] In February 1908 Magnus Mail ran aground outside Garston Docks in Liverpool.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Kinnow' {{harvesting}} starts {{when the}} fruit's external colour becomes orange, from December to February. The best harvesting time is mid-January to mid-February, when the fruit attains a TSS/acid ratio of 12:1 to 14:1. The fruit quality declines in later pickings. Fruits are harvested by clipping the stem {{with the help}} of sharp <b>clippers</b> (secateurs). The <b>stem</b> is cut as short as possible to avoid mechanical injury to the fruit in packing and transits. As it is a comparatively loose rind fruit, harvesting by pulling fruits with one's hands is avoided. Coating 'Kinnow' fruits with commercial waxes can increase the shelf life up to 60 days. The fruit can be stored in cold storage at a temperature of 4-5 °C and a relative humidity of 85-90%.|$|R
50|$|The ship’s hull is a riveted steel {{construction}} on transverse frames. The ship has a <b>clipper</b> <b>stem</b> and an elliptic stern. Viewed from the side, the ship may {{be divided into}} two sections. In front of the funnel there is space for the crew, any cargo, and the engine. At the rear is the Royal Apartment. This could accommodate patients if ever the yacht were used as a hospital. During visits to Danish and foreign ports the covered quarterdeck is used for receptions.|$|E
