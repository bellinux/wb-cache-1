A total of 216 patients with BPH received lower-energy TUMT treatment (Prostasoft 2. 0) and were followed until 1 year after treatment. All patients completed a Madsen symptom score and QoL questionnaire to assess their perception of urinary difficulties, sexual functions, activities of daily living, psychological well-being, and social activities. The maximal uroflow changed from 7. 8 ml/s at baseline to 11. 2 ml/s after 1 year. The Madsen symptom score improved from 14. 0 to 5. 7. With regard to QoL, we saw a significant improvement in the perception of urinary difficulties and activities of daily living. No statistically significant improvement in QoL measures documenting sexual functions, psychological well-being or social well-being was observed. Besides a significant improvement in objective and subjective clinical parameters, we also observed an improvement in QoL.

As a result of this use bisphosphonate lesions are formed in bone tissue and oral mucosis, which representing a remarkable therapeutic problem. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how many dentists in general practice are familiar with the <b>character,</b> diagnosis and <b>therapy</b> bisphosphonate lesions. Material and Methods: An anonymous questionnaire of 13 questions was conducted in dental practices in Nis County in the period from October 2015 to December 2015.

40|$|Childhood {{sexual abuse}} {{has been shown}} to be common among adult women, 15 - 30 % in {{prevalence}} studies, and among mentally ill women, 25 - 77 %. These women often suffer from depression, anxiety, sexual and relationship problems. Suicide attempts and self-destructive behaviour are common. Within the Department of Psychiatry at Lund University Hospital, 45 women with experiences of childhood sexual abuse were offered a 2 -year-long trauma-focused group therapy. They were well educated but 27 % were unemployed. Nearly half of the group had made suicide attempts, 87 % had had suicidal thoughts and, according to the questionnaire SCL- 90, they were suffering from psychiatric symptoms significantly to a greater degree than both a general group and a clinical group with mixed diagnoses. According to the questionnaire ISSI, they were less well socially integrated than both a general group and a clinical group, and the degree of social adjustment according to the questionnaire SAS-SR was lower than in a general group. The study shows that childhood sexually abused women seeking therapy are a symptom-burdened group.

50|$|In Morita <b>therapy,</b> <b>character</b> is {{developed}} by cultivating awareness, decentralizing the self, and honoring {{the rhythms of}} the natural environment and one's own diurnal rhythms. Aspects of mindfulness are contained in knowing what is controllable {{and what is not}} controllable, and seeing what is so without attachment to expectations. Knowing what one is doing, knowing what the situation is requiring, and knowing {{the relationship between the two}} are quintessential to self-validation, effective living, and personal fulfillment. Character {{is developed}} as one moves from being feeling-centered to being purpose-centered. A feeling-centered person attends to feelings to such an extent that the concern for self-protection reigns over decisions and perceptions. Given the human condition, change, pain, and pleasure are natural experiences. Indeed, emotions are a rich type of experience and a valuable source of information. Feelings are acknowledged even when what is to be done requires not acting on them. Constructive action is no longer put on hold in order to process or cope with symptoms or feelings. The individual can focus on the full scope of the present moment as the guide for determining what needs to be done.|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the current <b>character</b> of {{occupational}} <b>therapy</b> practice for Parkinson's disease in the United Kingdom. The study aimed to document this in order to inform plans for a future multicentre randomised controlled trial. Two hundred and forty-two occupational therapists that treated people with Parkinson's disease were sent a questionnaire regarding demographics, service organisation and therapy content. One hundred and sixty-nine occupational therapists (70 %) responded. They had worked with people with Parkinson's disease for a median of 6 years and personally treated a median of 15 people with Parkinson's disease annually. Most (86 %) were at senior grade or above 87 % worked in the National Health Service and 12 % in social services. Forty per cent worked in specialist Parkinson's disease clinics. Most (79 %) felt that they needed more specialist postgraduate training. Occupational therapists are employed in both health and social care settings. The character of the occupational therapy is often determined by the location in which it is provided. Current occupational therapy appears to focus on functional activities rather than on the wider social and psychological aspects of occupation. Many occupational therapists felt that they needed more specialist postgraduate training to treat people with Parkinson's disease effectively...|$|R
40|$|Osteoid osteoma is {{a benign}} {{skeletal}} tumour {{that accounts for}} 2 - 3 % of all bone tumours. The male-to-female ratio is around 4 : 1 and it predominates in children and young adults.

40|$|Glial {{tumors are}} the most common primary {{neoplasms}} of the central nervous system. Their proportion in the total structure of primary brain tumors is 50 - 65 %. In Ukraine, according to the statistical data of the cancer-registry of the year 2014, 49, 3 % of patients with primary diagnosed malignant neoplasms of the brain did not live for one year. The aim {{of the study was to}} improve the survival rates of patients with low-grade glial tumors (LGT) (grade III-IV) by determining optimal treatment strategy and main prognostic survival factors. A prospective study of the results of treatment of patients with LGT from 2009 to 2014 was conducted. The study consistently included 100 operated patients with LGT (anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and glioblastoma (GLB)). The median survival in the total group of patients (n= 100) was 363. 5 days (12 months). The main statistically significant prognostic factors of survival were: the completeness of tumor removal (p= 0. 00000000007) and the <b>character</b> of adjuvant <b>therapy</b> (p= 0. 000012). With the removal of LGT III-IV grade aplasias, which do not spread to functionally important areas and deep areas of the brain, one should try to perform Gross-total resection (GTR), which ensures long-term survival. The median survival of patients after GTR was 22. 3 months. An integrated approach to the treatment which includes surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy and monochemotherapy with temozolamide showed the best survival rates – 20. 5 months...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} photography and healthcare {{in order to examine}} the model of practice generated by the concept of Photo Therapy, an approach developed by the celebrated British artist- photographer Jo Spence (1934 - 1992) who saw previously unexplored therapeutic dimensions to the act of taking photographic self-portraits (Spence, 1986). Spence sought visual ways of exploring her experiences as she negotiated treatments for her cancer. My aim has been to use this legacy to unders tand how an artist-photographer can be a kind of healer. My research, based on my own practices (which are very different from those of Spence) working as an artist-photographer on projects with the Camphill Village Trust and Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, has attempted to embrace the full range of social activities created by Photo Therapy: from the process of negotiating a shot; to hand printing the resulting photograph, to the discussions created by viewing photographs with patients, relatives and healthcare staff; to the remote reception of Photo Therapy images by exhibition-going audiences and readers of photographic publications. The context of my research project is the emergent <b>character</b> of Photo <b>Therapy</b> in Japan. My ambition has been to transfer the knowledge developed in the UK to my home country which still has some way to go before it can claim to possess a distinct arts and healthcare sector (Seki, Inoue and Miwaki, 2002). To achieve this goal I have adopted the terminology and methods of Transactional Analysis (TA), a form of psychotherapy that treats all social transactions as derivatives of a parent’s physical contact with its child, e. g. the healing ‘stroke’ of a mother’s hand (Berne, 1961). This form of therapy is familiar to many Japanese and, having applied TA concepts such as Ego States and Stroke Exchanges to my own transactions in healthcare contexts in the UK, I then sketch out my plans for using TA to promote Photo Therapy through my role as a founder member of the Japanese Photo -Therapists Network (JPTN), my country’s first group of photographers and doctors interested in practicing Photo Therapy...|$|R
40|$|Background. In psychoanalytic theory, {{character}} is {{conceived as a}} regulating structure intended for life-long adaptation between inner needs and outer reality. If this adaptation fails, symptoms and dysfunctional relationship patterns might emerge, thus, implying a close association between symptoms, relationship patterns and underlying character. Furthermore, according to psychoanalytic theory decreased symptomatic suffering and more adaptive relations are regarded to be consequences of change in character structure. Aims. This project was designed to empirically investigate psychoanalytic theory regarding the association between character, symptoms and relationship pattems. The specific aims were to study: 1) the psychiatric and demographic characteristics of patients selected for long-term psychoanalytic therapy in a naturalistic clinical setting; 2) the relationship between character, symptoms and relationship pattems in these patients; 3) the change in character, symptoms and relationship patterns after long-term psychoanalytic therapy; 4) whether change {{in one of the}} aforementioned three aspects was interrelated with change in any other aspect; 5) the relationship between change of character or change in symptoms and duration of treatment or frequency of sessions. Method. The sample at intake comprised 55 patients selected for long-term psychoanalytic <b>therapy.</b> <b>Character</b> was assessed with the Karolinska Psychodynamic Profile (KAPP), and relationship patterns with the Core Conflictual Relationship Theme (CCRT). The DSM-III-R was used for psychiatric diagnosis. Self-report questionnaires assessing symptoms (the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale-Self-Affective, CPRS-S-A) and personality (the Karolinska Scales of Personality, KSP) were filled out after the interview. Thirty-six patients who underwent long-term psychotherapy completed follow-up assessments 6 months after treatment termination, and 10 patients, who for various reasons did not enter treatment, completed follow-up assessments 3 years after intake. The psychotherapists who conducted the treatment were well trained and had long professional experience. Results. After long-term psychotherapy, patients reported a significantly decreased level of character pathology and symptomatic suffering, as well as significantly improved relationship patterns. There were, however, very few significant associations between change in character and change in symptoms or maladaptive relationships. Duration of treatment and frequency of sessions were not related to change. In the 10 patients who did not undergo treatment, almost no change was found after 3 years. Conclusions. The patients, who were selected in a traditional clinical fashion for longterm psychoanalytic therapy, suffered from various symptoms but displayed a low level of character pathology. Neither the psychoanalytic theory regarding a close association between character, symptoms and relationship patterns, nor the psychoanalytic theory of structural change received support from our results...|$|R
