25|$|Dissipation {{of waste}} heat is {{especially}} complicated because the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> is kept {{as low as}} possible to maximize thermal efficiency. This increases the size of the radiators, which can make packaging difficult. Along with materials cost, this {{has been one of the}} factors limiting the adoption of Stirling engines as automotive prime movers. For other applications such as ship propulsion and stationary microgeneration systems using combined heat and power (CHP) high power density is not required.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an ejected control assembly, it is {{possible}} for the reactor to become critical on the prompt neutrons alone (i.e. prompt critical). When the reactor is prompt critical, the time to double the power is on the order of 10 microseconds. The duration necessary for temperature to follow the power level depends on the design of the reactor core. Typically, the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> lags behind the power by 3 to 5 seconds in a conventional LWR. In the SL-1 design, it was about 6 milliseconds before steam formation started.|$|E

50|$|The {{cooling system}} is {{composed}} of a timing belt driven water pump, a 87 °C thermostat in the engine block itself.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results obtained}} in the experimental measurement of the reactor heat extracted by the coolant during two different scrams of the DR Reactor. These tests were conducted with the reactor flow carefully controlled to establish different reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> following the scram. During normal reactor scrams, which {{have been used in}} the past to measure the reactor heat output, a high coolant flow was maintained. Consequently, the <b>coolant</b> outlet <b>temperature</b> dropped very quickly from an operating value of 90 to 95 C down to 20 to 30 C following the scram. Under emergency conditions, however, with only the last ditch emergency flow available, the <b>coolant</b> outlet <b>temperature</b> could remain as high as 80 to 90 C. This condition could prevail because of the small amount of last ditch flow available, and could last for 5 to as long as 70 minutes after the reactor scram...|$|R

Other, more common options such as electrically operated rear windows and an A/C system were standard in the USA. The USA-cars also had different upholstery styles and of course different dashboard panels also indicating speed in mph, oil pressure in psi and <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> in degrees F, and as a final touch the AR control was different, including a seat belt warning light.|$|E
25|$|One key {{advance in}} the Kestrel {{was the use of}} a {{pressurised}} cooling system. Water boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure, but this temperature decreases with altitude. Since the amount of heat carried out of the engine is a function of <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> and volume, the coolant has to be kept below boiling point and an increasing amount of fluid has to be used, along with an increasingly large radiator to cool it. The solution was to pressurise the entire cooling system, thereby not only preventing the decrease in cooling performance with altitude, but in fact increasing the boiling point even on the ground. The Kestrel was built to maintain enough pressure to keep the boiling point at about 150°C.|$|E
25|$|Only minor grille and {{taillight}} lens revisions {{highlighted the}} 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was {{dropped from the}} option list, leaving only the diesel version available. All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM's new Computer Command Control engine management system. This system was the forerunner, and surprisingly similar to today's OBDII which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine RPM's, <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM's Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R transmission, which added an overdrive gear and torque converter clutch (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity.

40|$|The three-loop {{power system}} {{which is to}} be used with Experimental Breeder Reactor No. II (EBR-II) was {{analyzed}} to determine the coolant flow rate requirements at various power levels, <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> at various power levels, effects of heat exchanger sizes (system optimization), and effects of control errors. An intermediate heat exchanger, preheater, evaporator, and superheater are included in the EBR-II power system. Constant thermal resistances and physical properties, and perfect insulation were assumed in the analysis. Among other things, the study showed that at low power levels, excessive thermal stresses are produced at the cold end of the intermediate heat exchanger ualess a high sink temperature is used. It was also found that a short cut may be used to determine approximate system conditions at all power levels, that system optimization requires compromises, and that system flow rate control is possible through high-low measurements of two <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the primary system.

2500|$|If the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> is {{too close}} to its boiling point, {{cavitation}} can occur in the pumps and their operation can become erratic or even stop entirely. The feedwater temperature is dependent on the steam production; the steam phase portion is led to the turbines and condensers and returns significantly cooler (...) than the water returning directly from the steam separator (284°C). At low reactor power, therefore, the inlet temperature may become dangerously high. The water is kept below the saturation temperature to prevent film boiling and the associated drop in heat transfer rate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} finite-element {{analyses of}} the cylinder specimen {{being used in the}} international Network for Evaluating Steel Components (NESC) large-scale spinning-cylinder project (NESC- 1). The objective of the NESC- 1 project is to focus on a complete process for assessing the structural integrity of aged reactor pressure vessels. A new cylinder specimen was reconstituted from segments of the previously tested SC- 4 and SC- 6 specimens because the relatively high fracture toughness of the original specimen might preclude achieving the test objectives. Also, the initial and <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> for the proposed thermal shock may be reduced as much as 25 C to increase the probability of achieving cleavage initiation. Analyses were carried out to determine the combined effects of increasing the wall thickness and lowering the initial and <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the experiment. Estimates were made of the change in hoop strain on the clad inner surface directly above a subclad crack due to initiation and axial propagation of the crack. Three-dimensional finite-element models of the cladded cylinder were generated with 6 : 1 and 2 : 1 semielliptical 70 -mm-deep subclad cracks. The cylinder specimen was subjected to thermal-shock and centrifugal loading conditions and analyzed with a thermo-elastic-plastic material model. The analytical results indicate that lowering the initial and <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> by 25 C will not significantly change the peak driving force, but will shift the stress-intensity factor (K{sub I}) vs temperature curves so that the crack will become critical at an earlier time in the transient. The peak K{sub I} value occurs at a lower temperature which increases the probability of achieving cleavage initiation...|$|R

2500|$|The nominal {{temperature}} of the cooling water at the inlet of the reactor is about [...] and the outlet temperature , at pressure in the drum separator of [...] The pressure and the inlet temperature determine the height at which the boiling begins in the reactor; if the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> is not sufficiently below its boiling point at the system pressure, the boiling starts {{at the very bottom}} part of the reactor instead of its higher parts. With few absorbers in the reactor core, such as during the Chernobyl accident, the positive void coefficient of the reactor makes the reactor very sensitive to the feedwater temperature. Bubbles of boiling water lead to increased power, which in turn increases the formation of bubbles. After 1986 absorbers were introduced in the fuel assembly, permanently assuring a negative void coefficient at the cost of higher enrichment requirements of the uranium fuel.|$|E

Regression models generated using stepwise regression analyses were used to plot response surface curves, to study the tempering behaviour of products. The results showed that both Stage 1 and Stage 2 <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> had significant linear and quadratic effects on the crystallization behaviour causing wide variations in chocolate temper index during tempering of products with variable PSD and fat content. Differences in fat content exerted the greatest variability in temperature settings of the different zones for attaining well-tempered products.

No unique set of conditions was found to achieve good temper in dark chocolate with a specified tempering unit.

5000|$|A Pressurizer is a {{component}} of a pressurized water reactor. The basic design of the pressurized water reactor includes a requirement that the coolant (water) in the reactor coolant system must not boil.
