5000|$|At the University of Bologna the {{training}} of physicians began in 1219. The Italian city attracted students from across Europe. Taddeo Alderotti built a tradition of medical education that established the characteristic features of Italian learned medicine and was copied by medical schools elsewhere.

25|$|Disadvantages of the {{axillary}} block include inadequate anesthesia in {{the distribution}} of the musculocutaneous nerve. This nerve supplies motor function to the biceps, brachialis, and coracobrachialis muscles and one of its branches supplies sensation to the skin of the forearm. If the musculocutaneous nerve is missed, {{it may be necessary to}} block this nerve separately. This can be accomplished by using a peripheral nerve stimulator to identify the location of the nerve as it passes through the <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle.</b> The intercostobrachial nerves (which are branches of the second and third intercostal nerves) are also frequently missed with the axillary block. Because these nerves supply sensation to the skin of the medial and posterior aspects of the arm and axilla, a tourniquet on the arm may be poorly tolerated in such cases. Subcutaneous injection of local anesthetic over the medial aspect of the arm in the axilla helps patients tolerate an arm tourniquet by blocking these nerves.|$|E

This study provides additional morphological data, including muscle maps, for the forelimb of Ailurus, based on the dissection of four cadavers from the National Zoological Park, Washington, DC, USA. The red panda forelimb is characterized by a number of primitive features, including the lack of m. rhomboideus profundus, a humeral insertion for m. cleidobrachialis, the presence of mm. brachioradialis, articularis humeri and <b>coracobrachialis,</b> a single <b>muscle</b> belly for m. extensor digitorum lateralis with tendons to digits III–V, four mm. lumbricales, and the presence of mm. flexor digitorum brevis manus, adductores digiti I, II and V, and abductor digiti I and V. Red pandas resemble Ailuropoda, mustelids and some procyonids in possessing a soft tissue origin of m. flexor digitorum superficialis. In addition, red pandas are similar to ursids and procyonids in having a variable presence of m. biceps brachii caput breve. Furthermore, Ailurus and some ursids lack m. rhomboideus capitis.

5000|$|The {{coracoid}} tubercle is {{a prominent}} {{area on the}} anterior surface of the coracoid, just ventral to the shoulder socket (glenoid).

50|$|A {{number of}} small fluid-filled sacs known as {{synovial}} bursae are located around the capsule to aid mobility.

5000|$|Pectoral muscles: {{there are}} 4 pectorals, {{and they all}} {{function}} in adduction of the limb. The pectoralis descendens (cranial superficial pectoral) originates from the cariniform cartilage of the sternum, and inserts into the humerus.

The largest of the pectorals, the pectoralis profundus (caudal deep pectoral), originates on the caudal side of the sternum, and inserts into the humerus and onto the tendon of the <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle.</b> The pectoralis ascendens (caudal superficial pectoral), or the subclavius, originates on the cranial side of the sternum, and inserts into the dorsal side of the supraspinatus muscle.|$|E
50|$|The medial border {{extends from}} the lesser {{tubercle}} to the medial epicondyle. Its upper third consists of a prominent ridge, {{the crest of the}} lesser tubercle, which gives insertion to the tendon of the teres major muscle. About its center is a slight impression for the insertion of the <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle,</b> and just below this is the entrance of the nutrient canal, directed downward; sometimes there is a second nutrient canal at the commencement of the radial sulcus. The inferior third of this border is raised into a slight ridge, the medial supracondylar ridge, which became very prominent below; it presents an anterior lip for the origins of the brachialis muscle and the pronator teres muscle, a posterior lip for the medial head of the triceps brachii muscle, and an intermediate ridge for the attachment of the medial intermuscular septum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{overuse of}} the coracobrachialis {{can lead to}} {{stiffening}} of the muscle. Common causes of injury include chest workouts or activities that require to press the arm very tight towards the body, e.g. work on the rings in gymnastics. [...] Symptoms of overuse or injury are pain in the arm and shoulder, radiating down {{to the back of}} the hand. In more severe cases, the musculocutaneous nerve can get trapped, causing disturbances in sensation to the skin on the radial part of the forearm and weakened flexion of the elbow, as the nerve also supplies the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles. [...] Actual rupture to the <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle</b> is extremely rare. Very few case reports exist in the literature, and it is reported to be caused by direct trauma to the contracted muscle.

Variant insertion of the <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle</b> was found during routine dissection of an adult male cadaver in the Department of Anatomy, College of Medical Sciences, and Bharatpur, Nepal. Normally the <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle</b> is inserted {{into the middle of the}} medial border of the humerus. In the present case an additional slender tendon passed inferiorly, crossing anterior to the median nerve and brachial artery, before attaching to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Most of the proximal part of the tendon gave rise to an aponeurotic expansion that inserted into the distal medial border of the humerus. The tendinous insertion and aponeurotic expansion may represent a variant of the coracobrachialis longus (Wood’s) muscle and the internal brachial ligament or the ligament of Struthers. The ulnar nerve was found to be traversing below the aponeurotic expansion.

The median nerve was formed by the union of three roots on both sides. There was an additional lateral root on both sides, while the first lateral root was short. On the left side, the second lateral root was short and united with the main trunk of median nerve proximal to the insertion of <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle</b> to humerus bone.

40|$|Introduction: Anatomical {{variations}} of the peripheral nervous system may have not any clinical signs and symptoms. One of these variations belongs to the Musculocutaneous nerve. However, a good knowledge of nerve pathways and their variations {{is very important for}} surgeons in post-traumatic evaluations, exploratory interventions, and/or administration of neuromuscular blocks in axillary region in order to surgical therapies. Presentation of case: This report describes a case of variation of the musculocutaneous nerve which was observed in an old Iranian male cadaver during routine educational dissection (Fig. 1). Discussion and Conclusion: Anatomically, in the axilla region, the Musculocutaneous nerve is originated of the lateral cord of brachial plexus, then, by piercing the <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle</b> arrives enters to anterior compartment of the arm. But, in the present report, we observed that the Musculocutaneous nerve without piercing the <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle</b> has arrived in the left arm, then communicated to the Median nerve. To exploratory interventions of the arms for peripheral nerve repair and surgical therapies, a good knowledge of nerve pathways helps to surgeons for preventing possible mistakes during surgery...|$|E

The short common trunk divided into two roots: one joined the median nerve; and the second one continued down as ulnar nerve. Median nerve supplied biceps brachii and brachialis muscles. The <b>coracobrachialis</b> <b>muscle</b> was supplied by radial nerve. The cutaneous innervation to the upper limb was derived from radial and ulnar nerves...|$|E
