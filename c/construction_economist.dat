40|$|The world’s {{economies are}} {{becoming}} increasingly interdependent. Consequently, "globalisation " is a key word among the world’s construction industries. Of all the construction professions/specialisms, construction economics {{is probably the most}} diversely represented in this global arena. In the UK and its former colonies, the Quantity Surveyor fulfils the role of <b>construction</b> <b>economist.</b> Yet, in the US and Europe, Cost Engineers and Construction Economists are the respective specialists. It is suggested that any move towards globalisation must begin with a mutual appreciation and subsequent reconciliation of the differences between any group of individuals. For the <b>construction</b> <b>economist</b> then, {{there is a need to}} ask the following questions: What are the differences between construction economists world-wide? What is the common ground between construction economists world-wide? What is the key to commonality among different construction economists? Can there be such a thing as a global <b>construction</b> <b>economist?</b> This paper aims to begin to answer these questions by reporting upon some preliminary research findings based upon studies of selected educational and professional institutions around the world...|$|E
40|$|Linkages among {{different}} construction markets have attracted great {{of attention from}} the <b>construction</b> <b>economist.</b> With notable exceptions, most of this infestation has carried out by using input-output analysis. Interactions among regional construction markets have been discussed in few studies {{and none of them}} investigate spatial effects on the regional construction markets. This study employed spatial econometric techniques, spatial autocorrelation and convergence tests, to analysis interactions and linkages among construction price indices in Australian six states and two territories. The empirical results indicate the presence of significant positive spatial correlation between the construction prices in Australian eight construction markets and the degree of dependence decrease sufficiently quickly as the space between units increase. The results of convergence test further present evidence on "ripple effect" in the construction prices in Australian regional markets and the changes in regional construction price would positively influence neighboring states first, and then spread out into others, and then the regional prices converge and reach a long-run equilibrium in the following quarters. Urban development policymakers and construction developers could benefit from the analysis of spatial linkages in regional construction markets...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{somewhat}} unusual book, {{in the context}} of the books found in contemporary construction management and construction economics.

40|$|The editor, Gerard de Valence, {{points out}} in the preface, this book is neither a {{textbook}} nor a guide to what is done by construction managers and <b>construction</b> <b>economists</b> – read quantity surveyors and the like. Rather, de Valence notes it comprises a collection of chapters each of which focus on matters at the industry level and, in doing so, illustrates that a substantially improved understanding {{of the building and}} construction industry can be gained beyond the economics of delivering projects. Before giving some thought to how far each of the chapters achieve this, it’s worth reflecting on the virtues of developing construction economics as its own discipline or sub-discipline in general economics and the bold manner by which de Valence is proposing we do this. That is, de Valence proposes partitioning industry and project economics - as explained in the preface and in Chapter 1. de Valence’s view that “the time seems right” for these developments is also worthy of some consideration...|$|R
40|$|The {{linkages}} {{among different}} construction markets have recently {{attracted much attention}} from <b>construction</b> <b>economists.</b> The interactions among regional construction markets have been discussed in a few studies, most {{of which have been}} carried out by using input-output methods, and none of them investigated spatial effects on the regional construction markets.

40|$|The {{contribution}} made {{by economic}} theory when studying construction-related subjects has a muddled history. This theme was carefully reviewed in Ofori (1994) where he bluntly concluded that: 'Construction economics cannot {{be regarded as}} a bona-fide subject' (p. 304). This short note takes a retrospective look at George Ofori's paper and suggests that during the subsequent period little has changed. This is despite the publication of government reports that stressed the importance of creating a culture of economic efficiency within construction and the need for the industry to become sustainable. This paper is informed by a brief survey of what is currently taught at British universities under the title of construction economics. Two points for debate emerge. The first is the worrying observation about the present state of play, as it seems that construction economics continues to lack any coherent conceptual structure. The second is the more promising suggestion that in the foreseeable future the sustainability agenda could provide the impetus necessary for <b>construction</b> <b>economists</b> to agree a common purpose and conceptual approach.

40|$|Whilst {{mergers and}} {{acquisitions}} are a favoured means of strategic renewal and expansion for firms, scant academic attention {{has been placed on}} the growth patterns of construction professional services firms (CPSFs). This paper focuses on the role of {{mergers and acquisitions}} in the evolution of CPSFs. The findings are based on an analysis of the growth patterns of the top 25 CPSFs in the United Kingdom between 1988 and 2013. Since the 1990 s, the increase in merger and acquisition activity has shaped the size, international presence, and multi-disciplinary reach of the major CPSFs. However, CPSFs differ with respect to the intensity with which mergers and acquisitions are pursued. Whilst large, public limited companies are active acquirers, smaller and/or privately-owned firms succeed in growing with a more selective acquisitive strategy, as they tend to rely more on organic growth. The findings call <b>construction</b> <b>economists</b> to attend to how acquisitions are radically changing the construction landscape and its main players. As the competitive advantage of firms is increasingly human capital-based, the example of the privately-owned CPSFs that rely on organic modes of growth prompts a critical rethink of the role of mergers and acquisitions in firm growth...|$|R

As a result, expert opinion on the effects of modern rent control policies has become increasingly agnostic." ...|$|R
40|$|Construction price {{forecasting}} is {{an essential}} component to facilitate decision-making for construction contractors, investors and related financial institutions. <b>Construction</b> <b>economists</b> are increasingly interested in seeking a more analytical method to forecast construction prices. Although many {{studies have focused on}} construction price modelling and forecasting, few have considered the impacts of large-scale economic events and seasonality. In this study, an advanced multivariate modelling technique, namely the vector correction (VEC) model with dummy variables, was employed. The impacts of global economic events and seasonality are factored into the model to forecast the construction price in the Australian construction market. Research findings suggest that both long-run and dynamic short-term causal relationships exist among the price and levels of supply and demand in the construction market. These relationships drive the construction price and supply and demand, which interact with one another as a loop system. The reliability of forecasting models was examined by the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the Theil 2 ̆ 7 s inequality coefficient U tests. The test results suggest that the conventional VEC model and the VEC model with dummy variable are both acceptable for forecasting the construction price, while the VEC model considering external impacts achieves higher prediction accuracy than the conventional VEC model. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between construction output {{and economic growth}} has been well discussed by <b>construction</b> <b>economists.</b> Most of the previous studies found {{a positive correlation between}} gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and various measures of construction output. However, cross?sectional analysis was commonly adopted but longitudinal analysis has been called upon. Furthermore, recent research argued that non?linear {{relationship between}} GDP and construction output exists because of different stages of economic development in different countries. They explained the phenomenon by means of the change of the growth rates of construction output at different stages of economic development, but the argument has not yet been rigorously tested. With the availability of long time?series of data of Hong Kong construction industry, this paper attempts to test longitudinally the relationship between the real growth rate of construction output and the real growth rate of GDP. It was found that the growth rate of GDP led that of construction output, and as the growth rate of GDP increased, the growth rate of construction output was marginally diminishing. It agrees with the proposition that construction industry is relatively inefficient in productivity improvement and the accumulation of capital investment results in a marginally diminishing growth of construction output.

40|$|Reliable {{forecasting}} as to {{the level}} of aggregate demand for construction is of vital importance to developers, builders and policymakers. Previous construction demand forecasting studies mainly focused on temporal estimating using national aggregate data. The construction market can be better represented by a group of interconnected regions or local markets rather than a national aggregate, and yet regional forecasting techniques have rarely been applied. Furthermore, limited research has applied regional variations in construction markets to construction demand modelling and forecasting. A new comprehensive method is used, a panel vector error correction approach, to forecast regional construction demand using Australia’s state-level data. The links between regional construction demand and general economic indicators are investigated by panel cointegration and causality analysis. The empirical results suggest that both long-run and causal links are found between regional construction demand and construction price, state income, population, unemployment rates and interest rates. The panel vector error correction model can provide reliable and robust forecasting with less than 10 % of the mean absolute percentage error for a medium-term trend of regional construction demand and outperforms the conventional forecasting models (panel multiple regression and time series multiple regression model). The key macroeconomic factors of construction demand variations across regions in Australia are also presented. The findings and robust econometric techniques used are valuable to <b>construction</b> <b>economists</b> in examining future construction markets at a regional level...|$|R
40|$|Teaching {{economics}} to <b>construction</b> <b>economists</b> is paradigmatically {{different to}} teaching economics to ‘pure’ economists. While {{the principles of}} economics don’t change, the philosophical aim and the methodology of teaching the subject do change. Understanding and executing this philosophical variant enhances the students’ learning experience. Teaching economics and finance can open students’ eyes to {{a new way of}} thinking about the world. The study of economics looks at the world in a unique way because economics is a truly social science and it makes advances in finding solutions to the challenges that society faces. However, it approaches these solutions with the dispassion of a science and by using the scientific method. The appropriate philosophical goal is to convey this way of thinking to built environment economics students in a way that enhances their thinking and which illuminates much about valuations, the environment and business – the learning pillars of the course. A prolific writer and teacher of economics Prof Gregory Mankiew of Harvard University said that “economics is a subject where a little knowledge goes a long way, something that cannot be said, for instance, of the study of physics or the Japanese language”. The responsibility that comes with teaching economics is that it helps promote deeper understanding and better policymaking. It makes for a better society...|$|R

40|$|Construction Economics and Management in Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) educates {{and prepares}} {{students}} to become Quantity Surveyors (<b>Construction</b> <b>Economists)</b> in the <b>Construction</b> Industry. Arguably the most important subject on the course and {{the cornerstone of the}} profession is the ability of the students and graduates to carry out a technical function called ‘measurement’ or ‘take off’ from construction plans and drawings. Graduates of Construction Economics and Management may spend up to two years carrying out measurement for their employers before they progress to the more professional practices of Quantity Surveying. The importance of measurement and take off inthe profession cannot be overstated and thus the subject is included in all four years of the Construction Economics and Management Degree in The School of Real Estate and Construction Economics in DIT. The functions outlined above are delivered in the second year of the course inQuantity Surveying Studies 2 A in semester one and Quantity Surveying Studies 2 B in semester two. Both modules are five ECTS credits delivered in two hours of lectures and two hours of tutorials. Students do appreciate the importance of the module and interest and attendance on the module is high. However, teaching the module in second year the author observed that attendance at the two hour tutorials was significantly lower than the lecturers. The subject matter is practical in nature and really only can be learned and understood through continuous practice. The tutorials provide an environment for the students to carry out measurement in a small group under the tutors supervision and direction thus simulating the working environment. Attendance on these tutorials is paramount to the successful completion of the learning outcomes of the module. The paper investigates an assessment strategy implemented in Quantity Surveying Studies 2 B to encourage attendance and participation in the tutorials. This paper outlines how part of the modules continuous assessment into the tutorials, giving formative feedback on a weekly basis to the students {{and at the same time}} increasing attendance on the tutorials and understanding of the subject matter...|$|R
50|$|A 2015 {{report from}} the Senate Economics References Committee argues that, while {{negative}} gearing {{has an influence on}} housing affordability, the primary issue is a mismatch between supply and demand. A submission to this committee from the Department of Social Services stated that:while demand for housing has increased significantly over the last 30 years, the supply of new dwellings has not responded, with average annual completions of new dwellings remaining around 150,000 since the mid-1980s.The effect of negative gearing on the supply side of dwelling construction is difficult to pin down. Commentary from Eslake and others has highlighted the preponderance of negatively-geared purchases in established suburbs where the probability of a lightly-taxed capital gain exists, challenging the idea that negative gearing leads to substantial amounts of new <b>construction.</b> Many <b>economists</b> have commented extensively on the tax subsidy being made available to speculative buyers in competition against homebuyers, who have no such tax subsidy, leading to significant social dislocation.|$|R
5000|$|Unsustainable {{economic}} growth: All three Baltic states experienced {{very high}} market growth {{compared to the}} rest of Euro Area. The real GDP for Latvia achieved double digits for three consecutive years from 2005 and Estonia for two consecutive years from 20005. Even the real GDP for Lithuania from 2005-2007 is considered higher than the average growth in the Euro Area. Such high economic growth largely due to their measurement to attract foreign capital to their shore. In Estonia, the amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow hit as high as 22.5% of GDP and maintained the inflow in double-digits up to 2007. Both Latvia and Lithuania managed to attract substantially high FDI to their shores though a much lesser share compared to Estonia. In all three Baltic states the majority FDI directly benefited the real estate and construction sectors. Unlike their preceding years, manufacturing sectors received far less than the real estate and <b>construction</b> sectors. <b>Economists</b> at the UniCredit Group opined the growth rate as consumption-led economic growth, with trade, finance, commercial services, real estate and construction fuelling the growth. Simultaneously, external imbalances became more worrying as the imports were growing twice as fast as the exports.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper will}} argue that the centre-periphery {{dynamics}} of the modernisation of sexuality is more complex and difficult to grasp than is usually shown in queer studies and gay history. Existing historiography on the emerging of a modern gay and lesbian identity has failed to study the links between different sites for the emergence of a gay and lesbian subculture. The contacts between Greenland and German and Danish missionaries, from the eighteenth century onward, profoundly influenced Inuit concepts of sexuality by imposing Christian norms of sexual restraint. The accelerating colonial domination of Greenland culminated in a conscious effort to “modernise” Greenlandic society from the 1950 s onward. Danish presence in Greenland increased from a handful of merchants and colonial officers to a substantial population of <b>construction</b> workers, <b>economists,</b> teachers, and bureaucrats. Did the colonisation of Greenland also influence Danish discourses on masculinity and sexuality? For metropolitan Danes, Greenland represents an idea of hyper-masculine adventure and extreme hardship. The diaries and travelogues by Danish explorer and national hero Knud Rasmussen are impregnated with his admiration for the arctic seal hunters he befriended during his extended stay in northernmost Greenland, and the Crown Prince Frederik’s sleigh rides over the inland ice rendered him huge popularity both in Greenland and in Denmark. Images of the weather-bitten prince travelling between the extreme outposts of his future realm was a symbolic rendering of Danish masculinity in the Arctic. Many sources testify that Greenlanders traditionally had an open and relaxed attitude to sexuality. There were no explicit condemnations of same-sex sexuality, but childlessness in women was regarded as a tragedy, and in the tales, women {{who did not want to}} marry were severely punished. The only folklore concerning same-sex sexuality concerns women who act as men and penetrate younger women. Indeed, if sexuality was not a taboo subject, it was highly gendered. When Greenlandic activists founded a gay rights organisation in 2002, they translated the Danish words bøsse (gay man) and lesbisk (lesbian woman) into two already existing Inuit words: arnaasaq (lit. ‘womanly man’) angutaasaq (lit. ‘manly woman’). These words have been used traditionally to designate men who prefer women’s work, such as sewing or cooking, to the male work, such as hunting. As opposed to the Danish National Associaltion for Gays and Lesbians (Landsforeningen for bøsser og lesbiske) the Greenlandic activists also wanted to include bisexuals in their organisation. There was no word for bisexual, so they had to invent one, tamanoortut, which literally means ‘both ways’. The mixture of a traditional gendered conception of non-normative sexuality and the western, Danish concepts of “gay” and “lesbian” shows how Greenlanders actively renegotiate the norms that arrive from metropolitan Denmark. Another example is how Greenlandic legislation handled the question of same-sex sexuality in the criminal law. For very long, there were separate sets of laws for Greenlanders and Danes living in Greenland, but in 1954 a joint Criminal Code was adopted. The law commission strove to preserve Greenlandic traditional laws as much as possible, but explicitly stated that they made an exception for sexual crimes, since Greenlandic customs were so different from what was acceptable in modern society. The result of this was that same-sex sexuality was regulated by the same rule as in Denmark, i. e. a higher age of consent for homosexual than for heterosexual relations. The society for gays, lesbians and bisexuals in Greenland, Qaamaneq, was dismantled in 2007. Some activists argue that it was because a lack of interest from its members, now that it is easier to find a partner via the Internet than via the dances that Qaamaneq arranged. Others say that the homophobic climate in Greenland results in a very small number of non-heterosexual people daring to be open. More research is needed to determine how sexual discourse in Greenland – and in Denmark – has been influenced by the colonial process. An anthropological project would be the best way of investigating the exact nature of the modernisation of sexuality in Greenland and Denmark...|$|R
