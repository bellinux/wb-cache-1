Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped <b>calyx.</b> Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that {{there appears to be}} one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of C.pepo have a small <b>calyx,</b> but the <b>calyx</b> of C.moschata male flowers is comparatively short.|$|E

The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the yield of <b>calyxes</b> of Hibiscus sabdariffa L, a medicinal plant, at four planting times in Lavras - MG. The treatments were four planting times (October 18 th, November 15 th, December 18 th 2001 and January 15 th 2002) and a harvest was proceeded when practically there were no developing <b>calyxes,</b> almost {{at the end of}} the plant cycle. The numbers of <b>calyxes</b> per plant, the fresh and dry biomasses of <b>calyxes</b> and quality were taken into account. It follows that planting time influenced yield per plant and the fresh and dry biomasses of <b>calyxes,</b> differing from each other by Tukey test at 5 %. In October planting, there was a higher yield (2, 522 kg/ha) with a yield 5. 24 as high relative to the planting of the month of January (481 kg/ha). The planting s in the month of November to December showed yields of 1, 695 and 1, 093 kg/ha of dry <b>calyxes,</b> respectively and in relation to the same months of January, yield was of 3. 52 to 2. 27 times more.

5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem {{capable of producing}} stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire <b>calyx.</b> The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to: (a) study the {{physical}} and chemical properties of fresh roselle calyxes; (b) study the optimum conditions for water extraction of roselle; and (e) compare the methods of evaporation (vacuum, atmospheric) for processing of concentrated roselle extract. This study found that the L*, a* and b* values of fresh roselle <b>calyxes</b> were 0. 09 ± 0. 01, 0. 02 ± 0. 01 and 0. 05 ± 0. 01. The pH, total acidity and total soluble solids content were 2. 16 ± 0. 05, 4. 20 ± 0. 01 % as malic acid and 5. 83 ± 0. 04 °Brix, respectively. The yields of fresh and dried roselle <b>calyxes</b> production were 47. 45 ± 0. 71 % and 9. 58 ± 0. 77 %. The optimum conditions for fresh roselle <b>calyxes,</b> fresh <b>calyxes</b> to water ratio was 1 : 2, with the extraction temperature of 50 oC for 30 min. For dried roselle <b>calyxes,</b> the optimum conditions were 1 : 10 ratio of dried <b>calyxes</b> to water and the extraction temperature of 50 oC for 30 min. The method of evaporation under the vacuum of 44 cmHg at 70 oC was an appropriate selected method for both concentrated fresh and dried roselle extracts.

30|$|At the {{reproductive}} stage, {{with respect to}} the different parts of the flowers in wild type SR 1, the <b>calyxes</b> and the pistils were green, and the petals and the filaments showed light pink pigmentation; the Lc-transgenic tobacco exhibited light red in <b>calyxes</b> and crimson in petals and in filaments respectively. Correspondingly, the total anthocyanin contents (TAC) in <b>calyxes,</b> petals and filaments of Lc-transgenic plants were much higher than that of the counterparts in SR 1. Though the TAC in anthers of Lc-transgenic plants was low, it was still significantly higher than that of SR 1. SR 1 has almost the same TAC in the pistils as Lc-transgenic plants. Consistent with the intense phenotype and the increased TAC, Lc was weakly expressed in the <b>calyxes</b> and strongly expressed in petals and filaments of Lc-transgenic plants, while Lc was not detected in SR 1. The expression level of NtAN 2 in petals was similar between SR 1 and Lc-transgenic lines. In agreement with the expression profile of Lc, both early (NtCHS) and late anthocyanin-biosynthetic genes (NtDFR, NtF 3 ′H, and NtANS) were coordinately up-regulated in the counterparts of flowers. HPLC analysis demonstrated that the cyanidin (Cya) deposition was mainly responsible for the intense pigmentation of Lc-transgenic tobacco.|$|R

25|$|As a {{dioecious}} plant, the inconspicuous pistillate (female) and staminate (male) {{flowers are}} found on different trees. Staminate flowers are pale green, small, and arranged in racemes borne on long, slender, drooping peduncles {{developed from the}} axils of crowded leaves on the spur-like branchlets of the previous year. They feature a hairy, four-lobed calyx; the four stamens are inserted opposite the lobes of <b>calyx,</b> on the margin of a thin disk. Pistillate flowers are borne in a dense spherical many-flowered head which appears on a short stout peduncle from the axils of the current year's growth. Each flower has a hairy four-lobed <b>calyx</b> with thick, concave lobes that invest the ovary and enclose the fruit. Ovaries are superior, ovate, compressed, green, and crowned by a long slender style covered with white stigmatic hairs. The ovule is solitary.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in type A genes, these {{mutations}} {{affect the}} <b>calyx</b> and corolla, {{which are the}} outermost verticils. In these mutants, such as APETALA2 in A. thaliana, carpels develop instead of sepals and stamen in place of petals. This means that, the verticils of the perianth are transformed into reproductive verticils.|$|E
25|$|Adults are {{particularly}} fond of nectar-rich flowers {{with a long}} and narrow <b>calyx,</b> since they can then {{take advantage of their}} long proboscis and avoid competition from other insects. Examples of such plants include Centranthus, Jasminum, Buddleia, Nicotiana, Primula, Viola, Syringa, Verbena, Echium, Phlox, and Stachys. They are reported to trap-line, that is, to return to the same flower beds {{at about the same time}} each day.|$|E

25|$|The chilli thrips {{or yellow}} tea thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood, is an {{extremely}} successful invasive species of pest-thrips which has expanded rapidly from Asia over the last twenty years, and is gradually achieving a global distribution. It has most recently been reported in St. Vincent (2004) Florida (2005), Texas (2006), and Puerto Rico (2007). It is a pest of economic significance with a broad host range, with prominent pest reports on crops including pepper, mango, citrus, strawberry, grapes, cotton, tea, peanuts, blueberry, and roses. Chilli thrips appear to feed preferentially on new growth, and infested plants usually develop characteristic wrinkled leaves, with distinctive brown scarring along the veins of leaves, the buds of flowers, and the <b>calyx</b> of fruit. Feeding damage can reduce the sale value of crops produced, and in sufficient numbers, kill plants already aggravated by environmental stress.
