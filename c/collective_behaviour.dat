40|$|The terms 'shoal', 'swarm' and 'school' {{are very}} {{frequently}} used {{in research on}} <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours</b> in animals. Pitcher's definitions are accepted as the authority in the field but {{are based on a}} conceptual criterion of sociability. Without call into question the basis of these definitions, they do not provide tools to determine these behaviours quantitatively. To compare studies between populations, species, taxa or different experimental treatments, and between different authors, quantitative references are necessary. Quantitative measurements of <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours</b> can also test and validate the predictive capacity of computer models by comparing real data from nature so that different models can be compared. The first part of this paper succinctly reviews the definitions and meanings of these behaviours, with particular attention paid to quantitative aspects. This review underlines a series of conceptual confusions concerning these behavioural terms observed in the scientific literature and oral scientific communications. The second part reviews the quantitative parameters developed by biologists studying <b>collective</b> fish <b>behaviours,</b> mainly fish shoals, and by theoretical biologists and physicists studying computer modelling of <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The parameters reviewed herein make no attempt to explain the mechanisms and causes that create a shoal, a swarm or a school, but rather try to describe these <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and to connect local and global properties with individual and <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Recent development over the last decade in technology, data processing capacity, cameras, and video tracking tools have provided the opportunity to obtain quantitative measures of <b>collective</b> dynamic <b>behaviours</b> in animals both rapidly and precisely.

25|$|Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a <b>collective</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{exhibited}} by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling {{about the same}} spot or perhaps moving en masse or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic. As a term, swarming is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term flocking or 'murmuration' are usually used to refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, herding to refer to swarm behaviour in quadrupeds, shoaling or schooling to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. Phytoplankton also gather in huge swarms called blooms, although these organisms are algae and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term swarm is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a robot swarm, an earthquake swarm, or a swarm of stars.|$|E
25|$|While {{cognitive}} science endeavors to explain human thought and the conscious mind, {{the work of}} cognitive biology {{is focused on the}} most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the past several decades, biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large and small, both plant and animal. “Mounting evidence suggests that even bacteria grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with conspecifics and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating <b>collective</b> <b>behaviour</b> to increase the chances of survival.” Without thinking or perceiving as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a stimulus, then finds an appropriate response in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is {{due to the lack of}} a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a science of cognitive biology has yet to be established. A prolegomena for such science was presented in 2007 and several authors have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice.|$|E

In this study, two swarm intelligence algorithms inspired of natural honeybee colonies have been overviewed with many respects and two new revisions and a hybrid version have been studied to improve the efficiencies in solving numerical optimisation problems, which are well-known hard benchmarks.

2500|$|With an ACO algorithm, the {{shortest}} path in a graph, between two points A and B, is built {{from a combination}} of several paths. It is not easy to give a precise definition of what algorithm is or is not an ant colony, because the definition may vary according to the authors and uses. Broadly speaking, ant colony algorithms are regarded as populated metaheuristics with each solution represented by an ant moving in the search space. Ants mark the best solutions and take account of previous markings to optimize their search. They can be seen as probabilistic multi-agent algorithms using a probability distribution to make the transition between each iteration. In their versions for combinatorial problems, they use an iterative construction of solutions. According to some authors, the thing which distinguishes ACO algorithms from other relatives (such as algorithms to estimate the distribution or particle swarm optimization) is precisely their constructive aspect. In combinatorial problems, {{it is possible that the}} best solution eventually be found, even though no ant would prove effective. Thus, in the example of the Travelling salesman problem, it is not necessary that an ant actually travels {{the shortest}} route: the shortest route can be built from the strongest segments of the best solutions. However, this definition can be problematic in the case of problems in real variables, where no structure of 'neighbours' exists. The <b>collective</b> <b>behaviour</b> of social insects remains a source of inspiration for researchers. The wide variety of algorithms (for optimization or not) seeking self-organization in biological systems has led to the concept of [...] "swarm intelligence", which is a very general framework in which ant colony algorithms fit.|$|E

40|$|In group-living species, {{decisions}} made by individuals may result in <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours.</b> A central question in understanding <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours</b> is how individual variation in phenotype affects <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours.</b> However, how the personality of individuals affects collective decisions in groups remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of boldness on the decision-making process in different-sized groups of barnacle geese. Naive barnacle geese, differing in boldness score, were introduced in a labyrinth in groups with either one or three informed demonstrators. The demonstrators possessed information about the route through the labyrinth. In pairs, the probability of choosing a route prior to the informed demonstrator increased with increasing boldness score: bolder individuals decided more often for themselves where to go compared with shyer individuals, whereas shyer individuals waited more often for the demonstrators to decide and followed this information. In groups of four individuals, however, there was no effect of boldness on decision-making, suggesting that individual differences were less important with increasing group size. Our experimental results show that personality is important in collective decisions in pairs of barnacle geese, and suggest that bolder individuals have a greater influence over the outcome of decisions in groups...|$|R

40|$|Significant criticisms {{have emerged}} {{on the way}} that <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours</b> in team sports have been {{traditionally}} evaluated. A major recommendation has been for future research and practice {{to focus on the}} interpersonal relationships developed between team players during performance.

In this paper, we offer the view that team performance analysis could benefit from the adoption of biological models used to explain how repeated interactions between grouping individuals scale to emergent social <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours.</b> We highlight the advantages of conceptualizing sports teams as functional integrated 'super-organisms' and discuss innovative measurement tools, which might be used to capture the superorganismic properties of sports teams.

40|$|Background: The {{structure}} and organisation of ecological interactions within an ecosystem is modified by the evolution and coevolution {{of the individual}} species it contains. Understanding how historical conditions have shaped this architecture is vital for understanding system responses to change at scales from the microbial upwards. However, {{in the absence of}} a group selection process, the <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours</b> and ecosystem functions exhibited by the whole community cannot be organised or adapted in a Darwinian sense. A long-standing open question thus persists: Are there alternative organising principles that enable us to understand and predict how the coevolution of the component species creates and maintains complex <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours</b> exhibited by the ecosystem as a whole? Results: Here we answer this question by incorporating principles from connectionist learning, a previously unrelated discipline already using well-developed theories on how emergent behaviours arise in simple networks. Specifically, we show conditions where natural selection on ecological interactions is functionally equivalent to a simple type of connectionist learning, ‘unsupervised learning’, well-known in neural-network models of cognitive systems to produce many non-trivial <b>collective</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Accordingly, we find that a community can self-organise in a well-defined and non-trivial sense without selection at the community level; its organisation can be conditioned by past experience in the same sense as connectionist learning models habituate to stimuli.
