40|$|ABSTRACT Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a {{water-borne}} infectious bacterium that {{is found}} in both <b>clinical</b> (<b>hospitals)</b> and non-clinical environments. This human pathogen is commonly recovered from respiratory tract infections. A recent study {{at a hospital in}} Taiwan suggested that dry patient charts can serve as a vehicle of transmission of this bacterium 7. As S. maltophilia is not commonly isolated from dry surfaces, this current study tested the hypothesis that this pathogen can remain viable for some time on a dry surface. This study was designed to determine how long S. maltophilia could remain viable after air-drying by observing culture growth fro...|$|E
