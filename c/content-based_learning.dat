40|$|This paper {{presents}} a collaborative ontology learning approach {{for the implementation}} of an ontology-based Web content management system (OWCMS). The proposal system integrates two supervised learning approach - <b>content-based</b> <b>learning</b> and user-based learning approach. The <b>content-based</b> <b>learning</b> approach applies text mining methods to extract ontology concepts, and to build an ontology graph (OG) through the automatic learning of Web documents. The user-based learning approach applies features analysis methods to extract the subset of the ontology graphs, in order to build a personalized ontology by using intelligent agent approach to capture user reading habit and preference through their semantic navigation and search over the ontology-based Web content. This system combines the two methods to create collaborative ontology learning through an ontology matching and refinement process on the ontology created from <b>content-based</b> <b>learning</b> and user-based learning. The proposed method improves the validness of the classical ontology learning outcome by user-based learning refinement and validation. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} how {{an advanced}} technology called pedagogical agents {{can be applied}} to English education to benefit learners across ages through computer-assisted language <b>learning</b> (CALL) and <b>content-based</b> language <b>learning</b> (CBLL). CALL, when designed appropriately, has positively influenced the development of a learner’s linguistic proficiency and communicative competence (Chun, 1994; Fotos & Browne, 2004). CBLL integrates language learning with subject-matter learning to make language learning more meaningful (Snow, 2001; Swain, 1998). However, the conventional CALL programs are often criticized for the lacking a social context, considered essential for successful language learning (Warschauer, 2004). Also, CBLL seems rarely applied to EFL contexts, especially Korean English Education, mainly {{due to the lack of}} resources. Pedagogical agents (PAs), defined as animated life-like characters embedded in computer-based applications, might be able to overcome those constraints. Given the similarity between human/computer interaction and human-to-human interaction in the real world (Reeves & Nass, 1996), PAs can be designed to emulate social interaction and play simulated instructional roles, through which learners may find learning English engaging and relevant.

Training a system to use such information across domains is shown to produce better performance. Specifically, we represent users’ behavior patterns based on topological graph structures. Each behavior pattern represents the behavior of a set of users, when the users’ behavior is defined as the items they rated and the items’ rating values. In the next step, a correlation is found between behavior patterns in the source domain and target domain. This mapping is considered a bridge between the two. Based on the correlation and content-attributes of the items, a machine learning model is trained to predict users’ ratings in the target domain. When our approach is compared to the popularity approach and KNN-cross-domain on a real world dataset, the results show that our approach outperforms both methods on an average of 83 %...|$|R

40|$|WebQuest is an {{educational}} strategy designed by Bernie Dodge in 1995 {{that has been}} widely used {{in the last ten}} years to teach any subjects and at all levels. From the perspective of learning and teaching a second or foreign language, the WebQuest model is related to <b>content-based</b> and task-based <b>learning,</b> as students have to deal with a large amount of specific information on the Web and perform a final task. WebQuests offer good, internet-based, language learning opportunities because they provide learners with exposure to authentic material, meaningful content and possibilities for real communication in the target language (Stoks, 2002). Other advantages that count when we decide to use this strategy for second / foreign language and content learning are that it provides a clear structure and requires collaboration and cooperation among students.

40|$|We study <b>content-based</b> <b>learning</b> to rank {{from the}} {{perspective}} of learning distance functions. Standardly, the two key issues of learning to rank, feature mappings and score functions, are usually modeled separately, and the learning is usually restricted to modeling a linear distance function such as the Mahalanobis distance. However, the modeling of feature mappings and score functions are mutually interacted, and the patterns underlying the data are probably complicated and nonlinear. Thus, as a general nonlinear distance family, the Bregman distance is a suitable distance function for learning to rank, due to its strong generalization ability for distance functions, and its nonlinearity for exploring the general patterns of data distributions. In this paper, we study learning to rank as a structural learning problem, and devise a Bregman distance function to build the ranking model based on structural SVM. To improve the model robustness to outliers, we develop a robust structural learning framework for the ranking model. The proposed model Robust Structural Bregman distance functions Learning to Rank (RSBLR) is a general and unified framework for learning distance functions to rank. The experiments of data ranking on real-world datasets show the superiority of this method to the state-of-the-art literature, as well as its robustness to the noisily labeled outliers. </p...|$|E

40|$|Bloom (1956) {{states that}} {{learning}} is the permanent {{change in the}} cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains of a learner. Considering that learners have different learning styles and educators have different teaching methodologies, the question that I have been paying special attention to since I started teaching is: "How do I know that learning has really taken place?" The only way to determine if learning has taken place, i. e. {{whether there is a}} permanent change in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains of the learner, is to measure the learning. The conventional measuring tools in a content-based education system are tests and examinations. This approach often results in a tendency towards awarding learners with a once-off qualification and not necessarily providing them with the academic and life skills needed to enter the workplace. Although outcome-based education creates the opportunity to change the product-driven and rote learning measuring in content-based education to the process-driven and authentic assessment of learning in outcome-based education, the question of whether learning has really taken place still exists. The focus of this study is therefore the assessment of learning in outcome-based education to confirm that learning has really taken place. This study comprises of action research of six cycles of one year each (1997 - 2002) and pertains to changing the Further Diploma in Education (Computer-assisted Education) qualification as presented by the University of Pretoria, from a content-based (1997 - 1998) into an outcome-based education approach (1999 - 2002). What initially seemed to be an easy task in 1999, {{turned out to be a}} complex challenge to discover all the aspects contributing to the successful implementation of outcome-based assessment of learning South African education, training and development. The findings of the study indicate that is not possible simply to convert evaluation in <b>content-based</b> <b>learning</b> into assessment in outcome-based learning. Outcome-based learning is a totally different way of doing and it takes time to make an internal mind-change as well as a change that can be observed externally. It also reveals that it is not possible to eliminate <b>content-based</b> <b>learning</b> in favour of outcome-based learning. There is a place for both and both are imperative to the needs of learners. The complex problem of assessment in outcome-based learning has no straightforward solution. It can only be stated that if all aspects are considered, there is a fair chance to end up with a permanent change in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor skills of a person, i. e. that learning has taken place. There is a real need for information on the following aspects to be considered in an integrated and holistic approach to assessment of learning in outcome-based education: ~ The governmental policy and current educational philosophy ~ The design, development and implementation of the learning programme ~ The facilitation of learning ~ The portfolio of evidence of learning ~ The quality assurance of the assessment of learning This study is only an introductory study and more research needs to be done regarding assessment of learning in outcome-based education in South Africa.
