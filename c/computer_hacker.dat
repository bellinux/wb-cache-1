500|$|In 2011, Kapoor {{starred in}} Thank You, a comedy about three women who teach {{a lesson to}} their philandering husbands.

She then played the romantic interest of Shahid Kapoor in the Pankaj Kapur-directed romantic drama, Mausam, which was also poorly received. Despite doubts about her acting ability, critic Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV thought Kapoor conveyed [...] "the essential vulnerability of a girl forever under duress, bringing out just {{the right mix of}} feminine fragility and native resolve". The following year, Kapoor played a <b>computer</b> <b>hacker</b> opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Bipasha Basu in the Abbas–Mustan-directed action film, Players, a remake of 2003's The Italian Job. Her role was originally written for Katrina Kaif, who was unavailable for the film.

500|$|Hack would {{eventually}} be dropped in favor of NetHack (1987). When Mike Stephenson, an analyst at a computer hardware manufacturer, took maintainership of Hacks code, he improved it, taking suggestions from Izchak Miller, a philosophy professor at University of Pennsylvania, and Janet Walz, another <b>computer</b> <b>hacker.</b> Calling themselves the DevTeam, they began to make major modifications to Hacks code. [...] They named their new version NetHack, {{in part due to}} their collaboration over the game being done through USENET. NetHacks major deviations from Hack were the introduction of a wider variety of monsters, borrowing from other mythologies and lores, including anachronistic and contemporary cultural elements (such as a tourist class with a flash-bulb camera inspired by Terry Pratchett's Discworld series) in the high fantasy setting, and the use of pre-defined levels with some procedural elements that the player would encounter deeper in the dungeons. Further iterations of the game included branching pathways through the dungeon and optional character-based quests that could grant the player an extremely useful item to complete the game. Though the DevTeam released the code publicly, they carefully maintained who could contribute to the code base to avoid excessive forking of the vanilla game, and remain relatively quiet about suggested improvements to each release, working in relatively secrecy from its player base. There are separate forks of NetHack, such as Slash'EM.|$|E
