30|$|One may argue, a la Ricardian equivalence, {{that the}} {{distribution}} of income among households, <b>corporations</b> <b>and</b> the government should not affect national savings if government consumption does not change; when <b>corporations</b> <b>and</b> the government save more, households, as owners of <b>corporations</b> <b>and</b> tax payers, will benefit from these savings {{in the future and}} should save less now. This argument is particularly irrelevant in the context of China. Big corporations, often state owned, and the government do not invest efficiently, and as a result, households view the increase in corporate and government disposable income as permanently lost household income rather than household savings temporarily held by the <b>corporations</b> <b>and</b> the government. Distribution of income among households, <b>corporations,</b> <b>and</b> the government matters.|$|R
