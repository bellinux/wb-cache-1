5|$|Superscript {{notation}} is also used, {{especially in}} group theory, to indicate <b>conjugation.</b> That is, , where g and h are elements of some group. Although <b>conjugation</b> obeys {{some of the}} same laws as exponentiation, it is not an example of repeated multiplication in any sense. A quandle is an algebraic structure in which these laws of <b>conjugation</b> play a central role.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} <b>conjugation</b> types, the suffix <b>conjugation,</b> {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix <b>conjugation,</b> also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form {{expressed}} {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and <b>conjugation.</b> Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by <b>conjugation,</b> but some molecules may {{escape to the}} nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than <b>conjugation</b> enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E

50|$|Verbs {{occur in}} some 38 {{different}} <b>conjugations.</b> Each verb is morphologically complex, with the verb root surrounded by prefixes and suffixes identifying subject, object, tense, and mood; these affixes {{are different in}} the different <b>conjugations.</b>|$|R
5|$|E. coli {{and related}} {{bacteria}} possess {{the ability to}} transfer DNA via bacterial <b>conjugation</b> or transduction, which allows genetic material to spread horizontally through an existing population. The process of transduction, which uses the bacterial virus called a bacteriophage, is where {{the spread of the}} gene encoding for the Shiga toxin from the Shigella bacteria to E. coli helped produce , the Shiga toxin-producing strain of E. coli.|$|E
5|$|The {{colors of}} Hygrocybe {{mushrooms}} originate from betalains, {{a class of}} red and yellow indole-derived pigments. Specific betalains found in H.appalachianensis include muscaflavin, {{and a group of}} compounds called hygroaurins, which are derived from muscaflavin by <b>conjugation</b> with amino acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{dropping}} {{of final}} short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions, {{but also some}} gender distinctions; however, unexpected vowel lengthening occurred in many situations to preserve the distinctions. For example, in the suffix <b>conjugation,</b> first-singular *-tu {{appears to have been}} remade into *-tī already by Proto-Hebrew on the basis of possessive -ī (likewise first singular personal pronoun *ʔana became *ʔanī).|$|E
50|$|In modal verbs, {{the stem}} vowel will change for all <b>conjugations</b> of the {{singular}} simple present. These changes {{are unique to}} each verb. In addition, the ending will be missing {{for the first and}} third person <b>conjugations</b> of the singular simple present.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} <b>conjugations</b> in Latin which define {{patterns}} of verb inflection. However the grouping in <b>conjugations</b> is {{based solely on}} the behaviour of the verb in the present system, and the stems for other forms cannot be inferred from the present stem, so several forms of the verb are necessary to be able to produce the full range of Latin verbal forms. Most Latin verbs belong to one of the four verb <b>conjugations,</b> though some, like esse (to be), do not.|$|R

5|$|Two other {{international}} scholars also studied the Albanian language mainly based on Meksi's {{translation of the}} New Testament: August Schleicher, who stated that {{his knowledge of the}} <b>conjugation</b> of Albanian verbs was based on Meksi's work, and Johann Georg von Hahn an Austrian diplomat, philologist, and specialist in Albanian history, language, and culture, who translated the Bible into Gheg Albanian with the help of Kostandin Kristoforidhi.|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, <b>conjugation</b> with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial <b>conjugation.</b>|$|E

5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. <b>Conjugation</b> with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, <b>conjugation,</b> {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. <b>Conjugation,</b> in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by <b>conjugation</b> to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for voice and mood, {{and had two}} conjugations which may have indicated aspect and/or tense (a matter of debate). The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the <b>conjugation</b> , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through <b>conjugation.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge <b>conjugation</b> C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Most verbs {{have six}} inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, {{a third person}} {{singular}} present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund–participle and a past participle. The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original <b>conjugation,</b> and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is am, the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.|$|E
5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial <b>conjugation.</b> Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
