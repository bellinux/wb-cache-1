5|$|As the show's revenue <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> through {{syndication}} and DVD sales, {{the main}} cast stopped appearing for script readings in April 2004. The work stoppage occurred {{after weeks of}} unsuccessful negotiations with Fox, in which the cast asked {{for an increase in}} their pay to $360,000 per episode, or $8 million over a 22-episode season. The strike was resolved a month later and their salary was raised to something between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} Great Depression of the 1930s, and many Puerto Ricans {{moved to the}} East Coast of the United States looking for jobs and {{a better way of}} life. On the island, the unemployment rate <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> and many Puerto Ricans who were unable to find a job looked to the Armed Forces of the United States as a source of employment.

5|$|Residential {{development}} of the mountain's southern foothills {{has been on the}} rise for several years, primarily in the form of single-family residences. Construction costs have <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> as well, in part because of a bill passed in 2003. Oregon House Bill 3375 required that new construction on slopes of 20 percent or greater with unstable soil undergo increased regulation and an extended approval process. The bill doubled the cost of new foundations to around $20,000 to $30,000, and the cost of retrofitting an existing structure approached $100,000.|$|E
5|$|The River Weaver is a river, navigable in {{its lower}} reaches, {{running in a}} curving route {{anti-clockwise}} across west Cheshire, northern England. Improvements to the river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and the work, which included eleven locks, was completed in 1732. An unusual clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that profits {{should be given to}} the County of Cheshire for the improvement of roads and bridges, but the navigation was not initially profitable, and it was 1775 before the first payments were made. Trade <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise,</b> and by 1845, over £500,000 had been given to the county.|$|E
5|$|The {{unprecedented}} rainfall {{turned the}} Chena River into a torrent. On August 14, it passed flood stage and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b> Because no hydrological equipment had been installed upstream of Fairbanks, residents {{were unaware of}} the flood's scale. All day and night on August 14, the water rose. It inundated the A-67 site and volunteers allowed water to fill the hold of the SS Nenana {{to keep it from}} floating on the rising waters and damaging buildings. In downtown Fairbanks, hundreds of volunteers built a sandbag dike around St. Joseph's Hospital to no avail. As the water crested the emergency dike, doctors, nurses, and patients evacuated to the University of Alaska on College Hill.|$|E

5|$|William Hale Thompson was the Mayor of Chicago {{during the}} riot and {{a game of}} brinksmanship with Illinois Governor Frank Lowden may have {{exacerbated}} the riot since Thompson refused to ask Lowden to send in the National Guard for four days, despite Lowden ensuring that the guardsmen were in Chicago and ready to intervene. Although future mayor Richard J. Daley never officially acknowledged {{being part of the}} violence, at age 17 he was {{an active member of the}} Irish Hamburg Athletic Club, which a post-riot investigation named as instigators in attacks on black Americans. In the following decades, Daley <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> in politics to become the city's mayor for twenty-one years.|$|E
5|$|After being {{signed by}} WWE, the {{brothers}} worked as enhancement talents, before gaining notoriety in the tag team division, {{partly due to}} their participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches. With the addition of Lita, the team became known as Team Xtreme and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> in popularity. As a tag team wrestler, Hardy is an 11-time world tag team champion (six World Tag Team Championships, one WCW Tag Team Championship, one Raw Tag Team Championship, two TNA World Tag Team Championships, and one ROH World Tag Team Championship) – all with his brother Matt. On the independent circuit, Jeff was also one-half of the OMEGA Tag Team Champions with Matt in their second reign and one-half of the Crash Tag Team Champions with Matt in their first reign.|$|E
5|$|By mid-September, Grant warned Boutwell {{to be on}} {{his guard}} as the gold price <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise,</b> while the conspirators bought ever more and the rising price {{affected}} the wider economy. Grant, seeing that the increase was unnatural, told Boutwell to sell gold, which reduced its price. Boutwell did so the next day, on September 24, 1869, later known as Black Friday. The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould's scheme as the gold price plummeted, relieving the economic tension. This caused a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves. A Congressional investigation followed, chaired by James A. Garfield and cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise,</b> especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise,</b> {{and by the}} end of his tenure, Ross {{requested}} that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E
