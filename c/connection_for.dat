5|$|Brockway Mountain {{was named}} for Daniel D. Brockway, one of the pioneer {{residents}} of the area. The road was constructed by the county road commission with funding through Depression-era work programs in 1933. It was briefly used as a <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> the parallel state highway after it opened. Since it opened, Brockway Mountain Drive has been recognized nationally and locally in several media outlets for its picturesque qualities, usually in profiles of Keweenaw County, the Upper Peninsula or other scenic drives.|$|E

Some manufacturers provide proprietary cables that permit their devices to physically connect to a USB standard port. Full functionality of proprietary ports and cables with USB standard ports is not assured; for example, some devices only use the USB <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> battery charging and do not implement any data transfer functions.|$|E

The game's story follows that of The Wind Waker, focusing on series protagonist Link's journey to save his friend Tetra from the story's antagonist, Bellum, with the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck.|$|E
5|$|The second {{iteration}} of M-10 {{was designated}} in 1929 {{on a much}} shorter segment of the original M-10 through the Flint area, serving as a business <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> the city as the through route, US10, bypassed it on the east. It was later redesignated as Business US 10 (Bus. US10) in 1941, and then as Bus. M-54 in 1962 before being turned back to local control in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a <b>connection.</b> <b>For</b> the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E

5|$|Starting on January 3 {{and lasting}} until January 9, 2011, in the United States, players of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver {{were able to}} visit GameStop stores to {{download}} the special shiny Raikou that was previously given out for Phantom Ruler: Zoroark pre-order ticket holders in Japan. Similar downloads would be available for the shiny Entei (January 17 to 23) and shiny Suicune (January 31 to February 6). All three of these Pokémon still enabled the event for Zoroark in the North American Black and White versions. These three Pokémon were later distributed via the Nintendo Wi-Fi <b>Connection</b> <b>for</b> European, Australian, and North American markets (for a second time) starting February 7 to 13 with Raikou, again, with subsequent staggered releases for Entei and Suicune throughout February.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle Link {{is part of}} two routes, European Route E39 and County Road 542. The section from Stord to Sveio, {{including}} the Stord Bridge and the Bømlafjord Tunnel, is part of E39—the Coastal Highway—which runs along {{the west coast of}} Norway. The section from the interchange on Føyno, {{including the}} Bøla Bridge and the Spissøy Bridge, is on County Road 542. The link acts both as a mainland <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> Stord and Bømlo to the mainland at Sveio, as well as a link between the two island communities, which have a combined population of 30,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the runway itself required the filling of crevasses {{and the removal of}} stones. Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005 by Queen Sonja of Norway and the new research station the following day. After the opening, another power station was built in 2005. In 2006, a satellite base station was built by Kongsberg Satellite Services. This resulted in the need for a broadband <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> the base. During the winter season of 2006, there was no overwintering due to lack of funding, but from 2007 this has been re-instated. In 2008, a windmill was taken into use to provide some of the power.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} built by William Cubitt. The first plan was to construct a building near the Regent's Canal in Islington that would provide a useful <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> London dockland traffic, before Robert Stephenson proposed an alternative site at Marble Arch. This was rejected by a provisional committee, and a proposal to end the line at Maiden Lane {{was rejected by the}} House of Lords in 1832. A terminus at Camden Town was announced by Stephenson the following year, receiving Royal Assent on 6 May, before an extension was approved in 1834, allowing the line to reach Euston Grove.|$|E
5|$|The {{segments}} of the road between Brighton and Farmington were upgraded in 1956. The MSHD initially signed the various freeways as Interstates in 1959, and US16 through the Farmington area gained the additional I-96 numbering. Two years later, the business route through Farmington was redesignated as a business loop of I-96 instead of US16. The final <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> I-96 between Lansing and Brighton was completed in late 1962, and the US16 designation was decommissioned in the state. The sections of highway through the Detroit metro area were given Business Loop (BL) or Business Spur (BS) I-96 designations.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} {{to promote the}} Sino-Roman <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> tourism, but Dubs' synthesis of Roman and Chinese sources has not found acceptance among historians, {{on the grounds that}} it is highly speculative and reaches too many conclusions without sufficient hard evidence. DNA testing in 2005 confirmed the Indo-European ancestry of a few inhabitants of modern Liqian; this could be explained by transethnic marriages with Indo-European people known to have lived in Gansu in ancient times, such as the Yuezhi and Wusun. A much more comprehensive DNA analysis of more than two hundred male residents of the village in 2007 showed close genetic relation to the Han Chinese populace and great deviation from the Western Eurasian gene pool. The researchers conclude that the people of Liqian are probably of Han Chinese origin. The area lacks archaeological evidence of Roman presence.|$|E

5|$|When using Nintendo Wi-Fi <b>Connection</b> <b>for</b> online multiplayer, {{the player}} can choose between a match with a random {{opponent}} {{from around the}} world, or a match with someone that the player has exchanged friend codes with. Worldwide matches are limited to two players, with the weather conditions being randomly generated and a map randomly chosen from a set list. Worldwide match players can choose if they want an opponent close to their skill level or to play against an opponent regardless of skill level. When playing with a friend, more options are opened up to allow greater customization of the match, such as the type of weather and {{the duration of the}} match. Voice chat is only supported when playing with a friend, and is unavailable during worldwide online play. However, Caulder can not be used in ONLINE multiplayer due to his extreme advantages.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim. According to the proposal, trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a loop back to the central station. The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a <b>connection</b> <b>for</b> trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E
