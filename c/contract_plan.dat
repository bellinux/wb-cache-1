50|$|Financial {{responsibility}} {{was encouraged}} in the program. A limited allotment, around $16.00, was allowed from pay periods {{to be given}} as cash to youth depending on the year, <b>contract</b> <b>plan</b> and location. Since the youth financed their own airfare and cost for tours, any amounts owed were deducted from pay until the full amount paid. Income beyond was kept in savings accounts that were released to the youth upon completion. Insurance costs were mostly borne by the parents' plans. MLP carried the standard insurance for any worker, while on work time. Additional moneys send to the youth by parents or others was discouraged, as it often led to acquisition of contraband, bartering, theft, drugs or even prostitution during tours.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} forms of private credit created by banks; {{unsecured}} (non-collateralized) credit such as consumer credit cards and small unsecured loans, and secured (collateralized) credit, typically secured against the item being purchased with the money (house, boat, car, etc.). To reduce their exposure {{to the risk of}} not getting their money back (credit default), banks will tend to issue large credit sums to those deemed credit-worthy, and also to require collateral; something of equivalent value to the loan, which will be passed to the bank should the debtor fail to meet the repayment terms of the loan. In this instance, the bank uses sale of the collateral to reduce its liabilities. Examples of secured credit include consumer mortgages used to buy houses, boats etc., and PCP (personal <b>contract</b> <b>plan)</b> credit agreements for automobile purchases.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in data traffic demand has overloaded existing cellular networks. Planned upgrades in the communication architecture (e. g. LTE), while helpful, {{are not expected to}} suffice to keep up with demand. As a result, extensive densification through small cells, caching content closer to or even at the device, and device-to-device (D 2 D) communications are seen as necessary components for future heterogeneous cellular networks to withstand the data crunch. Nevertheless, these options imply new CAPEX and OPEX costs, extensive backhaul support, <b>contract</b> <b>plan</b> incentives for D 2 D, and a number of interesting tradeoffs arise for the operator. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to explore how much local storage and communication through "edge" nodes could help offload traffic in various heterogeneous network (HetNet) setups and levels of user tolerance to delays. We then use this model to optimize the storage allocation and access mode of different contents as a tradeoff between user satisfaction and cost to the operator. Finally, we validate our findings through realistic simulations and show that considerable amounts of traffic can be offloaded even under moderate densification levels...|$|E

40|$|A joint Gas Research Institute and U. S. Department of Energy Program was {{initiated}} in 1982 {{to evaluate the}} use of fuel cell power systems for on-site energy service. Forty-six 40 kW fuel cell power plants were manufactured at the United Technologies Corporation facility in South Windsor, Connecticut, and are being delivered to host utilities and other program participants in the United States and Japan for field testing. The construction of the 46 fully-integrated power plants was completed in January 1985 within the constraints of the <b>contract</b> <b>plan.</b> The program has provided significant experience in the manufacture, acceptance testing, deployment, and support of on-site fuel cell systems. Initial field test results also show that these experimental power plants meet the performance and environmental requirements of a commercial specification. This Interim Report encompasses the design and manufacturing phases of the 40 kW Power Plant Manufacturing and Field Test program. The contract between UTC and NASA also provides UTC field engineering support to the host utilities, training programs and associated manuals for utility operating and maintenance personnel, spare parts support for a defined test period, and testing at UTC of a power plant made available from a preceding program phase.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{sponsored}} by the Union of African Railways, as part of a Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Project task aimed at defining what is involved in restructuring railways so that they behave more like market driven enterprises. The question addressed in this document is not whether the railway should be restructured, but how. The report recommends four types of action to be employed in the process of institutional reform : 1) a strategic plan which defines the environment in which the railway will function and focuses on the crucial policy issues that will guide or influence the railway's planning and actions, 2) a <b>contract</b> <b>plan</b> which defines the roles and responsibilities of the railway and its owner. This plan flows from the strategic plan and should not be developed in isolation from related policy and funding objectives of the government and railway. 3) A management plan that clarifies the objectives of the senior railway executives and their roles and responsibilities in relation to the executive director, and 4) an enabling actions plan, which lists most of the initiatives that must be taken in conjunction with implementation of the first three plans. The focus should be to ensure that the roles and responsibilities defined will actually be realized in law or enforceable agreement.

40|$|The MUTCD, Section IV, {{discusses}} {{the types of}} signals and their application, and provides warrants and other guidelines used to justify signal installations. 4. 2 Design Manual Design Manual Section 335 provides the guidelines for signal installations with regard to state laws, department policies, permit approval procedures, design report requirements, preliminary signal plans, phase analysis (level of service/optimum cycle calculations), detection systems, pedestrian considerations, signal supports, and <b>contract</b> <b>plan</b> preparation. Special attention {{should be given to}} signal permit applications submitted by local agencies or developers. The permit application should be submitted to the State Traffic Engineer at least two months prior to the time the approved permit is desired. The request can then be processed for approval in a timely manner. See Chapter 6, Traffic Regulations, for the information required as support data which must accompany permit applications. 4. 3 Flashing Operation Occasionally traffic signals have been, or are, installed primarily to reduce intersection delay during the morning, noon, and evening peak hours. These signals may not be warranted during off-peak hours. At locations having fixed time signals, flashing operations may be considered for nonpeak hours where there is significantly larger traffic volumes on the major approaches than the minor approaches (i. e., intersections meeting primarily warrant No. 2). If off-peak flashing operations are implemented, follow-up accident studies should be conducted. 4. 4 Intersection Control Beacons The MUTCD states that intersection control beacons are intended for use at intersections where traffic or physical conditions do not justify conventional traffic signals but where accident rates above the statewide average for like locations indicate a special hazard. The most common application for these beacons is at intersections with minor approach stop control where some approaching vehicles on the controlled legs have failed to stop...|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} {{obtained from the}} chemical analysis of specific human excretion products (biomarkers) in urban wastewater {{can be used to}} estimate the exposure or consumption of the population under investigation to a defined substance. A proper biomarker can provide relevant information about lifestyle habits, health and wellbeing, but its selection is not an easy task as it should fulfil several specific requirements in order to be successfully employed. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge related to the most relevant biomarkers used so far. In addition, some potential wastewater biomarkers {{that could be used for}} future applications were evaluated. For this purpose, representative chemical classes have been chosen and grouped in four main categories: (i) those that provide estimates of lifestyle factors and substance use, (ii) those used to estimate the exposure to toxicants present in the environment and food, (iii) those that have the potential to provide information about public health and illness and (iv) those used to estimate the population size. To facilitate the evaluation of the eligibility of a compound as a biomarker, information, when available, on stability in urine and wastewater and pharmacokinetic data (i. e. metabolism and urinary excretion profile) has been reviewed. Finally, several needs and recommendations for future research are proposed. This work was supported by the COST Action ES 1307 “SCORE – Sewage biomarker analysis for community health assessment”.
