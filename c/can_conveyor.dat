50|$|Vertical lift {{conveyors}} contain two adjacent, parallel conveyors for simultaneous {{upward movement}} of adjacent {{surfaces of the}} parallel conveyors. One of the conveyors normally has spaced apart flites for transporting bulk food items. The dual conveyors rotate in opposite directions, but are operated from one gear box to ensure equal belt speed. One of the conveyors is pivotally hinged to the other conveyor for swinging the pivotally attached conveyor away from the remaining conveyor {{for access to the}} facing surfaces of the parallel conveyors. Vertical lift <b>conveyors</b> <b>can</b> be manually or automatically loaded and controlled. Almost all vertical <b>conveyors</b> <b>can</b> be systematically integrated with horizontal conveyors, since both of these conveyor systems work in tandem to create a cohesive material handling assembly line.|$|R
50|$|In {{internal}} logistics, {{there are}} various ways for getting product flows up or down. A solution which is often used is the deployment of incline or lowering belts. When placed at an angle in order to bridge a height difference, such belt conveyors also {{have the advantage of}} covering a certain distance. A disadvantage is the loss of much useful floor space {{as a result of the}} presence of the necessary supports for the belt conveyor. A bigger distance over a smaller floor area can be bridged using a product lift or a vertical conveyor. A continuous conveyor or a discontinuous <b>conveyor</b> <b>can</b> be chosen as a vertical <b>conveyor.</b> Continuous <b>conveyors</b> <b>can</b> take the form of a spiral conveyor, an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift or a product lift fitted with a fork.|$|R

50|$|While {{inclined}} {{moving walkways}} {{can be used}} in multi-level retail stores to transport shopping carts between floors, they are associated with safety hazards (such as, with baby strollers) and take up about twice as much floor space as a separate cart conveyor system, because moving walkways can not be installed at inclinations greater than 12 degrees, while a cart <b>conveyor</b> <b>can</b> operate at an inclination of up to 35 degrees.

40|$|Abstract: Through {{summarizing}} {{and analyzing}} {{the design and}} application characteristics of large inclination main belt conveyor, it is shown that the large inclination <b>conveyor</b> <b>can</b> not only overcome the problem of large inclination main inclined shaft, but also has the advantages of large delivery capacity, high automation level, high safety and reliability, simple operation and maintenance, economizing manpower and thingpower. It achieved good results {{in the application of}} large inclination inclined shaft in Dujiacun mine and generated great economic benefit. Summarize The angle of main inclined shaft which elevated by skips at DuJiaCun coal mine is 300, its design ability was 0. 3 Mt/a yet. According to the coal reserves and market demands, it is developed to 1. 2 Mt/a. If the skips still be used, It not only affects the efficiency of transportation, increasing the possibility of accident also can’t meet the requirements of transport capacity; Ordinary belt transportation could achieves continue transport except for the condition of big obliquity factor. After investigation and research in many relative units, the big dip angle belt conveyor which has been put into use in 2010 proved to be a solution to the problem.

50|$|Belt {{conveyors}} are {{the most}} commonly used powered conveyors because they {{are the most}} versatile and the least expensive. Product is conveyed directly on the belt so both regular and irregular shaped objects, large or small, light and heavy, can be transported successfully. These conveyors should use only the highest quality premium belting products, which reduces belt stretch and results in less maintenance for tension adjustments. Belt <b>conveyors</b> <b>can</b> be used to transport product in a straight line or through changes in elevation or direction. In certain applications they can also be used for static accumulation or cartons.|$|R
50|$|A {{discontinuous}} conveyor {{also called}} a reciprocating elevator, lifts the product on to a platform using a platform, roller conveyor or belt conveyor and then moves the platform with {{the product to}} another level. Because of the cycle time required for input and output as well as lifting/lowering movements, such a <b>conveyor</b> <b>can</b> only be used for smaller capacities. Continuous conveyors {{are more suitable for}} bigger capacities. There are two important solutions which can be used for this group. It is possible to choose a spiral conveyor or a continuous product lift. Both solutions are able to handle several products at a time.|$|R
40|$|Belt <b>conveyors</b> <b>can</b> be {{partially}} loaded {{due to the}} variation of bulk material flow loaded onto the conveyor. Speed control attempts to reduce the belt conveyor energy consumption and to enable the green operations of belt conveyors. Current research of speed control rarely takes the conveyor dynamics into account so that speed control lacks applicability. Based on our previous research, this paper will provide an improved three-step method to determine the minimum speed adjustment time. This method can be summarized as Estimation-Calculation-Optimization and ECO in short. The ECO method takes both the potential risks and the conveyor dynamics into account. It is expected to keep belt conveyors in good dynamic behaviors in transient operations. After discussing the ECO method, this research takes a long inclined belt conveyor of an import dry bulk terminal as case study. Based on the suggested acceleration time, a speed controller is built and computational simulations are carried out to evaluate the energy savings and the conveyor dynamics. Experimental results prove that {{the application of the}} ECO method ensures the healthy dynamic performance of belt conveyors under speed control in transient operations. Annually, the average electricity consumption of the single <b>conveyor</b> <b>can</b> be reduced by over 10 % with around 90 tons reduction of emission. The direct economic benefit can reach up to more than € 10, 000 in terms of the electricity utilization per year. Accepted Author ManuscriptTransport Engineering and Logistic...|$|R

Line-shaft conveyors are also extremely safe {{for people to}} work around because the elastic belts can stretch and not injure fingers should any get caught underneath them. Moreover, the spools will slip and allow the rollers to stop moving if clothing, hands or hair gets caught in them. In addition, since the spools are slightly loose on the shaft, they act like clutches that slip when products are required to accumulate (stop moving and bump up against each other. i.e. queue up).
