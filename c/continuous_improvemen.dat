As a general principle, the prerequisites for a successful CQI program include: commitment by top management, motivation of all members to participate and continuous training. This proposal {{is intended to be}} more practical than theoretical and therefore the discussion below will be written in a format to best serve this purpose. The authors followed Donabedian’s theoretical model by dividing aspects of quality into three components, namely structure, process and outcome. To assure and improve quality in any of these components, 4 steps are necessary: first, the selection of topics to be looked at; second, the development of indicators; third, the analysis and evaluation of the data; and fourth, the implementation of change and follow-up review (Figure 1).

40|$|Assessing {{performance}} {{of mental health}} services (MHS) providers merely by their outcomes is insufficient. Process factors, such as treatment cost or duration, should also be considered in a meaningful and thorough analysis of quality of care. The present study aims to examine various performance indicators based on treatment outcome and two process factors: duration and cost of treatment. Data of patients with depression or anxiety from eight Dutch MHS providers were used. Treatment outcome was operationalized as case mix corrected pre-to-posttreatment change scores and as reliable change (improved) and clinical significant change (recovered). Duration and cost were corrected for case mix differences as well. Three performance indicators were calculated and compared: outcome as such, duration per outcome, and cost per outcome. The results showed that performance indicators, which also take process variability into account, reveal larger differences between MHS providers than mere outcome. We recommend to use the three performance indicators in a complementary way. Average pre-to-posttreatment change allows for a simple and straightforward ranking of MHS providers. Duration per outcome informs patients on how MHS providers compare in how quickly symptomatic relief is achieved. Cost per outcome informs MHS providers on how they compare regarding the efficiency of their care. The substantial variation among MHS providers in outcome, treatment duration and cost calls for further exploration of its causes, dissemination of best practices, and <b>continuous</b> quality <b>improvemen...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, two {{innovative}} two-wheeled vehicles, {{one with}} four-stroke four-cylinder engine {{and the other}} one with four-stroke three-cylinder engine, have been analyzed. These vehicles exhibit good performance in terms of weights, fuel consumption and emissions of pollutant and CO 2. The aim of this paper is a comparison, from an energy and environmental standpoint, of the life cycle of these new models with the life cycle of a previous model of two-wheeled vehicle with four-stroke four-cylinder engine. LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) is an excellent support tool for these analyses: through a detached procedure, environmental impacts of a manufacturing system throughout its whole life span can be evaluated and the correlated environmental effects can be quantified. LCA can aim also for the evaluation and comparison of the life cycle environmental effects of similar models relating to a specific kind of product. The final result of this paper is that the innovative vehicles attain a strong reduction of energy needs and associated environmental impacts, referred to the whole life cycle; this result is obtained through LCA methodology application and with an objective, reliable and verifiable analysis. Such energy and environmental impact reduction across the whole life span could stimulate the specific market segment: in fact the new models must be compared with competitors not only from the technical performance point of view, but also in terms of energy and environmental sustainability. A benchmark can be formed from the results of this analysis, in order to establish the level of sustainability of a particular model and to define potential improvement operations, with the purpose of <b>continuous</b> <b>improvemen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{organisation}} invests huge {{resources on}} a regular basis on Human Resources Development (HRD) initiatives because of the age long belief that this will enhance efficiency and effectiveness. But sadly, these expectations often go unfulfilled. This study empirically tests the effect of HRD on financial performance with employee competence and organisational commitment acting as mediating mechanisms. A total of 84 copies of a questionnaire that was distributed to and received from bank workers of two of Nigeria’s leading banks: First Bank of Nigeria Plc and Zenith Bank Plc to elicit relevant data on employee participation in and perceived benefits of HRD, commitment & competence and financial performance were analysed using Cronbach’s Coefficient Alpha and multiple regression analysis. Results show a significant relationship between employee participation in HRD including perceived benefits of HRD and organisational commitment and employee competence. The study also shows a significant relationship between competence & commitment and financial performance. Thus organisation should focus attention on delivering consistent HRD initiatives relevant to the need of employees and focused on addressing identified Skills, Knowledge and Abilities (KSA) gaps for a <b>continuous</b> financial performance <b>improvemen...</b>|$|R

Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs The University of MinnesotaIn the Spring of 2007, the University of Minnesota's Office of Service and Continuous Improvement (OSCI) {{approved}} {{a grant from}} its Service and Process Improvement Fund (SPIF) for a grassroots initiative entitled “Emphasizing the "Public" in Public Affairs” (see Appendix A). The aim of the proposal was to use an already existing university resource called “UThink” to build weblogs for the various research centers at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs to enable the centers to better publicize their own research and events and to serve as easily accessible public affairs resources for each center's particular policy field, policy makers, the blogosphere, the mainstream media, and elite or otherwise highly engaged publics. At $ 12, 125, the grant was the smallest approved by OSCI for the 2007 - 2008 academic year, and was funded primarily due to the substantial benefit/cost ratio it promised to achieve. Further, the committee which approved the project included the following affirmation of its merits: “Reviewers supported this project because it will further develop the Humphrey Institute as an exceptional organization. It will {{be a model for}} other departments to follow and it will demonstrate what is possible through UThink with a systematic and coordinated plan” (OSCI, 2007). Most blogs hosted by the UThink system are deployed in an ad-hoc fashion as personal opinion blogs, collaborative research blogs, or as online complements to offline, traditional courses taught at the University. The Humphrey blogging project, by contrast, is an organized institution-wide effort that seeks to integrate blogs and blogging practices into the core of the organization's academic research and outreach efforts.

40|$|Volunteering Australia’s new {{national}} standards for volunteer involvement update standards produced in 1998 and 2001 and provide a sound framework for supporting the volunteer sector in Australia. Introduction Volunteer involvement is {{a critical part of}} Australian society. It contributes to civil society and active participation in building strong, inclusive, and resilient communities. It underlies innovation and social change, our responses to community need and community challenges, and it brings together and supports the local strengths and assets of communities. There are important benefits to both organisations and to volunteers when volunteers become involved in organisations. Volunteer involvement can contribute to, and extend the capacity of, organisations to meet aims and goals. Volunteers can provide the time, skills, expertise and points of view that enable an organisation to pursue programs and activities that benefit the community. For individuals, volunteering provides an opportunity to be involved in activities reflecting their interests and using their skills. Meaningful activity in turn promotes a sense of belonging and general wellbeing. Volunteering can also be a way to develop skills, potential pathways to employment, or a way to contribute existing skills for the common good. Volunteer involvement is a two-way relationship, providing an opportunity for organisations to achieve their goals by involving volunteers in their activities, and for volunteers to make meaningful use of their time and skills, contributing to social and community outcomes. The National Standards allow organisations to make use of simple, practical criteria across a broad range of volunteering situations. There are 8 standards addressing the key areas of volunteer involvement: 1. Leadership and management 2. Commitment to volunteer involvement 3. Volunteer roles 4. Recruitment and selection 5. Support and development 6. Workplace safety and wellbeing 7. Volunteer recognition 8. Quality management and <b>continuous</b> <b>improvemen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Even the best-designed {{online course}} faces a make-it-or-break-it {{moment when the}} live online classes begin. Successful {{execution}} requires support and coaching. This session will describe how Columbia University’s School of Continuing Education (CU SCE) promotes the successful execution of live online classes, which are {{a key component of}} CU SCE’s online course offerings. Session participants will come away with best practices and practical tips for implementing similar strategies at their own universities, with a range of staffing levels and budgets. Once a semester begins and live online classes launch, online faculty face many barriers to a successful semester. Technical issues can easily derail an online class. Individual students may need support with connection issues and equipment setup, while faculty need to focus on teaching the whole class. Interactive activities such as polls, videos with debrief discussions, and breakout groups require preparation. Chat conversations require constant monitoring. Student attendance and participation require tracking when they impact grades. New online faculty need to develop online instructional skills over time, and can feel confused by the many tools and overwhelmed by the many differences from face-to-face classroom instruction. At CU SCE, live online classes are a key component of the online courses we offer. They are weekly classes hosted in Adobe Connect for 90 - 120 minutes {{for the duration of the}} semester and led by a course instructor with a teaching assistant facilitator. Every class is supported by a dedicated webinar specialist. Prior to the start of the semester, every new online course goes through a rigorous 16 -week instructional design process with a team that includes the course faculty and an instructional designer, course developer, media producer, educational technologist, and webinar specialist. This team creates a highly interactive, social, and rigorous online learning experience for our students. As part of this design process, each live online class is carefully planned, with storyboards for each class session that include details of what students will see, hear, and do. The classes include compelling content, dynamic visuals, moments of interaction every five minutes, initiation of reflective dialogue in the chat, and creative use of tools. By the time the semester arrives, all of the asynchronous activities and assignments have been set up in the course site on Canvas, and all of the live online classes have been scripted. In order to set online faculty up for success, CU SCE dedicates a webinar specialist to each course. The webinar specialists come from a pool of full time employees and freelancers. Their role is to meet with the instructor every week, attend every live online class of the course, provide real-time technical support to the students and instructor, prepare the Adobe Connect classroom with all lecture materials and activity assets, and write a report after every live online class, detailing student attendance and participation and also offering written coaching for the instructor, in the form of describing what went well and what could be improved next time. The written coaching in the weekly reports and the verbal coaching in the weekly meetings focus on the instructor’s strengths, in order to help the instructor identify and build upon these strengths and develop confidence with online instruction. The webinar specialist also proposes solutions to fix any issues that may have come up in the previous class, and suggests new instructional strategies the instructor may be ready to try. CU SCE has found that this support and coaching model has facilitated technically smooth live online classes that are continually improving. Instructors say that they could not have done it without their webinar specialist partners – with this support, they are able to focus on instruction and engage their students. Students say that they appreciate the responsive technical support and ability to focus on their learning rather than extraneous technical issues, and they rate their online courses and instructors well. This interactive session will engage participants through the use of polling questions, Q&A, and a brief activity and discussion to help participants plan how to modify strategies from this session in order to fit their university’s unique circumstances. Whether participants are looking for solutions to make live online classes more engaging for students, techniques to support online faculty, or ways to improve the execution of well-designed live online classes, this session will offer applicable ideas. ***Columbia University’s School of Continuing Education offers a variety of online courses to attract a broad demographic of working professionals, move beyond geographical limitations, and reduce costs. The online courses enable the school to offer fully online and low residency degrees and professional certificates that integrate knowledge across disciplinary boundaries, combine theory with practice, leverage the expertise of our students and faculty, and connect global constituencies. Online courses are a pivotal part of CU SCE’s mission to transform knowledge and understanding in service of the greater good: a just, sustainable and compassionate global society.
