25|$|UNIVAC, {{the first}} {{commercial}} <b>computer</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> produced a series of EXEC operating systems. Like all early main-frame systems, this batch-oriented system managed magnetic drums, disks, card readers and line printers. In the 1970s, UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic (RTB) system to support large-scale time sharing, also patterned after the Dartmouth BC system.|$|E

25|$|Between 1978 and 2006 {{there were}} a number of legal {{disputes}} between Apple Corps (owned by The Beatles) and the <b>computer</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) over competing trademark rights.

25|$|The British <b>computer</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Acorn Computers first {{developed}} the Acorn RISC Machine architecture (ARM) in the 1980s {{to use in}} its personal computers. Its first ARM-based products were coprocessor modules for the BBC Micro series of computers. After the successful BBC Micro computer, Acorn Computers considered how to move on from the relatively simple MOS Technology 6502 processor to address business markets {{like the one that}} was soon dominated by the IBM PC, launched in 1981. The Acorn Business Computer (ABC) plan required that a number of second processors be made to work with the BBC Micro platform, but processors such as the Motorola 68000 and National Semiconductor 32016 were considered unsuitable, and the 6502 was not powerful enough for a graphics-based user interface.|$|E
2500|$|In early September 2001, in {{the wake}} of the {{bursting}} of the Tech Bubble, Fiorina announced the acquisition of PC maker Compaq with 25 billion in stock, which, at the time, was the second largest producer of personal computers, after Dell.

2500|$|As Chief Executive Officer [...] of HP from 1999 to 2005, Fiorina was {{the first}} woman to lead a Top-20 company as ranked by Fortune Magazine. In 2002, Fiorina oversaw what was then the largest {{technology}} sector merger in history, in which HP acquired rival personal <b>computer</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> Compaq. The transaction made HP the world's largest seller of personal computers. HP subsequently laid off 30,000 U.S. employees in order to save 80,000 jobs. The company then grew to 150,000. In February 2005, she was forced to resign as CEO and Chair following a boardroom disagreement.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Apple {{completed}} numerous acquisitions {{to create}} a portfolio of digital production software for both professionals and consumers. In 1998, Apple purchased Macromedia's Key Grip software project, signaling an expansion into the digital video editing market. The sale was an outcome of Macromedia's decision to solely focus upon web development software. The product, still unfinished {{at the time of}} the sale, was renamed [...] "Final Cut Pro" [...] when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999. The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999. Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte, which had developed DVD authoring technology, as well as Astarte's corresponding products and engineering team in April 2000. Astarte's digital tool DVDirector was subsequently transformed into the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product. Apple then employed the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market. In 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake, as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first <b>computer</b> <b>manufacturer</b> to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application. The release of iPhoto in the same year completed the iLife suite.|$|E
