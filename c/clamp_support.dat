A three Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) mass-spring {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to predict the}} dynamic response of <b>clamped</b> <b>supported</b> beams subjected to blast loads at the mid-span of the beam. The stiffness of inelastic spring is defined from the relationship between force and mid-span displacement of beams subjected to blast loads. The lumped mass is calculated from the equivalency between the model and beam based on the fundamental frequency. <b>Clamped</b> <b>supported</b> solid beams and T-beams are taken as typical examples to verify the proposed model. And the influence of geometric parameters on deformation behavior is discussed in details...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a {{residual}} stress analysis {{is carried out}} on symmetric cross-ply and angle-ply thermoplastic simple <b>supported</b> and <b>clamped</b> <b>supported</b> laminated plates for transverse loading. Low density polyethylene thermoplastic matrix (LDPE) and woven Ni–Cr fibers are used to produce the composite plates by using molds. First order shear deformation theory and nine nodes Lagrangian finite element are used. Mathematical formulation is given for the elasto-plastic stress analysis of a laminated plate for small deformations. Yield points and stresses are obtained for symmetric simple <b>supported</b> and <b>clamped</b> <b>supported</b> laminated plates. Residual stresses in thermoplastic plates are given in the tables. The expansion of plastic zones is illustrated for 50, 100 and 150 loading steps. Yield points {{and the expansion of}} plastic zones are compared for different plates.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} research is to examine the added mass effect that water has on the dynamic response of a sandwich composite under impact, particularly impact leading to failure. Because sandwich composites are much less dense than water, fluid structure interaction plays a large part in the failure. Composite samples were constructed using vacuum assisted transfer molding, with a 6. 35 mm balsa core and symmetrical plain weave 6 oz E-glass skins. The experiment consisted of three phases. First, using threepoint bending, strain rate characteristics were examined both in air and under water. After establishing that the medium had no effect on the beam response under different strain rates, but confirming that previously established relationships between strain rate and ultimate strength for axially loaded glass composites can be applies to sandwich construction in bending, the experiment progressed to impact testing where each specimen, again a one inch wide beam, was subjected to progressively increasing force. The data from this phase showed that submerged samples failed at lower drop heights and lower peak forces with a failure mode dominated by center span skin compression failure. Beams in air were able to withstand higher drop heights and peak forces. Dry sample failure mode was dominated by skin compression failure at the <b>clamped</b> <b>support</b> with occasional evidence of shear failure through the core adjacent to the <b>clamped</b> <b>support.</b> The data from this study will increase understanding of sandwich composite characteristics subjected to underwater impact.

The simplified approach can result in significant savings in computer time or it can expediently be used as a check of results from a more rigorous approach. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by various examples of beams with simple <b>support</b> and <b>clamped</b> <b>support</b> boundary conditions...|$|R
