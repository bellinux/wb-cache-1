5000|$|During a {{subsequent}} seven-year period (1977-84) Clayton resided about 1/3 time sponsored by Till Kirsten at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg as Humboldt Prize awardee. He {{did so with}} annual academic leaves from Rice University. There he joined the Meteoritical Society seeking audience for his newly published theoretical picture of {{a new type of}} isotopic astronomy based on the relative abundances of the isotopes of the chemical elements within interstellar dust grains. He hoped that such interstellar grains could be discovered within meteorites; and he also advanced a related theory that he called cosmic <b>chemical</b> <b>memory</b> by which the effects of stardust can be measured in meteoritic minerals even if stardust itself no longer exists there. Clayton designated the crystalline component of interstellar dust that had condensed thermally from hot and cooling stellar gases by a new scientific name, stardust. Stardust became an important component of cosmic dust. Clayton has described the stiff resistance encountered from meteoriticist referees of his early papers advancing this new theory. He nonetheless established that research program at Rice University, where he continued guiding graduate-student research on that topic. He and student Kurt Liffman computed a pathbreaking history of survival rates of refractory stardust in the interstellar medium after its ejection from stars; and with student Mark D. Leising computed a propagation model of positron annihilation lines emitted from nova explosions and of the angular distribution of gamma ray lines from radioactive 26Al in the galaxy. Following laboratory discovery in 1987 of meteoritic stardust bearing unequivocal isotopic markers of stars, Clayton was awarded the 1991 Leonard Medal, the highest honor of the Meteoritical Society, sixteen years after his refereeing battles over his papers on stardust. Feeling vindicated, Clayton exulted in Nature [...] "the human race holds solid samples of supernovae in its hands and studies them in terrestrial laboratories".|$|E
40|$|Work on {{the ways}} in which the isotopic {{anomalies}} found in meteorites can be regarded as the <b>chemical</b> <b>memory</b> of even larger anomalies found in interstellar dust is outlined. This approach constitutes one theory of the isotopic anomalies, standing in contrast to the idea of a spatial inhomogeneity in the early solar system owing to inhomogeneous admixture from a neighboring supernova. The four mechanisms of isotopic <b>chemical</b> <b>memory</b> in interstellar dust are: (1) thermal condensation within expanding events of nucleosynthesis; (2) different isotopic mappings onto the grain size spectrum; (3) dust components of differing age; and (4) isotope-dependent interstellar chemistry.

The majority of authors ascribed these events to denervation hypersensitivity caused by the nigral and other lesions of the disease. By feeding levodopa to mice, however, we induced a state that simulated denervations hypersensitivity, including hyperreaction to single injections of levodopa and increased dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] activity in homogenates of caudate nuclei.

40|$|Astrophysical history, {{particularly}} that period extending from stellar nucleosynthesis events {{to the formation}} of meteorites, is discussed as the key element for the understanding of isotopic anomalies in meteorites. The bulk homogeneity of the interstellar medium is considered, and it is argued that, despite the presence of spatial inhomogeneities due to different nucleosynthesis rates {{in different parts of the}} galaxy and supernova ejecta, a cosmic <b>chemical</b> <b>memory</b> of nucleosynthesis patterns, rather than an inhomogeneous injection, is the source of isotopic anomalies. According to this view, volatility patterns and some isotopic patterns are mapped onto a grain-size spectrum, and the FUN systematics may be explained by interstellar sputtering.

40|$|Because of the {{relative}} simplicity of its nervous system, Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model organism to study learning and memory at cellular and molecular levels. For appetitive conditioning in C. elegans, food has exclusively been used as an unconditioned stimulus (US). It {{may be difficult to}} analyze neuronal circuits for associative memory since food is a multimodal combination of olfactory, gustatory, and mechanical stimuli. Here, we report classical appetitive conditioning and associative memory in C. elegans, using 1 -nonanol as a conditioned stimulus (CS), and potassium chloride (KCl) as a US. Before conditioning, C. elegans innately avoided 1 -nonanol, an aversive olfactory stimulus, and was attracted by KCl, an appetitive gustatory stimulus, on assay agar plates. Both massed training without an intertrial interval (ITI) and spaced training with a 10 -min ITI induced significant levels of memory of association regarding the two <b>chemicals.</b> <b>Memory</b> induced by massed training decayed within 6 h, while that induced by spaced training was retained for more than 6 h. Animals treated with inhibitors of transcription or translation formed the memory induced by spaced training less efficiently than untreated animals, whereas the memory induced by massed training was not significantly affected by such treatments. By definition, therefore, memories induced by massed training and spaced training are classified as short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM), respectively. When animals conditioned by spaced training were exposed to 1 -nonanol alone, their learning index was lower than that of untreated animals, suggesting that extinction learning occurs in C. elegans. In support of these results, C. elegans mutants defective in nmr- 1, encoding an NMDA receptor subunit, formed both STM and LTM less efficiently than wild-type animals, while mutations in crh- 1, encoding a ubiquitous transcription factor CREB required for memory consolidation, affected LTM, but not STM. The paradigm established in the present study should allow us to elucidate neuronal circuit plasticity for appetitive learning and memory in C. elegans...|$|R

Spectrophotometer and high-throughput assays {{were used to}} assess the inhibition of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), which led us to some novel inhibitors having potential as anticancer agents. Inhibition of cholinesterase enzymes has led to the discovery of new inhibitors with potential for use in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders. We have also discovered several potent antioxidant agents from natural sources by using a battery of antioxidant assays. Anti-in-flammatory activity of a number of natural products was assayed through a cell-based in vitro bioassay. This article also contains a section on a slightly different topic of <b>chemical</b> basis of <b>memory</b> as presented during the lecture. The theory of the <b>chemical</b> basis of <b>memory</b> based on hydrogen bonding in the brain is further elaborated. NOVEL NATURAL PRODUCTS WITH PROLYL ENDOPEPTIDASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITY Prolyl endopeptidase (PEP, EC 3. 4. 21. 26), a post-proline cleaving enzyme, is the only serine protease that catalyzes the cleavage of a peptide substrate in the C-terminal side of a proline residue. It has re-cently attracted pharmaceutical interest since its specific inhibitors can relieve scopolamine-induced amnesia.

40|$|Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is {{a single}} cell which {{physically}} oscillates via contraction of actomyosin {{in order to achieve}} motility. Several of its apparently ‘intelligent’ behaviour patterns such as anticipatory responses to periodic stimuli have recently been attributed as functions of the coupling between the oscillating intracellular reactions which drive its rhythmic muscular contraction, but the mechanisms that underlie these phenomena have not yet been experimentally verified. Through laboratory investigations in which we entrain the P. polycephalum plasmodium via periodic ultraviolet light exposure we find that this phenomenon is likely to result from biasing its various oscillating life processes through altering local concentration profiles of various allosteric molecules and their effectors. This temporarily overwrites the global streaming clock frequency and eradicates the wave packets usually observed in slime mould biomechanical oscillation. This response is likened to an intracellular <b>chemical</b> <b>memory.</b> We proceed to present a multi-agent model in which we demonstrate that travelling waves and oscillatory clock frequencies may emerge in the virtual organism’s biomechanical oscillator, although anticipatory responses cannot be replicated by simple mechanical interactions.

40|$|The loss of {{pigmented}} neurons {{from the}} human brain {{has long been the}} hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuromelanin (NM) in the pre-synaptic terminal of dopamine neurons is emerging as a primary player in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This mini-review discusses the interactions between neuromelanin and different molecules in the synaptic terminal and describes how these interactions might affect neurodegenerative disorders including PD. Neuromelanin can reversibly bind and interact with amine containing neurotoxins, e. g., MPTP, to augment their actions in the terminal, eventually leading to the instability and degeneration of melanin-containing neurons due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In particular, neuromelanin appears to confer susceptibility to chemical toxicity by providing a large sink of iron-bound, heme-like structures in a pi-conjugated system, a system seemingly purposed to allow for stabilizing interactions including pi-stacking as well as ligand binding to iron. Given the progressive accumulation of NM with age corresponding with an apparent decrease in dopamine synthetic pathways, the immediate question of whether NM is also capable of binding dopamine, the primary functional monoamine utilized in this cell, should be raised. Despite the rather glaring implications of this finding, this idea appears not to have been adequately addressed. As such, we postulate on potential mechanisms by which dopamine might dissociate from neuromelanin and the implications of such a reversible relationship. Intriguingly, if neuromelanin is able to sequester and release dopamine in membrane bound vesicles, this intracellular pre-synaptic mechanism could be the basis for a form of <b>chemical</b> <b>memory</b> in dopamine neurons...|$|E

40|$|Three {{stages in}} memory (electrical, {{short-term}} and long-term) are reviewed. The short computing time of organized neural systems favors synapses as loci for storage of memory. Transfer of neuronal excitation depends upon transfer of transmitter, involving the steps: vesicle attachment to presynaptic vesicle-release sites, contraction at dithiolate structures of these sites, exocytosis of transmitter, movement of transmitter across synaptic cleft, and reception at postsynaptic sites. Disulfide formation from dithiolates (calcium dithiolate salt) occurs during excitation and can represent a short-term alteration in properties of vesicle-release sites and, thus, short-term memory. Repair by one {{mechanism of the}} altered vesicle-release sites through reduction of the disulfide bond returns the system to its original state or, by a second mechanism, enlarges the presynaptic area covered by these sites. Such enlargement is a stable, permanent mode: long-term memory. Suitable concentrations of transmitter at postsynaptic receptor sites lead to mobilization of additional receptor sites through polymerization of monomeric receptor units. Postsynaptic expansion constitutes a metastable long-term storage, readily reconstituted under appropriate stimuli. Reverberations at the electrical stage of memory are suggested as a necessary link to the <b>chemical</b> stage of <b>memory.</b> These ideas constitute {{the elements of a}} molecular theory of learning and memory...|$|R
