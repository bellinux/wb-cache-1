5|$|In 1929 {{a section}} of the LNC's land at Brookwood was set aside as Brookwood American <b>Cemetery</b> <b>and</b> Memorial, the sole burial ground in Britain for US {{military}} casualties of the First World War. As most US casualties had occurred in continental Europe and been buried there the number interred at Brookwood was small, with a total of 468 servicemen buried in the cemetery. After the entry of the United States into the Second World War the American cemetery was enlarged, with burials of US servicemen beginning in April 1942. With large numbers of American personnel based in the west of England, a dedicated rail service for the transport of bodies operated from Devonport to Brookwood. By August 1944 over 3,600 bodies had been buried in the American Military Cemetery. At this time burials were discontinued, and US casualties were from then on buried at Cambridge American <b>Cemetery</b> <b>and</b> Memorial.|$|E

5|$|The Altar to Liberty: Minerva monument: The {{battle is}} commemorated with a monument, which {{includes}} a bronze statue of Minerva {{near the top of}} Battle Hill, the highest point of Brooklyn, in Green-Wood Cemetery. The statue was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull and unveiled in 1920. The statue stands in the northwest corner of the <b>cemetery</b> <b>and</b> gazes directly at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. In 2006, the Minerva statue was invoked in a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to the Statue of Liberty in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood <b>Cemetery</b> <b>and</b> marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument.|$|E

5|$|A Bronze Age <b>cemetery</b> <b>and</b> {{the remains}} of an Iron Age {{settlement}} have been discovered in the village. Historians also believe Navenby was a significant staging point on the Roman Ermine Street, as the Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village. Navenby became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by William Rufus, Edward III and Richard II. When the market fell into disuse in the early 19th century, Navenby returned to being a village.|$|E
5|$|At Omaha Beach, {{parts of}} the Mulberry harbour are still visible, {{and a few of}} the beach {{obstacles}} remain.

The Normandy American <b>Cemetery</b> <b>and</b> Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer. A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the American airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église.

5|$|Bronze age {{archaeology}} is to {{be found}} in abundance in the surrounding area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age archaeology is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes <b>Cemetery</b> <b>and</b> at West Grange of Conan, as well as the better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E

5|$|Financial {{mismanagement}} {{and internal}} disputes led to {{delays in the}} project. By the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in late 1854, {{a number of other}} cemeteries had opened nearer to London or {{were in the process of}} opening. While some parishes in London did arrange for the LNC to handle the burials of their dead, many preferred to use nearer cemeteries. The LNC had anticipated handling between 10,000 and 50,000 burials per year, but the number never rose above 4,100 per year, and in its first 150 years of operations only 231,730 burials had been conducted. Buying the land for Brookwood <b>Cemetery</b> <b>and</b> building the <b>cemetery</b> <b>and</b> railway had been very expensive, and by the time the cemetery opened the LNC was already on the verge of bankruptcy. The LNC remained solvent by selling surplus parts of its land, but as the land had been chosen in the first place for its remoteness, sales were low.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 during {{construction}} of the Durley Hill Cemetery, {{the remains of a}} grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, {{construction of the}} cemetery went ahead, and the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian <b>cemetery</b> <b>and</b> an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 the {{location}} of the terminus was blocking the expansion of Waterloo station. After much negotiation, the LSWR reached agreement with the London Necropolis Company, the owners of the <b>cemetery</b> <b>and</b> the railway: in return for the existing site, the LSWR re-equipped the London Necropolis Railway and supplied it with a new station on Westminster Bridge Road. This new building was designed to contrast with other funeral directors' premises by being as attractive as possible. In 1902 the railway moved into the new building, and the earlier station was demolished.|$|E

North of this point, the surroundings of NY101 become more residential as the route narrows to two lanes and passes into the village of Sands Point. NY101 ends shortly afterward at an intersection with Astor Lane, at which point Port Washington Boulevard is continued by Middle Neck Road and designated as CR101.|$|E
