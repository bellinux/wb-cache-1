40|$|In {{this work}} we {{evaluate}} the impairments due to laser phase noise in <b>multichannel</b> <b>coherent</b> optical <b>systems</b> using a heterodyne ASK modulation scheme. The effects of crosstalk {{due to a}} finite value of the channel spacing are considered in a system employing a frequency division multiplexing technique. The phase noise and the frequency spacing between adjacent channels are the fundamental parameters which determine the design criteria (e. g. the bandwidth of the intermediate frequency filters) {{and the performance of}} the receiver. The accurate statistical characterization of the filtered phase noise and of the crosstalk is the key to get accurate results: to this aim the exact moments of the random processes related to the phase noise and to the crosstalk interference are used together with a Gaussian Quadrature Rule for the evaluation of the error probability...|$|R

40|$|In active noise control, it {{is desired}} to {{generate}} destructive interference by model-independent control. This {{is possible for}} single-channel systems to which a recently proposed method, called orthogonal adaptation, is applicable. In this study, the new method is extended to <b>multichannel</b> <b>systems.</b> An important issue is how to optimize a feedforward controller in the minimum H 2 norm sense. In practice, secondary paths of some <b>multichannel</b> <b>systems</b> may be nonminimum phase. It is a difficult problem to design H 2 feedforward controllers for <b>multichannel</b> <b>systems</b> with nonminimum phase secondary paths. The problem is solved analytically here with the best achievable, a practical and an economical solution.

We consider a slow adaptive modulation (SAM) technique which adapts the constellation size to the slow variation of the channel due, for example, to shadowing. The proposed SAM technique is more practical than conventional adaptive modulation techniques that require the adaptation to fast fading variations. Our results show that SAM technique can provide substantial increase in throughput while maintaining an acceptable low bit error outage...|$|R

40|$|In this work, the {{impairment}} due to {{crosstalk interference}} in a FSK {{coherent optical system}} is investigated. The crosstalk can arise from both co-channel interference due to the dual-filter receiver structure, and inter-channel interference due to the frequency division multiplexing technique in <b>multichannel</b> <b>systems.</b> Here, we perform the analysis of a <b>multichannel</b> <b>system,</b> taking into account simultaneously the two contributions to interference.

50|$|Since the <b>multichannel</b> stereo <b>systems</b> require lots of {{reproduction}} channels, some researchers adopted the HRTF simulation technologies {{to reduce the}} number {{of reproduction}} channels. They use only two speakers to simulate multiple speakers in a <b>multichannel</b> <b>system.</b> This process is called as virtual reproduction. Essentially, such approach uses both interaural difference principle and pinna filtering effect theory. Unfortunately, this kind of approach cannot perfectly substitute the traditional <b>multichannel</b> stereo <b>system,</b> such as 5.1 surround sound system. That is because when the listening zone is relatively larger, simulation reproduction through HRTFs may cause invert acoustic images at symmetric positions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we present}} a {{possible}} extension {{of the theory of}} sampling signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI) to the case of <b>multichannel</b> acquisition <b>systems.</b> The essential issue of a <b>multichannel</b> <b>system</b> is that each channel introduces different unknown delays and gains that need to be estimated for the calibration of the channels. We pose both the synchronization stage and the signal reconstruction stage as a parametric estimation problem and demonstrate that a simultaneous exact synchronization of the channels and reconstruction of the FRI signal is possible. We also consider the case of noisy measurements and evaluate the Cramér–Rao bounds (CRB) of the proposed system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{protocol}} appropriate for multiple access in a multichannel environment. All free stations contend in one channel, while the busy stations construct one queue belonging to all retransmission channels for collision resolution. Thus asymmetric access methods, such as pre-selection or sequential selection of retransission channels. A queueing model appropriate for the analysis and performance evaluation of the proposed protocol is derived. Analytic solutions are developed for a system with a finite number of stations using discrete time Markov chains. Numerical results indicate the dependence of normalized performance (normalized throughput and normalized delay) on the number of channels. The cases in which the <b>multichannel</b> <b>system</b> is superior to the single channel protocol are found. The stability of the <b>multichannel</b> <b>system</b> with infinite population is studied. Pakes's Lemma criteria are applied to specify regions in which the <b>multichannel</b> <b>system</b> is stable. The control parameters are the retransmission probabilities. Optimization rules are derived which show that the optimal retransmission probabilities are a function of the number of busy stations. © 1992...|$|R
