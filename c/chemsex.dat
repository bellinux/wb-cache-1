40|$|Introduction: There {{has been}} a steep rise {{in the use of}} drugs during sex by some {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM), with {{associated}} increases in sexual risk for HIV and other STIs. This ‘Chemsex’ has been described, but there is a lack of theoretical perspectives applied to this particular phenomenon. We aimed to assess participants’ reasoning and conceptualisation of <b>Chemsex</b> and situate this within theoretical frameworks. Methods: This study presents data from telephone interviews with 15 MSM attending sexual health clinics following a risk of HIV and accessing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Interviews were conducted as part of a larger interventional study, which used an adapted version of Motivational Interviewing to explore risk behaviour and support change. We used Framework analysis on interview transcripts in order to understand participants’ perspectives on the use of <b>chemsex.</b> Results: Participants conceptualised their <b>chemsex</b> and HIV risks in their psycho-social context, highlighting the influence of the psycho-socio-cultural challenges of homophobic marginalisation and the ‘gay scene’ on their behaviour. Narratives of loneliness and difficulties in forming satisfying social and sexual relationships were repeatedly identified. Discussion: Multiple influences of stigma, minority stress and maladaptive coping (including drug-use) are seen to contribute to syndemic ‘risk-environments’ in which <b>chemsex</b> and risk behaviours are played out. Interventions to address the harms of <b>chemsex</b> must recognise the complex psychosocial context of risk, and shift the responsibility for change from vulnerable individuals to a shared responsibility distributed across social, political and institutional contexts...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a steep rise {{in the use of}} drugs during sex by some {{men who have sex with}} men in {{economically}} developed countries, with associated increases in sexual risk for HIV and other STIs. This paper presents data from telephone interviews with 15 men attending sexual health clinics for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following a chemsex-related risk for HIV, and discusses some of the theoretical approaches that have been employed to understand <b>chemsex</b> and inform interventions. Interviews were conducted as part of a larger intervention study, which used an adapted version of motivational Interviewing to explore risk behaviour and support change. Participants conceptualised their <b>chemsex</b> and HIV-related risks in a psycho-social context, highlighting the influences of psycho-socio-cultural challenges of homophobic marginalisation and the ‘gay scene’ on behaviour. Multiple influences of stigma, marginalisation, minority stress and maladaptive coping (including drug-use) contribute to syndemic ‘risk-environments’ and ‘littoral spaces’ in which <b>chemsex</b> and risk behaviours are played out...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chemsex</b> – a subcultural {{phenomenon}} {{where men}} who have sex with men consume drugs to facilitate sex sessions, usually accompanied by electronic dance music (EDM) – has received a lot of media attention recently. Both the media and the limited existing research have tended to focus on <b>chemsex</b> as a public health concern, with both drug use and risky sexual behaviour implicated in physical and mental harm. But <b>chemsex</b> is also an arena of illegal drug use and drug supply, and this chapter explores the nature of drug distribution within this subcultural scene. Drawing on observational research and interviews with 17 drug dealers, we found that retail-level dealers tend to emerge from within the scene rather than coming from outside, and that they reflect and maintain the ethos and norms of the subculture. Benefits of drug dealing (both financial and interpersonal) encourage existing <b>chemsex</b> participants to take on the role of dealer, while challenges of maintaining the lifestyle (the physical and emotional demands of ongoing participation in drug and sex sessions) mean that their drug dealing careers are often short-lived. We argue that here that, as in other drug-using scenes, retail level dealing is a product of the subculture – and the patterns of use and social supply within it – rather than parasitical to it...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Drug use for {{or during}} sex ('chemsex') among MSM has caused concern, {{because of the}} direct effects of the drugs themselves, and because of an {{increased}} risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study aimed to assess the prevalence of <b>chemsex,</b> associated behaviours and STIs among attendees at Ireland's only MSM-specific sexual health clinic in Dublin over a six week period in 2016. METHODS The questionnaire collected demographic data, information on sexuality and sexual practice, self-reported history of treatment for STIs, and <b>chemsex</b> use. Key variables independently associated with treatment for STIs over the previous 12 months were identified using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS The response rate was 90...|$|E
40|$|Background. Synthetic cathinones (SCs), {{also known}} as “bath salts,” are β-ketone {{amphetamine}} compounds derived from cathinone, a psychoactive substance found in Catha edulis. Mephedrone is the most representative SC. Slamming is the term used for the intravenous injection of these substances {{in the context of}} <b>chemsex</b> parties, in order to enhance sex experiences. Using IV mephedrone may lead to diverse medical and psychiatric complications like psychosis, aggressive behavior, and suicide ideation. Case. We report the case of a 25 -year-old man admitted into a psychiatric unit, presenting with psychotic symptoms after slamming mephedrone almost every weekend for the last 4 months. He presents paranoid delusions, intense anxiety, and visual and kinesthetic hallucinations. He also shows intense craving, compulsive drug use, general malaise, and weakness. After four weeks of admission and antipsychotic treatment, delusions completely disappear. The patient is reinfected with hepatitis C. Discussion. Psychiatric and medical conditions related to <b>chemsex</b> and slamming have been reported in several European cities, but not in Spain. Psychotic symptoms have been associated with mephedrone and other SCs’ consumption, with the IV route being prone to produce more severe symptomatology and addictive conducts. In the case we report, paranoid psychosis, addiction, and medical complications are described...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is {{the drug}} most linked to acute harm {{out of those}} used in <b>chemsex,</b> the {{incidence}} of which {{is reported to be}} increasing. However, there have been few systematic studies of the harms associated with GHB use. We investigated GHB-associated deaths from London coroners’ jurisdictions between 2011 and 2015. Methods: Blood and urine samples were collected by pathologists and submitted for toxicological analysis at the request of coroners. Data from the Toxicology Unit, Imperial College London was retrospectively analysed. This comprised of 6633 cases from seven out of eight coroners’ jurisdictions in London that underwent toxicological analysis between January 2011 and December 2015. Results: A total of 61 GHB-associated deaths (0. 92 % of total cases), 184 cocaine-associated deaths (2. 8 % of total cases) and 83 MDMA-associated deaths (1. 3 % of total cases) were identified. There was a 119 % increase in the proportion of GHB-associated deaths detected in 2015 compared to 2014. Over the same time period there was a 25 % increase in cocaine-associated deaths and a 10 % decrease in MDMA-associated deaths. Conclusions: Our data suggest that GHB-associated deaths are increasing in London, and that this is likely at least in part due to increasing use of GHB for <b>chemsex.</b> Further studies on the use of GHB are urgently required to understand the extent of its use, whether this is as prevalent in other major urban areas in the UK, and {{the full extent of the}} harms it causes...|$|E
30|$|Results: Twenty-four NPS-poisoned {{patients}} (23 males 1 female + age— 34  years [18] (median [IQR] + chronic ethanol (77 %) {{and drug}} (59 %) consumers + HIV-infected (58 %) and depressive (25 %) patients) were {{admitted to the}} ICU. The main declared compounds were methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV + N =  9), 4 -methylethcathinone (4 -MEC + N =  6), 3 -methyl methcathinone (3 -MMC + N =  3) and 4 -methyl methcathinone (4 -MMC + N =  3), more frequently used in drug mixtures sold as bath salts or in poly-intoxication with conventional illegal drugs (mainly cocaine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate). NPS was used in a recreational (71 %), <b>Chemsex</b> (29 %) or solitary practice (29 %). Binge (63 %) and intravenous (50 %) self-administration was remarkable. Patients presented acute encephalopathy with psychomotor agitation (46 %), confusion (38 % + Glasgow coma score— 14 [9]), hallucinations (33 %), anxiety (17 %), seizures (17 %), myoclonus (13 %) and stereotypes (13 %). ECG typically showed sinus tachycardia (70 %), QRS QT abnormalities (13 %) and atrio-ventricular block (4 %). Acute cardiac ischemia (17 %) and dysfunction (13 %), disseminated intravascular coagulation (8 %) and multiorgan failure (17 %) developed. Management was supportive including mechanical ventilation (25 %, length— 24  h [21]). One NBOMe-poisoned patient died in relation to post-anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic pre-hospital cardiac arrest resulting from sustained seizures.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: A key UK {{public health}} {{priority}} is to reduce HIV incidence among gay and other {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM). This study aimed to explore the social and environmental context in which new HIV infections occurred among MSM in London and Brighton in 2015. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study, comprising in-depth interviews, was carried out as a substudy to the UK Register of HIV Seroconverters cohort: an observational cohort of individuals whose date of HIV seroconversion was well estimated. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted in NVivo, guided by a socio-ecological framework. SETTING: Participants were recruited from six HIV clinics in London and Brighton. Fieldwork was conducted between January and April 2015. PARTICIPANTS: All MSM eligible for the UK Register Seroconverter cohort (an HIV-positive antibody test result within 12 months of their last documented HIV-negative test or other laboratory evidence of HIV seroconversion) diagnosed within the past 12 months and aged ≥ 18 were eligible for the qualitative substudy. 21 MSM participated, aged 22 - 61 years and predominantly white. RESULTS: A complex interplay of factors, operating at different levels, influenced risk behaviours and HIV acquisition. Participants saw risk as multi-factorial, but the relative importance of factors varied for each person. Individual psycho-social factors, including personal history, recent life stressors and mental health, enhanced vulnerability towards higher risk situations, while features of the social environment, such as <b>chemsex</b> and social media, and prevalent community beliefs regarding treatment and HIV normalisation, encouraged risk taking. CONCLUSIONS: Recently acquired HIV infection among MSM reflects a complex web of factors operating at different levels. These findings point to the need for multi-level interventions to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition among high-risk MSM in the UK and similar settings...|$|E
40|$|In 2015, Peccadillo Pictures {{released}} the movie 'Chemsex', an 80 -minute {{documentary about the}} experiences of gay, bisexual and queer male (GBQM) drug users in London-men whose lives have been impacted by <b>chemsex,</b> that is, the mixing of illicit drugs such as crystal methamphetamine, gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and mephedrone with 'risky' sex. The film {{has been described by}} the media as painting a bleak portrait of a 'subculture on the edge'-one that is fueled by both the heteronormative marginalization of GBQM and the popularity of online and mobile-based GBQM social networks. The release of 'Chemsex' was prompted by research that reveals increases in GBQM drug use-not only in London, but among GBQM in many gay ghettos throughout the world. Most of these studies emerge from disciplines outside criminology-for example, behavioral health, epidemiology and public health. These studies also describe GBQM drug users as existing within a subculture. Moreover, these studies also link GBQM drug use to external marginalization and or stigma related to sexual identity or HIV-seropositivity. Yet, rarely are the cultural dynamics of GBQM drug use fully explored. Neither do these studies address the fact that drug use-in most jurisdictions-is a crime. Cultural criminologists argue that crime, deviance and transgression are part of an ongoing process that is interwoven with the dynamics of culture and all of its attendant meanings. This thesis explores the cultural dynamics that may shape the meanings that underlie GBQM drug use-in particular, drug use that is facilitated and or expressed through cyberspace. This thesis conceptualizes the cultural dynamics of GBQM drug using three tenets that are central to cultural criminological inquiries: that crime and deviance and transgression are often related to marginalization and oppression; that these phenomena are often subcultural in nature; and, that subcultures cannot be studied apart from their mediated representations. Complementing this framework is a research design that employs virtual ethnography, instant ethnography, ethnographic content analysis and visual content analysis. Critical discourse analysis is also employed in an effort to analyze the underlying power differentials that are present in the mediated representations of GBQM drug use. Using these methods, I was able to participate in the activities and understandings of GBQM drug users who were situated in cyberspace. Using the theoretical framework that was constructed, I was then able to analyze and draw conclusions as to the cultural dynamics that underlie their activities, behaviors, language, norms, rituals and values. One of the key findings of this thesis was in the discovery of shared group drug injecting experiences that are constructed as temporary networks using Skype and other webcam conference call applications. Another finding concerns the sharing by GBQM of drug-themed photo content in mainstream and GBQM social networks. A third finding involves their sharing of drug-themed videos to Internet 'tube sites'...|$|E
