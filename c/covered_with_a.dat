5|$|August 18, 1899– The San Ciriaco Hurricane {{moves slowly}} ashore along the Outer Banks, after {{previously}} causing extreme damage in Puerto Rico. Nearly all of Hatteras Island is <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4foot (1.2m) storm tide, and about 10vessels are wrecked. Damage is severe across the eastern {{portion of the}} state, and over 20people are killed in the state.|$|E

5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} (SMAW), also known as manual {{metal arc welding}} (MMA or MMAW), flux {{shielded}} arc welding or informally as stick welding, is a manual arc welding process that uses a consumable electrode <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flux to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|The {{geological}} {{study of}} Antarctica {{has been greatly}} hindered by {{nearly all of the}} continent being permanently <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thick layer of ice. However, new techniques such as remote sensing, ground-penetrating radar and satellite imagery have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, {{said to have}} been <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gilded roof. Among those completed were the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, the Arch of Titus and the Colosseum, to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{reports for}} LaGuardia showed {{that on the}} night of the accident, all taxiways were coated with a thin {{covering}} of snow. Runway 13 was also <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thin layer of wet snow, although it had been plowed, treated with urea and it had been sanded.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop and <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool {{to be made of}} large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the city centre, the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris is <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strip of dense deciduous forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 {{management}} of the Tomaree National Park, in which the lighthouse is located, {{was transferred to the}} National Parks and Wildlife Service and the tower received some long due restoration, which completed in October 1998. At a cost of 85,000 the walls were cleaned and <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special waterproof membrane system, the cast steel staircase refitted and the lantern room resealed for waterproofing.|$|E
5|$|In this period, the {{ceramics}} {{showed a}} {{change with the}} entry of the highland Solano style, This ceramic tradition is most associated with the Solano site in the southeastern Valley of Guatemala and the most characteristic type is a brick-red ware <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright orange micaceous slip, sometimes painted with pink or purple decoration. This style of ceramics {{has been associated with}} the highland K'iche' Maya. These new ceramics did not replace the pre-existing Ocosito complex but rather became mingled with them.|$|E

5|$|Kulintang gongs {{are made}} using the cire perdue method, a lost-wax process used for casting the {{individual}} gongs. The first phase {{is the creation}} of wax molds of the gongs. In the past, before the availability of standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either beeswax (talo) or candle wax (kandilà). The wax mold is <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special mixture of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using a brush.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} are <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast {{off the old}} one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days, some have their bodies <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pale blue, waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} dangers to the frescoes is {{automotive}} exhaust, and they are also vulnerable {{to the effects of}} the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day, bringing with them heat, humidity, dust and bacteria (the latter of which can biodegrade paints and pigments). The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> layer of smoky wax.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of {{the film}} began on May 13, 1957, with the newly created choreography. Presley's {{characteristic}} hairstyle and sideburns were <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wig and makeup for the scenes in musical number and those set in the jail. During the performance, one of Presley's dental caps fell out and became lodged in his lung. He {{was taken to the}} Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where he spent the night after the cap was removed. Shooting was resumed the next day. Throughout the film, Presley mimed the songs, which had been previously recorded in the studio and were added to the finished scenes.|$|E
