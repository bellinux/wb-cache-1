40|$|The {{logistic}} transformation, originally {{suggested by}} Johnson (1949), {{is applied to}} analyze responses that are restricted to a finite interval (e. g. (0, 1)), so-called bounded outcome scores. Bounded outcome scores often have a non-standard distribution, e. g. J- or U-shaped, precluding classical parametric statistical approaches for analysis. Applying the logistic transformation on a normally distributed random variable, {{gives rise to a}} logit-normal (LN) distribution. This distribution can take a variety of shapes on (0, 1). Further, the model can be extended to correct for (baseline) covariates. Therefore, the method could be useful for <b>comparative</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> Bounded outcomes can be found in many research areas, e. g. drug compliance research, quality-of-life studies, and pain (and pain relief) studies using visual analog scores, but all these scores can attain the boundary values 0 or 1. A natural extension of the above approach is therefore to assume a latent score on 0, 1) having a LN distribution. Two cases are considered: (a) the bounded outcome score is a proportion where the true probabilities have a LN distribution on (0, 1) and (b) the bounded outcome score on [0, 1] is a coarsened version of a latent score with a LN distribution on (0, 1). We also allow the variance (on the transformed scale) to depend on treatment. The usefulness of our approach for <b>comparative</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> will be assessed in this paper. It turns out to be important to distinguish the case of equal and unequal variances. For a bounded outcome score of the second type and with equal variances, our approach comes close to ordinal probit (OP) regression. However, ignoring the inequality of variances can lead to highly biased parameter estimates. A simulation study compares the performance of our approach with the two-sample Wilcoxon test and with OP regression. Finally, the different methods are illustrated on two data sets. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Few <b>comparative</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> of newer {{antiepileptic}} drugs (AEDs) {{in patients}} with refractory partial epilepsy are available. Therefore, meta-analysis is a widely used and useful method for comparing them. Despite the limitations of indirect comparisons, and recognizing that these drugs were tested at different doses, such comparisons can be helpful to physicians making practical treatment decisions. The {{purposes of this study}} were to present newer meta-analysis results for add-on levetiracetam compared with placebo and to estimate its efficacy and tolerability compared with other new AEDs (gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide) in a meta-analysis using methods for making indirect comparisons. Randomized placebo-controlled <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> of add-on therapy with levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide {{in patients with}} refractory partial epilepsy were identified in the Cochrane Library 2002. A fixed effects model was used to estimate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios for the responder rate (efficacy measure) and withdrawal rate (mainly tolerability measure) of levetiracetam and other new AEDs versus placebo. Because no head-to-head <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> comparing these new AEDs exist, adjusted indirect comparisons were then made between levetiracetam and each other AED using the meta-analysis results. At the doses tested, levetiracetam was more effective in terms of responder rate than gabapentin (odds ratio 2. 64 with 95 % CI 1. 514. 63) and lamotrigine (odds ratio 1. 86 with 95 % CI 1. 04 - 3. 34) and equally well tolerated. Levetiracetam had a significantly lower withdrawal rate than topiramate (odds ratio 0. 52 with 95 % CI 0. 290. 93) and oxcarbazepine (odds ratio 0. 55 with 95 % CI 0. 33 - 0. 92), with comparable efficacy. Although levetiracetam did not differ significantly from the other AEDs, numerical trends favoring levetiracetam were obtained in response rate and in withdrawal rate (tiagabine, zonisamide). Indirect comparisons based on meta-analysis suggest that add-on therapy with levetiracetam has a favorable responder and/or withdrawal rate relative to several AEDs in patients with partial epilepsy with doses used in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> These meta-analyses give only short-term efficacy and safety data. <b>Comparative</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> and long-term studies of these agents are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
