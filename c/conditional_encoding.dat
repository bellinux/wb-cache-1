40|$|Abstract—With {{the rise}} of {{datacenter}} virtualization, the number of entries in forwarding tables is expected to scale from several thousands to several millions. Unfortunately, such forwarding table sizes can hardly be implemented today in on-chip memory. In this paper, we investigate the compressibility of forwarding tables. We first introduce a novel forwarding table architecture with separate encoding in each column. It is designed to keep supporting fast random accesses and fixed-width memory words. Then, we suggest an encoding whose memory requirement per row entry is guaranteed to be within a small additive constant of the optimum. Next, we analyze the common case of two-column forwarding tables, and show that such tables can be presented as bipartite graphs. We deduce graph-theoretical bounds on the encoding size. We also introduce an algorithm for optimal <b>conditional</b> <b>encoding</b> of the second column given an encoding of the first one. In addition, we explain how our architecture can handle table updates. Last, we evaluate our suggested encoding techniques on synthetic forwarding tables {{as well as on}} real-life tables. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Consider {{a set of}} {{correlated}} sources {{located at}} the nodes of a network, {{and a set of}} sinks that are the destinations for some of the sources. The minimization of cost functions which are the product of a function of the rate and a function of the path weight is considered, for both the data-gathering scenario, which is relevant in sensor networks, and general traffic matrices, relevant for general networks. The minimization is achieved by jointly optimizing a) the transmission structure, which is shown to consist in general of a superposition of trees, and b) the rate allocation across the source nodes, which is done by Slepian–Wolf coding. The overall minimization can be achieved in two concatenated steps. First, the optimal transmission structure is found, which in general amounts to finding a Steiner tree, and second, the optimal rate allocation is obtained by solving an optimization problem with cost weights determined by the given optimal transmission structure, and with linear constraints given by the Slepian–Wolf rate region. For the case of data gathering, the optimal transmission structure is fully characterized and a closed-form solution for the optimal rate allocation is provided. For the general case of an arbitrary traffic matrix, the problem of finding the optimal transmission structure is NP-complete. For large networks, in some simplified scenarios, the total costs associated with Slepian–Wolf coding and explicit communication (<b>conditional</b> <b>encoding</b> based on explicitly communicated side information) are compared.

40|$|Abstract—There are {{two common}} types of {{encoding}} paradigms in multiple descriptions (MD) coding: i) an approach based on conditional codebook generation, which was originally initiated by El-Gamal and Cover for the 2 channel setting and later extended {{to more than}} 2 channels by Venkataramani, Kramer and Goyal (VKG), ii) and an approach based on Slepian and Wolf’s random binning technique, proposed by Pradhan, Puri and Ramchandran (PPR) for L> 2 descriptions. It {{is well known that}} the achievable region due to PPR subsumes the VKG region for the symmetric Gaussian MD problem. Motivated by several practical advantages of random binning based methods over the <b>conditional</b> codebook <b>encoding,</b> this paper focuses on the following important questions: Does a random binning based scheme achieve the performance of <b>conditional</b> codebook <b>encoding,</b> even for the 2 descriptions scenario? Are random binning based approaches beneficial for settings that are not fully symmetric? This paper answers both these questions in the affirmative. Specifically, we propose a 2 descriptions coding scheme, based on random binning, which subsumes the currently known largest region for this problem due to Zhang and Berger. Moreover, we propose its extensions to L> 2 channels and derive the associated achievable regions. The proposed scheme enjoys the advantages of both encoding paradigms making it particularly useful when there is symmetry only within a subset of the descriptions.

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{scalable}} coding while exploiting the decoder side information is considered. Prior work considered the two important cases concerning the degraded side information where source X {{and the side}} information variables (Y 1, Y 2) form a Markov chain {{in the order of}} either X−Y 1 −Y 2 or X−Y 2 −Y 1. While the encoding schemes for these settings differ considerably, they are both based on the combination of <b>conditional</b> codebook <b>encoding,</b> a standard tool in scalable coding, and random binning, conventionally used in decoder side information problems. In this paper, an encoding scheme is proposed {{solely on the basis of}} random binning, which essentially performs scalable and Wyner-Ziv coding simultaneously. Proposed scheme achieves the rate-distortion regions of prior results. A practical advantage of the unifying scheme is the fact that random binning can be realized via practical tools such as nested lattice codes and channel codes. Finally, motivated by the proposed encoding scheme, a network interpretation of scalable coding is considered. An achievable region is derived for this problem setting and the potential benefits of networked scalable coding are shown. I...|$|R

Acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) generalize DAGs so that closure under marginalization is possible.

40|$|Abstract—Exploration versus {{exploitation}} in {{a sensor}} {{field with a}} mobile agent is examined {{in the context of}} source coding. The encoder is the low complexity data gathering agent. The decoder is a high complexity fusion center. The encoder first sends a coarse description of the random field, then transmits a refined description of a region of interest, i. e., a subset of the correlated sources in the first stage and so on. The main source coding challenge is that the receiver wants to refine a subset of the correlated sources that is unknown to the encoder a priori. The conventional approach of scalable coding via <b>conditional</b> codebook <b>encoding</b> (CCE) requires a codebook that is exponential in size with respect to the number of sources and also the number of refinement stages. This paper studies an alternative approach, using random binning (RB), in lieu of CCE. The universality of RB plays a key role, as the encoder does not know a priori which sources the decoder wants to refine. It is shown that RB does not introduce any loss and can effectively replace CCE while providing significant storage reduction {{in terms of the number}} of codewords stored. Achievable rate regions are derived for the single and the multi-terminal encoding settings. I...|$|R

This graphical model allows to prove geometric loss of memory properties and deduce the asymp-totic behavior of the likelihood function.

40|$|Building higher-dimensional copulas is {{generally}} {{recognized as a}} difficult problem. Regular-vines using bivariate copulas provide a flexible class of high-dimensional dependency models. In large dimensions, the drawback of the model is the exponentially increasing complexity. Recognizing some of the conditional independences is a possibility for {{reducing the number of}} levels of the pair-copula decomposition, and hence to simplify its construction Aas et al (2009). The idea of using conditional independences was already performed under elliptical copula assumptions Hanea, Kurowicka and Cooke (2006), Kurowicka and Cooke (2002) {{and in the case of}} DAGs in a recent work Bauer, Czado and Klein (2011). We provide a method which uses some of the <b>conditional</b> independences <b>encoded</b> by the Markov network underlying the variables.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} established that coexpression of both Cre and Flp recombinases catalyzes the exchange of sequences flanked by single loxP and FRT sites integrated into the genome at a random location. However, these studies did not explore whether such an approach {{could be used to}} modify conditional mouse alleles carrying single or multiple loxP and FRT sites. dual RMCE (dRMCE; Osterwalder et al., 2010) was recently developed as a re-engineering tool applicable to the vast numbers of mouse conditional alleles that harbor wild-type loxP and FRT sites and therefore are not compatible with conventional RMCE. The general dRMCE strategy takes advantage of the fact that most <b>conditional</b> alleles <b>encode</b> a selection cassette flanked by FRT sites, in addition to loxP sites that flank functionally relevant exons ('floxed' exons). The FRT-flanked selection cassette is in general placed outside the loxP-flanked region, which renders these alleles directly compatible with dRMCE. Simultaneous expression of Cre and Flp recombinases induces cis recombination and formation of the deleted allele, which then serves as a 'docking site' at which to insert the replacement vector by trans recombination. The correctly replaced locus would encode the custom modification and a different drug-selection cassette flanked by single loxP and FRT sites. dRMCE therefore appears as a very efficient tool for targeted re-engineering of thousands of mouse alleles produced by the IKMC consortium.|$|R

Though we know most of the genes that act in cells, we have very limited knowledge of how they interact. Discovering an interaction link can easily consume a year of a graduate student’s life, if it’s successful at all. Systems biology aims to establish the interaction of genes in a high-throughput manner, elucidating the function of genes from within cells. The protein from a gene is active within a context: there are a few proteins that are responsible for expressing the gene, and the protein itself interacts with a few other proteins and compounds.
