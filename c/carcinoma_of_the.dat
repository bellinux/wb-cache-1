We describe a pooled case series from published reports <b>of</b> neuroendocrine <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ampulla <b>of</b> Vater including a case which presented to our institution. Methods A narrative review was undertaken including all published English case reports of large cell neuroendocrine <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ampulla <b>of</b> Vater. Our primary outcome was to determine overall survival. Results Twenty cases of large cell neuroendocrine <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ampulla <b>of</b> Vater were identified.

Conclusions This pooled analysis demonstrates both the rarity and poor prognosis of large cell neuroendocrine <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ampulla <b>of</b> Vater. Although surgical resection is <b>the</b> mainstay <b>of</b> treatment, we review common adjuvant chemotherapy regimes.

40|$|Endemic (Balkan) {{nephropathy}} is {{a chronic}} tubulointerstitial disease frequently accompanied by urothelial cell <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper urinary tract. This disorder {{has recently been}} linked to exposure to aristolochic acid, a powerful nephrotoxin and human carcinogen. Following metabolic activation, aristolochic acid reacts with genomic DNA to form aristolactam-DNA adducts that generate a unique TP 53 mutational spectrum in the urothelium. The aristolactam-DNA adducts are concentrated in the renal cortex, thus serving as biomarkers of internal exposure to aristolochic acid. Here, we present molecular epidemiologic evidence relating <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper urinary tract to dietary exposure to aristolochic acid. DNA was extracted from the renal cortex and urothelial tumor tissue of 67 patients that underwent nephroureterectomy for <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper urinary tract and resided in regions of known endemic nephropathy. Ten patients from nonendemic regions with <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper urinary tract served as controls.

In contrast, neither aristolactam-DNA adducts nor specific mutations were detected in tissues of patients residing in nonendemic regions.

30|$|The {{most common}} {{malignant}} bone tumours are metastatic lesions; any malignant neoplasm possesses {{the capacity to}} metastasise in the musculoskeletal system [46]. In <b>the</b> general population <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast, prostate, lung and kidney constitute, in decreasing order, ∼ 75 % of skeletal metastasis cases whilst <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prostate, lung and bladder are more common in males and <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast and uterus more common in females [46]. Osseous metastatic disease especially when lytic lesions are involved can result in significant pain and mobility impairment. In most cases the therapeutic goal is palliation with resultant pain reduction and mobility improvement. Alternative therapeutic goals in palliative treatments include tumour reduction/decompression and bone consolidation. Potential therapies include surgery, embolisation, chemotherapy, osteoplasty, ablation, radiotherapy and palliative analgesics.

Results Of 44 patients with squamous cell <b>carcinomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lung, 12 (27. 27 %) {{were found to be}} HPV negative. Twenty-three (52. 27 %) were found to be integrated form HPV, 9 (20. 45 %) were found to be large number of episomal form and a few integrated form HPV. And no simplex episomal form HPV was found. HPV 16 / 18 DNA could not be detected in 15 non-carcinomas tissues. A significantly higher 16 / 18 DNA positive rates in carcinomas tissues compared to non-carcinomas tissues (P< 0. 001).
