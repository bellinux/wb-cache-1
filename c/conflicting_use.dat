Topographic maps, satellite data, aerial vertical photos and field surveys were used. The gathered data wereprocessed in a GIS using SPRING. The data base was composed by thematic maps of the drainage network, slope, soil, nativeforest, land use, areas of permanent preservation (APPs) and of conflicting land use. About 50 % of the watershed area presentedslope above 12 %. The predominant types of soil in the watershed were Latosol.

40|$|Firewalls {{and network}} address translators (NATs) cause {{significant}} connectivity problems {{together with their}} benefits. Many ideas to solve these problems have been explored both in academia and in industry. Yet, no single system solves the problem entirely. Considering diverse and even <b>conflicting</b> <b>use</b> cases and requirements from organizations, we propose an integrated approach that provides a suite of mechanisms and allows communicating peers to choose the best available mechanism. As an important step toward the final goal, we categorize previous efforts and briefly analyze each category in terms of use cases supported, security impacts, performance, and so forth. We then introduce a new firewall traversal system, called CODO, that solves the connectivity problem more securely than other systems in its category. 1...|$|E

Up to now, computational neuroscientists have mostly relied on box-and-arrow diagrams of even complex neuronal networks, often using ad hoc notations with <b>conflicting</b> <b>use</b> of symbols from paper to paper. This significantly impedes the communication of ideas in neuronal network modeling. We present here Connectivity Pattern Tables (CPTs) as a clutter-free visualization of connectivity in large neuronal networks containing two-dimensional populations of neurons. CPTs {{can be generated}} automatically from the same script code used to create the actual network in the NEST simulator. Through aggregation, CPTs can be viewed at different levels, providing either full detail or summary information.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{international}} standards in the globalisation of the service economy. Various strands of economic analyses consider that core attributes of services affect their ability to be reliably delocalised, industrialised and standardised. In contrast, international political economy (IPE) approaches draw attention to power configurations supporting <b>conflicting</b> <b>use</b> of standards across industries and nations. The paper examines {{the case of the}} Indian service industry in business process outsourcing to probe these opposing views. Our findings suggest that standards matter in types of services conventionally identified as unlikely to be standardised, and that their use raise little conflict. An IPE perspective on service standardisation highlights, however, the importance of potential power issues likely to be included in more progressive forms of standardisatio...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{valuable}} and misused assets possessed by the United States is the rich and highly varied coastal zone. The genesis of much of our material wealth and the basis for success of the early colonies has been our national fascination with the sea. As our industry and population have expanded, the coastal zone has been neglected seriously to the detriment of both current and future generations of Americans. Abuse of the coastal zone stems from employing it as a dumping ground, using the rivers flowing into it for effluent disposal and haphazard, poorly planned development. Since the coastal zone is a valuable asset which is threatened by <b>conflicting</b> <b>use</b> and poor management, an analysis of coastal zone management is a useful means of examining the problems of managing a vital resource...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how employees respond to managements’ <b>conflicting</b> <b>use</b> of technocratic forms of control to ensure efficiency and socio-ideological control {{to produce an}} ‘on brand’ employee identity. The paper proposes a portrait-based form of ethnography {{as a way to}} illustrate both commonalities and differences in employees’ identity work and responses to managerial control within the call centre setting. The findings show that cynical distancing – and subtle enactment of the service brand – grows out of simultaneous embracing of and distancing from the contested work role. The study extends the concept of cynical distance as well as advances our understanding of how the tandem of socio-ideological and technocratic control may work through employees’ cynical distancing. Finally, the paper argues for more nuanced insights into the identity work of call centre employees to fully understand negative but also positive consequences of managerial control in this specific setting...|$|E
40|$|Grounded Theory (GT) is an {{innovative}} research methodology, consisting of three prevailing traditions: Classic, Straussian, and Constructivist GT. Despite {{arising from the}} same root, and sharing {{a number of the}} original methodological techniques, Classic, Straussian, and Constructivist GT have nevertheless diverged {{to such an extent that}} they are neither homogenous nor interchangeable methodologies. They are differentiated by contrasting philosophical frameworks and conflicting methodological directives. Through a careful analysis of the literature, the authors propose that the incongruity of the three GT traditions hinges on three principal and paramount demarcations: Firstly, their contending coding procedures; secondly, their opposing philosophical positions; and thirdly, their <b>conflicting</b> <b>use</b> of literature. The authors argue that these three areas of contention represent the quintessential distinction between the three GT traditions. Accordingly, this article will illustrate and contrast the contending coding conventions, uncover the underlying philosophical positions, and explore the contrasting uses of literature embedded within Classic, Straussian, and Constructivist GT...|$|E
40|$|Community ecology is an {{inherently}} complicated field, confounded by the <b>conflicting</b> <b>use</b> of fundamental terms. Nearly two decades ago, Fauth etal.

Results suggest that confusion about these terms is still widespread in ecology. We conclude with clear suggestions for definitions of each term to be adopted hereafter to provide greater cohesion among research groups...|$|E
