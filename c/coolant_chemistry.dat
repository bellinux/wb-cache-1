40|$|In {{the closed}} working fluid loop of the {{proposed}} Prometheus space nuclear power plant (SNPP), there {{is the potential for}} reaction of core and plant structural materials with gas phase impurities and gas phase transport of interstitial elements between superalloy and refractory metal alloy components during service. Primary concerns are surface oxidation, interstitial embrittlement of refractory metals and decarburization of superalloys. In parallel with kinetic investigations, this letter evaluates the ability of potential coatings to prevent or impede communication between reactor and plant components. Key coating requirements are identified and current technology coating materials are reviewed relative to these requirements. Candidate coatings are identified for future evaluation based on current knowledge of design parameters and anticipated environment. Coatings were identified for superalloys and refractory metals to provide diffusion barriers to interstitial transport and act as reactive barriers to potential oxidation. Due to their high stability at low oxygen potential, alumina formers are most promising for oxidation protection given the anticipated <b>coolant</b> gas <b>chemistry.</b> A sublayer of iridium is recommended to provide inherent diffusion resistance to interstitials.

40|$|Corrosion and {{hydrogen}} pickup of zirconium alloy fuel cladding in water cooled nuclear reactors are life-limiting phenomena for fuel. This thesis studies {{the fate of}} hydrogen liberated by waterside corrosion of Zircaloy- 4 fuel cladding in Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) : are the adsorbed protons incorporated into the oxide and eventually the metal, or are they evolved into molecular hydrogen and released into the <b>coolant?</b> Water <b>chemistry</b> modeling was used to understand effects of radiolysis and CRUD. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the role of oxidized Zr(Fe,Cr) 2 second phase particles. Chemical potentials and the electron chemical potential were used to connect these two modeling efforts. A radiolysis model was developed for the primary loop of a PWR. Dose profiles accounting for fuel burnup, boron addition, axial power profiles, and a CRUD layer were produced. Dose rates to the bulk coolant increased by 21 - 22 % with 12. 5 - 75 pim thick CRUD layers. Radially-averaged core chemistry was compared to single-channel chemistry at individual fuel rods. Calculations showed that local chemistry was more oxidizing at high-power fuel and fuel with CRUD. Local hydrogen peroxide concentrations were up to 2. 5 ppb higher than average levels of 5 - 8 ppb. Radiolysis results were used to compute chemical potentials and the corrosion potential. Marcus theory was applied to compare the band energies of oxides associated with Zircaloy- 4 and the energy levels for proton reduction in PWR conditions. Hydrogen interactions with Cr 203 and Fe 203, both found in oxidized precipitates, were studied with DFT. Atomic adsorption of hydrogen was modeled on the Cr and Feterminated (0001) surfaces. Climbing Image-Nudged Elastic Band calculations were used to model the competing pathways of hydrogen migration into the subsurface and molecular hydrogen formation. A two-step mechanism for hydrogen recombination was identified consisting of: reduction of an adsorbed proton (H+) to a hydride ion (H-) and H 2 formation from an adjacent adsorbed proton and hydride ion. Overall, results suggest that neither surface will be an easy entrance point for hydrogen ingress and that Cr 203 {{is more likely to}} be involved in hydrogen evolution than the Fe 203. by Jennifer Anne Jarvis.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{characterization}} of several coolant {{performances in the}} IHTL. There are lots of choices available for the IHTL coolants; gases, liquid metals, molten salts, and etc. Traditionally, the selection of coolants is highly dependent on engineer's experience and decisions. In this decision, the following parameters are generally considered: melting point, vapor pressure, density, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, viscosity, and <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry.</b> The followings are general thermal-hydraulic requirements for the coolant in the IHTL: (1) High heat transfer performance - The IHTL coolant should exhibit high heat transfer performance to achieve high efficiency and economics; (2) Low pumping power - The IHTL coolant requires low pumping power to improve economics through less stringent pump requirements; (3) Low amount of coolant volume - The IHTL coolant requires less coolant volume for better economics; (4) Low amount of structural materials - The IHTL coolant requires less structural material volume for better economics; (5) Low heat loss - The IHTL requires less heat loss for high efficiency; and (6) Low temperature drop - The IHTL should allow less temperature drop for high efficiency. Typically, heat transfer coolants are selected based on various fluid properties such as melting point, vapor pressure, density, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, viscosity, and <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry.</b> However, the selection process & results are highly dependent on the engineer's personal experience and skills. In the coolant selection, if a certain coolant shows superior properties {{with respect to the}} others, the decision will be very straightforward. However, generally, each coolant material exhibits good characteristics for some properties but poor for the others. Therefore, it will be very useful to have some figures of merits (FOMs), which can represent and quantify various coolant thermal performances in the system of interest.

Hydrogen was set free by the oxidation of the metal by the secondary coolant at the inner surface of test tubes. In the next step it permeates the tube wall and reaches the outer surface of the tube which is in contact with the primary coolant.

The original aqueous IATCS coolant used in Node 1, the Laboratory Module, and the Airlock consisted of water, borate (pH buffer), phosphate (corrosion control), and silver sulfate (microbiological control) at a pH of 9. 5 +/- 0. 5. Chemical changes occurred after on-orbit implementation including a decrease to pH 8. 4 due to the diffusion of carbon dioxide through the Teflon hoses, an increase in nickel ions due to general corrosion of heat exchanger braze coatings, a decrease in phosphate concentration due to precipitation of nickel phosphate, and the rapid disappearance of silver ions due to deposition on hardware surfaces.

This study examines the design, materials, maintenance, operation and actual degradation experiences of the system and main sub-components to assess the potential for age degradation. A detailed review of the Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System (NPRDS) and Licensee Event Report (LER) databases for the 1988 [...] 1991 time period, together with a review of industry and NRC experience and research, indicate that age-related degradations and failures have occurred.

The IATCS is a water based system which works in conjunction with the EATCS (External ATCS), an ammonia based system, which are interfaced through a heat exchanger to facilitate heat transfer. On-orbit issues associated with the aqueous <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry</b> began to occur with unexpected increases in CO 2 levels in the cabin. This caused an increase in total inorganic carbon (TIC), a reduction in coolant pH, increased corrosion, and precipitation of nickel phosphate.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} changes in coolant {{activity}} due to corrosion products of extended burn-up cycles of 18 - 24 months duration, in a typical pressurized water reactor, under pH and boric acid variations. It deals with non-linearly changing corrosion rates coupled with pH effects. The CPAIR-P computer program was modified to accommodate for time-dependent rising corrosion and effects of <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry.</b> These simulations suggest {{that the effect of}} an increase in pH value for an extended 24 -month cycle on a specific activity, {{in the form of a}} decrease in the said activity, is smeared by the rising corrosion. The new saturation values for activity at the end-of-cycle are lower than with a reactor operated at constant low pH/natural boric acid in the coolant. For a non-linear rise in the corrosion rate coupled with a pH rise from 6. 9 to 7. 4 and the use of enriched boric acid (30 %- 40 %), coolant activity first rises to a peak value during the cycle and then approaches a much smaller saturation value at the end of the cycle, when compared with the activity for the system having a constant low pH value (6. 9) in the coolant. In this work, we have shown that the use of enriched boric acid as a chemical shim actually lowers primary coolant activity when higher pH values, rather than natural boric acid, are employed in the coolant. For multiple long-term operating cycles, the saturation value of corrosion product activity increases in the first two cycles and becomes constant in subsequent ones, due to the high operational pH value for enriched boric acid (40 %) as a chemical shim...|$|E

This paper focuses on the main phenomena causing actual or potential fuel failure during in-core operation to identify the remedial actions taken and the significant lessons learned. The use of higher enrichment and higher burnup fuel, mixed cores with assemblies of different designs, more challenging core power management, and shorter outages has derived in the need to carefully consider the performance and safety of the fuel materials and designs under these conditions. A great effort has been put to improve the design and manufacture of the fuel assemblies, which has allowed for a better performance and higher operational margins, {{in spite of the}} more demanding operational conditions. The result of these counteracting trends is that fuel performance has improved significantly over the years, but there are still some concerns which need to be addressed, like debris and grid to rod fretting, overpower, and corrosion. The most recurrent causes of fuel related events were design deficiencies and human errors but the improved designs and operational strategies widely spread also as operational experience feedback have demonstrated to be very effective in reducing the frequency of in-core fuel related events. Some of the main phenomena important in the past are no longer a concern. Operational and surveillance practices, like Foreign Material Exclusion, <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry</b> control, and actions to enhance human performance need to be further enhanced. Systematic inspection of fuel assemblies and close monitoring of the operation would allow to detect potential failures in advance.

40|$|Nanofluids, {{colloidal}} dispersions of nanoparticles in a base fluid, {{have shown}} enhancements in both pool boiling and flow boiling {{critical heat flux}} (CHF) in laboratory tests. The applicability of this aspect to nuclear reactor post-accident cooling is promising. This study investigates various parameters {{that should be considered}} for such applications. Dilute alumina nanofluids were tested in terms of radiation durability, chemical stability, and CHF enhancement capability in wire and plate geometries. They {{have been found to be}} stable under high doses of gamma radiation and in the chemical environment associated with emergency core cooling. However, exposure to tri-sodium phosphate, a chemical used in in-vessel retention systems, resulted in significant agglomeration of nanoparticles. CHF value increases were obtained for both nanofluid and primary <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry</b> conditions. Additionally radiation induced surface activation (RISA) effect on CHF was evaluated for alumina and titania nanoparticle depositions on plate geometries. Pool Boiling experiments were conducted with both wire and plate heaters. Wire test results showed CHF enhancement of 23 % to 74 % for dilute alumina nanofluids of 0. 001 v% to 0. 1 v%, with the highest enhancement obtained for lowest concentration alumina nanofluid. With the addition of boric acid in alumina nanofluid, the highest CHF enhancement is up to 90 %. RISA was proven to play a significant role in CHF increase. Stainless steel plates pre-coated with titania and alumina nanoparticles showed CHF enhancement of 146 % and 133 %, respectively, compared to CHF obtained from plain heaters, after irradiation in a Co- 60 gamma source. These initial results reveal that applying nanofluid in reactor chemistry and radiation environment can potentially bring about significant benefit in increasing the safety margin.

ChapmanThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present on the {{development}} and results of the cooling system logic tree and model developed {{as part of the}} Pipeline Research Council International, Inc (PRCI) funded project at the Kansas State National Gas Machinery Laboratory. PRCI noticed that many of the legacy engines utilized in the natural gas transmission industry were plagued by cooling system problems. As such, a need existed to better understand the heat transfer mechanisms from the combusting gases to the cooling water, and then from the cooling water to the environment. To meet this need, a logic tree was developed to provide guidance on how to balance and identify problems within the cooling system and schedule appropriate maintenance. Utilizing information taken from OEM operating guides, a cooling system model was developed to supplement the logic tree in providing further guidance and understanding of cooling system operation. The cooling system model calculates the heat loads experienced within the engine cooling system, the pressures within the system, and the temperatures exiting the cooling equipment. The cooling system engineering model was developed based upon the fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer experienced by the coolant within the system. The inputs of the model are familiar to the operating companies and include the characteristics of the engine and coolant piping system, <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry,</b> and engine oil system characteristics. Included in the model are the various components that collectively comprise the engine cooling system, including the water cooling pump, aftercooler, surge tank, fin-fan units, and oil cooler. The results of the Excel-based model were then compared to available field data to determine the validity of the model.

40|$|In {{addition}} to validation data plan, development of advanced techniques for calibration and validation of complex multiscale, multiphysics nuclear reactor simulation codes are a main {{objective of the}} CASL VUQ plan. Advanced modeling of LWR systems normally involves a range of physico-chemical models describing multiple interacting phenomena, such as thermal hydraulics, reactor physics, <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry,</b> etc., which occur {{over a wide range}} of spatial and temporal scales. To a large extent, the accuracy of (and uncertainty in) overall model predictions is determined by the correctness of various sub-models, which are not conservation-laws based, but empirically derived from measurement data. Such sub-models normally require extensive calibration before the models can be applied to analysis of real reactor problems. This work demonstrates a case study of calibration of a common model of subcooled flow boiling, which is an important multiscale, multiphysics phenomenon in LWR thermal hydraulics. The calibration process is based on a new strategy of model-data integration, in which, all sub-models are simultaneously analyzed and calibrated using multiple sets of data of different types. Specifically, both data on large-scale distributions of void fraction and fluid temperature and data on small-scale physics of wall evaporation were simultaneously used in this work’s calibration. In a departure from traditional (or common-sense) practice of tuning/calibrating complex models, a modern calibration technique based on statistical modeling and Bayesian inference was employed, which allowed simultaneous calibration of multiple sub-models (and related parameters) using different datasets. Quality of data (relevancy, scalability, and uncertainty) could be taken into consideration in the calibration process. This work presents a step forward in the development and realization of the “CIPS Validation Data Plan” at the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of LWRs to enable quantitative assessment of the CASL modeling of Crud-Induced Power Shift (CIPS) phenomenon, in particular, and the CASL advanced predictive capabilities, in general.

40|$|Corrosion {{products}} on the fuel cladding surfaces within pressurized water reactor fuel assemblies have {{had a significant impact}} on reactor operation. These types of deposits are referred to as CRUD and can lead to power shifts, as a consequence of the accumulation of solid boron phases on the fuel rod surfaces. Corrosion deposits can also lead to fuel failure resulting from localized corrosion, where the increased thermal resistance of the deposit leads to higher cladding temperatures. The prediction of these occurrences requires a comprehensive model of local thermal hydraulic and chemical processes occurring in close proximity to the cladding surface, as well as their driving factors. Such factors include the rod power distribution, coolant corrosion product concentration, as well as the feedbacks between heat transfer, fluid dynamics, chemistry, and neutronics. To correctly capture the coupled physics and corresponding feedbacks, a high fidelity framework is developed that predicts three-dimensional CRUD deposition on a rod-by-rod basis. Multiphysics boundary conditions resulting from the coupling of heat transfer, fluid dynamics, <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry,</b> CRUD deposition, neutron transport, and nuclide transmutation inform the CRUD deposition solver. Through systematic parametric sensitivity studies of the CRUD property inputs, coupled boundary conditions, and multiphysics feedback mechanisms, the most important variables of multiphysics CRUD modeling are identified. Moreover, the modeling framework is challenged with a blind comparison of plant data to predictions by a simulation of a sub-assembly within the Seabrook nuclear plant that experienced CRUD induced fuel failures. The physics within the computational framework are loosely coupled via an operator-splitting technique. A control theory approach is adopted to determine the temporal discretization at which to execute a data transfer from one physics to another. The coupled stepsize selection is viewed as a feedback control problem, and a controller of the type integral is utilized. The temporal discretization adapts with the problem solution to maintain a user-prescribed tolerance of specific solution variables. Predictor-corrector algorithms enable convergence error estimates. The highly nonlinear precipitation rate of solid boron phases, and their dependence on the local thermal hydraulic conditions, is the primary motivation for seeking an automated and adaptive stepsize selection algorithm...|$|E
40|$|This {{summary report}} {{examines}} an in-vessel optical access concept intended to support standoff optical instrumentation, control and human-machine interface (ICHMI) systems for future advanced small modular reactor (AdvSMR) applications. Optical-based measurement and sensing systems for AdvSMR applications have several key benefits over traditional {{instrumentation and control}} systems used to monitor reactor process parameters, such as temperature, flow rate, pressure, and <b>coolant</b> <b>chemistry</b> (Anheier et al. 2013). Direct and continuous visualization of the in-vessel components can be maintained using external cameras. Many optical sensing techniques can be performed remotely using open optical beam path configurations. Not only are in-vessel cables eliminated by these configurations, but also sensitive optical monitoring components (e. g., electronics, lasers, detectors, and cameras) can be placed outside the reactor vessel in the instrument vault, containment building, or other locations where temperatures and radiation levels are much lower. However, the extreme AdvSMR environment present challenges for optical access designs and optical materials. Optical access is not provided in any commercial nuclear power plant or featured in any reactor design, although successful implementation of optical access has been demonstrated in test reactors (Arkani and Gharib 2009). This report outlines the key engineering considerations for an AdvSMR optical access concept. Strict American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) construction codes must be followed for any U. S. nuclear facility component (ASME 2013); however, {{the scope of this}} study is to evaluate the preliminary engineering issues for this concept, rather than developing a nuclear-qualified design. In addition, this study does not consider accident design requirements. In-vessel optical access using a standpipe viewport concept serves as a test case to explore the engineering challenges and performance requirements for sodium fast reactor (SFR) and high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR) AdvSMR applications. The expected environmental conditions for deployment are reviewed for both AdvSMR designs. Optical and mechanical materials that maximize component lifetime are evaluated for the standpipe viewport design under these conditions. Optical components and opto-mechanical designs that provide robust optical-to-metal seals and stress-free optical component mounting are identified, and then key performance specifications are developed for a sapphire optical viewport concept. Design strategies are examined that protect the internal optical surfaces from liquid-coolant condensation and impurity deposits. Finally, a conceptual standpipe viewport design that is suggestive of how this concept could be assembled using standard nuclear-qualified pipe components, is presented...|$|E
