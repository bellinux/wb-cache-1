5000|$|The [...] "LZ" [...] twin <b>cam</b> <b>head</b> was {{designed}} to give a power boost to the Datsun L series engine for competition purposes. [...] There are two different LZ cylinder heads. The early head is the same thickness as a normal L series head. The engine using the first head {{was referred to as}} the L14 twin cam. There was no mention of Z in the title. This L14 twin <b>cam</b> <b>head</b> engine has flat exit side exhaust ports, the early 12 bolt rocker cover and the coolant discharge on the inlet side of the head. All early twin cam engines appear to have the 14 bolt rocker cover (6 for the cover and 8 for the bolt-in plug holders). Later engines use the full flat cover with six bolts to secure it.|$|E

50|$|The Z31 {{generation}} featured five engine options. A turbocharged dual over <b>head</b> <b>cam</b> 2.0 L straight-six (RB20DET, {{used in the}} 200ZR), a turbocharged single over <b>head</b> <b>cam</b> 2.0 L V6 (VG20ET, {{found in}} 200Z/ZS/ZG), a naturally aspirated single over <b>head</b> <b>cam</b> 3.0 L V6 (VG30E, found in 300ZX), a turbocharged single over <b>head</b> <b>cam</b> 3.0 L V6 (VG30ET, used in 300ZX Turbo) and a naturally aspirated dual over <b>head</b> <b>cam</b> 3.0 L V6 (VG30DE, used in 300ZR). The Z31 had electronic fuel injection (EFI), and was rear wheel drive. The Z31 was available in either left or right hand drive.|$|R
50|$|The fitment of a twin <b>cam</b> <b>head</b> {{from any}} of these engines onto a {{standard}} compression RB30E bottom end gives an ideal compression ratio, (around 8.2:1), for a mild to moderately modified street turbo engine, making the conversion popular amongst those who would otherwise convert their RB30E to a high compression RB30ET using original ET bolt on externals.|$|E
50|$|These four Ballot cars, {{which were}} {{designed}} in the utmost secrecy, naturally resembled pre-war Peugeots, but Ernest Henry, who took the time during the war to improve his design before the war, resumed his sketch hemi engine with four valves per cylinder, inclined at 60°, controlled by a dual overhead <b>cam</b> <b>head,</b> to equip a straight-eight engine capable of 2900 RPM and giving 150 hp for {{a top speed of}} nearly 200 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|This engine used carburetors {{instead of}} the Nissan ECCS fuel {{injection}} system. It is able to rev higher than the RB25DE/DET (as {{it has the same}} stroke as the RB20DE/DET) as well as being almost the same displacement as the RB25DE/DET. A common modification is to fit a twin <b>cam</b> <b>head</b> from other RB series motors while retaining the carburetor set-up. The standard single cam form produced 141 PS at 5,000 rpm and 20.1 kgf·m (197 N·m) of torque at 3,000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|These engines were <b>cam</b> in <b>head</b> <b>cam</b> chain driven, {{units with}} carburetors in the 1960s and 1970s,but was later fitted with Bosch fuel {{injection}} {{in the early}} 1980s.A special 24v head design appeared on the Carlton/Omega and Senator {{in the beginning of}} the 1990s,this was later turbocharged by Lotus for the 1990s Lotus Omega/Carlton.|$|R

40|$|A column {{longeron}} {{latch assembly}} provides the securing {{mechanism for the}} deployable, telescoping column of a hoop/column antenna. The column is an open lattice structure with three longerons disposed 120 deg apart as the principle load bearing member. The column is deployed {{from a pair of}} eleven nested bays disposed on opposite sides of a center section under the influence of a motor-cable-pulley system. The longeron latch is a four bar linkage mechanism using the over-center principle for automatically locking the longeron sections into position during deployment. The latch is unlocked when the antenna is to be restowed. A spring pack disposed in the end of each longeron serves to absorb stress forces on the deployed column through the <b>cam</b> <b>head</b> piston and abutting latch from an adjacent longeron...|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} engines were equipped in the S12 chassis, depending on production year and more specifically on the geographic market. These engines borrowed from previous designs, or in some cases, inspired future engine platforms (with {{the exception of the}} FJ series, which was designed solely with Rally competition in mind). For instance, the CA series initially borrowed design cues from the NAP-Z series. The CA18DET's DOHC head design was similar to that utilized in the later [...] "RB" [...] engine series, the inline-six engine that powered the Nissan Skylines. Certain trims had the S12 equipped with an optional V6 engine also shared by the 300ZX (Z31) of the same vintage; this engine would be augmented with dual <b>cam</b> <b>heads</b> for the Z32.|$|R

5000|$|SOHCThe EJ252 {{was only}} briefly used in North America {{alongside}} the EJ251 in the USDM Legacy Outback for the 2000 and 2001 Model Years. They are most {{commonly found in}} MY00 Legacy Outbacks manufactured {{before the end of}} 1999 while MY00 Legacy Outbacks manufactured in 2000 are rarely designated with EJ252 codes in the VIN. While Subaru has not provided a direct list of revisions between the EJ251 and less common EJ252, there is some degree of information suggesting the EJ252 was simply an alternate version of the EJ251 made to meet California Emissions Standards when the SOHC EJ engines were first introduced in North America. Power output has been reported as ISO 115 kW (156 hp) but is often speculated to share the same specs with the largely identical EJ251. [...] From unofficial analysis, the EJ251 shares the same with block, <b>cams,</b> <b>heads,</b> pistons, connecting rods with the EJ252. The only notable differences confirmed are unique intake manifold and throttle body designs to accommodate the different MAP sensor location and IACV location. Also have different cam and crank sprocket reluctor configuration.|$|R

50|$|Ultimately {{however, the}} Slant-4 gained a less {{favourable}} reliability record than its in-house contemporary in the GM Europe stable - the Opel CIH (<b>Cam</b> In <b>Head)</b> unit - {{although it was}} arguably more technically advanced. The Slant-4 was abandoned for the newer generation of badge engineered Vauxhalls from the mid 1970s onward; the Cavalier Mk.1 used the CIH units, whilst the Bedford CF van also lost the Slant-4 in favour of the CIH in its facelifted form in 1983.|$|R

50|$|Beginning {{with all}} of the Saturn S-Series {{vehicles}} that were made in late 1999 (sometimes referred to as 1999.5 models) had received improvements to both the SOHC and the DOHC engines in the S-Series. These changes included revised pistons, new connecting rods, and new crankshaft counterweights in the engine as well. The Twin <b>Cam</b> cylinder <b>head</b> had now featured a new roller-rocker setup with hydraulic tappets and roller cams replacing the conventional bucket lifter setup of the previous engine in the S-Series.|$|R
50|$|Following {{experiments}} with an eight valve twin <b>cam</b> cylinder <b>head</b> for the Vauxhall Slant Four, the company developed a 16-valve, twin cam engine {{in the early}} 1970s; the first test engine, 'Old Number 1', was running by 1973. The cylinder head was similar in design but different in appearance to the Lotus one; in particular the cam carriers on the Vauxhall engine were angled upwards so that the covers were both horizontal (those on the Lotus engine were equal about the cylinder centreline).|$|R
