5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the type {{material}} for the species was thought to have been lost; in other words, the shell on which Linnaeus based his original description and which would very likely have been in his own collection, was apparently missing, which created a problem for taxonomists. To remedy this, in 1941 a neotype of this species was designated by the American malacologists William J. <b>Clench</b> and R. Tucker Abbott. In this case, the neotype was not an actual shell or whole specimen, but a figure from a 1684 book , published 23 years before Linnaeus was born by the Italian scholar Filippo Buonanni. This was the first book that was solely about seashells. In 1953 the Swedish malacologist Nils Hjalmar Odhner searched the Linnaean Collection at Uppsala University and discovered the missing type shell, thereby invalidating <b>Clench</b> and Abbott's neotype designation.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or <b>clench)</b> planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: As bruxism and <b>clenching</b> are {{important}} parafunctional habits that cause disorders in masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and many patients {{are unaware of}} these parafunctions, this study was done to evaluate prevalence of these parafunctional habits and oral related signs. Methods and Materials: In this descriptive, analytic and cross-sectional study, 683 patients came to dental clinics in Isfahan were randomly selected and examined. The examination contained evaluation of history of bruxism and <b>clenching</b> and clinical examination for it including physical examination of masticatory muscles and TMJ, oral exam for finding occlusal wear, shining of amalgam fillings, cheek biting, scalloped tongue borders, tooth mobility, and masticatory muscles' hypertrophy. The data was analyzed and χ 2 was used. Results: The overall prevalence of bruxism and <b>clenching</b> was 14. 6 % and 29. 3 % respectively. 16. 8 % of females and 12. 2 % of males had bruxism. The prevalence of <b>clenching</b> had no statistical difference in two genders. In bruxers,, dental wear (55 %) and pain of masticatory muscles (53 %) were the most prevalent signs. In persons with <b>clenching,</b> dental wear (42 %) and temporomandibular joint sound (37. 5 %) were the most prevalent signs. Conclusion: The prevalence of <b>clenching</b> was more than bruxism. In bruxers, dental wear and pain of masticatory muscles, and in persons with <b>clenching</b> dental wear and temporomandibular joint sound were most prevalent signs. There was a relation between oral signs and bruxism or <b>clenching.</b> By this consideration, more exactly prevalence evaluation of these parafunctional habits were possible.

40|$|Objective: Bruxism, the parafunctional {{habit of}} nocturnal {{grinding}} of the teeth and <b>clenching,</b> {{is associated with}} the onset of joint degeneration. Especially prolonged <b>clenching</b> is suggested to cause functional overloading in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). In this study, the distributions of stresses in the cartilaginous TMJ disc and articular cartilage, were analysed during prolonged <b>clenching.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine if joint degradation due to prolonged <b>clenching</b> can be attributed to changes in stress concentration in the cartilaginous tissues. Design: Finite element model was developed on the basis of magnetic resonance images from a healthy volunteer. Condylar movements recorded during prolonged <b>clenching</b> were used as the loading condition for stress analysis. Results: At the onset of <b>clenching</b> (time = 0 s), the highest von Mises stresses were located in the middle and posterior areas (6. 18 MPa) of the inferior disc surface facing the condylar cartilage. The largest magnitude of the minimum principal stress (− 6. 72 MPa) was found in the condylar cartilage. The stress concentrations were relieved towards the superior disc surface facing the temporal cartilage. On the surfaces of the temporal cartilage, relatively lower stresses were found. After 5 -min <b>clenching,</b> both stress values induced in the TMJ components were reduced to 50 - 80 % of the stress values at the onset of <b>clenching,</b> although the concomitant strains increased slightly during this period. Conclusions: It is suggested that both the condylar and temporal cartilage layers along with the TMJ disc, play an important role in stress distribution and transmission during prolonged <b>clenching</b> due to tissue expansion. Furthermore, our study suggests that a development of stress concentrations in the TMJ during prolonged <b>clenching</b> and risk factors for the initiation of TMJ degeneration could not be confirmed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} unilateral disc displacement (DD) in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) on the stress in the contralateral joint, with a normally-positioned disc, during <b>clenching.</b> Study design A finite element model of the TMJ was constructed based on MRI and 3 D-CT of a single patient with a unilateral DD. A second model with bilateral normally-positioned discs served as a reference. The differences in stress distribution in various TMJ components during <b>clenching</b> were predicted with these models. Results In the unaffected joint of the unilateral DD model, the largest von Mises stress {{at the start of}} <b>clenching</b> was predicted in the inferior surface of the disc and increased by 30 % during <b>clenching.</b> In the connective tissue the largest stress (1. 16 MPa) did not reduce during <b>clenching,</b> in contrast to the (unaffected) joints of the reference model. In the affected joint, the largest stress was predicted in the temporal cartilage throughout <b>clenching.</b> In the surrounding connective tissue, the largest stress (1. 42 MPa) hardly changed during <b>clenching</b> indicating no, or negligible, stress relaxation. Conclusions This suggested that a unilateral DD could affect the stresses in the unaffected (contralateral) joint during <b>clenching,</b> where it may lead to weakening of the tissues that keep the disc {{on the top of the}} condyle. The results may be helpful in counseling worried patients, since they give insight into possible future developments of the disorder...|$|R
40|$|Bruxism is {{suggested}} to be {{a risk factor}} of temporomandibular disorders and a contributing factor to delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Assessments of proprioceptive allodynia—a phenomenon that occurs in muscles with DOMS—could indicate whether bruxism leads to DOMS. This study evaluated whether experimental tooth <b>clenching</b> leads to DOMS. Sixteen healthy females (mean age 32 ± 10 years) participated in three 60 -min sessions with 15 -min follow-ups at 24 and 48 h. Participants were randomly assigned tooth <b>clenching</b> exercises with <b>clenching</b> levels of 10 %, 20 %, or 40 % of maximal voluntary <b>clenching</b> (MVC). A Vibrameter® measured perceived intensity of vibration (PIV) and perceived discomfort (PD), which were assessed on 0 – 50 – 100 numeric rating scales. An electronic algometer measured pressure pain thresholds (PPT). A 0 – 100 -mm visual analogue scale measured pain intensity (VASpain) and fatigue (VASfatigue). Measurements were made on the right masseter muscle. <b>Clenching</b> level had no main effect on PIV and time effects (p < 0. 05) were only observed at 40 min (Dunnet: p < 0. 01). <b>Clenching</b> level and time {{had no effect on}} PD. Only time effects were significant for PPT (p < 0. 01) with reductions at 50 and 60 min compared to baseline (Dunnett: p’s < 0. 05). <b>Clenching</b> level and time had main effects for VASpain and VASfatigue (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} effect of {{low-level}} jaw <b>clenching</b> on temporal summation in healthy volunteers. Design In 18 healthy volunteers, the pain intensities evoked at the masseter muscle and the hand palm by the first and last stimuli in a train of repeated electrical stimuli (0. 3 or 2. 0 Hz) were rated using 0 - 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS), in order to evaluate temporal summation before and after three types of jaw-muscle tasks: low-level jaw <b>clenching,</b> repetitive gum chewing and mandibular rest position. A set of concentric surface electrodes with different diameters (small and large) was used for the electrical stimulation. Results The temporal summation evoked by the large diameter electrode with 2. 0 Hz stimulation decreased significantly both on the masseter and the hand after low-level <b>clenching</b> (P > 0. 03), but did not show any significant change after the other tasks (P > 0. 23). The VAS score of the first stimulation did not show any significant changes after low-level <b>clenching</b> (P > 0. 57). Conclusions Experimental low-level jaw <b>clenching</b> can inhibit pain sensitivity, especially temporal summation. Low-level jaw <b>clenching</b> can modify pain sensitivity, most likely through the central nervous system. The findings suggest that potential harmful low-level jaw <b>clenching</b> or tooth contacting could continue despite painful symptoms, e. g., temporomandibular disorders...|$|R

25|$|Botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis/atrophy by {{inhibition}} of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions. Botox injections {{are used in}} bruxism {{on the theory that}} a dilute solution of the toxin will partially paralyze the muscles and lessen their ability to forcefully <b>clench</b> and grind the jaw, while aiming to retain enough muscular function to enable normal activities such as talking and eating. This treatment typically involves five or six injections into the masseter and temporalis muscles, and less often into the lateral pterygoids (given the possible risk of decreasing the ability to swallow) taking a few minutes per side. The effects may be noticeable by the next day, and they may last for about three months. Occasionally, adverse effects may occur, such as bruising, but this is quite rare. The dose of toxin used depends upon the person, and a higher dose may be needed in people with stronger muscles of mastication. With the temporary and partial muscle paralysis, atrophy of disuse may occur, meaning that the future required dose may be smaller or the length of time the effects last may be increased.|$|E
25|$|The Individual (personal) Tooth-Wear Index was {{developed}} to objectively quantify the degree of tooth wear in an individual, without being affected {{by the number of}} missing teeth. Bruxism is not the only cause of tooth wear. Another possible cause of tooth wear is acid erosion, which may occur in people who drink a lot of acidic liquids such as concentrated fruit juice, or in people who frequently vomit or regurgitate stomach acid, which itself can occur for various reasons. People also demonstrate a normal level of tooth wear, associated with normal function. The presence of tooth wear only indicates that it had occurred {{at some point in the}} past, and does not necessarily indicate that the loss of tooth substance is ongoing. People who <b>clench</b> and perform minimal grinding will also not show much tooth wear. Occlusal splints are usually employed as a treatment for bruxism, but they can also be of diagnostic use, e.g. to observe the presence or absence of wear on the splint after a certain period of wearing it at night.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people with}} bruxism will {{experience}} no pain. The presence or degree of pain {{does not necessarily}} correlate with the severity of grinding or clenching. The pain in the muscles of mastication caused by bruxism can be likened to muscle pain after exercise. The pain may be felt over {{the angle of the}} jaw (masseter) or in the temple (temporalis), and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw. Most (but not all) bruxism includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups; but some bruxers <b>clench</b> and grind front teeth only, which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles. The temporomandibular joints themselves may also become painful, which is usually felt {{just in front of the}} ear, or inside the ear itself. Clicking of the jaw joint may also develop. The forces exerted on the teeth are more than the periodontal ligament is biologically designed to handle, and so inflammation may result. A tooth may become sore to bite on, and further, tooth wear may reduce the insulating width of enamel and dentin that protects the pulp of the tooth and result in hypersensitivity, e.g. to cold stimuli.|$|E

Participants {{were randomly assigned}} tooth-clenching exercises with <b>clenching</b> levels of 10 %, 20 %, or 40 % of maximal voluntary <b>clenching.</b> A Vibrameter applied to the right masseter muscle measured perceived intensity of vibration and perceived discomfort, which were assessed on 0 - 50 - 100 numeric rating scales. An electronic algometer measured pressure pain threshold (PPT). Two 0 - to 100 -mm visual analog scales measured pain intensity (VASpain) and fatigue (VASfatigue). Measurements were made on the right masseter muscle. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to calculate test-retest reliability of VT measurements. Outcome variables were tested with two-way ANOVAs for repeated measures and Dunnett's post-hoc test. RESULTS: Moderate long-term (ICC 0. 59) and good short-term (ICC 0. 92) reliability was found for VT on the masseter muscle. <b>Clenching</b> level had no main effect on perceived intensity of vibration; time effects (P <. 05) were only observed at 40 minutes (Dunnett's test: P <. 01). <b>Clenching</b> level and time {{had no effect on}} perceived discomfort. Only time effects were significant for PPT (P <. 01), with reductions at 50 and 60 minutes compared to baseline (Dunnett's test: P <. 05). <b>Clenching</b> level and time had main effects for VASpain and VASfatigue (P <. 001). Conclusion: Experimental tooth <b>clenching</b> appears to evoke moderate levels of pain and fatigue and short-lasting hyperalgesia to mechanical stimulation, but not proprioceptive allodynia. The absence of proprioceptive allodynia does not necessarily exclude delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) but warrants further studies on the clinical manifestations of DOMS in jaw muscles...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to investigate whether or not <b>clenching</b> and occlusal instability of Angle's Class I malocclusion {{has an effect on}} weight distribution in healthy adult subjects. Twenty adults (fourteen males and six females, ages 2740 mean age 31. 7 years, SD 3. 32) were included in this study. The MatScan (TckScan Inc, Boston, MA) system was used to measure the weight distribution chances of the subjects. Four weight distribution measurements were taken for each subject while: 1. the mandible was in the rest position (no tooth contact) (RES), 2. subject was <b>clenching</b> (maximum intercuspation of the teeth with heavy occlusal forces) (CL), 3. subject was <b>clenching</b> on the right side (with 1 mm disocclusion on the left side) (CLR), 4. subject was <b>clenching</b> on the left side (with 1 mm disocclusion on the right side) (CLL).

Twenty-nine healthy participants (19 men [mean age, 24. 2 ± 1. 6 years]; 10 women [mean age, 24. 0 ± 1. 6 years]) were recruited. The median nerve was examined at the proximal carpal tunnel region in three grip conditions, namely finger relaxation, unclenched fist, and <b>clenched</b> fist. Ultrasound examinations were performed in the neutral wrist position (0 °), at 30 °wrist flexion, and at 30 °wrist extension for both wrists. The grip condition and wrist angle showed significant main effects (p < 0. 01) on {{the changes in the}} MNCSA, D 1, and D 2. Furthermore, significant interactions (p < 0. 01) were found between the grip condition and wrist angle for the MNCSA, D 1, and D 2. In the neutral wrist position (0 °), significant reductions in the MNCSA, D 1, and D 2 were observed when finger relaxation changed to unclenched fist and <b>clenched</b> fist conditions. <b>Clenched</b> fist condition caused the highest deformations in the median nerve measurements (MNCSA, approximately − 25 %; D 1, − 13 %; D 2, − 12 %). The MNCSA was significantly lower at 30 °wrist flexion and 30 °wrist extension than in the neutral wrist position (0 °) at unclenched fist and <b>clenched</b> fist conditions. Notably, <b>clenched</b> fist condition at 30 °wrist flexion showed the highest reduction of the MNCSA (− 29 %). In addition, 30 °wrist flexion resulted in a lower D 1 at <b>clenched</b> fist condition. In contrast, 30 °wrist extension resulted in a lower D 2 at both unclenched fist and <b>clenched</b> fist conditions. Our results suggest that unclenched fist and <b>clenched</b> fist conditions cause reductions in the MNCSA, D 1, and D 2. More importantly, unclenched fist and <b>clenched</b> fist conditions at 30 °wrist flexion and 30 °wrist extension can lead to further deformation of the median nerve...|$|R

One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him <b>clench</b> his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E

With respect to the frictional coefficient between articular surfaces, 3 different values ranging from μ = 0. 001 to μ = 0. 1 were established. Results: At the onset of <b>clenching,</b> large stresses {{were found in the}} central and lateral part of the intermediate zone in the disc, and its stress distribution was not markedly changed during 10 minutes of <b>clenching.</b> In the retrodiscal tissue, stress relaxation occurred during the first 2 minutes of <b>clenching.</b> When the frictional coefficient between articular surfaces increased, the anterior, lateral, and central points in the disc moved further forward. At the end of 10 minutes of <b>clenching,</b> the disc showed a more anterior position as the frictional coefficient increased. Conclusion: This result indicates that increase of the frictional coefficient between the articular surfaces may be a major cause for the onset of the disc displacement...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} whether experimental tooth <b>clenching</b> {{leads to a}} release of algesic substances in the masseter muscle. Methods: Thirty healthy subjects (16 females, 14 males) participated. During two sessions, separated by at least 1 week, intramuscular microdialysis was performed to collect masseter muscle 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and glutamate {{as well as the}} metabolic markers pyruvate and lactate. Two hours after the start of microdialysis, participants were randomized to a 20 -min repetitive experimental tooth-clenching task (50 % of maximal voluntary contraction) or a control session (no <b>clenching).</b> Pain and fatigue were measured throughout. The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical analyses. Results: No alterations were observed in the concentrations of 5 -HT, glutamate, pyruvate, and lactate over time in the <b>clenching</b> or control session, or between sessions at various time points. Pain (P <. 01) and fatigue (P <. 01) increased significantly over time in the <b>clenching</b> session and were significantly higher after <b>clenching</b> than in the control session (P <. 01). Conclusion: Low levels of pain and fatigue developed with this experimental tooth-clenching model, but they were not associated with an altered release of 5 -HT, glutamate, lactate, or pyruvate. More research is required to elucidate the peripheral release of algesic substances in response to tooth <b>clenching...</b>|$|R
