It is, of course, a personal view and the authors have chosen to focus on the field of concentrated <b>contacts</b> <b>operating</b> in elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), where they are tempted to make the kind of predictions required with at least a modicum of confidence. The main thrust of the argument presented is that engineering tribology will develop considerably, and move towards modelling failure of the EHL mechanism rather than simply explaining its successful operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) with rough surfaces {{has become an}} important problem as the ratio of film thickness to surface roughness is decreasing. Recently it has been recognized that the roughness inside an EHL contact might {{be different from the}} roughness outside the contact owing to elastic deformation. As will be explained in this paper, a first step in understanding the deformation of a real rough surface is the detailed knowledge of the amplitude reduction of harmonic features, which forms the topic of this paper. For the line contact problem it is shown that the deformed amplitude of a harmonic feature (waviness) depends on the original amplitude of the feature, its wavelength and the <b>contact</b> <b>operating</b> conditions, including the slide-roll ratio. The amplitude reduction can be completely described by a single dimensionless parameter. For the point contact problem it is shown that the deformed amplitude of isotropic waviness depends on the original amplitude of the feature, its wavelength and the <b>contact</b> <b>operating</b> conditions. Once again, the amplitude reduction can be completely described by a single dimensionless parameter. The presented relations for line and circular contact {{can be used as a}} basis for a modified Λ parameter predicting the relation between the real ratio of film thickness to amplitude inside the EHL contact. A numerical example of the calculation of the deformation is given...|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{infinitely}} variable traction drive transmissions (IVT) {{have demonstrated the}} potential to provide significant fuel economy benefits through the optimisation of the vehicle powertrain, greater emphasis is now being placed on reducing the overall package size. The inevitable increase in power density places increased demands on the variator elements to withstand the heavily loaded rolling contact conditions. Described in this paper are {{the results of an}} experimental fatigue test program undertaken to establish the fatigue life of the variator rolling <b>contacts</b> when <b>operating</b> with the latest traction fluids. The experimental work utilised a number of full scale variator durability test rigs: all tests were conducted with real transmission <b>contact</b> <b>operating</b> conditions up to 220 kW. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the contact surfaces, including SEM, 3 D area surface profile data and metallurgical analysis has been carried out.

40|$|A novel {{configuration}} of contact and friction models is outlined to describe friction in rough line <b>contacts</b> <b>operating</b> under mixed friction. The load distribution between fluid and solid body contacts is iteratively determined {{with a combination}} of the half-space theory and an established elasto-hydrodynamic model. On this basis, boundary friction and fluid friction are determined with a frictional work method and a fluid friction model, respectively. The calculation results based on the developed model are compared with experimental results achieved with rolling bearings, frictionally engaged freewheels as well as tribometers for contact pressures up to 2500 MPa. In wide ranges, experimental results show good compliance with the calculated results...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{experimentally}} {{the significance}} of the effective contact capacitance, i. e. the interfacial capacitance during the current flow, {{for a wide range of}} stationary metal <b>contacts</b> <b>operating</b> under high charge injection rates. The effective capacitance of metallic interfaces depends on the ratio between the apparent contact area (which is optically determined) and the effective contact area (which injects the electronic charges). Silver contacts having series resistance values significantly less than the contact resistance were subjected to a. c. high current densities (up to 500 A/mm 2). The obtained i(t) and v(t) profiles were further analyzed to obtain I-V curves. Due to the phase shift between i(t) & v(t) profiles the I-V curve within a single period of the stimulating current will produce a closed loop. The area of the loop determines the interfacial electrical energy. According to the obtained results the electrical energy storage at a given metal contact, increases at: a) higher ampacity values, b) lower operating temperatures and c) higher clamping forces between the joints (elastic deformation regime) each of the above parameters acting independently. The experimental results were obtained for AgSnO 2 and OFHC <b>contacts</b> <b>operated</b> in a wide temperature range, varying between - 130 °C and + 40 °C. The observed response of the electrical contacts is mainly characterized by the implications of the asperity contact model and dominating charge transport processes across the metallic interfaces. When standard simple equivalent circuits are used to determine contact impedance, the effective capacitance of current carrying metal contacts acquires exceptionally high values...|$|R

This system is then “patterned” into individual one-dimensional channels of various dimensions and spacing between them. Note that the structures under consideration remain planar and do not provide the added advantage of effectively increasing the device width in the vertical direction (as in the case of FinFETs and TriGates). A comparison between both the on- and off-state performance of the various systems when operating in the quantum capacitance limit, i.e., the conduction and valence bands of the structure are under ideal gate control, reveals the desired operation window for low-dimensional nanowire arrays which goes beyond the arguments that typically motivate the introduction of FinFETs and TriGates.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} Elastohydrodynamic lubricated (EHL) contact have become increasingly severe. Consequently, the average film thickness decreased and became comparable to the surface roughness. Under those conditions, the surface features can reduce the minimum film thickness and can thus increase wear. They can also increase the temperature and the pressure fluctuations, which directly affect the component life. In order to describe the roughness geometry inside an EHL contact, the amplitude reduction of harmonic waviness has been studied over the last decade. This theory currently allows a quantitative prediction of the waviness amplitude and includes the influence of wavelength and <b>contact</b> <b>operating</b> conditions. However, the model assumes a Newtonian behavior of the lubricant.
