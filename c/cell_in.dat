5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every <b>cell</b> <b>in</b> the organism's body derives ultimately from a single <b>cell</b> <b>in</b> a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cells</b> <b>in</b> a plant {{differentiate}} {{according to}} their positions and use cell-cell communication to assess these positions. Similarly, single <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> suspension cultures can develop into somatic embryos, and cell-cell communication is thought to control this process. The monoclonal antibody JIM 8 labels an epitope on <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> specific positions in plants. JIM 8 also labels certain <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> carrot embryogenic suspension cultures. We have used JIM 8 and secondary antibodies coupled to paramagnetic beads to label and immunomagnetically sort single <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> a carrot embryogenic suspension culture into pure populations. <b>Cells</b> <b>in</b> the JIM 8 (+) population develop into somatic embryos, whereas <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> the JIM 8 (-) population do not form somatic embryos. However, certain <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> JIM 8 (+) cultures (state B cells) undergo asymmetric divisions, resulting <b>in</b> daughter <b>cells</b> (state C cells) that do not label with JIM 8 and that sort to JIM 8 (-) cultures. State C cells are competent to form somatic embryos, and we show here that a conditioned growth medium from a culture of JIM 8 (+) cells allows state C <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> a JIM 8 (-) culture {{to go on and}} develop into somatic embryos.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} Chinese herbal medicine for warming kidney on proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primary culture. Methods: The normal human mammary epithelial cells were dissociated by digestion with collagenase type Ⅰ. The morphological identification of normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primary culture was determined under inverted phase contrast microscope and transmission electron microscope. The estradiol and progesterone were added to culture medium to induce the proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primary culture, and the different doses of Chinese herbal medicine for warming kidney and tamoxifen were also added into the culture medium. The MTT assay was used to {{evaluate the}} proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primary culture under the different conditions of interventions. Results: The normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primary culture presented typically morphological features of normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> vitro. The proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primary culture was significantly improved by intervention of estradiol and progesterone both with concentration of 1 × 10 － 5 g/L. The high-dose Chinese herbal medicine for warming kidney could obviously promote the proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primary culture, while the proliferation was obviously inhibited by low-dose Chinese herbal medicine for warming kidney. The tamoxifen exerted no effects on the proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primary culture.

40|$|Abstract: The {{incidence}} of mucous and ciliated <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> epithelial linings was examined among odontogenic inflammatory cysts (radicular cysts) and developmental cysts (dentigerous and primordial cysts). Mucous <b>cells</b> were found <b>in</b> 20. 8 % of all cysts examined, while ciliated <b>cells</b> were found <b>in</b> 11. 4 %; however, ciliated cells were always accompanied by mucous cells. The {{incidence of}} mucous <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> radicular cysts and dentigerous cysts {{and that of}} ciliated <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> radicular cysts was higher in the maxilla than in the mandible, while the incidence of mucous <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> primordial cysts and that of ciliated <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> dentigerous cysts and primordial cysts was higher in the mandible than in the maxilla. The present results regarding mucous cells and ciliated <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> the epithelial linings of intraosseous odontogenic cysts indicate a metaplasic origin, but the cause and biological significance of this phenomenon is not known. Mucous <b>cells</b> were present <b>in</b> the surface layer of epithelial linings, and intra-epithelial gland-like structures lined with mucous <b>cells</b> were observed <b>in</b> the hyperplastic regions of epithelial linings of several radicular and dentigerous cysts.
