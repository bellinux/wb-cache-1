50|$|The Bell 206B-1 Kiowa {{has been}} in service with the Army since 1972; its main roles being {{observation}} and rotary flying training.

50|$|In October 1996, the Maximas {{exterior}} was refreshed for 1997, {{with new}} five-spoke alloy wheels, plastic (clear-lens) headlights vs. the previous glass headlights, {{a slightly different}} front and rear fascia with new redesigned tail-lights, the rear-facing part of the trunk was smoothed out to match the tail-lights, re-designed fog-lights and badge designs, and a chrome grille insert for GLEs (body color for SE models) was added. Among interior changes were a different steering wheel and CD player. Front seat-mounted side impact airbags were added as an option for 1998 and 1999 SE and GLE models. There were also structural modifications to improve <b>crash</b> <b>worthiness</b> for the 1997 to 1999 models.

50|$|Z-10 is {{also the}} very first Chinese {{helicopter}} that adopts HOTAS, but a traditional conventional control system had been developed in parallel as a backup, just as the case of cockpit MFDs, and for exactly the same reason why two configurations of flight instrumentation were developed in parallel. The erroneous claim of installing Russian K-36/37 ejection seat in the cockpit of Z-10 proved to be false, and the survival of pilots in emergency landings depends on the <b>crash</b> <b>worthiness</b> of the helicopter. To counterbalance {{the weight of the}} armor protecting the pilots, flight instrumentation panel is the place where composite material is mostly used, {{as in the case of}} the dashboard of automobiles, where plastic material concentrates. One of the greatest challenges was to find the right composite material that is fit to use, while at the same time, also meets the safety standard so that during a fire, the pilots would not be knocked out by the toxic fume released by the burning composite material.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, using {{technology}} {{developed for the}} aerospace and nuclear industries, German car makers started complex computer crash simulation studies, using finite element methods simulating the crash behaviour of individual car body components, component assemblies, and quarter and half cars at the [...] body in white(BIW) stage. These experiments culminated in a joint project by the Forschungsgemeinschaft Automobil-Technik (FAT), a conglomeration of all seven German car makers (Audi, BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Opel (GM), Porsche, and Volkswagen), which tested the applicability of two emerging commercial crash simulation codes. These simulation codes recreated a frontal impact of a full passenger car structure (Haug 1986) and they ran to completion on a computer overnight. Now that turn-around time between two consecutive job-submissions (computer runs) did not exceed one day, engineers {{were able to make}} efficient and progressive improvements of the crash behaviour of the analyzed car body structure. The drive for improved <b>crash</b> <b>worthiness</b> in Europe has accelerated from the 1990s onwards, with the 1997 advent of Euro NCAP, with the involvement of Formula One motor racing safety expertise.|$|E

Sequential approximate optimization is used to deal with both the noisy functional behaviour and the high computational costs. By means of multipoint approximations, a sequence of linear programming problems is generated that can be easily solved. The optimization approach is illustrated for an analytical test problem and an industrial <b>crash</b> <b>worthiness</b> design problem...|$|E

40|$|Magnesium alloys {{have found}} {{increased}} application in {{the automotive industry}} because of their lower densities compared to steels and aluminum alloys, and their higher temperature capabilities and improved <b>crash</b> <b>worthiness</b> compared to polymers. Their application can be increased if their mechanical properties can be improved further. Grain Refining {{is one of the}} effective methods for improving the comprehensive mechanical properties of metals and alloys. However, existing grain refining technologies for Mg alloys are either too expensive or not capable for grain refining of castings using low pressure permanent mold casting process. This thesis reports a method using nano-particles for grain refining. Ultrasonic vibration is used for dispersing SiC nano-particles into molten metal in order to use these particles as nuclei for grain refinement. Experimental results indicate that nano-particles that are dispersed into molten metal using ultrasonic vibration can serve as nuclei for reducing grain size significantly in Mg alloys. ...|$|E
