40|$|Planktic foraminifers are <b>marine</b> protozoans with <b>calcareous</b> <b>Shells</b> and {{chambered}} tests. They {{first appeared}} in the mid-Jurassic and spread since the mid-Cretaceous over all the world’s oceans. Modern planktic foraminifers evolved since the early Tertiary, when the first spinose species occurred. Most species live in the surface to sub-thermocline layer of the open ocean, and in marginal seas like the Mediterranean, Caribbean, South China Sea, and Red Sea. Planktic foraminifers are absent in shallow marginal seas, for example, the North Sea. Planktic foraminifers respond to food, temperature and chemistry of the ambient seawater. Species abundance varies according to seasons, water masses, and water depths. Symbiont-bearing species depend on light and are restricted to the euphotic zone. Planktic foraminifers constitute a minor portion of total Zooplankton, but are major producers of <b>marine</b> <b>calcareous</b> particles (<b>shells)</b> deposited on the ocean floor where they form the so-called foraminiferal ooze. Planktic foraminifers contribute substantially to the fossil record of marine Sediments and are of high ecologic, paleoceanographic, and stratigraphic significance since the mid-Cretaceous. Radiocarbon (14 C) gives an absolute age of shell formation within late Pleistocene and Holocene Sediments. Factors that determine the modern faunal composition are applied to Interpretation of the fossil assemblages, for example, by multiple regression techniques (transfer functions) to yield an estimate on ancient environmental parameters. The chemical composition of the calcareous shell (stable isotopes and trace elements) holds clues to the chemical and physical State of the ambient seawater and is useful in the reconstruction of temperature, chemical State, and biological productivity of the ancient marine environment...|$|R
40|$|The Crystal River site (8 CI 1) in west-central Florida {{is famous}} as the southernmost major {{participant}} in the Hopewell Interaction Sphere, and certainly has the most Hopewellian goods of any Woodland site in Florida. Sharon Goad (1978), among others, proposed that Crystal River secured this position by controlling the production and exchange of <b>marine</b> <b>shell</b> ornaments and cups. I test this hypothesis through the analysis of <b>marine</b> <b>shell</b> recovered from previous excavations, recent surface finds, and shell debris from 58 core samples extracted from the Crystal River mounds, plaza, middens, and surrounding marshland. The analysis reveals an abundance of shell ornaments in burials, but only a limited presence of <b>marine</b> <b>shell</b> used in ornament production around the site, which contradicts Goad 2 ̆ 7 s original hypothesis. Therefore, I propose several alternative explanations for the disproportionate presence of Hopewellian items at Crystal River...|$|R
