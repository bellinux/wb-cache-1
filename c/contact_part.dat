40|$|Sensing {{devices for}} {{intelligent}} tire that can measure friction coefficient {{of a road}} are researched so as to improve the performance of vehicle motion control systems such as ABS (anti-lock braking system). However, previous devices need complicated systems {{and do not have}} enough performance. This study proposes a simple tactile sensor that can measure the friction coefficient between a tire and road surface. The sensor is composed of a cantilever called "whisker" that is fixed to a base. The base is an elastic plate, and two strain gauges are attached to its surface. The whisker is passed through the hole opened to the tread of a tire and the sensor is attached to its inner surface. The whisker is covered by a domed rubber; the tip surface is used as the <b>contact</b> <b>part.</b> When the tire slips on a road and the <b>contact</b> <b>part</b> comes in contact with the surface, the vertical load and frictional force are applied to the <b>contact</b> <b>part.</b> Then, whisker is compressed and bended, so that the base is deformed elastically. The induced strains at the base from such deformation are measured by the abovementioned strain gauges. The study proposes the method determining the value of the vertical load and frictional force that acting on the tire from the measured strains and fabricates the prototype tactile sensor to confirm its availability. © 2012 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|E

Aluminium was used as test material because of its soft hardness easy to be deformed plastically. Its shape is conical with an angle 90 ° in order to investigate the effect of deformation on junction growth. The conical specimen was slid against the transparent Pyrex Glass. An apex deformed under a load and also a process of stretch and growth during sliding have been observed through CCD video Camera. Camera followed on the deformation until a contact point stopped stretching continuously without macro slip. The increased area and variation of the <b>contact</b> <b>part</b> taken through CCD camera have been analysed exactly using image analyzer. As a coefficient of friction corresponding to each point deformed could be obtained, we could estimate the values of normal stress p and shear stress s, accordingly a relation among those two and yield stress Y of the material property.
