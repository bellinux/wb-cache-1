40|$|Hydraulic {{fractures}} {{were initially}} developed {{to be used}} in bedrock to enhance oil recovery. We have modified the procedure for use in the environmental field in shallower subsurface soils to increase the permeability of the soils to liquids, gases, and solids. This has allowed us to significantly enhance in situ methods of soil <b>cleaning</b> (<b>pump</b> and treat, steam injection, solvent extraction) (1) and aerobic bioremediation (2). We are now concentrating on enhancing movement of contaminants between hydraulic fractures and into hydraulic fractures using electrokinetics and destruction of contaminants within the hydraulic fractures. Bioremediation, very specific to the unusual conditions that electrokinetics presents to the subsurface soil is being developed. This work is being done {{as a result of the}} RTDF and in conjunction with researchers at Monsanto, Dupont, General Electric, and DOE. Hydraulic fracturing allows for the insertion of a pancake-shaped lens of sand. The sand lens increases the soil permeability of the area allowing a 10 fold increase in the area of influence of the well allowing for a 10 fold increase in vapor extraction, and a 10 fold increase in liquid addition (such as solubilized nutrients and hydrogen peroxide), which leads to a 100 fold increase in aerobic bioremediation (1). The process also allows for other solid addition to contaminated subsurface soil...|$|E

50|$|In {{the north}} of the castle area, there are Turkish baths with typical vaulted roofs. Just after the entrance, the Kria Vrisi tank is on right hand. It is a large semi-underground water {{reservoir}} with vaults forming four quarters divided by a cross on its roof that are supported by eight shafts. Then Chian press of the time mentions that in 1920 the Mayor of Chios and architect Dim. Tselepidis had set out its <b>cleaning.</b> “The <b>pumping</b> of water was originally performed through a large dome-roofed elevated arcade that was extending all along {{the eastern part of the}} tank and later on through a short cistern in its southeast corner.” Professor Char.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of cleaning factors on the energy consumption of the cleaning process in a CIP system, and the correlation between single components of electricity necessary to perform this process and the cleanliness degree obtained. Studies were carried out in a laboratory cleaning station, wherein a plate heat exchanger contaminated with hot milk was included. The research program was developed according to a 5 -level statistical plan. Based on the results, obtained with Experiment Planner 1. 0, a regression function of energy requirement considering variables such as: cleaning time, temperature and flow rate of the cleaning liquid via the cleaned exchanger has been developed. Describing this relationship, linear and quadratic functions with double interactions were used. Significance level for the analysis was established at α = 0. 05. Correlation analysis between components of the electricity necessary to perform the <b>cleaning</b> process (<b>pump</b> drive and heating of the cleaning agent) and the resulting degree of cleaning of heat exchanger plates was performed...|$|R

5000|$|During {{static test}} firing, the kerosene-based RP-1 fuel left {{hydrocarbon}} deposits and vapors {{in the engine}} post test firing. These {{had to be removed}} from the engine to avoid problems during engine handling and future firing, and the solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) was used to clean the engine's fuel system immediately before and after each test firing. The <b>cleaning</b> procedure involved <b>pumping</b> TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30-35 minutes, depending upon the engine and the severity of the deposits. For some engines, the engine's gas generator and LOX dome were also flushed with TCE prior to test firing. [...] The F-1 rocket engine had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.|$|R
40|$|The metal {{finishing}} industry uses alkaline cleaners and detergents to remove oils and dirt from manufactured parts, often {{before they are}} painted or plated. The use of these cleaners has grown because environmental regulations are phasing out ozone depleting substances and placing restrictions on the use and disposal of many hazardous solvents. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is examining ultrafiltration as a cleaning approach that reclaims the cleaning solutions and minimizes wastes. The ultrafiltration membrane is made from sheets of polymerized organic film. The sheets are rolled onto a supporting frame and installed in a tube. Spent <b>cleaning</b> solution is <b>pumped</b> into a filter chamber and filtered through the membrane that captures oils and dirt and allows water and detergent to pass. The membrane is monitored and when pressure builds from oil and dirt, an automatic system cleans the surface to maintain solution flow and filtration quality. The {{results show that the}} ultrafiltration does not disturb the detergent concentration or alkalinity but removed almost all the oils and dirt leaving the solution in condition to be reused...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the clinical, serological, and environmental {{features of a}} work related inhalational fever associated with exposure to an aerosol generated from a biologically contaminated 130, 000 gallon water pool in a building used for testing scientific equipment. METHOD: Cross sectional survey of all exposed subjects (n = 83) by symptom questionnaire, clinical examination, spirometry, and serology for antibody to Pseudomonads, pool water extract, and endotoxin. In symptomatic patients diffusion capacity was measured, and chest radiology was performed if this was abnormal. Serial peak flow was recorded in those subjects with wheeze. Bacterial and fungal air sampling was performed before and during operation of the water pool pump mechanism. Endotoxin was measured in the trapped waters and in the pumps. Serum cotinine was measured as an objective indicator of smoking. RESULTS: Of the 20 symptomatic subjects, fever was most common in those with the highest exposure (chi 2 42. 7, P 10, 000 colony forming units per cubic metre (cfu/m 3) (predominantly environmental Pseudomonads) when the pumps were operating. High endotoxin concentrations were measured in the waters and oil sumps in the pumps. Low concentrations of antibody to the organisms isolated were detected (apart from two subjects with high antibody) {{but there was no}} relation to exposure or the presence of symptoms and similar antibody was found in the serum samples from a non-exposed population. The fever symptoms settled completely with the simple expedient of changing the water and <b>cleaning</b> the <b>pumps.</b> CONCLUSION: Given the results of our study, the development of inhalational fever in this unique environment and clearly restricted cohort was closely related to the degree of exposure to contaminated aerosol and mainly occurred in the absence of distinct serological abnormality and independent of cigarette smoking...|$|R
40|$|Fouling {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{uncertainties}} associated with the operation and maintenance of plate-and-frame heat exchangers (PHEs) in the steel and process industries. The decision regarding periodic maintenance (i. e., cleaning) to meet the target performance level is generally based on both thermal and economic behavior of the process. In this paper, we present a cost model that includes the risk level and the scatter parameter of random fouling growth models. Two models (namely, power law and exponential fouling growth) are integrated in the model. The non-dimensional cost function of reduced time is examined by considering dimensionless cost parameters, representing additional cost due to a decrease in effectiveness, pumping power cost, anti-foulant cost, <b>cleaning</b> cost, additional <b>pumping</b> power cost of the standby unit during cleaning, and miscellaneous costs. These dimensionless cost elements are examined for a PHE operating in the steel industry. The results are presented in terms of the risk level and scatter parameter for the underlying fouling models. Furthermore, a simplified closed-form solution is also obtained to study the optimal cycle time, which represents the minimum cost of operation and maintenanc...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{ultrasonic}} cleaning baths {{are limited in}} that they cannot clean objects that are too large to fit in the bath, and cannot be taken to objects with complex geometries in order to ?clean in place?. Furthermore the object to be cleaned sits in a ?soup? of contaminated liquid, and whilst cavitation fields {{can be set up}} under test conditions, immersion of the object to be cleaned can significantly degrade the bath?s performance by disrupting the sound field. An alternative technique, which does not use ultrasound is the commercial pressure- or powerwasher, where high speed jets of water and <b>cleaning</b> agent are <b>pumped</b> onto a surface. Although these can ?clean in place?, they pump large volumes of water, and produce significant volumes of contaminated run-off and contaminated aerosol, both of which are hazards for secondary contamination of users and water supplies. The momentum of the water and pump requirements mean they are difficult to scale up. This paper specifies a low volume flow technique for {{ultrasonic cleaning}} in place, benefits being that it operates with low flow rates (1 - 2 litres per minute), and {{there is no need to}} expend energy on heating the water...|$|R

5000|$|The rifle was 4 ft {{long and}} weighed 10 lb, {{about the same}} basic size and weight as other muskets of the time. It fired a [...]46 caliber ball [...] (caliber is contested, {{original}} sources such as Dolleczek [...] describe the caliber as 13mm (.51cal)) {{and it had a}} tubular, gravity-fed magazine with a capacity of 20 balls. This gravity operated design was such that the rifle had to be pointed upwards in order to drop each ball into the breech block. Unlike its contemporary, muzzle-loading muskets, which required the rifleman to stand up to reload with powder and ball, the shooter could reload a ball from the magazine by holding the rifle vertically while lying on his back and operating the ball delivery mechanism. The rifleman then could roll back into position to fire, allowing the rifleman to keep a [...] "low profile". Contemporary regulations of 1788 required that each rifleman, in addition to the rifle itself, be equipped with three compressed air reservoirs (two spare and one attached to the rifle), <b>cleaning</b> stick, hand <b>pump,</b> lead ladle, and 100 lead balls, 1 in the chamber, 19 in the magazine built into the rifle and the remaining 80 in four tin tubes. Equipment not carried attached to the rifle was held in a special leather knapsack. It was also necessary to keep the leather gaskets of the reservoir moist in order to maintain a good seal and prevent leakage.|$|R
