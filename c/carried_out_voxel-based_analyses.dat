40|$|It {{is thought}} that {{semantic}} memory represents taxonomic information differently from thematic information. This study investigated the neural basis for the taxonomic-thematic distinction in a unique way. We gathered picture-naming errors from 86 individuals with poststroke language impairment (aphasia). Error rates were determined separately for taxonomic errors (“pear” in response to apple) and thematic errors (“worm” in response to apple), and their shared variance was regressed out of each measure. With the segmented lesions normalized to a common template, we <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>voxel-based</b> lesion-symptom mapping on each error type separately. We found that taxonomic errors localized to the left anterior temporal lobe and thematic errors localized to the left temporoparietal junction. This {{is an indication that}} the contribution of these regions to semantic memory cleaves along taxonomic-thematic lines. Our findings show that a distinction long recognized in the psychological sciences is grounded in the structure and function of the human brain...|$|R
40|$|Background: Grey {{matter and}} other {{structural}} brain abnormalities are consistently reported in first-onset schizophrenia, but less {{is known about}} the extent of neuroanatomical changes in first-onset affective psychosis. Aims: To determine which brain abnormalities are specific to (a) schizophrenia and (b) affective psychosis. Method: We obtained dual-echo (proton density/T 2 -weighted) MR images and <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>voxel-based</b> analysis on the images of 73 first-episode psychosis patients (schizophrenia= 44, affective psychosis= 29) and 58 healthy controls. Results: Both patients with schizophrenia and patients with affective psychosis had enlarged lateral and third ventricle volumes. Regional cortical grey matter reductions (including bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus, left insula and left fusiform gyrus) were evident in affective psychosis but not in schizophrenia, although patients with schizophrenia displayed decreased hippocampal grey matter and increased striatal grey matter at a more liberal statistical threshold. Conclusions: Both schizophrenia and affective psychosis are associated with volumetric abnormalities at the onset of frank psychosis, with some of these evident in common brain areas. ...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is a single-gene neurodevelopmental disorder, {{in which}} social and {{cognitive}} problems are highly prevalent. Several commonly observed {{central nervous system}} (CNS) abnormalities in NF 1 might underlie these social and cognitive problems. Cerebral volumetric abnormalities {{are among the most}} consistently observed CNS abnormalities in NF 1. This study investigated whether differences were present between NF 1 patients and healthy controls (HC) in volumetric measures of cortical and subcortical brain regions and whether differential associations existed for NF 1 patients and HC between the volumetric measures and parent ratings of social skills, attention problems, social problems, autistic mannerisms, and executive dysfunction. Fifteen NF 1 patients (mean age 12. 9 years, SD 2. 6) and 18 healthy controls (HC, mean age 13. 8 years, SD 3. 6) underwent 3 T MRI scanning. Segmentation of cortical gray and white matter, as well as volumetry of subcortical nuclei, was <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b> <b>Voxel-based</b> morphometry was performed to assess cortical gray matter density. Correlations were calculated, for NF 1 -patients and HC separately, between MRI parameters and scores on selected dimensions of the following behavior rating scales: the Social Skills Rating System, the Child Behavior Checklist, the Social Responsiveness Scale, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning, and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. After correction for age, sex, and intracranial volume, larger volumes of all subcortical regions were found in NF 1 patients compared to controls. Patients further showed decreased gray matter density in midline regions of the frontal and parietal lobes and larger total white matter volume. Significantly more social and attention problems, more autistic mannerisms, and poorer executive functioning were reported for NF 1 patients compared to HC. In NF 1 patients, larger left putamen volume and larger total white matter volume were associated with more social problems and poorer executive functioning, larger right amygdala volume with poorer executive functioning and autistic mannerisms, and smaller precentral gyrus gray matter density was associated with more social problems. In controls, only significant negative correlations were observed: larger volumes (and greater gray matter density) were associated with better outcomes. Widespread volumetric differences between patients and controls were found in cortical and subcortical brain regions. In NF 1 patients but not HC, larger volumes were associated with poorer behavior ratings...|$|R
30|$|Operator {{dependence}} is also {{an important}} consideration for (non-tractographic) ROI analyses of DTI data. For example, Lilja et al. [20] showed that in quantitative DTI analyses of the optical tracts, results differ according to which ROI method (manual or semi-automatic) is applied. Similarly, Foeling et al. [21] reported high operator dependence associated with ROI analyses, after considering the importance of various factors like the ROI definition, atlas-based analyses, effects of motion, registration, and spatial normalisation. In a comparison of voxel-based and manual ROI-based analyses of DTI data in children and young adults, Snook et al. [22] observed good correlation between the FA values derived with automated and manual methods. However, they noted differences between the two methods in sensitivity to age effects in certain brain regions, thought to be due to the effects of spatial normalisation and smoothing in the <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses.</b> Based on the apparent differences in results between the methods they concluded that both manual (ROI-based) and <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> offer complementary insight into neurodevelopment.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether diffusion abnormalities {{can be observed}} in nonsymptomatic family members with a known causative Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase mutation (asymptomatic familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; AFALS +SOD 1) in a family with autosomal dominant familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Materials and Methods: A total of eight AFALS +SOD 1 subjects (aged 17 - 43 years) were age-matched with 13 healthy controls (aged 19 - 45 years) without SOD 1 mutations. DTI was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on a 1. 5 T scanner. The diffusion index maps derived were then normalized spatially for voxel-based analysis, region of interest (ROI) -based analysis was also <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b> Results: Our <b>voxel-based</b> and ROI-based analysis showed that AFALS +SOD 1 subjects have decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) (0. 5401 vs. 0. 5168, P < 0. 05) and increased tensor trace (TT) (2. 5854 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /second vs. 2. 6226 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /second, P < 0. 04) at the posterior limb of the internal capsule compared to the control subjects. Increased radial diffusivity (E (2, 3) / 2) was detected on both sides (right = 0. 5710 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /second vs. 0. 5943 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /second, P < 0. 05; left = 0. 5666 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /second vs. 0. 5872 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /second, P < 0. 05). No significant change in axial diffusivity (E 1) was detected. Conclusion: Abnormal diffusivity was found at the posterior limb of the internal capsule in AFALS +SOD 1 subjects, hitherto unreported. Our results suggest that DTI may detect diffusion abnormalities in AFALS +SOD 1 subjects before symptoms develop. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Sex {{differences}} in the brain appear {{to play an important}} role in the prevalence and progression of various neuropsychiatric disorders, but to date little is known about the cerebral mechanisms underlying these differences. One widely reported finding is that women demonstrate higher cerebral perfusion than men, but the underlying cause of this difference in perfusion is not known. This study investigated the putative role of steroid hormones such as oestradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) as underlying factors influencing cerebral perfusion. We acquired arterial spin labelling perfusion images of 36 healthy adult subjects (16 men, 20 women). Analyses on average whole brain perfusion levels included a multiple regression analysis to test for the relative impact of each hormone on the global perfusion. Additionally, <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> were performed to investigate the sex difference in regional perfusion as well as the correlations between local perfusion and serum oestradiol, testosterone, and DHEAS concentrations. Our results replicated the known sex difference in perfusion, with women showing significantly higher global and regional perfusion. For the global perfusion, DHEAS was the only significant predictor amongst the steroid hormones, showing a strong negative correlation with cerebral perfusion. The <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> revealed modest sex-dependent correlations between local perfusion and testosterone, in addition to a strong modulatory effect of DHEAS in cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions. We conclude that DHEAS in particular may play an important role as an underlying factor driving the difference in cerebral perfusion between men and women...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Epileptic syndromes with {{continuous}} spikes {{and waves}} during sleep (CSWS) represent {{a wide spectrum}} of epileptic conditions associated with cognitive dysfunctions that have the EEG pattern of CSWS as a common feature. Reported are the results of <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> of brain glucose metabolism performed in a group of 18 children with CSWS. METHODS: <b>Voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> of cerebral glucose metabolism were performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). First, each patient was compared with a control group and the influence of age, epileptic activity, and corticosteroid treatment on metabolic abnormalities was studied. Also, disease-related changes in the contribution of a brain area to the level of metabolic activity in another brain area were investigated using pathophysiologic interactions in groups of patients compared with the control group. RESULTS: Individual SPM analyses identified three metabolic patterns: association of hypermetabolic and hypometabolic areas, hypometabolic areas only, and normal pattern. Age and intensity of awake interictal spiking did not significantly differ in patients showing focal hypermetabolism compared with the other ones. Treatment with corticosteroids was associated with absence of focal hypermetabolism. In the group of patients with hypermetabolic areas, analyses of pathophysiologic interactions showed disease-related altered functional connectivity between the parietal and frontal cortices. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral metabolic patterns are heterogeneous among patients with CSWS. This metabolic heterogeneity could be related to the use of corticosteroid treatment before PET. The parietofrontal altered connectivity observed in patients with hypermetabolism is interpreted as a phenomenon of remote inhibition of the frontal lobes induced by highly epileptogenic and hypermetabolic posterior cortex.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{aim was to}} <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> {{the first}} <b>voxel-based</b> morphometry study of grey matter changes in the whole brain in {{schizophrenia}} associated {{with a history of}} seriously and violently offending. Methods Structural cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scans of 26 patients with schizophrenia were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry: 13 of the patients had seriously and violently offended directly as a result of schizophrenia prior to admission, the offences consisting of homicide, attempted murder or wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm; the other 13 patients did not have a history of violence. There was no history of comorbid psychoactive substance misuse disorder in any of the patients. Voxelwise generalized linear modelling was applied to the processed magnetic resonance data using permutation-based non-parametric testing, forming clusters at t > 2. 3 and testing clusters for significance at p Results The two groups of patients were matched with respect to age, gender and duration of illness, but the group with a history of serious violence was on average receiving a higher dose of antipsychotic medication than the group without a history of violence. There were local regions of reduced grey matter volume in the schizophrenia patient group with a history of serious and violent offending, compared with the schizophrenia patient group without such a history. Significant voxels (p Conclusion These regions are important in verbal working memory. The cerebellum may integrate inputs from ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal regions, providing a corrective signal that refines the process of rehearing the contents of the phonological store. A strong connection has been hypothesized between the supramarginal region corresponding to BA 39 / 40 and Broca's area, which may correspond largely to the arcuate fasciculus, with the connectional pattern of the language regions of this model fitting the network of parietotemporal-prefrontal connections that participate in working memory. Therefore our results point to the possibility of an abnormality in neural circuits involved in verbal working memory in this group of patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{connectivity}} {{in default}} mode network (DMN) may be changed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and related risk populations, such as amnestic {{mild cognitive impairment}} (aMCI) patients and APOE ε 4 carriers. Exploring DMN changes and related behavioral performance of APOE ε 4 population might provide valuable evidence for better understanding the development of AD. Subjects were enrolled from a population-based cohort established in a multi-center study in China. Forty-nine cognitive normal individuals were enrolled after standardized cognitive evaluations, MRI examination and APOE genotyping. Regions of interest (ROI) -based functional connectivity analyses were performed, and <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> were used to validate these findings. The correlation between DMN functional connectivity and behavioral performance was further evaluated between APOE ε 4 ε 3 and ε 3 ε 3 carriers. Comparing to ε 3 ε 3 carriers, functional connectivity between left parahippocampal gyrus and right superior frontal cortex (LPHC-R. Sup. F), left parahippocampal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex (ventral) (LPHC-vMPFC) were significantly increased in ε 4 ε 3 carriers, while connectivity between cerebellar tonsils and retrosplenial was decreased. LPHC-R. Sup. F connectivity {{was positively correlated with}} the changes of delay recall from baseline to follow-up (r = 0. 768, p = 0. 009), while LPHC-vMPFC connectivity had a positive correlation with MMSE at baseline (r = 0. 356, p = 0. 018), and a negative correlation with long-delayed recognition at follow-up (r = - 0. 677, p = 0. 031). Significantly increased functional connectivity in vMPFC was confirmed in <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> by taking LPHC as seed region. APOE ε 4 carriers present both increased and decreased functional connectivity in DMN, which is correlated with clinical cognitive performances.
