5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps <b>control</b> <b>body</b> temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E

25|$|Unresearched nonprescription {{products}} or programs {{for weight loss}} are heavily promoted by mail and print advertising and on the internet. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends caution with use of these products, {{since many of the}} claims of safety and effectiveness are unsubstantiated. Individuals with anorexia nervosa and some athletes try to <b>control</b> <b>body</b> weight with laxatives, diet pills or diuretic drugs, although these generally have no impact on body fat. Products that work as a laxative can cause the blood's potassium level to drop, which may cause heart and/or muscle problems. Pyruvate is a popular product that may result in a small amount of weight loss. However, pyruvate, which is found in red apples, cheese, and red wine, has not been thoroughly studied and its weight loss potential has not been scientifically established.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Border Collies are {{registered}} with an Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) affiliated state <b>control</b> <b>body</b> {{or with a}} working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed Border Collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986. Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate's main register allows Border Collies to compete in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering in performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register {{and be able to}} compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility Dog Association of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events.|$|E
25|$|Spanish wine laws {{created the}} Denominación de Origen (DO) system in 1932 and were later revised in 1970. The system shares many {{similarities}} with the hierarchical Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system of France, Portugal's Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) and Italy's Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) system. As of 2009, there were 79 Quality Wine areas across Spain. In addition there is Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOCa or DOQ in Catalan) status for DOs {{that have a}} consistent track record for quality. There are currently two DOCa/DOQ regions: Rioja and Priorat. Each DO has a Consejo Regulador, which acts as a governing <b>control</b> <b>body</b> that enforces the DO regulations and standards involving viticultural and winemaking practices. These regulations govern everything from the types of grapes that are permitted to be planted, the maximum yields that can be harvested, the minimum length of time that the wine must be aged and what type of information is required {{to appear on the}} wine label. Wineries that are seeking to have their wine sold under DO or DOC status must submit their wines to the Consejo Regulador laboratory and tasting panel for testing and evaluation. Wines that have been granted DO/DOC status will feature the regional stamp of the Consejo Regulador on the label.|$|E

500|$|The {{control system}} was reorganised as the Central Review Committee (1928–1933), the Central Party Affairs Committee (1933–1945) and the Central Control Commission (1945–1949). Despite these changes, the duties and {{responsibilities}} of the control bodies remained vague until the amendments to the party constitution at the 7th National Congress in 1945. Although it may {{be argued that the}} 1945 amendments did little to clarify the role of a <b>control</b> <b>body,</b> the party leadership expanded on the theoretical reasons for its existence. It was argued in the party constitution that the control system [...] "was born to serve the needs of a Leninist party for its ideological and organisational consolidation. Such a role was reinforced in the Party's frequent campaigns against its real or perceived enemies {{in and out of the}} party organisation." ...|$|E
500|$|The dual-leadership {{system was}} {{reformed}} during Hu Jintao's term. In {{the aftermath of}} the Shanghai pension scandal, the central party leadership appointed the CDI leaders of the four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing) and suggested a preference for outsiders as CDI leaders in the provinces. Beginning in 2009, localities below the prefecture level began to abolish the practice of a <b>control</b> <b>body</b> in every party-controlled organisation. Before the reforms, every organisation (civil, party or government) with an embedded party committee or party group had a corresponding CDI-style department. The reforms consolidated control and supervision resources (including finances and personnel) {{under the auspices of the}} prefecture- or county-level CDI, which became an [...] "umbrella supervision organ" [...] of all party-controlled bodies in its area of jurisdiction and those below it. The umbrella organisation gave the CDI control of the staffing of party organisations it was tasked with overseeing, allowing more efficient use of CDI resources and reducing potential conflicts of interest arising from CDI staff involvement in the operations of a party committee it was supposed to regulate.|$|E
500|$|The CCDI {{underwent}} {{another round}} of reforms under general secretary Xi Jinping, elected {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the 18th National Congress in 2012. Xi and CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan further institutionalised CCDI independence from the day-to-day operations of the Party, improving its ability to function as a bona fide <b>control</b> <b>body.</b> At the 3rd Plenum of the 18th Central Committee in the fall of 2013, the Party declared that it would [...] "strengthen the 'dual leadership' system [...] by making it more defined, procedure-oriented, and institutionalised." [...] In practice, this signalled the intention of the leadership that CDIs across the country operate separate from the party apparatus, with local CDIs responsible to higher-level CDIs in nearly all substantive respects. Beginning in 2014, CDI chiefs across the country began to shed concurrent executive positions which could create conflicts of interest (for example, a CDI chief also serving as a vice-mayor or department head); CDI personnel also began removing themselves from [...] "leading groups" [...] and similar policy-coordination and consultation groups. These changes were intended to free CDI resources to [...] "solely focus on the work of enforcing discipline".|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} snakes {{have the ability to}} sense infrared (IR) thermal radiation, which allows these reptiles to derive thermal images from the radiant heat emitted by predators or prey at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm. The accuracy of this sense is such that a blind rattlesnake can target its strike to the vulnerable body parts of a prey animal. It was previously thought that the pit organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that they may also be used to <b>control</b> <b>body</b> temperature.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} balance {{disorders}} will require balance training, prescribed by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist. Physiotherapists often administer standardized outcome measures {{as part of}} their assessment in order to gain useful information and data about a patient’s current status. Some standardized balance assessments or outcome measures include {{but are not limited to}} the Functional Reach Test, Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance (CTSIB), Berg Balance Scale and/or Timed Up and Go [...] The data and information collected can further help the physiotherapist develop an intervention program that is specific to the individual assessed. Intervention programs may include training activities that can be used to improve static and dynamic postural <b>control,</b> <b>body</b> alignment, weight distribution, ambulation, fall prevention and sensory function. Although treatment programs exist which seek to aid the brain in adapting to vestibular injuries, it is important to note that it is simply that – an adaptation to the injury. Although the patient’s balance is restored, the balance system injury still exists.|$|E
