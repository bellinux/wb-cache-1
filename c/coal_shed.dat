5|$|In 1975 Spain, a {{young girl}} named Laura is adopted. Years later, adult Laura (Belén Rueda) returns to the closed orphanage, {{accompanied}} by her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their seven-year-old son, Simón (Roger Príncep). She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. Simón claims to have befriended a boy named Tomás, and draws pictures {{of him as a}} child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) visits the house to inquire after Simón, and the audience learn that Laura and Carlos adopted Simón and that he is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. Later that night Laura finds Benigna in the orphanage's <b>coal</b> <b>shed,</b> but Benigna flees the scene. Later, Simón teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to Simón's adoption file. Simón becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and {{that he is going to}} die soon.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the <b>coal</b> <b>shed.</b> Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the main}} depot at the South Framingham junction, Framingham has been {{served by a}} number of {{stations}} inside or just outside its borders. The Agricultural Branch included three of these stations. One, variously known as Montwait, Mt. Wayte, and Lakeview, was located just north of Mt. Wayte Avenue {{at the north end of}} Farm Pond. The station served the Montwait neighborhood as well as the Montwait Camp Ground, a worship camp used by Methodist, Chautaqua, and later Pentecostal groups from the 1870s to the 1910s. The Framingham Centre station – at times known simply as Framingham – located at Maynard Street adjacent to Route 9. It was opened in 1849 when the branch to Framingham Center was completed. A new station was built in 1855 when the branch was realigned and extended. It also served the Framingham & Lowell after that line opened in 1871. A freight house and <b>coal</b> <b>shed</b> were located nearby to the north. Fayville station was located just over the Southborough border in the Fayville village and also served the western reaches of Framingham. The station was placed at Central Street between Route 9 and Route 30 at or after the 1855 opening of the line. The three stations closed with the end of passenger service on the branch in 1937; none of the buildings remain.|$|E

25|$|Holmestrand was {{the main}} depot of HVB and {{included}} a series of operations buildings {{in addition to the}} company's administration. It consisted of a station building, a freight building, an outhouse, a locomotive depot, a wagon shed, a <b>coal</b> <b>shed,</b> a turntable and a guardhouse. The station had five tracks, of which three were spurs. Two of these connected to small turnstiles, which were only large enough to handle freight cars. North of the station the line connected to the Vestfold Line at Holmestrand Station. At Gausen there was en engine shed with two tracks. There were gradually built branch lines to major industrial facilities in town, such as the power company Holmestrand Elektrisitetsverk, Nordisk Aluminium and the fish market.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{connection with}} the Vestfold Line gave operating difficulties for NSB, resulting in the line over Gausen being replaced by a new line over Traneberghaugen, which opened on 21 December 1910. The new double track line cost NOK200,000, financed by a loan provided by Holmestrand Municipality. In 1910 the station handled 11,630 tonnes of freight and 13,705 of milk, most of which was sent to Viking Melk. The station handled 17,205 passengers, of which 800 traveled on second class and the rest on third, giving the station a revenue of NOK134,198. Through {{the next few years}} a new stone platform was built at the station building and the <b>coal</b> <b>shed</b> expanded. The station building was expanded in 1917 and four years later it received a renovation with new interior and electrical lighting. The station had 23,645 passengers, 191 tonnes of express cargo and 4,393 tonnes of regular cargo in 1921.|$|E
50|$|The Grain Growers' Grain Company was {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} provide financial assistance by the AFCEC, and {{it became clear that}} there would be advantages to merging the two companies.

25|$|In 1934 Concrete {{reinforcements}} {{were added}} to the foundation, as well as the center beam being braced, in order to stop some settling of the building which was occurring. Also in 1934, in May, interior plumbing was added and an interior bathroom was added. Two outbuildings were also upgraded or constructed in 1934. An old rabbit house was converted into a <b>coal</b> <b>shed</b> by pouring a concrete floor and reinforcing the walls, and an open garage was constructed behind the friary. In May 1935, an addition was added, acting as a dining room for the friary. Later in 1935, on November 11, the mission cemetery reached capacity. The Friars began to bury their dead in a cemetery which was near the nearby Visitors Center at Canyon de Chelly National Monument. The burials continued at the new site until the Chinle Community Cemetery was opened on March 30, 1946.|$|E

Touro University California is located on the south side of Mare Island. As one of the nation's oldest decommissioned shipyard and naval bases, Mare Island has a rich history and contains many National Historic Landmark buildings, including a 19th-century industrial brick warehouse, the <b>Coal</b> <b>Shed</b> Artists Studios, Officers Mansions, designated historic landscapes Alden Park and Chapel Park, the oldest golf course west of the Mississippi, and Saint Peters Chapel, a nondenominational church built in 1901 that boasts the largest collection of actual Louis Comfort Tiffany stain-glass windows on the west coast. The Island is still home to industrial and creative work spaces, currently the renown art space known as the Coalshed Studios sits on the water front at building 153. Coalshed Brewery is also on the same water front.|$|E
500|$|The former <b>coal</b> <b>shed</b> (now the {{exhibition}} hall) and its attached workshops are {{of red and}} brown brick with coping {{on the walls and}} a shallow slate roof.

500|$|The High Victorian Gothic {{buildings}} are a landmark in Hove, {{and are a}} good example of the 19th-century ethos that [...] "utility definitely does not equal dullness" [...] in industrial buildings. [...] Polychrome brickwork, moulded dressings and facings, decorative gables and elaborate windows characterise all the structures – even the [...] chimney, which stands apart from the main buildings like a campanile. [...] English Heritage has listed the complex for its architectural and historical importance, giving its structures five separate listings: the former boiler house and the chimney are both listed at Grade II* – the second-highest designation – and the former <b>coal</b> <b>shed,</b> the cooling pond and leat and the tall flint and brick wall surrounding the site each have the lower Grade II status.|$|E
500|$|In 1872, {{ownership}} of Goldstone Pumping Station {{and all other}} water facilities in the Brighton area passed to Brighton Corporation, who formed a new committee called the Brighton Water Corporation to operate them. [...] Demand for water continued to rise, so in 1876 the Corporation undertook a major expansion of the pumping station. [...] A second engine room was added, and a separate coal storage shed {{was built in the}} grounds. [...] Workshop facilities were also provided, with a range of machine tools, forge, lathe and planer and a separate Easton and Amos steam engine (apparently left over from The Great Exhibition). [...] The new engine house was equipped with the [...] "Number 2 Engine"—a 250-horsepower Woolf compound unit built by the firm of Easton and Anderson and with a pumping capacity of [...] per hour. [...] It was powered by three more Lancashire boilers. [...] Mayor of Brighton Henry Abbey fired up the engine {{for the first time on}} 26 October 1876; his visit, with members of the Water Corporation committee, was recorded on a plaque in the engine room. [...] A network of arched tunnels were built to link the new <b>coal</b> <b>shed,</b> the workshop and the firing platform of the boiler room.

5000|$|After the Canadian National Railway {{had taken}} over the Grand Trunk Railway, the station {{underwent}} another transformation. During the Depression, the CNR installed a drop ceiling in the main waiting room to save on heating costs. In 1936 it was painted in CNR colours. By the early 1950s, the traditional board and batten had been covered up by insulbrick which was then painted red. By 1959 the steam locomotives had been replaced by diesel locomotives, which led to the removal of the roundhouse, roundtable and <b>coal</b> <b>sheds.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Her {{history was}} peculiar. Mr. Stillwood, when a blase man about town, verging on forty, had first seen her, then a fair-haired, ethereal-looking child, {{in spite of}} her dirt, playing in the gutter. To his lasting self-reproach it was young Gadley himself, {{accompanying}} his employer home from Westminster, who had drawn Mr. Stillwood's attention to the girl by boxing her ears for having, as he passed, slapped his face with a convenient sprat. Stillwood, acting on the impulse of the moment, had taken the child by the hand and dragged her, unwilling, to her father's place of business--a small <b>coal</b> <b>shed</b> in the Horseferry Road. The arrangement he there made amounted practically to the purchase of the child. She was sent abroad to school and the <b>coal</b> <b>shed</b> closed. On her return, ten years later, a big, handsome young woman, he married her, and learned at leisure the truth of the old saying, [...] "what's bred in the bone will come out in the flesh," [...] scrub it and paint it and hide it away under fine clothes as you will.|$|E

The Worcester, Nashua and Rochester Railroad, the successor to the W, came under control of the Boston and Maine Railroad (B) in 1886, followed by the Boston and Lowell Railroad (which by then owned the Stony Brook) in 1887. The Brookline and Pepperell Railroad opened in 1894 and connected to the P in West Groton several miles to the north, with trains run through to Ayer. When the Fitchburg Railroad was acquired by the B in 1900, all lines through Ayer (and most of northern Massachusetts) were under its control.|$|R
50|$|The Grain Growers' Grain Company (GGGC) was a farmers' {{cooperative}} {{founded in}} the prairie provinces of western Canada in 1906.The GGGC met strong resistance from existing grain dealers.
