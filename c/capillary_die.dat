40|$|The {{phenomena}} of wall slip and elastic swell (extrudate swell or die swell) of a tyretread compound during its flow through a <b>capillary</b> <b>die</b> {{and the effect}} of processconditions on them were investigated using a torque driven capillary rheometer. For this purpose, the capillary dies were made up from smooth stainless steel (SKP 316) with constant length and various radii. The behaviour of shear stress and shear rate for com-pound flowing through <b>capillary</b> <b>die</b> were determined with the assumption of Bagley and Rabinowitsch corrections and calculating the slip coefficient (β). The wall shear stress dependency of the wall slip coefficient, β, was also calculated at various temperatures (80, 100, 120 C). The results showed that β increased linearly with wall shear stress and decreased with temperature. So using β at different conditions, the corrected rheologi-cal parameters in various temperatures and <b>capillary</b> <b>die</b> radii were calculated and the flow curves were then plotted. It was also shown that the elastic swell(B) depended on L/D of capillaries and increased by decreasing die diameter because of the increase in the extensional deformation at the die entrance. The elastic swell decreased with the increase of temperature. tyre tread compound; capillary rheometer...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{incorporating}} silica filler derived from rice husk ash (RHA) on the rheological properties of polypropylene was studied using a Bra-bender slit <b>capillary</b> <b>die.</b> The melt shear stress and viscosity increased with filler content. The filler {{was treated with}} a silane-based coupling agent. The silane used was Prosil 2020, a proprietary silane coupling agent containing the peroxide bis(t-butyl peroxy) di-isopropyl benzene. The peroxide induces &beta;-scission of the polypropylene molecular chains reducing the shear stress and viscosity. Hence the filler and the coupling agent (peroxide concentration) have opposing effect on the rheology of the composite’s melt. For high filler content melt, the peroxide effect is more prominent, lowering the overall stress and vis-cosity. At higher shear rate, the effect of filler concentration is more dominant. Mixing torque and melt flow index studies support the rheology measurements by the slit die technique. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|E
