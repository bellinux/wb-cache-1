However, larger animals are taken only sporadically {{due to the}} fact only large males typically attack very large prey and large ungulates and other sizeable wild mammals are only sparsely distributed in this species' range, outside of a few key areas such as the Sundarbans. Off-setting this, goats, water buffalo and wild boar/pigs have been introduced to many of the areas occupied by saltwater crocodiles and returned to feral states to varying degrees and thus can amply support large crocodiles. Any type of domestic livestock, such as chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), sheep (Ovis aries), pigs, horses (Equus ferus caballus) and <b>cattle</b> (<b>Bos</b> <b>primigenius</b> taurus), and domesticated animals/pets may be eaten if given the opportunity. As a seagoing species, the saltwater crocodile also preys on a variety of saltwater bony fish and other marine animals, including sea snakes, sea turtles, sea birds, dugongs (Dugong dugon), rays (including large sawfish), and small sharks. Most witnessed acts of predation on marine animals have occurred in coastal waters or within sight of land, with female sea turtles and their babies caught during mating season when the turtles are closer to shore and bull sharks being the only largish shark with a strong propensity to patrol brackish and fresh waters. However, there is evidence that saltwater crocodiles do hunt while out in the open seas, based upon the remains of pelagic fishes that dwell only miles away from land being found in their stomachs.|$|E

Naturally, they feed on the largest carcasses available, which can include llamas (Lama glama), alpacas (Vicugna pacos), rheas (Rhea ssp.), guanacos (Lama guanicoe), deer and armadillos. Wild individuals could acquire extra carotenoids from vegetal matter contained in carcass viscera and fresh vegetation. However, most inland condors now live largely off of domestic animals, which are now more widespread in South America, such as <b>cattle</b> (<b>Bos</b> <b>primigenius</b> taurus), horses (Equus ferus caballus), donkeys (Equus africanus a sinus), mules, sheep (Ovis aries), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). They also feed on the carcasses of introduced game species such as wild boars (Sus scrofa), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and red deer (Cervus elaphus). For condors who live around the coast, the diet consists mainly of beached carcasses of marine mammals, largely cetaceans. They will also raid the nests of smaller birds to feed on the eggs. Andean condors have been observed to do some hunting of small, live animals, such as rodents, birds and rabbits, which (given their lack of powerful, grasping feet or developed hunting technique) they usually kill by jabbing repeatedly with their bill.|$|E

Two extant and six extinct species are recognised. Of the six extinct species, five went extinct in the Quaternary extinction event.

The fourth, B. priscus (steppe bison), ranged across steppe environments from Western Europe, through Central Asia, East Asia including Japan, and onto North America.

50|$|The {{great horned owl}} is not {{considered}} a globally threatened species by the IUCN. Including the Magellanic species, there are approximately 5.3 million wild horned owls in the Americas. Most mortality in modern times is human-related, caused by owls flying into man-made objects, including buildings, cars, power lines, or barbed wire. In one study, {{the leading cause of}} death for owls was collision with cars, entanglement with wires, flying into buildings and, lastly, electrocution. Among 209 banded nestlings in yet another study, 67% were found dead after independence: 56 were found shot, 41 were trapped, 15 hit by cars, 14 found dead on highways and 14 electrocuted by overhead power lines. Secondary poisoning from pest control efforts is widely reported variously due to anticoagulant rodenticides, strychnine, organophosphates (famphur applied topically to <b>cattle</b> (<b>Bos</b> <b>primigenius</b> taurus)), organochlorines, and PCBs.|$|E
40|$|A complex {{history of}} <b>cattle</b> (<b>Bos</b> taurus) and aurochs (<b>Bos</b> <b>primigenius)</b> : a {{crossbred}} study of molecular genetics and archaeology DNA (mtDNA, D-loop) analyses on archaeological bones of aurochs (<b>Bos</b> <b>primigenius)</b> and <b>cattle</b> (<b>Bos</b> taurus) {{were carried out}} in the ancient-DNA laboratories at the Institute of Biology in Leiden. Two formerly unknown aurochs-haplotypes of a haplogroup P descent were found. Bones of cattle reproduced common haplotypes of T 3. Several conclusions could be drawn regarding DNA-preservation. The keratinous horns from the peat-bog area that, judged by eye, are well preserved appear to have deficient DNA. Finds from the terpen area (former tidal plains), situated in the northernmost part of the Netherlands, constitute excellent preservation conditions for ancient DNA. Nevertheless, in specimens from the terpen area that were excavated {{at the end of the}} nineteenth or in the early parts of the twentieth century, i. e. specimens from museum storehouses or institutional collections, amplifiable DNA was absent. Organic material from these collections could be considered useless for conventional DNA-analyses. Two aurochs’ bones consistently resulted in cattle-mtDNA. In one case, in a sample from a skeleton that was found in 1907 and stood exhibited in a museum up to several decades ago, the concentration of DNA was high enough to rule out a minor contamination. It was presupposed that this result was due to bone glue immersion, a conservation technique commonly used before the Second World War. This presupposition was tested by X-ray fluorescence; XRF appears to be an economic way to check for the possible presence of bone glue as a contaminant in archaeological bones, although verification is required. Besides results from the laboratory, an assessment was made on the climate-induced migration patterns of Late Pleistocene and Holocene aurochs and as to whether this resulted in separate groups that could be identified either by fossil remains or by their haplotypes.
