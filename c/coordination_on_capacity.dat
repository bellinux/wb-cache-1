40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{with the concept}} of Smart Grid, there are a great {{interest}} in integration of renewable energy based distributed generation (DG) units at distribution level. Along with a number of benefits, penetration of DG units in the distribution system imposes some serious challenges; protection requirements turns up {{as one of the most}} critical challenge in DG integration. In this paper the possibility and the potentiality of occurring mis-coordination between protection devices in radial distribution network is studied. The impacts of protection devices <b>coordination</b> <b>on</b> DG <b>capacity</b> are investigated. The penetration level, number, and location of interconnected DGs are used as parameters in order to verify the effects of DG on fault current level. The threshold value of DG capacity is presented while the existing protection scheme for distribution network can be maintained. Detailed simulations using MATLAB and PowerWorld simulators are inserted in order to explain and verify the results...|$|R
40|$|Paradoxically, {{the greater}} the {{national}} security threats, the more important the role of local policy in the United States. In this article we examine homeland security initiatives-particularly the tension between risk and vulnerability-and the governance dilemmas they pose for local communities. In contrast to the usual emphasis <b>on</b> <b>coordination</b> and <b>capacity,</b> we argue for conceptualizing local imperatives attendant to homeland security as collective action problems requiring the construction of local performance regimes. Performance regimes must engage three challenges: (1) to enlist diverse stakeholders around a collective local security goal despite varying perceptions of its immediacy; (2) to persuade participants to sustain their involvement {{in the face of}} competing demands, and (3) to create a durable coalition around performance goals necessary for reducing local vulnerability. Using these analytic categories casts local homeland security issues in strategic terms; it also encourages comparisons of local governance arrangements to respond to risk and vulnerability.

40|$|Abstract: Existing {{literature}} {{have focused}} on the influence of institutional factors on wage determination when explaining the prolonged cross-country differences in unemployment. Although coordination of wage bargaining probably affects entry barriers and competition in product markets as well, research on price determination has typically not considered such factors. In this paper, an imperfect competition model - where the price markup depends <b>on</b> <b>coordination</b> of wage bargaining (and relative prices) - is set up and estimated on a panel of 15 OECD-countries. We derive a hypothesis that coordination has two separate effects on prices, i. e. an indirect effect through its effect on wages and a direct effect on the price markup. The estimates show that when we correct for the effect of <b>coordination</b> <b>on</b> wages, consumer prices may be as much as 21 percent higher in countries like Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Austria and Norway as compared to Canada, the US and the UK, due to the effect of <b>coordination</b> <b>on</b> the price markup. Since coordination probably has a dampening effect on wages, this may explain why many researchers have been unable to find any clear effect of <b>coordination</b> <b>on</b> unemployment in reduced form analysis.

40|$|Objectives: To review {{position}} {{descriptions of}} the community and public health nutrition workforce in order to assess employers' expectations of workforce functions and competency requirements. Design: Qualitative content analysis of job descriptions obtained from a sample of the known community and public health nutrition workforce in Australia and collation of position descriptions advertised in the February 2002 to August 2002 period. Subjects: Community and public health nutritionists in the Australian health system. Main outcome measures: Descriptive qualitative data about employers' expectations of the core functions, competencies and credentials of community and public health nutritionists, as expressed by position descriptions. Results: From a total of 64 position descriptions obtained, 46 were included in the analysis. This sample consisted of 35 existing (occupied) positions and 11 new (advertised) positions. These were distributed across 29 entry-level and 17 advanced-level positions. The most consistent core function domains, as represented by duty statements, were community-based nutrition intervention management (planning, strategy development, implementation and evaluation), capacity building and nutrition-related research and evaluation. Entry-level positions {{were more likely to have}} direct-care or clinical dietetics functions and there was a stronger emphasis <b>on</b> <b>coordination,</b> <b>capacity</b> building and research in the advanced-level positions. Competency expectations, as represented by key selection criteria, focused on experience of intervention management, knowledge of public health nutrition issues and strategies, interpersonal communication skills and the ability to adopt a multidisciplinary working style. Almost all of the entry-level positions required mandatory dietetic qualifications. Conclusions: As a proxy of employers' expectations, analysis of workforce position descriptions by duties (functions) and selection criteria (credentials and [...] . [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|R

The best-practise feature and the iterative design of the OMC correspond to the behavioral rule the best.

By drawing on the Motivation/Ability/Opportunity (MAO) theoretical framework, this research attempts to examine factors to enhance employees? motivation/ability/opportunity to coordinate on improving inter functional coordination. The research also empirically examined the impact of inter functional <b>coordination</b> <b>on</b> marketing performance in terms of adaptiveness, effectiveness, efficiency and creativity of marketing programmes. The research conceptual model was tested with data collected from 274 structured surveys in medium to large Egyptian firms. Regression analysis was employed as a tool for testing the research hypotheses. The research findings suggest that the use of cross functional teams, resource dependency, joint reward systems, management support, positively affect the level of inter functional coordination. The research also showed that some factors, for example employees? interpersonal skills, might hinder coordination between functional units and these issues should be resolved in order to establish an effective inter functional coordination.
