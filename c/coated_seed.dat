Initial lucerne populations were 300 plants m⁻² from <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> and on average 200 ± 11. 2 plants m⁻² from bare seed, ALOSCA® and the peat slurry inoculated seed. The higher population from <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> treatments did not confer a herbage yield advantage. In the establishment year, yield was lowest (0. 59 t DM ha⁻¹) from the last sowing (3 February 2012) and highest from sowing dates (SD) 2 and 3 (2. 6 ± 0. 12 t DM ha⁻¹). Yields were restricted by the low volumetric soil moisture content from November until March. The declining autumn photoperiod (14. 9 to 14. 1 hours) probably increased the partitioning priority of assimilates to the roots, reducing the above ground DM in the later sowing dates. In most cases, DM yields in Year 1 were unaffected by seed inoculant treatments. In Year 2, DM production from the peat slurry treated seed (8. 0 t ha⁻¹) was highest, while <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> crops were lowest (6. 0 t ha⁻¹).

40|$|The use of <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> to {{establish}} crops {{is not a}} novel practice. Seed coatings have been used on small seeded crops to improve the handling ability by making the seed unit larger and heavier. Producers can therefore calibrate their sowing equipment more efficiently and wind will not cause as much drift at sowing. Seed coating can have an added benefit for leguminous crops if the symbiotic inoculant (Rhizobium) {{is added to the}} coating. This saves the producer time and allows peace of mind that inoculation was done by trained professionals. Other than the inoculation, there are some other constituents in the seed coating that can have benefits to the plant. It can, however, be theorized that added nutrients or pesticides will be beneficial to the plants only if these nutrients are deficient in the growth medium or when pests are present. This study evaluated the effect of seed coating on the life stages of germination, emergence and survival, seedling growth and ultimate yield of mature lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) plants, comparing the results with non-coated seed. Two cultivars were used in the evaluation, SA Standard and SuperCuf, to determine if the effects would be similar, or would genetic differences between the cultivar play a significant role. These life stages (germination, emergence and seedling growth) were chosen due to the importance of these stages to the success of establishment. Fast and uniform germination will result in a uniform stand with strong competition against weed infestation. The effect of growth medium on the emergence of seedlings and the interaction between the seed coating and the growth medium was important to determine to identify limitations in the use of seed coating. Changes in the growth of seedlings in terms of some physio-morphological characteristics will assist in identifying parameters influenced by the coating. It was, however, essential to not only do these trials under ideal agricultural conditions, but to identify if similar results would be obtained from stressed conditions, such as salinity, which is a growing concern for crop production areas. The question of whether seed coating will influence the ultimate production of the crop could then be answered. It was found that the method in which germination is tested can have a significant outcome for the results obtained. When the Jacobsen apparatus was compared with the use of petri dishes, using specification according to ISTA, {{it was found that the}} water movement in the Jacobsen apparatus overcomes concentrated nutrient conditions, especially for SuperCuf. Under saline conditions the coated SA Standard seed had higher germination than the non-coated seed, therefore overcoming inhibitions imposed by the salinity. It is clear that the coating influences germination of lucerne and the interaction with the seed environment is significant. It is also clear that the genetic differences between cultivars are significant and results should not be applied across all lucerne cultivars. When the emergence percentage had been determined in different growth media, namely a commercial growth media, a sandy loam soil and silica medium, it was found that the emergence was influenced by the media. Even though the emergence of seedlings are mostly determined by the nutrients in the cotyledons, some growing conditions did cause lower emergence for non-coated SA Standard seeds and was overcome by the use of <b>coated</b> <b>seed.</b> When the growing conditions were manipulated with saline irrigation it was found that coated SuperCuf had a higher emergence % than the non-coated treatments when irrigated with the 750 μS. cm- 1 water. From the data collected from this trial, it can be concluded that, even though the use of seed coating does not always influence the emergence of lucerne seedlings, seed coating does have an influence on the emergence, but it is dependent on the growth medium quality in terms of nutrient composition and salinity. Similar to the germination trial, the genetic influence of the different cultivars was noticeable. To determine the differences caused by seed coating to the physio-morphological characteristics (stem height, leaf area etc.) of lucerne, a pot trial was conducted using different irrigation treatments, municipal water (180 μS. cm- 1), 500 and 750 μS. cm- 1 water, created with NaCl. It was found that the physio-morphological characteristics were highly correlated, i. e. the stem height, leaf area, number of leaves and dry matter production changed in relation to each other. There were, however, differences in this correlation coated and non-coated seed treatments, when irrigated with 500 μS. cm- 1 water. For the seedlings grown from <b>coated</b> <b>seed,</b> the correlation between shoot dry matter yield and the other parameters were low, while the seedlings growth from non-coated seed, leaf area was not correlated with the other parameters. It was concluded that the tolerance mechanism for salinity for plants irrigated with 500 μS. cm- 1 water, caused more differences than the other water treatments. Taking into consideration that coating influences the germination and emergence of lucerne and that the two cultivars react differently to the seed coating, the yields obtained from field trials could then be interpreted if differences were observed. Three field trials were established, namely a trial established in autumn (established in 2009) and second trial established in spring (established in 2010) which were sown at 25 kg. ha- 1, while a third trial established spring (established in 2010) was sown at 5 different sowing densities, namely 80 %, 90 %, 100 %, 110 % and 120 % of recommended sowing density (25 kg. ha- 1). It was found that the pasture stands established with SA Standard, did not show many differences between the coated and non-coated seed treatments and were mostly restricted to the second growing season, where the non-coated seed treatments had significantly higher dry matter yield than the <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> treatments. Stands established with SuperCuf, displayed more variation between the seed treatments and the non-coated seed treatments had higher yields in the first season. It was, however, found that the stands established with coated SuperCuf seed had lower stem: leaf ratio’s, indicating that a better quality fodder can be produced from <b>coated</b> <b>seed.</b> The data from the sowing density trial showed very little difference between the yields of the stands established with coated and non-coated SA Standard seed. Differences were, however, observed between seed treatments at 90 % and 120 % of the recommended sowing density, where the stands established with non-coated seed had higher yields than the stands established with <b>coated</b> <b>seed.</b> It can be concluded that under these trial conditions, the use of <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> had very little influence on the yield of the lucerne stands. The observed differences suggest that the lucerne growth under these few conditions, the stands established from non-coated seed had better yield, but the stands established from <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> had better quality. It is, however, more likely that there will be no differences between the seed treatments. Data from the sowing density trial also led to the conclusion that stands established at 20 % less seed will not result in lower yields if the stand establishment is successful. The similarity between the seed treatments and the sowing densities suggests that the number of plants per area were the same, caused by seedling mortality during the high growth rate in the early growing stage, or the morphological characteristics, such as number of stems per plant and number of leaves per stem, adapted to result in similar yields and quality.

40|$|The {{timing of}} harvest {{is a major}} factor {{affecting}} seed quality in soybean, particularly in Midsouthern USA, when rain during harvest period is not uncommon. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of time of harvest on soybean seed quality (seed composition, germination, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and lignin) in high germinability (HG) breeding lines (50 % exotic) developed under high heat. The hypothesis was that seeds of HG lines possess physiological and genetic traits for a better seed quality at harvest maturity and delayed harvest. A 2 -year field experiment was conducted under irrigated conditions. Results showed that, at harvest maturity, the exotic HG lines had higher seed protein, oleic acid, sugars, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin, but lower seed oil compared with the non-exotic checks (Control), confirming our hypothesis. At 28 days after harvest maturity (delayed harvest), the content of seed protein, oleic acid, sugars, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin were higher in some of the HG lines compared with the checks, indicating a possible involvement of these seed constituents, especially <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin, in maintaining <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> integrity and protecting <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> against physical damage.

Pesticide {{application}} is suspected to {{be a major}} cause of population decline in farmland birds. Seeds coated with fungicides or insecticides constitute a main part of the diet of species such as the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) during sowing seasons. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the effects of <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> ingestion on A. rufa physiology and fitness. We tested an insecticide (imidacloprid) and two fungicides (difenoconazole and thiram). Each experiment consisted in two groups of six pairs of partridges exposed at two doses: a dose corresponding to the recommended for seed coating and another dose twice as high as the recommended one. Seed administration was prolonged for a 10 -day period, after which all animals were transferred to an untreated diet and monitored for an additional 12 days. We took measures on mass, ventilation rate, ornamentation, hematocrit, plasma levels of hormones, vitamins and carotenoids, oxidative stress parameters and immunocompetence, which was analysed by testing primary and secondary cellular responses (PHA test), as well as humoral response (SRBC-agglutination test). High levels of the three tested pesticides had an effect on ornamentation by reducing the percentage of eye ring pigmentation. Low concentrations of imidacloprid and high doses of thiram induced significant weight loss and reduced body condition, although animals recover quickly once the exposure was terminated. These two pesticides also induced oxidative stress; percent of oxidized glutathione was significantly increased by thiram, whereas imidacloprid reduced the retinol concentration in plasma. Imidacloprid and thiram showed also an immunosuppressive effect, impairing the primary cellular immune response.

40|$|It {{is often}} a {{challenge}} to successfully establish perennial pastures which in turn determines the production potential and persistence thereof. Three perennial subtropical grass species commonly cultivated in South Africa are Eragrostis curvula (var. Ermelo), Digitaria eriantha (var. Irene) and Chloris gayana (var. Katambora). The secret of successful planted pastures lies in the execution of good seed- and soil preparation techniques; {{also referred to as}} pre-establishment techniques. These techniques include: seed conditioning by coating seed with either conventional coating or a coating that contains Mycortex, that differs in only adding mycorhizza; adjusting the seeding rates recommended by industry which potentially causes intra-species competition (competition between plants of the same species); planting an annual nurse crop with a perennial species which potentially causes inter-species competition (competition between plants of different species); and controlling seedbed qualities before planting and consolidating the seedbed after planting. There were four experiments conducted (Randomized Block Design) in a controlled environment of a Phytotron. In these experiments the growth factors like water, temperature and soil variance were controlled. It must be kept in mind that conclusions made from data obtained in these experiments cannot be extrapolated to field conditions. Digitaria eriantha and C. gayana were only assessed in two small experiments as uncoated and coated (conventionally- and Mycortex <b>coated)</b> <b>seed.</b> Eragrostis curvula was measured in two experiments as uncoated and conventionally <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> and was also evaluated at different seeding rates, planted with and without an annual nurse crop (Eragrostis tef) and where seedbed consolidation was done after planting. The treatments were replicated between three and six times in the four experiments. It was found that <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> does not significantly improve establishment of any of the test species. Adapting the E. curvula seeding rate had no significant effect because of the favourable environment created. Consolidating the seedbed caused a lower emergence and yield of E. curvula {{as a result of an}} anaerobic condition being generated around the seed. The nurse crop planted with E. curvula caused an increased yield in the first season. Pre-establishment techniques applied as treatments in these controlled experiments were not as effective as hypothesized in a controlled environment. There were three field experiments conducted (Randomized Block Design) in uncontrolled environments. Establishment success of test species were evaluated as a response to variable seeding rate treatments, of uncoated and conventionally coated seed; additionally, D. eriantha and C. gayana Mycortex <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> was also used. The establishment success of the perennial test species was also measured as being influenced by an annual nurse crop (Eragrostis tef). The experiment included the evaluation of establishment success of E. curvula where seedbed quality was controlled through preparation techniques; rotavating before planting and consolidating the seedbed after planting. It was concluded that a higher seeding rate gives a better first season plant density. However, in season two, the optimum plant density was reached for E. curvula and C. gayana and there were no differences between seeding rate treatments. This was as a result of intra-species competition in season one, resulting in plants out-competing one another. The creeping growth characteristics of C. gayana also contributed to this result. One of the main functions of the nurse crop planted with a perennial grass species is to create a more “favourable” competition as opposed to aggressive competition from weeds. The establishment success of perennial species was lower, where nurse crops were included as a result of inter-species competition. From the second season data it can be seen that D. eriantha and C. gayana did not have lower plant densities where a nurse crop was planted, whereas E. curvula still had lower plant densities. All species had a significantly higher pasture density in season one where uncoated seed was used due to a higher number of seed planted at the same seeding rates on a weight basis. Nevertheless, in season two, the E. curvula and C. gayana plant densities showed no significant differences between the seed conditioning treatments. This is attributed to the small seed size and shape of E. curvula and the creeping growth characteristics of C. gayana. Controlling the seedbed quality was found to be unsuccessful for E. curvula. The field experiment results highlight the interactive effects between seed coatings, seeding rates and nurse crop treatments as a function of selected species. The insignificant results obtained from the controlled environment study support the original hypothesis that favourable growing conditions reduce the functions of pre-establishment techniques during the facilitated establishment of sown pasture seed. The significant results from the unfavourable field study support the original hypothesis that adjusting the seeding rates and the use of a nurse crop does have significant effects on the establishment success of the perennial species. It also confirms that conditioning of seed by using coating substances does have significant effects on the establishment success of the perennial species. Controlling the seedbed quality does not have significant effects where pastures are irrigated until establishment.

40|$|Dressing seeds with {{pesticides}} {{to control}} pests {{is a widespread}} practice with important advantages. Recent incidents of bee losses, however, have directed attention to the emission of abraded pesticide-coated seed particles to the environment during sowing. This phenomena of drift of pesticide-dust can lead to pesticide contamination of air, water and other natural resources in crop-growing areas. This review article presents {{the state of the}} art of the phenomenon of dust emission and drift from pesticide seed dressing during sowing and the consequences thereof. To begin, we define pesticide seed treatment and present its pros and cons with focus on dust, dust emission and dust drift from pesticide <b>coated</b> <b>seed.</b> The factors affecting emission of pesticide-dust, (e. g. seed treatment quality, seed drilling technology and environmental conditions) are considered along with its possible effects. The measuring techniques and protocols and models currently in use for calculating the behaviour of dust are reviewed together with their features and limitations. We end by characterizing possible mitigation measures, such as improving the seed quality and the use of modified seed drilling technology, and present an overview of regulations and stewardship activities. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|One {{alternative}} {{in biological}} control of plant pathogenic fungi {{is to provide}} biological agent inoculant in <b>coated</b> <b>seed.</b> This study was to evaluate potential control and viability of two chitinolytic bacteria, Enterobacter sp. BK 15 and Bacillus sp. BK 17 of alginate-chitosan encapsulation coated on chili seed against damping off caused by Fusarium oxysporum. Chili seed beads were stored at refrigerator and room temperature. Examination of the bacteria ability in reducing seedling off was conducted by growing and treating the seed beads with F. oxysporum inoculum. Bacterial cell viability was measured by growing grinded chili bead in minimum salt medium with chitin as sole C source. Re-isolation of infected seedling was done by growing it in potato dextrose agar. The result showed that the bacteria in alginate-chitosan coated seeds reduced chili damping off. Chili seedling height and dry-weight did not differ with those of (-) control, treatment with no bacterial and fungal inoculation and differed with (+) control, treatment of fungal inoculation only. Re-isolation of infected seedling showed similar fungal characterization of inoculated F. oxysporum. Bacterial cell viability decreased significantly in 30 days of storage both at refrigerator and room temperature. However, cell viability stored at refrigerator was higher rather than that of room temperature...|$|E

The use of pesticide-coated seeds {{is a very}} {{widespread}} {{practice that}} could pose a risk on granivorous farmland birds. The neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid is the most used insecticide for seed coating, and constitutes the main risk of poisoning for wildlife species feeding on seeds. Since 2010, we have developed {{an assessment of the}} risk of <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> ingestion on an important game species in Spain, the red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa. In order to characterize the direct effects of ingestion of imidacloprid-treated seeds, we conducted two experiments with different doses and exposure times and recorded survival, body condition, and physiological and reproductive effects. Partridges feeding exclusively on seeds treated with the recommended dose of imidacloprid in the first experiment carried out in spring (10 days of exposure) showed a loss of body weight, altered biochemical parameters, increased oxidative stress and reduced carotenoid-based coloration. In the second one performed in autumn, such exposure was lethal for all partridges (n= 32) after 21 days (with the first casualty recorded the third day of exposure). Imidacloprid exposure also reduced the fertile eggs rate (55...|$|E
40|$|Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), {{the sudden}} loss of most honeybees of the hive {{represents}} a worldwide crisis. The consequent losses in crops productivity and plant pollination constitute a major emergency from both economical and ecol. standpoints. Although on {{the causes of}} CCD several hypothesis have been advanced (parasitic mites, viruses, insecticides, etc.) {{up to the present}} no one has been clearly supported by exptl. results. In several countries the phenomenon is mainly obsd. in the period of corn sowing (spring), that generally occurs using corn seeds coated with specific insecticides. As a consequence, seed-coating neonicotinoid insecticides that are extensively utilized in the corn crops have been blamed for CCD. In this connection, two possible ways of environmental exposure and intoxication of honeybees to neonicotinoid insecticides were studied: 1) the atm. emission of particulate matter contg. the insecticide by the sowing-machine and 2) the translocation of the systemic neonicotinoids from the <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> to guttation drops of young corn plants. Quant. measurements conducted both in lab. and in the field demonstrated that both mechanisms of environmental diffusion of neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with CCD phenomenon: the death manifests within few minutes if bees consume guttation drops or within few hours if they are exposed to particulate matter produced by the sowing machine...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports about}} the sputter {{deposition}} and characterization of ZnO nanomaterials both {{in the form of}} dense and sponge-like thin films. It is shown that high-quality ZnO thin films can be successfully grown on both hard and flexible conductive substrates, with the final aim of proving that their piezoelectric and electrical properties can be successfully exploited in the fabrication of piezoelectric-based nanosensors and nanoactuators. To further state the versatility of ZnO thin films, both spin coated and sputtered dense ZnO thin films were used as seed layers for promoting the growth of well-aligned ZnO nanowires. A strong relationship between the kind of seed layer, i. e., sputtered or spin-coated, and the final NWs morphology, surface chemistry and thus wettability was noticed. In particular NWs grown on sputtered seed layers showed a superhydrophobic behavior, ideal for self-cleaning, anti-fogging or microfluidic devices. In contrast, on spin <b>coated</b> <b>seed</b> layers, highly hydrophilic NWs were obtained, being suitable for further surface functionalization with enhanced adsorption properties towards biological agents or dye for imaging, diagnostic, optical or photovoltaic applications. Finally, the sponge-like morphology is further exploited for the synthesis and characterization of Mn- and Sb- doped, sponge-like ZnO films. The presence of Mn dopant resulted in a high resistance contribution. On the contrary, typical ferroelectric switching phenomena were observed in the Sb-doped ZnO films, showing the presence of hysteretical polarization loop...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms of {{dormancy}} {{of seeds}} from an annual {{population of the}} seagrass Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) in the SW Netherlands were investigated in the laboratory. Both physiological dormancy (a requirement for reduced salinity for germination) and physical dormancy (imposed by the <b>seed</b> <b>coat)</b> existed in recently shed seeds. Physiological seed dormancy was partly released in the seed bank by early winter, but physical dormancy lasted longer. By March seeds germinated quickly in the dark in full-strength seawater without artificial weakening of the <b>seed</b> <b>coat.</b> Viable <b>seeds</b> were released with coats that ranged from green (easily ruptured by the embryo) to brown (not easily ruptured); this variation {{may account for the}} occasional seedlings that appear during winter. No significant effects of temperature or light on germination were detected. A reexamination of the literature suggests that the observed variation in timing of germination in eelgrass populations may be a result of hitherto overlooked aspects of dormancy.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether <b>seed</b> <b>coating</b> with {{microbial}} consortium based on the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices BEG 72, Glomus mossae, and Trichoderma atroviride MUCL 45632 could improve seedling establishment, yield and grain quality (protein content and mineral composition) of wheat (Triticum durum Desf.). As a first step, a laboratory experiment was conducted in a growth chamber to verify the capability of <b>seed</b> <b>coating</b> with endophytic fungi to promote emergence and plant growth of wheat seedlings. Two additional experiments were carried out under open field conditions, to evaluate the effects of coating with beneficial fungi on SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, yield, grain quality and mineral composition of winter wheat. In the growth chamber experiment, 17 days after sowing, the SPAD index, the number of leaves, shoot and root dry biomass of seedlings were significantly higher by 10. 0 %, 28. 6 %, 23. 1 %, and 64. 2 %, in coated as compared to uncoated wheat seeds. In the open field trials, use of the uncoated seeds led to a significant reduction in grain yield by 24. 3 % and 7. 7 %, during the first and second growing season, respectively, compared to the <b>coated</b> <b>seeds.</b> Grain quality of wheat, in particular protein content, K, P, Fe and Zn concentrations were improved by AM fungi and Trichoderma inoculation. Uncoated wheat plants exhibited a strong variation of yield between the two growing cycles (2. 8 and 3. 6 t ha- 1 for 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13, respectively) in comparison to <b>coated</b> <b>seeds</b> (3. 7 and 3. 9 t ha- 1 for 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13, respectively). The increase in grain yield and yield stability with <b>coating</b> <b>seed</b> treatment was associated with an increased level of macro and micronutrient uptake, higher SPAD index and photochemical activity of PSII. The application of <b>coated</b> <b>seeds</b> containing Glomus and Trichoderma can improve the crop performance of wheat in a sustainable way...|$|R
40|$|Although seeds {{have been}} the subject of {{extensive}} studies for many years, their <b>seed</b> <b>coats</b> are just beginning to be examined from the perspective of molecular genetics and control of development. The <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> plays a vital role in the life cycle of plants by controlling the development of the embryo and determining seed dormancy and germination. Within the <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> are a number of unique tissues that undergo differentiation to serve specific functions in the seed. A large number of genes are known to be specifically expressed within the <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> tissues; however, very few of them are understood functionally.
