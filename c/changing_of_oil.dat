Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study the mechanism of the oil film heat transfer and the heat-transfer-reducing method to improve the machine accuracy. This paper describes a comprehensive thermal finite element (FE) simulation modeling method for the hydrostatic machine feed platform to study methods of reducing machine thermal errors. First of all, the generating heat power of viscous hydraulic oil flowing between parallel planes is calculated based on the Bernoulli equation. This calculation is then employed for the simulation load calculations for the closed hydrostatic guideways, which is adopted by the hydrostatic machine feed platform. Especially, in these load calculations, the <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> film thickness (resulted from external loads) and the <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> dynamic viscosity (influenced by its temperature) are taken into account. Based on these loads, thermal FE simulation modeling of the hydrostatic machine feed platform is completed to predict and analyze its thermal characteristics. The reliability of this simulation modeling method is verified by experiments. The studies demonstrate that the hydrostatic machine thermal error degree is determined by the oil film heat transfer scale, and this scale is mainly influenced by the relative oil supply temperature to ambient temperature (quantitative comparison of oil supply temperature and ambient temperature). Furthermore, the reduction of the absolute value of this relative oil supply temperature can reduce the oil film heat transfer scale and improve the machine accuracy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs a biggest {{palm oil}} {{producer}} in the world, Indonesia also produces {{a huge amount}} of oil palm waste, like oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) and oil palm fronds (OPF). Oil palm EFB and OPF contain cellulose that can be converted to bioethanol through pretreatment, saccharification, and fermentation processes. The pretreatment is required to liberate the cellulose from lignocellulosic matrix. One of pretreatment method is chemical pretreatment process using alkaline solution at high pressure and temperature. This paper reports the influence of alkaline pretreatment to chemical composition, cellulose crystallinity index, and morphology of oil palm EFB and OPF. The results show that increasing of alkaline concentration causes decreasing of lignin content from 25. 83 % to 13. 61 % for oil palm EFB and from 30. 92 % to 19. 23 % for OPF at 10 % of NaOH solution. The lowest cellulose crystallinity index of oil palm EFB and OPF are achieved at 10 % and 8 % of NaOH solution, respectively.

40|$|The {{technical}} service system of automobiles and its territory have been existing for almost hundred years since automobiles began to appear. This system {{was developed to}} ensure optimal usage of automobiles, their no-failure operation and longevity. The system envisages also optimal application of automobiles based on costs. Increasing the mileage between servicing, for instance, from 15000 km to 30000 km, {{it is possible to}} save resources for servicing two times. Nevertheless, according to the theory as well as practical provisory research repair costs of automobiles essentially increase, especially for car mileage exceeding five runs between servicing, for instance, 15000 km. The aim of the research is to compare the total sums of expenses for two {{technical service}}s of automobiles and the current repair in two different cases of technical service scenarios if the mileage is 210000 km: ♦ technical servicing is done after every 15000 km; ♦ technical servicing is done after every 30000 km. The object of the research is Dacia XXX (Sondero) with a 1. 4 l gasoline motor and Renault Laguna with a 1. 9 l Diesel motor. In both automobiles original spare parts will be used and they will be serviced at the dealers of these automobiles in Latvia. For the automobile Renault Laguna at more infrequent servicing (after every 30000 km) at the mileage 21000 additionally a turbine has to be replaced, full head repair including the replacement of valves, valve carriers has to be performed, the valves and the head have to be ground, the EGR valve has to be replaced. The basic reasons for these faults are too infrequent technical servicing and <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> Additional costs for elimination of these faults in total comprise 1300 LVL. Savings from the omitted technical services for this automobile will be 7 * 75 = 525 LVL For the automobile Dacia Logan with more infrequent technical servicing at 21000 km mileage additionally the valves have to be changed, the head and the valves have to be ground that costs extra 360 LVL. Savings from the omitted technical services for this automobile will be 7 * 75 = 385 LVL Due to this it can be concluded that for automobiles with Diesel motors it is efficient to use less mileage in between servicing, for instance, 15000 – 20000 km, but for automobiles with gasoline motors without a turbine the mileage in between servicing can be also 30000 km at medium hard operation conditions.

The Secondary fuels that we are using should have the same efficiency or greater efficiency of the engine that uses ordinary fuel. In this project the secondary fuel used is HHO gas. HHO otherwise known as hydroxyl or Browns Gas is the gas produced from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen from electrolysis and allowing the gas to stay in a premixed state for use on-demand without the need for storage. This reduces the exhaust gas emitted during the working of engine, and the temperature of the engine is also reduced which is produced by the burning of ordinary fuels. The HHO gas is injected into the inlet manifold of the combustion chamber through the air filter of the engine. From this design the fuel utility is reduced from 10 % to 30 % which minimizes the carbon deposition in the cylinder thereby increasing the <b>changing</b> period <b>of</b> engine <b>oil,</b> it also improves the efficiency of the engine and the life span.

40|$|Drying oils, and in {{particular}} linseed oil, were the most common binding media employed in painting between XVI and XIX centuries. Artists usually operated some pre-treatments on the oils to obtain binders with modified properties, such as different handling qualities or colour. Oil processing has a key role on the subsequent ageing of and degradation <b>of</b> linseed <b>oil</b> paints. In this thesis a multi-analytical approach was adopted to investigate the drying, polymerization and oxidative degradation <b>of</b> the linseed <b>oil</b> paints. In particular, thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), yielding information on the macromolecular scale, were compared with gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and direct exposure mass spectrometry (DEMS) providing information on the molecular scale. The study was performed on linseed oils and paint reconstructions prepared according to an accurate historical description of the painting techniques of the 19 th century. TGA revealed that during ageing the molecular weight <b>of</b> the <b>oils</b> changes and that higher molecular weight fractions formed. TGA {{proved to be an}} excellent tool to compare the oils and paint reconstructions. This technique is able to highlight the different physical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>oils</b> that were processed using different methods and of paint layers {{on the basis of the}} different processed oil and /or the pigment used. GC/MS and DE-MS were used to characterise the soluble and non-polymeric fraction <b>of</b> the <b>oils</b> and paint reconstructions. GC/MS allowed us to calculate the ratios of palmitic to stearic acid (P/S), and azelaic to palmitic acid (A/P) and to evaluate effects produced by oil pre-treatments and the presence of different pigments. This helps to understand the role of the pre-treatments and of the pigments on the oxidative degradation undergone by siccative oils during ageing. DE-MS enabled the various molecular weight fractions of the samples to be simultaneously studied, and thus helped to highlight the presence of oxidation and hydrolysis reactions, and the formation of carboxylates that occur during ageing and with the <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oil</b> pre-treatments and the pigments. The combination of thermal analysis with molecular techniques such as GC-MS, DEMS and FTIR enabled a model to be developed, for unravelling some crucial issues: 1) 	how oil pre-treatments produce binders with different physical-chemical qualities, and how this can influence the ageing <b>of</b> an <b>oil</b> paint film; 2) 	which is the role of the interaction between oil and pigments in the ageing and degradation process. ...|$|R

Najafi and Amani (2011) studied the asphaltene flocculation inhibition with ultrasonic radiation (45  kHz frequency and 75  W power intensity) and observed that the viscosity <b>of</b> heavy <b>oil</b> decreases due to the disintegration of asphaltene flocs under ultrasonic irradiation. Further, Mohammadreza et al. (2012) studied the effect of ultrasonic irradiation on rheological properties <b>of</b> asphaltenic crude <b>oil</b> and concluded that ultrasonic irradiation increases {{the value of the}} yield stress required for the flow <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> samples. However, {{in order to understand the}} action of ultrasound and its effect on the change in heavy oil viscosity, it is required to study the effect of sonication frequency, solute concentrations, and acoustic power intensity on cavitation yield.|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in energy}} prices have had sizable but differing effects on {{economic}} activity across the United States. The composition of each state's economy largely determines how its employment responds to changes in energy prices. In this article, Stephen Brown and Mine Yucel use simulations based on input-output analysis to assess the long-term consequences <b>of</b> <b>changing</b> <b>oil</b> prices on employment in each state in 1982, 1992, and 2000. Brown and Yucel find that because state economies are becoming more similar in their composition, the variation across states in the response to changing oil prices is narrowing. The authors' {{findings suggest that the}} grounds for regional divisions in the debate over national energy policy have lessened since the early 1980 s {{and will continue to do}} so throughout the remainder of the 1990 s.

40|$|The sailing {{posture of}} AUV in water will be {{affected}} by the density, depth of seawater and so on. The sailing posture of AUV will be changed when crossing the waters of different hydrological environment. For maintaining a good sailing posture of AUV, we designed a variable buoyancy system. The variable buoyancy system can change the buoyancy <b>of</b> AUV by <b>changing</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> the outer <b>oil</b> sac to ensure that AUV can get a good posture. We can get a series of test data by the AMESim simulation of the no-load operation and loading operation of the hydraulic system and the test on the lake. Finally, the test data are compared with simulation data, and it can provide reliable reference for system optimization. The results showed that the flow of variable buoyancy system is affected by the depth of water and the temperature of environment, and variable buoyancy system can steadily operate and satisfy the engineering needs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the <b>changing</b> structure <b>of</b> world <b>oil</b> price system by identifying an additional driver – emerging market factor. We choose China and India {{as a representative of}} emerging markets to examine if the quantity <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> imported by China and India is significant in the existing oil pricing system (Kaufmann et. al. (2004). Our data starts from January 2002 and ends in March 2010 which includes the <b>oil</b> shock <b>of</b> 2007 - 2008. We utilize cointegration and Error-Correction-Model framework developed by Engle-Granger (1987) and Gregory-Hansen (1996) in the analysis. Our results indicate that demand from emerging market has become a significant factor in the world oil pricing system since 2003. This result is significant as it lends empirical support to the widely held conjecture that the <b>oil</b> shock <b>of</b> 2007 - 2008 is a demand-led shock (Hamilton, 2009). Our result also has significant policy implications that go beyond the oil shock. The emerging market factor is there to stay and reflects the changing power between emerging and developed economies in the world economic system as a result of decades of fast economic development in the former. It will certainly influence policy issues related to oil and beyond...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{optimization}} plays a {{vital role}} all over the world. In this work, there are three major faces: The first face is designing HHO generator assembly which is related to mechanical designs and second face is designing a circuit board for Pressure sensor, Temperature sensor, and Oxygen sensor and its overall electrification, plumping works with gas tight protection, and also designing electronics circuits for different sensors to interface with FPGA the third face is designing electrolytic process control using a System on Chip as a Core in VHDL and implementing in FPGA. This Core monitors the HHO generator with sensors and its accessories continuously measuring the vehicle engine performance. From this design the fuel utility is reduced from 15 % to 30 % which minimizes the carbon deposition in the cylinder thereby increasing the <b>changing</b> period <b>of</b> engine <b>oil,</b> it also improves {{the efficiency of the}} engine and the life span. Engine torque also increased and pollution gets reduced to maintaining the green house effect. Overall the cost of the product is very low...|$|R
