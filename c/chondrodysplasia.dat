One control and eight mutant chondrocytic lines expressing different FGFR 3 heterozygous mutations were obtained. FGFR 3 signaling pathways were modified in the mutant lines as revealed by the constitutive activation of the STAT pathway and an increased level of P 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1 protein.

2500|$|A similar form of {{achondroplasia}} {{was found}} in a litter of piglets from a phenotypically normal Danish sow. The dwarfism was inherited dominant in the offspring from this litter. The piglets were born phenotypically normal, but became more and more symptomatic as they reached maturity. This involved a mutation of the protein Collagen, type X, alpha 1, encoded by the COL10A1 gene. [...] In humans a similar mutation (G595E) has been associated with Schmid metaphyseal <b>chondrodysplasia</b> (SMCD), a relatively mild skeletal disorder that is also associated with dwarfism.|$|E

40|$|Diastrophic {{dysplasia}} sulfate transporter (DTDST) is a sulfate/chloride antiporter whose {{function is}} impaired in several human <b>chondrodysplasias.</b> We show that DTDST is upregulated by dexamethasone stimulation of HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells and {{is required for}} fibronectin (FN) extracellular matrix deposition by these cells. DTDST imports sulfate for the modification of glycosaminoglycans. We find that N-sulfation of these chains is important for FN matrix assembly and that sulfation of cell surface proteoglycans is reduced {{in the absence of}} DTDST. Of the candidate HT 1080 cell surface proteoglycans, only loss of syndecan- 2 compromises FN assembly, as shown by syndecan- 2 small interfering RNA knockdown. DTDST is both necessary and sufficient to induce FN matrix assembly in HT 1080 cells. Knockdown of DTDST ablates FN matrix, whereas its overexpression increases assembly without dexamethasone stimulation. These results identify a previously unrecognized regulatory pathway for matrix assembly via modulation of a sulfate transporter and proteoglycan sulfation. These data raise the possibility that FN assembly defects contribute to <b>chondrodysplasias...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cartilage {{diseases}} {{include a}} wide variety of clinical phenotypes from common osteoarthrosis to several different types of <b>chondrodysplasias,</b> i. e. 'disorders of cartilage', of which more than 100 different have been described. Patients frequently suffer from various symptoms affecting their joints and/or the growth of their long bones. The amount of hyaline cartilage at articular surfaces is often diminished and structurally abnormal. The surface of the cartilage may have an irregular appearance with defects extending into the subchondral bone. The major constituents of this hyaline cartilage are collagens and proteoglycans, the most abundant protein being type II collagen. It is a homotrimer of three identical alpha-chains, which are encoded by a single gene on human chromosome 12. The gene for type II collagen therefore became a likely candidate for some forms of <b>chondrodysplasias</b> and cartilage degeneration. Recently, both linkages and exclusions between this gene and various cartilage diseases have been reported {{and a growing number of}} mutations within the gene have also been identified...|$|R

40|$|Ciliary <b>chondrodysplasias</b> {{represent}} a heterogenous group of rare, nearly exclusively autosomal recessively inherited developmental conditions. While the skeletal phenotype, mainly affecting limbs, ribs {{and sometimes the}} craniofacial skeleton, is predominant, extraskeletal disease affecting the kidneys, liver, heart, eyes and other organs and tissues is observed inconsistently. Significant lethality, resulting from cardiorespiratory failure due to thoracic constriction {{as well as from}} renal and hepatic insufficiency or primary cardiac failure due to congenital heart disease, is observed with these conditions. The underlying genetic defects as well as developmental biology and cell biology work undertaken using animal model systems, suggest that these rare conditions result from ciliary malfunction. The skeletal phenotype is believed to result from imbalances in the hedgehog signaling pathway that normally occurs in functional cilia in chondrocytes. Although phenotypes have been historically distinguished based on clinical features into short-rib polydactyly syndrome, Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, Sensenbrenner syndrome (cranioectodermal dysplasia), oral-facial-digital syndrome and Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, recent research suggests that there is significant genetic as well as phenotypic overlap between the conditions.

40|$|The <b>chondrodysplasias</b> are a {{group of}} genetic {{disorders}} resulting from profound defects in cartilage development. Two mild <b>chondrodysplasias,</b> Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia (MED) and Stickler Syndrome (STL), result from reduced synthesis and/or altered structure of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which provide a scaffold for {{the organization of the}} chondrocytes in the endochondral growth plate. Individuals affected with MED exhibit mild short stature, joint pain, and early-onset osteoarthropathy. Dominantly inherited mutations in 5 genes, COMP, MATN 3, COL 9 A 1, COL 9 A 2, and COL 9 A 3, and recessively inherited mutations in SLC 26 A 2 result in a MED phenotype, and the mutations in these genes account for the molecular basis of disease in 80 - 85 % of the cases. Using exome sequencing, I endeavored to identify the molecular basis of the disease in cases with an unknown etiology. I identified two cases with a clinically distinct recessively-inherited form of MED due to mutations in CANT 1, a gene involved in ECM biosynthesis. As this form of MED only accounts for a subset of the uncharacterized cases, there is further locus heterogeneity among patients with this phenotype. Type IX collagen, a heterotrimeric collagenous ECM protein comprised of three procollagen chains, α 1 (IX), α 2 (IX), and α 3 (IX), is involved in the pathogenesis of both MED and STL. STL is characterized by mild short stature, craniofacial defects, sensorineural hearing loss, and myopia, and recessive loss-of-function mutations in all three human type IX procollagen genes have been identified in STL. Previous studies have indicated that the loss of α 1 (IX) results in a functional knockout of type IX collagen, but similar studies have not been conducted for α 2 (IX) and α 3 (IX). Through the generation of a Col 9 a 2 -/- mouse, I determined that the loss of α 2 (IX) also results in total loss of type IX collagen, and the resulting mouse phenocopies STL. Through the study of MED and type IX collagen, I have gained {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of pathogenesis in a subset of <b>chondrodysplasias</b> of the cartilage ECM...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of individuals with}} ciliary <b>chondrodysplasias</b> can shed light on sensitive mechanisms controlling ciliogenesis and cell signalling that are essential to embryonic development and survival. Here we identify TCTEX 1 D 2 mutations causing Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy with partially penetrant inheritance. Loss of TCTEX 1 D 2 impairs retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) in humans and the protist Chlamydomonas, accompanied by destabilization of the retrograde IFT dynein motor. We thus define TCTEX 1 D 2 as an integral component of the evolutionarily conserved retrograde IFT machinery.
