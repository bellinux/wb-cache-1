25|$|At 7:30pm on 29 June 1956, {{riding a}} lighter bike made {{in three days}} to the same design as Coppi's, and using a 7m40 gear (52x15), Anquetil tried again and finally broke his hero's record, riding 46.159km. Coppi was the first {{professional}} to give Anquetil his autograph. When the two next met, Anquetil was also a professional. He went to Italy to meet Coppi and, for reasons never explained, dressed as a simple <b>country</b> <b>boy</b> {{rather than in the}} smart clothes that he normally wore.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{down from}} Whyalla in 1966 to play juniors, {{he began his}} League career in 1967 and was runner-up in both the Magarey Medal and co-winner of North's best and fairest with Don Lindner, as well as {{representing}} South Australia. Robran was instrumental in North Adelaide's premiership sides in 1971 and 1972, {{as well as their}} Australian Championship win over VFL premier, Carlton in 1972. From 1968 to 1973, he was best and fairest at North, but making the move to the VFL never interested him; a quiet <b>country</b> <b>boy,</b> he never aspired to a life in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Goddard {{was born}} in Worcester, Massachusetts, to Nahum Danford Goddard (1859–1928), a farmer, and Fannie Louise Hoyt (1864–1920). Robert was their only child to survive; a younger son, Richard Henry, {{was born with a}} spinal {{deformity}} and died before his first birthday. Goddard's family had roots in New England dating to the late 1600s. With a curiosity about nature, he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. A <b>country</b> <b>boy,</b> he loved the outdoors and became an excellent marksman with a rifle. On Sundays the family attended an Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.|$|E

25|$|Hargreaves is {{well known}} as the gentle-voiced {{presenter}} of the weekly magazine programme Out of Town, first broadcast in 1960 following {{the success of his}} series Gone Fishing the previous year. Broadcast on Friday evenings on Southern Television the programme was also taken up by many of the other ITV regions, usually in a Sunday afternoon slot. He also presented three series (one of them with Ollie Kite) of <b>Country</b> <b>Boy,</b> a networked children's programme in which a boy from the city was introduced to the ways of country. Other programmes he created for local viewers were Farm Progress and a live afternoon series Houseparty. His country TV programmes continued after the demise of Southern with Old Country for Channel 4.|$|E
25|$|Thiệu {{transferred}} to the National Military Academy in Đà Lạt. In 1949, upon graduation, he was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant from the first officer candidates’ course of the Vietnam National Army, which had been created by former Emperor Bảo Đại who had agreed to be the Chief of State of the State of Vietnam {{to fight against the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam of the Việt Minh. Thiệu started as the commander of an infantry platoon fighting against the Việt Minh. He quickly rose up the ranks, and was known as a good strategist, albeit cautious, with an aversion to attacking unless victory appeared almost assured. He was sent to France to train at the Infantry School at Coëtquidan, before returning home to attend the Staff College in Hanoi. Nevertheless, Thiệu was regarded as “very much a <b>country</b> <b>boy,</b> lacking the manners of more sophisticated urban dwellers who aspired to become officers”. By 1954, he was a major and led a battalion that attacked a Việt Minh unit, forcing the communists to withdraw from Phan Rang. At first the Việt Minh retreated into Thiệu’s old family home, confident that he would not attack his own house, but they were mistaken.|$|E

500|$|The CD {{releases}} feature {{four more}} compositions: [...] "Switch Blade", [...] "Backward <b>Country</b> <b>Boy</b> Blues", [...] "REM [...] Blues", and [...] "A Little Max (Parfait)". The last {{of these is}} a Latin-influenced track that features Roach. [...] "Switch Blade" [...] is [...] "a slow blues that showcases Mingus' virtuosity with a looseness that puts feeling before precision. [...] intersperses his basslines with countermelodies and answers to what Duke plays." [...] According to drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, [...] "Backward <b>Country</b> <b>Boy</b> Blues" [...] was probably given its title because part of the usual blues construction is reversed – the V chord precedes the IV chord.|$|E

500|$|In 1902, James Pond, {{a lecture}} circuit manager, hired Davenport as a speaker. [...] Beginning in 1905, Davenport {{traveled}} on the Chatauqua lecture circuit, giving engaging talks, {{during which he}} sketched on stage. [...] He sometimes appeared on the same program as Bryan, though on different days, and like him drew thousands of listeners. [...] In 1906, he traveled to the Middle East to purchase Arabian horses from their native land, and then wrote a book in 1908 about his experiences. [...] Davenport authored an autobiographical book, The Diary of a <b>Country</b> <b>Boy,</b> in 1910, and collections of his cartoons, including The Dollar or the Man and Cartoons by Davenport. Apparently as a joke, Davenport once included The Belle (or sometimes, Bell) of Silverton and Other Oregon Stories in a list of his publications, and reference books for years listed it among his works. A book of that name did not exist, however. Some speculate {{that this was an}} early working title for The <b>Country</b> <b>Boy.</b>|$|E

Timberlake dedicated the song to his grandfather, an avid country music fan. Timberlake announced their collaboration in May 2007, revealing that he was [...] "making [...] grandfather very proud by working with someone like Reba McEntire".|$|E
500|$|Cupid at the Circus is a 1910 American silent short [...] drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a romance with a storyline focused around a <b>country</b> <b>boy</b> who follows a circus parade to the circus grounds and becomes intent on sneaking into the show. He is discovered, but before he can be ejected, a girl asks her father to buy him a ticket of admission. Thankful, the boy gives her his pocket knife. Years later the two meet again and when he sees her using his pocket knife. He proposes and she accepts. Not too much is known for certain about the production of this film, including the writer, director and photographer credits. The circus scenes were done with special arrangement by Barnum & Bailey. The film was released on May 20, 1910 to favorable reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|In 1935, {{the story}} was loosely adapted in the Merrie Melodies short film, <b>Country</b> <b>Boy.</b> It shows some {{modifications}} in relation to Beatrix Potter's original story, most notably the Rabbit family surname is changed to [...] "Cottontail" [...] and Peter having two brothers and a sister rather than 3 sisters. In 1971, Peter Rabbit appeared as a character in the ballet film The Tales of Beatrix Potter. In late 1991, HBO aired an animated musical adaptation of The Tale of Peter Rabbit, narrated by Carol Burnett, {{as part of the}} network's Storybook Musicals series, which was later released to VHS by Family Home Entertainment. In 1992, the tale was adapted to animation again for the BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends, which has since been released on VHS and DVD. In 2006, Peter Rabbit was heavily referenced in a biopic about Beatrix Potter entitled Miss Potter. In December 2012, a new CGI-animated children's TV series titled Peter Rabbit premiered on Nickelodeon, with a full series run beginning in February 2013. Peter was voiced by Colin DePaula throughout Season 1 and recanted by L. Parker Lucas for Season 2 in the US version. In the U.K. version he is voiced by Connor Fitzgerald.|$|E

500|$|On its review, Monthly Film Bulletin {{qualified}} Presley's {{career as}} [...] "one {{of the most}} puzzling and less agreeable aspects of modern popular music". the review declared: [...] "Presley adopts a slurred and husky style of delivery {{and a series of}} grotesque body gestures to impose on his otherwise innocuous material a suggestive meaning.... in 'Loving You' he is allowed more scope and is at times both the cause and sum total of the film's somewhat doubtful entertainment value." [...] Down Beat opened its review mentioning the negative reception of Presley by the press, indicating that while other publications [...] "hotly despised" [...] him, Down Beat was [...] "prepared to dismiss him with a decimating round of punfire". [...] The reviewer, however noted that after watching Loving You, it was [...] "amiss to speak unkindly of [...] ", and that the film was [...] "a rather entertaining pic". It remarked the [...] "resourcefulness" [...] of Lizabeth Scott, the [...] "positive acting ability augmented by a fresh prettiness" [...] of Dolores Hart, and the [...] "witty lines and range of expressions" [...] delivered by Wendell Corey. The review favored Presley, describing his performance as [...] "an overpowering, if touchingly naive, celluloid sexuality." [...] It concluded: [...] "For all his high-voltage on-stage erotica... he plays the sullen <b>country</b> <b>boy</b> convincingly... evincing all the emotion of a well bred head of livestock." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{retirement}} as a player, O'Reilly {{became a}} cricket columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, remaining {{in that position}} until his health declined in 1988. [...] His first engagement was England's tour of Australia in 1946–47, and during this season he began {{a partnership with the}} Daily Express of London, going on to cover several Ashes series for them. O'Reilly's articles for The Sydney Morning Herald were reproduced in its sister publication, The Age of Melbourne. Later, his writing was syndicated to newspapers in India, South Africa and New Zealand. His style was described by Wisden as [...] "muscular, very Australian... flavoured with wit and imagery ('You can smell the gum-leaves off him', he wrote of one <b>country</b> <b>boy</b> just starting with Queensland)." [...] Jack McHarg said that [...] "The clarity, wit and pungency of his writing, together with almost infallible judgment, never deserted him", even as his health began to restrict him. He was a highly respected and forthright pundit, who hated one-day cricket, describing it as [...] "hit and giggle". He condemned the omission of Keith Miller in 1949–50 and said that to call it [...] "a complete surprise would be a cowardly way of describing a botch". Reacting to the selection of the dour batting all rounder Ken Mackay, he wrote [...] "words fail...to express adequately my contempt for this howler". In 1952 he had a falling-out with Lindwall after condemning his protégé for bowling five consecutive bouncers at Everton Weekes in a Test. In comparison with his illustrious contemporary on-field and on paper, [...] "while Sir Donald walked the corridors of cricketing power O'Reilly was the rumbustious backbencher." [...] In 1956, O'Reilly strongly criticised Australian captain Ian Johnson, a Melburnian, for his leadership during the 1956 Ashes tour. The Age took exception to this and asked their sister publication to rein in their pundit. O'Reilly refused to shy away from his opinions and was dropped by the Melbourne publication. In the 1980s, when Bob Simpson became the first coach of Australia, O'Reilly, himself self-taught, spoke out against the creation of such posts. He was a strong critic of the breakaway World Series Cricket, the commercialisation of the sport and the erosion of the social norms that were followed during his playing career.|$|E

In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams's opening themes for Monday Night Football earned him four Emmy Awards. In 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in Tom Sawyer.

2500|$|After the 1968 LP Country Girl, West {{teamed with}} Don Gibson {{for a record}} of duets, Dottie and Don, {{featuring}} the number two hit [...] "Rings of Gold" [...] released in 1969. The album was her last with Atkins, and she followed it in 1970 with two releases, Forever Yours and <b>Country</b> <b>Boy</b> and Country Girl, a collection of pairings with Jimmy Dean. Around the time of Have You Heard Dottie West, released in 1971, she left her husband Bill and, in 1972, married drummer Byron Metcalf, who was 12 years her junior. Due possibly in part to her recent stratospheric success with duets, her solo career suffered between 1969 and 1972. Most of her singles released at the time had failed even to peak in the Top 40, and her album sales were declining.|$|E
