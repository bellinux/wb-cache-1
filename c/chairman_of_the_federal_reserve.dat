5|$|Rapid growth led to {{financial}} turmoil, and inefficiencies {{in the town}} government resulted in {{the adoption of a}} new nonpartisan Council-Manager form of government under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law in a referendum on September 16, 1930. A full-time Town Manager, Paul A. Volcker, Sr. (father of future <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> Paul A. Volcker, Jr.), was appointed to handle Teaneck's day-to-day business affairs.

5|$|American {{economist}} and former <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve,</b> and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E

25|$|The Chicago School of {{economics}} {{is best known}} for its free market advocacy and monetarist ideas.

25|$|Along with these, Reagan reappointed Paul Volcker as <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve,</b> {{as well as}} the {{monetarist}} Alan Greenspan {{to succeed}} him in 1987.

He was the first <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> Bank of New York May 1925 through February 1930.

25|$|The {{causes of}} the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but {{significant}} differences exist. The previous <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve,</b> Ben Bernanke, had extensively studied the Great Depression {{as part of his}} doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{announced}} his agenda in January 2005, but his {{popularity in the}} polls waned and his troubles mounted.

His campaign to add personal savings accounts to the Social Security system and make major revisions in the tax code were postponed. He succeeded in selecting conservatives to head four of the most important agencies, Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State, Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General, John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and Ben Bernanke as <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve.</b>|$|E

25|$|During his {{economics}} {{studies at}} New York University, Greenspan worked under Eugene Banks, {{a managing director}} at the Wall Street investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman, in the firm's equity research department. From 1948 to 1953, Greenspan worked as an analyst at The National Industrial Conference Board (currently known as The Conference Board), a business- and industry-oriented think tank in New York City. From 1955 to 1987, when he was appointed <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve,</b> Greenspan was chairman and president of Townsend-Greenspan & Co., Inc., an economics consulting firm in New York City, a 32-year stint interrupted only from 1974 to 1977 by his service as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Gerald Ford.|$|E
25|$|Former US <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> Bank Alan Greenspan gives most {{credit to}} German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard for Europe's {{economic}} recovery. Greenspan {{writes in his}} memoir The Age of Turbulence that Erhard's economic policies {{were the most important}} aspect of postwar Western Europe recovery, even outweighing the contributions of the Marshall Plan. He states that it was Erhard's reductions in economic regulations that permitted Germany's miraculous recovery, and that these policies also contributed to the recoveries of many other European countries. Its recovery is attributed to traditional economic stimuli, such as increases in investment, fueled by a high savings rate and low taxes. Japan saw a large infusion of US investment during the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|Greenspan entered {{government}} in the 70s, and became <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve.</b> In 1992, he visited the newly elected Bill Clinton. He persuaded him to let the markets grow, cut taxes, and to let the markets stabilise themselves {{with the help of}} computer technology, to create the New economy. This involved using computer models to predict risks and hedge against them, in accordance with the Californian Ideology. However, by 1996, the production figures had failed to increase, but profits were nevertheless rising, and Greenspan suggested that it wasn't working. After political attacks from all sides, Greenspan changed his mind and decided that perhaps the New Economy was real after all, but that it couldn't be measured using normal economic measures, and so the apparent boom continued.|$|E
