40|$|This report {{examines}} {{variations in}} road injury <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> in South Australia by {{time of year}} using injury and fatal crash data from 1982 - 2013. It was {{found that there was}} a statistically significant variation in injury <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> by month after accounting for different month lengths. January was found to have 11. 7 % fewer injury crashes per day than an average month and March was found to have 8. 6 % more. This pattern seems to have been in place over the entire time period examined. The period from 25 December to 5 January and public holidays were found to have very low injury crash rates and there were some indications that school holidays were associated with a lower injury crash rate. Rural areas of South Australia appeared to follow a different pattern with more injury crashes in the warmer months and fewer in the colder months. The limited available exposure measures do suggest that there is less vehicle travel in January consistent with January’s low daily injury crash rate. The increasing number of large public events in March in recent years may be having an underlying effect on the <b>number</b> of injury <b>crashes</b> in March. However, there is no consistent observable evidence for this in the <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> so the size of any effect is probably not large. The proportional variation in fatal <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> from month to month is very large. Even with 32 years of fatal crash data, no statistically significant variation by month was found.

30|$|A {{prominent}} policy, {{which has}} been proposed in many European municipalities {{over the last years}} is the promotion of cycling to decrease pollution and to increase public health. One important part of the assessment of this policy is the estimation of the induced change in bicycle <b>crash</b> <b>numbers.</b> Several recent works supported the ideas by reporting that cycling becomes safer if the number of cyclists increases, i.e., {{there seems to be a}} safety-in-numbers effect (SiN).|$|R
40|$|Marked on-road cycle lanes are a {{relatively}} inexpensive means of providing for cycling; however, {{their use in}} New Zealand has been questioned {{both in terms of}} their safety and their effectiveness in attracting more people to take up cycling. While both questions have been previously researched locally, the findings have been rather inconclusive. A recent Engineering Masters research project investigated the relative effects on cycle count and <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> of installing a series of cycle lanes. Twelve routes installed in Christchurch during the mid- 2000 s were analysed, together with some control sites. Cycle count data from a series of route locations and dates were used to establish cycling trends before and after installation. These were also compared against cycle <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> along these routes during the same periods. The results generally show no consistent "step" increase in cycling numbers immediately following installation of cycle lanes, with some increasing and decreasing. Changes on cycling growth rates were more positive, although it is clear that other wider trends such as motor traffic growth are having an effect. Taking into account the relative changes in volumes and controls, the study also found notable reductions in cycle crashes following installation, typically with a 23 % average reduction in crash rates...|$|R

30|$|Daily {{aggregation}} As for {{the annual}} and the monthly aggregation the estimate on the daily <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> were not improved by a non-linear fit, i.e., using {{a model of the}} form (2). Independent {{of the size of the}} memory τ the ML estimation gave η≈ 0, which did effectively set the term Eτ,η constant equal to one and signifies that the relation between volumes and crashes was linear on average. Since Eτ,η contains the memory terms the ML estimation for the negative binomial model gave the same values α≈ 0.295 and r≈ 4.77 for all choices of τ.|$|R
40|$|In South Australia, a {{blackspot}} {{is considered}} to be somewhere with at least three casualty crashes reported in five years; similar criteria are used in other developed jurisdictions. Such a small <b>number</b> of <b>crashes</b> is inherently highly variable, and the selection of sites by this means will give different results from one time period to another. Blackspot programs have produced positive safety benefits over many years and are consequently believed to be highly cost-effective. This paper, which is part one in a two part series, describes the approach to blackspot and investigates whether even better results are likely to be obtained by a procedure that is less dependent on the vagaries of <b>crash</b> <b>numbers.</b> T.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the number and types of crashes at locations in Adelaide where red light cameras have been installed. While some indications are that the cameras installed in 1988 did {{reduce the incidence of}} some types of road crashes, the cameras installed in 2001 appear to have had no effect on <b>crash</b> <b>numbers.</b> It is suggested that inadequate driver knowledge of the 2001 camera locations may be the primary reason for this. Initial results from combined red light and speed cameras were examined and their potential benefit considered. Note that this report was substantially completed in 2003 before the use of dual purpose red light and speed cameras for speed enforcement was started. Literature later than 2003 has also not been considered. C. N. Kloeden, S. A. Edwards, A. J. McLea...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{literature on the}} effectiveness (or otherwise) of promoting road safety via mass media advertising is selectively reviewed. The overall picture from this is inconclusive: effects of substantial size have been rare, but effects of small size cannot be ruled out. It is then argued that attempts to use crash data to establish or disprove the cost-effectiveness of campaigns are, indeed, doomed to failure: the random variability in <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> is too great (and even low effectiveness may be sufficient as campaigns are very cheap per person reached). It is suggested that evaluation {{may need to be}} based on before and after comparison of behaviours or variables that can be objectively observed and are closely linked to safety – and in order to substantiate the behaviour-safety link, credible theories are needed.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to explore ways to assess the safety performance of (predominantly two-lane) rural highways in New Zealand (NZ) and in particular identify driver/road/environmental factors affecting crashes on rural curves. Following a wide-ranging literature review, the Interactive Highway Safety Design Model (IHSDM) was identified as worthy of further investigation for adaptation to use in NZ. To help with this investigation, a comprehensive database was developed of road, traffic, crash and environmental data for all NZ State Highways, divided into variable-length road elements. A number of tasks were identified and undertaken to adapt IHSDM for general use here, including calibrating the Crash Prediction Module (CPM), developing a Design Policy file based on local agency standards, and developing an importing routine for NZ highway geometry and crash data. To assess the effectiveness of IHSDM for predicting the relative safety of rural road alignments, {{a series of tests}} were undertaken to confirm its appropriateness for use in NZ. These included “before and after” design consistency checks of a bridge replacement, a “before and after” crash comparison of a major highway realignment, and checks of actual versus predicted <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> along longer lengths of highway in varying terrain. These initial investigations have shown that IHSDM is a promising tool for safety and operational assessment of highway alignments (both existing and proposed) in NZ. Incorporating crash history data generally improves IHSDM’s accuracy in <b>crash</b> <b>numbers,</b> and appears to provide a better level of “local calibration” than by using sub-national (e. g. regional or terrain-specific) calibration parameters. Reported fatal/injury crash data generally provide more robust and precise measures than non-injury crashes. Correct specification of the extreme attributes of sub-standard elements (e. g. minimum radius, maximum roadside hazard) appears to be crucial to getting suitably accurate crash estimates on existing alignments. However, IHSDM’s current lack of consideration for bridges and inconsistent adjacent elements are notable omissions that limit the ability of the CPM to assess sub-standard existing routes with as much accuracy as well-designed newer alignments...|$|R

30|$|Empirical {{findings}} for Berlin We have tested the proposed memory model (2) on data sets {{for the city}} of Berlin leading to different results on different levels of temporal aggregation, see Section 3.3. For a more thorough evaluation of the model’s usefulness it would certainly be helpful to apply it to different data, where a SiN-effect was suspected, since no clear indication was obtained for Berlin that delayed correlations were present between volumes and <b>crash</b> <b>numbers.</b> Despite of the rising numbers in last decades, Berlin has a long-standing tradition of bicycle traffic and for Berlin’s drivers an encounter with a bicyclist is no rare event. Based on the proposed mechanism of developing correct expectations towards cyclist behaviour it may be expected that the largest SiN effect and thus the clearest statistical evidence could be found in areas where the amount of cyclists is very low {{at some point in time}} and increases in relation to this former state rather than in absolute numbers.|$|R
40|$|On October 20 – 21, 2009, two {{road safety}} audits were {{conducted}} in Lee County, Iowa: one for a 6 mile section of County Road X- 23 from IA 2 to the south corporate limits of West Point and one for a 9. 7 mile section of County Road W- 62 from US 218 to IA 27. Both roads have high severe crash histories for the years of 2001 through 2008. Using these crash data, the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) has identified County Road X- 23 as being in the top 5 percent of similar roads for run-off-road crashes. The Iowa DOT lists County Road W- 62 as a high-risk rural road that has above-average <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> and is eligible for funding under the Federal High-Risk Rural Road Program. Considering these issues, the Lee County Engineer and Iowa DOT requested that road safety audits be conducted to address the safety concerns and to suggest possible mitigation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Decades of {{research}} {{have failed to}} establish whether or not mass media advertising can reduce road crashes. The probable {{reason is that the}} random variability in <b>crash</b> <b>numbers</b> is too great (and, campaigns being very cheap per person reached, even low effectiveness may be enough to be worthwhile). Three alternatives to before-after comparison of crashes as the method of determining effectiveness of an intervention are discussed. These are real-world experiments of high methodological quality, laboratory experiments of the social psychological type, and the measurement of safety-related behaviors. The third of these, before-after comparison of behaviors or variables that can be objectively observed and are closely linked to safety, is suggested as the most promising. However, the behaviors that might plausibly be used as proxies for crashes are quite few in number, and there is an urgent research need to find more of them, together with theory implying that a change in the behavior does indeed mean a change in safety.

40|$|Road bends {{are known}} to cause traffic crashes, but the {{hypothesis}} {{in this study was}} that small geographical areas with many road bends have less, not more, road casualties than comparable areas with fewer bends. Data on road crashes involving fatal, serious and slight casualties in 571 wards in Eastern England were examined against four measures of average road curvature (mean angle per bend, cumulative angle per km, number of bends per km and ratio of road distance to straight distance) using regression analysis. Taking account of other risk factors, measures of average road curvature in wards were negatively associated with <b>crash</b> <b>numbers,</b> especially for fatal crashes. The strongest associations were with the cumulative angle turned per km. The results add to evidence suggesting that road casualty risk effects vary with geographical scale. Although individual road bends might be hazardous, frequent bends have a protective effect over a few kilometres of road...|$|R

40|$|A {{blackspot}} {{refers to}} a single site that has an unusually large number of accidents [...] - whether for obvious reasons such as {{a great deal of}} traffic, or for non-obvious reasons that become apparent only after careful investigation. Part 1 of this paper (TEC, October 2011) drew attention to the small <b>number</b> of <b>crashes</b> that (in developed countries) typically constitute the criterion for identifying a blackspot. At that <b>number</b> of <b>crashes,</b> the actual <b>number</b> inevitably varies a great deal from year to year (or from one three-year period to another), and the selection of sites by this means is consequently unreliable. This paper will first examine the busiest blackspots: how much might it be worth spending at busy blackspots, and how severe are accidents at busy blackspots. Then some possible ways in which the blackspot remediation process might be improved will be discussed. (The empirical Bayes method. Randomised trials. Should the evidence from the crash record and from the site inspection be more independent? Crash debris and traffic conflicts. Administrative processes. Geographical databases as a source of characteristics of crash sites.) Finally, there will be concluding discussion. A greater emphasis on expert judgment, based largely on site inspection, might be an improvement. Blackspot programs are believed to be highly cost-effective, and this is not brought into issue: the question concerns whether even better results are likely to be obtained by a procedure that is less dependent on the vagaries of <b>crash</b> <b>numbers.</b> T.
