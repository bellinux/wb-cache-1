25|$|The {{manufacturing}} plant {{to build the}} new car was built in Dunmurry, Northern Ireland, with substantial financial incentives from the Northern Ireland Development Agency of around £100 million. Renault was contracted to build the factory, which employed over 2000 workers at its peak production. The engine was made by Renault, while Lotus designed the <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> details. The Dunmurry factory would eventually turn out around 9,000 cars over 21 months of operation.|$|E
500|$|This {{allowed for}} {{improvements}} to the <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> of Razer including new titanium outriggers, and [...] thick armour panels versus [...] before. The most noticeable alteration to this version of Razer was a redesigned front scoop. This enclosed the front wheels to reduce side-on impact damage, and greatly decreased the robot's ground clearance to reduce its vulnerability to being flipped, whilst also {{making it easier to}} get underneath opponents to crush them.|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, the GTX {{class of}} the IMSA GT Championship became obsolete, and was {{replaced}} by the IMSA GTP category. As a result, Ford needed a new car, as their Ford Mustang GTX was no longer eligible for competition. Bob Riley was selected to design the car, which, somewhat unusually, was front engined; it used a 2.1-litre turbocharged variant of the Ford Cosworth BDA straight-four engine, capable of producing around [...] Roush Performance and Protofab built the <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork,</b> which consisted of carbon fibre panels bonded to a carbon fibre and Nomex composite monocoque chassis, which was reinforced with Kevlar in key areas. The car's aerodynamics were configured to maximize the downforce generated by ground effects, although the suspension was fairly conventional; double wishbones with KONI coil-over springs, and adjustable sway bars {{at both ends of the}} car. Ford's chairman, Philip Caldwell, was positive about the car's development, stating that he felt it was [...] "a clear edge of technological development." [...] The car used a fairly conventional Hewland five-speed manual transmission to transmit the power, and it weighed approximately [...] Three cars were built as part of the program.|$|E

50|$|The Moto2 {{formula is}} based on a {{universal}} engine and engine-ancillary equipment specification, with identical controlled engines supplied to teams via the organisers based on the Honda CBR600RR. Fuel, oil and tyres are also controlled. Teams are able to use any supplier of <b>chassis,</b> suspension <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> under strict regulations to enable no one team to dominate by technology or expenditure.|$|R
50|$|Suzuki {{designed}} a new, water-cooled engine {{specifically for the}} 2007 Bandit 650, unlike earlier models where they used re-worked engines from other models. Most of the <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> remained unchanged from the 2005 model, though.|$|E
50|$|The car is {{made with}} {{separate}} <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork.</b> The aluminium chassis features double wishbone-style suspension. The suspension has no dampers and only act as linkage between the vehicle and the wheel enabling adjustments of ride height, camber and toe.|$|E
50|$|For the 2001 {{model year}} Honda {{released}} an upgraded {{version of the}} popular CBR600F4 with intentions of becoming more competitive in the middleweight sport bike class. The 370 lb (dry) F4i is a modified F4 with numerous engine, <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> changes.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, Crown {{engineer}} Roy Hardy (a former Mack executive) commenced work on {{a dedicated}} design for a company-produced fire engine. The Crown fire engine would compete with the recently-introduced American LaFrance 700 cab-forward fire engine, but built to Crown Coach standards and quality. A {{key part of the}} design behind the new fire engine was adapting the <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> front <b>bodywork</b> of the mid-engine Supercoach school bus for the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Many buyers {{will have}} {{purchased}} {{the car in}} bare <b>chassis</b> form <b>and</b> purchased <b>bodywork</b> separately from an independent coach builder. That included the (by now) octogenarian German President whose 1929 presidential Typ 630 featured a Pullman-Landaulet body by coachbuilders Jos.Neuss of Berlin.|$|R
50|$|Responding {{to demand}} Wolseley {{presented}} a much roomier four-door saloon with wind-up windows.One {{month before the}} Motor Show agents {{from all over the}} country were called to Birmingham to see the new Hornet four door saloon. A changed design for the engine's drive to the camshaft allowed a shorter engine which could now be placed further forward in the <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> the <b>bodywork</b> could be more capacious. A silent third four-speed gearbox was added to the car's equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Until the 1930s, {{virtually}} every car had a structural frame, separate from its body. This construction design {{is known as}} body-on-frame. Over time, nearly all passenger cars have migrated to unibody construction, meaning their <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> have been integrated into one another.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> updated. TMAX {{offered in}} 3 {{versions}}: standard, SX and DX.

The Wave series succeeds the Honda Cub which used pressed steel frame acting as both the structural <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> cosmetic <b>bodywork.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1982, the Eclat was {{developed}} into the Eclat Excel (later badged {{simply as the}} Lotus Excel), which used the same engine, but {{a modified version of}} the <b>chassis,</b> altered <b>bodywork,</b> <b>and</b> Toyota gearbox, driveline, and brakes.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical early car, the Effyh 500 (1947-1952) {{was built}} in Malmö, Sweden {{and was one of}} the more {{successful}} cars. It had a lightweight tube <b>chassis,</b> aluminium <b>bodywork</b> <b>and</b> was powered by a 500cc 1-cylinder JAP engine.|$|R
50|$|With these loopholes in place, TTE {{was able}} to set out in {{laying-out}} the GT-One. TTE designed and manufactured the car's carbon fiber <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> in-house, while Toyota supplied a heavily upgraded version of the engine they originally used on their Group C cars, the R36V 3.6 L Turbo V8.|$|E
50|$|Waxoyl is a rustproofing fluid used {{to prolong}} the life of steel car <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork.</b> It works by {{excluding}} water and air from bare metal and by slowing the progress of existing surface rust using phosphoric acid rust inhibitors. The fluid is a suspension of waxy particles in white spirit, which evaporates after application.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> is a welded {{structure}} made of carbon steel with high strength {{and resistance to}} corrosion. The whole carriage is covered with corrosion protection, which, together with a covering paint ensures long-term durability of the wagon body. The spaces in the internal walls and the roof is covered with damping mats of a non-combustible material.|$|E
50|$|Many buyers {{will have}} {{purchased}} {{the car in}} bare <b>chassis</b> form <b>and</b> purchased <b>bodywork</b> separately from an independent coach builder. The manufacturer’s listed body types were a four or (from 1925) six seater Torpedo bodied “Tourenwagen”, a six-seater ”Pullman-Limousine”, a six-seater “Landaulet”, a six-seater “Coupe-Limousine” and a 4-door four seater Cabriolet.|$|R

50|$|The Mercedes-Benz W11 was a midsize six-cylinder {{automobile}} {{introduced by}} Daimler-Benz it 1929. It was {{developed from the}} Mercedes-Benz W02 first seen in 1926, and the W11 shared its <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> with the W02, but the W11 came with a larger more powerful engine, a new name and a wider list of “standard bodies” from which customers could choose.|$|E
50|$|Brian Redman {{asked for}} Lola Cars {{to develop a}} GTP spec racer based on a T70 chassis, fitted with a new {{bodywork}} and a Chevy 6.0L V8 engine developing around 600 bhp. Lola's Eric Broadley however, wanted a new <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> developed specifically for the new IMSA GTP regulations. He hired aerodynamicist Max Sardou to design a ground effects underbody for the car. Cooke-Woods Racing also helped develop the car.|$|E
50|$|The XJR-15's <b>chassis</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> are {{composed}} of carbon fibre and Kevlar (XJR-15 was the first road-going car built entirely of carbon and Kevlar composites, before the McLaren F1 used similar techniques in 1992). It was designed to comply with 1990 Group C regulations, being 480 cm long, 190 cm wide and 110 cm high. At 1050 kg, the XJR-15 weighed {{about the same as}} a contemporary VW Golf.|$|E
50|$|After going 278 mph in a mile on a Modified-class land speed motorcycle, Warner began {{building}} a new, Altered-class <b>chassis,</b> engine, <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> {{in order to}} attempt to break the 300 mph barrier on a conventional (rider-exposed) motorcycle. This undertaking was supported by many industry and personal sponsors, and absorbed all of Warner's time and energy. After breaking 300 on his first attempt in 2011 (with 11 mph to spare) on a 1,5 mile track, Warner sought to break 300 mph in a single mile, after which he planned to retire from ultimate land speed racing, auction his racing motorcycle, and manage his own standing-mile land speed event in Houston, Texas.|$|R
