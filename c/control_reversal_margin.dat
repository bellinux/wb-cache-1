40|$|A fixed-base {{simulator}} {{study to determine}} the effect of increased pictorial display realism on the frequency of <b>control</b> <b>reversals</b> made with an inside-out landing display was conducted.

The number of <b>control</b> <b>reversals</b> was moderately high on all displays. <b>Control</b> <b>reversals</b> to roll disturbances occurred nearly twice as frequently as reversals to either pitch or lateral rate disturbances.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} recent {{applications of}} the ENS 3 DAE computational aeroelasticity method. In particular, it describes aeroelastic and unsteady aerodynamics calculations performed on wings with trailing edge control surfaces. These simulations include the investigation of <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> for a structurally flexible wing with a deflected control surface, and a static and dynamic analysis of a rigid wing with an oscillating control surface. The two sets of calculations were performed independently on different wings using different grid topologies. The <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> simulation represents an inviscid Euler static aeroelastic analysis of a thin wing with a rectangular planform. The geometry of this wing makes it suitable for computations using more approximate, inviscid aerodynamics methods. Thus, {{the results of the}} present Euler computations are compared with numerical data generated by a validated computational aeroelasticity code which uses a simpler aerodynamic formulation. The second illustrated case involves the simulation of a significantly more complex flowfield and the static and dynamic analyses of this geometry were performed using the viscous Navier-Stokes equation option in ENS 3 DAE.

50|$|Some {{aircraft}} use spoilers {{in combination}} with or in lieu of ailerons for roll control, primarily to reduce adverse yaw when rudder input is limited by higher speeds. For such spoilers the term spoileron has been coined. In {{the case of a}} spoileron, in order for it {{to be used as a}} control surface, it is raised on one wing only, thus decreasing lift and increasing drag, causing roll and yaw. Spoilerons also avoid the problem of <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> that affects ailerons.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{patients}} with multiple sclerosis and healthy control subjects as regards hemodynamics of cerebral venous drainage. Material and Methods: Between December 2012 and May 2013, 44 consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects underwent the B-mode, color Doppler, and duplex Doppler evaluations of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and vertebral vein. The following four parameters were investigated: IJV stenosis, <b>reversal</b> of postural <b>control</b> of the cerebral venous outflow pathways, absence of detectable blood flow in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins, and reflux in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins in the sitting or supine position. Results: In the study group, IJV stenosis, postural <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> of the cerebral venous outflow pathways, and absence of flow in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins were found in 3 (6. 8 %), 2 (4. 5 %), and 3 (6. 8 %) patients, respectively. In the control group, IJV stenosis (P= 0. 12), postural <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> of the cerebral venous outflow pathways (P= 0. 50), and absence of flow (P= 0. 12) were not detected.

40|$|Extensive {{pressure}} measurements and off-surface flow visualization were obtained on the forebody and strakes of the NASA F- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) equipped with actuated forebody strakes. Forebody yawing moments {{were obtained by}} integrating the circumferential pressures on the forebody and strakes. Results show that large yawing moments can be generated with forebody strakes. At a 50 -angle-of-attack, deflecting one strake at a time resulted in a forebody yawing moment <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> for small strake deflection angles. However, deflecting the strakes differentially about a 20 symmetric strake deployment eliminated the <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> and produced a near linear variation of forebody yawing moment with differential strake deflection. At an angle of attack of 50 and for 0 and 20 symmetric strake deployments, a larger forebody yawing moment was generated by the forward fuselage (between the radome and {{the apex of the}} leading-edge extensions) than on the radome where the actuated forebody strakes were located.

5000|$|Another {{manifestation of}} the problem occurs when the amount of airflow over the wing becomes {{so great that the}} force {{generated}} by the ailerons is enough to twist the wing itself, due to insufficient torsional stiffness of the wing structure. For instance when the aileron is deflected upwards in order to make that wing move down, the wing twists in the opposite direction. The net result is that the airflow is directed down instead of up and the wing moves upward, opposite of what was expected. This form of <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> is often lumped in with a number of [...] "high speed" [...] effects as compressibility.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Control</b> <b>reversal</b> also {{affected}} the Gossamer Condor, the Kremer Prize-winning human-powered airplane. When a wing warping mechanism was tried {{as a solution}} to a long-running turning problem, the effect was to turn the airplane in the opposite direction to that expected by conventional airplane knowledge. When the Condor was rigged [...] "conventionally", the inside wing slowed down so much that it settled to the ground. By employing [...] "backwards" [...] wired wing-warping, the inside wingtip angle of attack was increased so that the added drag slowed that wing while the added lift allowed the airfoil to stay aloft at a slower speed. The tilted canard could then complete the turn.|$|R

This parallels the late development of the Gloster Meteor, whose later versions featured stronger engines providing more thrust than the airframe was designed to accommodate. Also suffered from transonic buffeting in powered dives; two were lost to tail separation. The problem in the latter cases was that the aircraft had not been designed using the transonic area rule, its aerodynamics being unsuited to stable flight in the transonic envelope, causing problems such as structural flutter (felt by the pilot as buffeting) and <b>control</b> <b>reversals</b> - both of which would have been most likely to be present in a high-speed dive.|$|R
50|$|The wing airfoil was {{identified}} by Boeing as the BAC 145, {{but this was}} actually the NACA 64A(.225)12 mod airfoil. The wing's flexibility was a concern, as it could flex as much as 17.5 ft at the tip, and major effort was expended to ensure that flight control could be maintained as the wing moved up and down. As it turned out, most of the worries proved unfounded. The aircraft's maximum speed was limited to 425 kn to avoid <b>control</b> <b>reversal,</b> where aileron inputs by the pilot would cause the wings to twist and produce a roll {{in the opposite direction}} to that desired by the pilot.

40|$|Misalignments between {{display and}} control {{reference}} frames complicate execution of many remote control tasks by loading the operator’s attentional resources with mental transformations. It is thus important to maintain alignment between an operator’s controls and her view of the controlled object or task space.
