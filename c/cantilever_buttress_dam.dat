25|$|The longest <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> was the 632+m long Consuegra Dam (3rd–4thcenturyAD) {{in central}} Spain {{which is still}} fairly well preserved. Instead of an earth embankment, its only 1.3m thick {{retaining}} wall was supported on the downstream side by buttresses in regular intervals of 5 to 10m. In Spain, {{a large number of}} ancient <b>buttress</b> <b>dams</b> are concentrated, representing nearly one-third of the total found there.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buttress</b> style {{diversion}} <b>dams</b> {{are designed}} using angle supports on the downstream {{side of the}} dam. The supports are fixed {{to the wall of}} the dam in order to help counteract the force of the water on the <b>dam.</b> <b>Buttress</b> style <b>dams</b> are built across wide valleys that do not have a solid bedrock foundation. Bedrock is solid rock that makes up {{the upper part of the}} earth’s crust. Bedrock can be made from sedimentary, igneous, and metaphoric rock origins. <b>Buttress</b> <b>dams</b> require extensive steel framework and labor. As a result, <b>buttress</b> style <b>dams</b> are expensive to construct and are seldom built today.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{features}} of the bridge include its queenpost truss modified by addition of a kingpost, its ribbon openings under the eaves, and its <b>cantilevered</b> <b>buttresses.</b> The bridge has a cedar roof, semi-circular portals, and board siding without battens.|$|R
50|$|A <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> or {{hollow dam}} is a dam with a solid, {{water-tight}} upstream side that is supported at intervals on the downstream side {{by a series}} of buttresses or supports. The dam wall may be straight or curved. Most <b>buttress</b> <b>dams</b> are made of reinforced concrete and are heavy, pushing the dam into the ground. Water pushes against the <b>dam,</b> but the <b>buttresses</b> are inflexible and prevent the dam from falling over.|$|R

5000|$|Working for the B. F. Sturtevant Company in Hyde Park, Boston, Massachusetts, in 1903, Ambursen {{developed}} an innovative concrete slab and <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> for an industrial client in Theresa, New York. [...] Ambursen's design {{was for a}} <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> requiring minimal <b>buttress</b> thickness in which the upstream part is a relatively thin flat slab typically made of reinforced concrete. Ambursen's concrete-slab-and-buttress design used far less material than a traditional gravity dam making it both a significant engineering advance and cost effective for clients.|$|R
25|$|Roman {{engineers}} made routine use {{of ancient}} standard designs like embankment dams and masonry gravity dams. Apart from that, they displayed {{a high degree}} of inventiveness, introducing most of the other basic dam designs which had been unknown until then. These include arch-gravity <b>dams,</b> arch <b>dams,</b> <b>buttress</b> <b>dams</b> and multiple arch <b>buttress</b> <b>dams,</b> all of which were known and employed by the 2nd century AD (see List of Roman dams). Roman workforces also were the first to build dam bridges, such as the Bridge of Valerian in Iran.|$|R
5000|$|As designs {{have become}} more sophisticated, the virtues and {{weaknesses}} of the <b>buttress</b> type <b>dams</b> have become apparent. The Romans {{were the first to}} use buttresses to increase the stability of a <b>dam</b> wall. [...] <b>Buttress</b> <b>dams</b> of slab concrete construction became popular in the United States in the early 20th Century with the patented process of Norwegian-American civil engineer Nils F. Ambursen.|$|R

50|$|Lake Catherine {{is a small}} 1940 acre lake near Hot Springs. Lake Catherine State Park {{is located}} on the lake's shore. The state park {{contains}} 18 cabins. Lake Catherine was created in the 1920s with the building of Remmel Dam, a concrete-and-steel Ambursen-type <b>buttressed</b> <b>dam.</b> Remmel Dam was created to provide hydroelectricity, but recreation came as a result of lake's location next to Hot Springs. Remmel Dam is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
25|$|The largest {{multiple}} arch <b>buttress</b> <b>dam</b> was the Esparragalejo Dam in Spain, whose 320m long {{wall was}} supported on its air face alternatingly by buttresses and concave-shaped arches. Dated to the 1stcenturyAD, the structure represents the first and, as it appears, only known dam of its type in ancient times.|$|R

There is also a bottom outlet which can discharge up to 52 m³/s.|$|R
40|$|The shear {{strength}} of a bonded concrete-rock interface below a concrete dam consists of two parts: friction from the self-weight of the dam and cohesion due to the glue in the cement paste binding the surfaces together. For flat-slab <b>buttress</b> <b>dams</b> with low self-weight, the cohesive strength becomes extra significant for the sliding resistance. However, the Norwegian authorities on dam safety does not allow the use of cohesion in sliding stability calculations, unless the cohesive strength can be documented through tests. Yet, no proposal is given on how such tests should be carried out. Consequently, the main scope of this thesis have been to develop and propose a test methodology to estimate the cohesive strength of Norwegian flat-slab <b>buttress</b> <b>dams.</b> The proposed testing procedure uses rock samples from the dam site to get the occurring roughness and strength of the bedrock. Furthermore, the test-specimen are prepared and concrete replicating the concrete of the dam are then cast on the natural surfaces of the rock samples. A series of shear tests is then carried out to measure the {{shear strength}} of the concrete-rock interfaces. Finally, {{the value of the}} cohesion is extrapolated out of the τ-σ curve. Preliminary testing of the methodology revealed the importance of thorough preparation of the test-specimen beforehand, but in the end left the author optimistic regarding the test methodology s future use. Additionally, to investigate the effect of including cohesion in sliding stability calculations, the sliding safety of one of Statkrafts flat-slab <b>buttress</b> <b>dams,</b> Kalhovd dam, was assessed with a combination of FE-analysis and simplified hand calculations. The results showed that by assuming reasonable values for the cohesion, the dam managed to meet the requirements from the Norwegian dam authorities. One problem when applying cohesion in calculations, however, is to determine the compressive zone of the dam. Assuming a linearly distributed normal stress seemed to overestimate the compressive area compared to the results from the finite element analysis, indicating that the latter might be the best tool for this purpose...|$|R
