5|$|Isotype or <b>class</b> <b>switching</b> is a {{biological}} process occurring after {{activation of the}} B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. <b>Class</b> <b>switching</b> allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but {{with the ability to}} produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. <b>Class</b> <b>switching</b> is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.|$|E
5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called <b>class</b> <b>switching</b> that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc {{fragment}} to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody {{to be used by}} different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.|$|E
5|$|<b>Class</b> <b>switching</b> {{occurs in}} the heavy chain gene locus by a {{mechanism}} called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, found in DNA upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity {{of a series of}} enzymes at two selected S-regions. The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.|$|E

40|$|By diversifying {{antibody}} biological effector functions, <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> DNA recombination has {{a central}} role in the maturation of the antibody response. Here we show that BCR-signalling synergizes with Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling to induce <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> DNA recombination. BCR-signalling activates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway and enhances the TLR-dependent canonical NF-κB pathway, thereby inducing activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which is critical for <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> DNA recombination. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers dual TLR 4 /BCR-signalling and induces hallmarks of BCR-signalling, including CD 79 a phosphorylation and Ca 2 + mobilization, and activates both the NF-κB pathways to induce AID and <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> DNA recombination in a PI(3) K p 85 α-dependent fashion. CD 40 -signalling activates the two NF-κB pathways to induce AID and <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> DNA recombination independent of BCR-signalling. Finally, dual BCR/TLR-engaging NP-lipopolysaccharide effectively elicits class-switched NP-specific IgG 3 and IgG 2 b in mice. Thus, by integrating signals of the non-canonical and canonical NF-κB pathways, BCR and TLRs synergize to induce AID and T-cell-independent <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> DNA recombination. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

25|$|The T {{helper cells}} (Th cells) are {{a type of}} T cell that play an {{important}} role in the immune system, particularly in the adaptive immune system. They help the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell cytokines. These cells help suppress or regulate immune responses. They are essential in B cell antibody <b>class</b> <b>switching,</b> in the activation and growth of cytotoxic T cells, and in maximizing bactericidal activity of phagocytes such as macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Antibody <b>class</b> <b>switching</b> declines {{significantly}} once helper T cell function fails. The {{immune system}} loses {{its ability to}} improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate B cells that can produce antibody groups such as IgG and IgA. These effects are primarily due {{to the loss of}} any helper T cell that can interact with the B lymphocyte correctly. Another symptom of AIDS is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in Th2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper T cells). All of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by IgM antibodies.|$|E

40|$|Studies have implicated {{defective}} Ig <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> in {{the pathogenesis}} of IgA deficiency. To understand better the molecular events that regulate IgA <b>class</b> <b>switch,</b> a 1. 4 -kb region of the IgA locus containing the I alpha exon was replaced with a human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase minigene by gene targeting in murine embryonic stem cells. The I alpha exon-deficient mice derived from these embryonic stem cells had normal IgA levels in serum and secretions and normal numbers of IgA B cells in Peyer's patches and spleen. Further, I alpha exon-deficient B cells efficiently underwent IgA <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> in vitro, {{despite the absence of}} I alpha exon-containing germline transcripts. Notably, I alpha exon-deficient B cells did not require TGF-beta for IgA <b>class</b> <b>switch</b> since stimulation with LPS alone led to IgA expression. Nonetheless, whereas I alpha exon-deficient B cells constitutively expressed human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase transcripts, they did not produce IgA in the absence of LPS stimulation. These results demonstrate that the I alpha exon or transcripts containing the I alpha exon are not required for IgA <b>class</b> <b>switch.</b> Further, the effects of TGF-beta on I alpha locus transcription can be supplanted by expression of a heterologous minigene at that locus, but a second signal is required for the induction of IgA <b>class</b> <b>switch...</b>|$|R

2500|$|CD154, {{also called}} CD40 ligand or CD40L, is a cell surface protein that mediates T cell helper {{function}} in a contact-dependent process {{and is a member}} of the TNF superfamily of molecules. [...] It binds to CD40 on antigen-presenting cells (APC), which leads to many effects depending on the target cell type. CD154 acts as a costimulatory molecule and is particularly important on a subset of T cells called T follicular helper cells (TFH cells). On TFH cells, CD154 promotes B cell maturation and function by engaging CD40 on the B cell surface and therefore facilitating cell-cell communication. A defect in this gene results in an inability to undergo immunoglobulin <b>class</b> <b>switching</b> and is associated with hyper IgM syndrome. Absence of CD154 also stops the formation of germinal centers and therefore prohibiting antibody affinity maturation, an important process in the adaptive immune system.|$|E

The <b>class</b> <b>switching</b> {{involves}} switch {{regions that}} made up of multiple copies of short repeatts(GAGCT and TGGGG).

Displaced strand locations with a WRC (where W is A or T and R is A or G) sequence are preferred targets, but there are clear exceptions.
