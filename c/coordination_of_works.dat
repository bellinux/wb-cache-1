40|$|Defects in {{building}} construction {{are considered to}} be one of the recurring problems in the construction industry. It has adverse effects on project performance, building performance, and client or end-user satisfaction. The lack of focus on defects leads to negative impacts on cost, duration and resources of projects. Defects may generate controversies among parties involved, not only affecting ongoing construction but also during its operation. Rework cost is another effect of defects, absorbs a significant share ranging from 0. 5 % to 3. 7 % of total project costs. This research therefore investigates the most frequent defects and rework cost involved in rectifying the defects in residential buildings in Sri Lanka. A questionnaire survey and subsequent interviews to be carried out together with a detailed analysis of documents will be employed to address research focus. 47 housing projects which exposed to defects were studied. Findings of the study indicates that defects such as bulging of columns, beams and slabs, verticality issues of masonry walls, cracks in plastering and painting, defects in doors and windows are more likely to occur in residential buildings in Sri Lanka. The mean total rework cost as a percentage of the cumulative work done value was found to be 0. 92 %. For a mean total rework cost of 0. 92 %, the likelihood that a project exceeds is 37 %. Finally, the study proposes strategies such as proper documentation, proper <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> and uplift the attitude towards reporting the defects of lower level staff would help practitioners to minimise the defects {{in building}} construction in Sri Lanka...|$|E

40|$|Abstract (100 words) Strategy and {{operations}} are inextricably connected: strategy {{is a plan}} to reach an objective {{and operations}} is the means of getting there. Operations management involves the planning and <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Strategically, this involves the long-term planning and structuring <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Indeed, the task of operations strategy is to design the operating system, which is the joint configuration of resources and processes, such that its resulting competencies are aligned with the organization’s desired competitive position. Tactically, the task of operations management is to utilize the operating system and provide the best match of supply with demand. Definition (60 words) Operations management involves the planning and <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> It is especially concerned with the creation and delivery of products and services and with providing the best match of supply with demand.

Singularly relating behavioral value drivers to financial performance of alliances ignores intangible performance components. This research shows that behavioral value drivers directly affect alliance performance and, additionally, indirectly affect intangible performance. The direct relationship to tangible performance is found to be positively significant for six value drivers: trust, commitment, open communication, strategic interdependence, participation, and <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The only variable not being significant is the one of symmetry. The indirect relationship by means of intangible performance shows a positive effect of the value drivers of open communication, strategic interdependence, participation, and <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Overall, symmetry does not have any impact on performance. The closely related drivers of trust and of commitment are important for the overall performance of business partnerships but do not increase the performance of specific intangible components...|$|R

The activities that we distinguish are the time that partners spent together, spent jointly on household tasks and spent jointly on child care. We find that partners de-synchronize their work times when there are children present in the household while they synchronize their work times {{when there are no}} children present in the household. Households where women are higher educated tend to synchronize there work times. Partners who synchronize their work times spent more joint hours on household tasks and partners who de-synchronize their work times less spent more time together. We do not find a relation between work timing and the time that parents spent together caring for their children. The demand for (in) formal child care is aected by the <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> schedules by partners.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study presents {{a theory of}} dark network design and answers two fundamental questions about illuminating and interdicting dark networks: how are they configured and how are they vulnerable? We define dark networks as interdependent entities that use formal and informal ties to conduct licit or illicit activities and employ operational security measures and/or clandestine tradecraft techniques through varying degrees of overt, or more likely covert, activity to achieve their purpose. A dark network must design itself to buffer environmental hostility and produce output to achieve its purpose according to its design state. The level of hostility in {{the environment and the}} requirement for secure <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> determine the dark network's design state. These factors yield four typological dark network configurations: Opportunistic-Mechanical; Restrictive-Organic; Selective-Technical; and Surgical-Ad hoc. Each configuration must allow the secure <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> between the dark network's directional, operational, and supportive components and should adhere to the six principles of dark network design we identify: security, agility, resilience, direction setting, control, and capacity. If a dark network's configuration does not fit its design state or violates the principles of dark network design, the network will be vulnerable to illumination and interdiction.
