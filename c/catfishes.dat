5|$|There is {{a higher}} fish {{richness}} {{in the southern part}} of the Western Ghats than in the northern, and the highest is in the Chalakudy River, which alone holds 98 species. Other rivers with high species numbers include the Periyar, Bharatapuzha, Pamba and Chaliyar, as well as upstream tributaries of the Kaveri, Pambar, Bhavani and Krishna rivers. The most species rich families are the Cyprinids (72 species), hillstream loaches (34 species; including stone loaches, now regarded a separate family), Bagrid <b>catfishes</b> (19 species) and Sisorid <b>catfishes</b> (12 species). The region is home to several brilliantly colored ornamental fishes like Denison's (or red line torpedo) barb, several species of Dawkinsia barbs, zebra loach, Horabagrus catfish, dwarf pufferfish and dwarf Malabar pufferfish. The rivers are also home to Osteobrama bakeri, and larger species such as the Malabar snakehead and Malabar mahseer. A few are adapted to an underground life, including some Monopterus swampeels, and the catfish Horaglanis and Kryptoglanis.|$|E
5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber cause it to oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine <b>catfishes,</b> sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater <b>catfishes,</b> many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E

40|$|We tagged 260 {{flathead}} <b>catfish</b> (pylodictis olivaris), 222 blue <b>catfish</b> (Ictalurus furcatus),and 187 channel <b>catfish</b> (I. punctatus) at nine fixed {{locations in}} the Lower Mississippi Riverduring August 1995 – October 1997. Seventeen of 18 flathead <b>catfish</b> were recaptured within 1 km of their release site 1 - 730 days after release; the other flathead <b>catfish</b> was recaptured 6 kmfrom its release location. Three blue <b>catfish</b> were recaptured 5 - 12 km from their release site after 363 - 635 days at large. Three channel <b>catfish</b> were recaptured 6 - 52 km from their release siteafter 242 - 662 days at large. The low recapture rates for blue <b>catfish</b> and channel <b>catfish</b> at thesame fixed sampling locations where flathead <b>catfish</b> were recaptured is compatible with thegreater mobility of blue <b>catfish</b> and channel <b>catfish.</b> Our results suggest that localizedmanagement programs are appropriate for flathead <b>catfish</b> in the Lower Mississippi River.

5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, <b>catfishes</b> and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

50|$|Blue <b>catfish</b> {{are often}} misidentified as channel <b>catfish.</b> Blue <b>catfish</b> are heavy bodied, blue-ish gray in color, {{and have a}} dorsal hump. The best way to tell the {{difference}} between a channel <b>catfish</b> and a blue <b>catfish</b> is to count the number of rays on the anal fin. A blue <b>catfish</b> will have 30-36 rays whereas a channel <b>catfish</b> will have 25-29. Blue <b>catfish</b> also have barbels, a deeply forked tail, and a protruding upper jaw.|$|R

25|$|Juvenile catfish, {{like most}} fish, have {{relatively}} large heads, eyes and posterior median fins {{in comparison to}} larger, more mature individuals. These juveniles can be readily placed in their families, particularly those with highly derived fin or body shapes; in some cases identification of the genus is possible. As far as known for most catfish, features that are often characteristic of species such as mouth and fin positions, fin shapes, and barbel lengths show little difference between juveniles and adults. For many species, pigmentation pattern is also similar in juveniles and adults. Thus, juvenile <b>catfishes</b> generally resemble and develop smoothly into their adult form without distinct juvenile specializations. Exceptions to this are the ariid <b>catfishes,</b> where the young retain yolk sacs late into juvenile stages, and many pimelodids, which may have elongated barbels and fin filaments or coloration patterns.|$|E

25|$|Both A. adonis and A. hystrix are {{sometimes}} kept in aquariums, {{and especially the}} densely white-spotted juveniles of the former species are regularly seen in the trade. They are opportunistic, omnivorous feeders that require well-oxygenated water. Their massive adult size and territorially aggressive behavior means that a very large tank is required. The territorial behavior is mostly aimed at other suckermouth armored <b>catfishes</b> and during disputes Acanthicus have even been known to kill Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps (itself typically considered a robust species).

25|$|<b>Catfishes</b> of {{the genus}} Akysis are small cryptically-coloured species. Akysis are small secretive fishes that occupy a variety of habitats. Most species {{typically}} inhabit clear swift-flowing upland streams with sandy or rocky substrates. Some species are reported from the muddy side and main channels and deltas of large rivers. In smaller streams they may be found hiding in leaf litter and woody debris, in patches of live vegetation such as Cryptocoryne affinis, or in shallow riffle areas under coarse gravel or larger stones. Species of Akysis also are reported from the shallow margins to the bottom depths of large rivers where they are usually taken in trawls together with decaying vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the male}} and female are in the 'T position', the {{pressing}} of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras <b>catfishes,</b> {{it seems likely that the}} female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised.|$|E
25|$|Representatives of {{the genus}} Ictalurus have been {{introduced}} into European waters {{in the hope of}} obtaining a sporting and food resource. However, the European stock of American <b>catfishes</b> has not achieved the dimensions of these fish in their native waters, and have only increased the ecological pressure on native European fauna. Walking catfish have also been introduced in the freshwaters of Florida, with the voracious catfish becoming a major alien pest there. Flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris, is also a North American pest on Atlantic slope drainages. Pterygoplichthys species, released by aquarium fishkeepers, have also established feral populations in many warm waters around the world.|$|E
