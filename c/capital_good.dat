2500|$|Instead {{of simply}} taking a neoclassical {{production}} function for granted, Samuelson follows the Sraffian tradition of constructing a production function from positing alternative methods {{to produce a}} product. The posited methods exhibit different mixes of inputs. Samuelson shows how profit maximizing (cost minimizing) indicates {{the best way of}} producing the output, given an externally specified wage or profit rate.

Capitalist income (total profit or property income) is defined as the rate of profit multiplied by the amount of capital, but the measurement of the [...] "amount of capital" [...] involves adding up quite incomparable physical objects [...] adding the number of trucks to the number of lasers, for example.

40|$|In {{standard}} {{capital accumulation}} models all <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> are equally productive and produce goods {{of the same}} quality.

Comparing the returns of investment in <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> of different age, the higher productivity of younger <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> has to be weighed against the lower costs of depreciation, discounting and acquisition of older <b>capital</b> <b>goods.</b> In the steady state it holds that, in the most reasonable scenario, the firm should invest at the highest rate in new <b>capital</b> <b>goods,</b> and dis-investment can only be optimal when costs of acquisition are large and machines are old. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I test the {{hypothesis}} that trade policies leading to higher prices for <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> have a negative influence on the steady state level and transitional growth rate of per capita GDP. I derive this hypothesis from {{a modified version of}} a Solow-Swan model, in which capital variety increases productivity. This model has the implication that import restrictions on foreign <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> reduce the steady state level and the transitional growth rate of per capita GDP. However, although I assume that technological progress spreads over different countries via the import of new <b>capital</b> <b>goods,</b> import restrictions do not reduce the steady state growth rate. A reduction of the steady state growth rate is only possible, if the number of varieties of imported <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> were restricted. The empirical results show that <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> prices as well as the relative input ratios of domestic and foreign <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> are significantly positively affected by the level of import tariffs on <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> and the coverage ratio of non-tariff measures on <b>capital</b> <b>goods.</b> A test of the steady state version of the Solow-Swan model displays a statistically significant negative relation between import restrictions on foreign <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> and the level of per capita GDP.

Through this selection, the distribution of <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> determines the industry-level productivity: industry-level productivity is higher in an industry with relatively larger variation in <b>capital</b> <b>goods,</b> and hence in a perfectly competitive two-country, two-good, two-factor equilibrium, the industry has Ricardian comparative advantage.

40|$|Almost 80 {{percent of}} <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> {{production}} {{in the world is}} concentrated in 10 countries. Poor countries import most of their <b>capital</b> <b>goods.</b> We argue that interna-tional trade in <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> has quantitatively important effects on economic develop-ment through two channels: (i) capital formation and (ii) aggregate TFP. We embed a multi country, multi sector Ricardian model of trade into a neoclassical growth model. Barriers to trade result in a misallocation of factors both within and across countries. We calibrate the model to bilateral trade flows, prices, and income per worker. Our model matches several trade and development facts within a unified framework. It is consistent with the world distribution of <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> production, cross-country dif-ferences in investment rate and price of final goods, and cross-country equalization of price of <b>capital</b> <b>goods</b> and marginal product of capital.
