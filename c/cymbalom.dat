While playing with eight bowhammers and two thumb picks, Masley {{has been known}} also to use pan pipes attached to a neck bracket, as well as rhythm instruments such as shakers and rattles attached to his legs.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also built}} several {{electrically}} amplified instruments {{of his own}} invention, expanding his ensemble beyond the guitar. A few of these instruments were third bridge zithers he called [...] "harmonic guitars". He also built instruments with many strings that he called [...] "mallet guitars" [...] because they were percussion instruments played with drumsticks and monotone electric <b>cymbaloms</b> with an additional third bridge on resonating positions. Early members of his group included Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Phil Kline of The Del-Byzanteens, and several members of Swans including Michael Gira, Dan Braun, and Algis Kizys.|$|R

5000|$|Like other {{professional}} musicians, klezmorim were often limited by authorities. In Ukraine they were banned from playing loud instruments, until the 19th century. Hence musicians {{took up the}} violin, tsimbl (or <b>cymbalom),</b> and other stringed instruments. The first musician to play klezmer in European concerts, Josef Gusikov, played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a [...] "wood and straw instrument". It was laid out like a <b>cymbalom,</b> and attracted comments from Felix Mendelssohn (highly favourable) and Liszt (condemnatory). Later, around 1855 under the reign of Alexander II of Russia, Ukraine permitted loud instruments. The clarinet started to replace the violin as the instrument of choice. Also, a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands.|$|E
5000|$|Masley {{describes}} his music as [...] "earth-folk", [...] "a contemporary Afro-Celtic variation of Free World and Country Eastern music.". Others have categorized his music as new-age or world music. One musician has described Masley's bowhammer style of <b>cymbalom</b> playing as generating [...] "a turkish steambath of overtones".|$|E

50|$|In English, the cimbalom {{spelling}} is {{the most}} common, followed by the variants, derived from Austria-Hungary’s languages, cimbál, <b>cymbalom,</b> cymbalum, țambal, tsymbaly and tsimbl etc. Santur, Santouri, sandouri {{and a number of}} other non Austro-Hungarian names are sometimes applied to this instrument in regions beyond Austria-Hungary which have their own names for related instruments of the hammer dulcimer family.|$|E
5000|$|Hora (pl. hore) is a {{traditional}} Romanian folk dance where the dancers hold each other's hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three steps forward and one step back.

These instruments are fully chromatic and {{have a range of}} over four octaves.|$|E
5000|$|The strings are strung {{in groups}} of 3-5, which are tuned in unison. The bass strings may have 1 or 2 wrapped strings tuned in union.

Later, Aidje Tafial (drums) and Marian Miu (<b>cymbalom)</b> were added, and Georghe Ene was replaced on the accordion by Constantin Bitica.|$|E
50|$|Michael Masley (born September 22, 1952 in Trenton, Michigan, United States) {{is known}} for his musical work on the Hungarian <b>cymbalom.</b> His unique method of playing the {{instrument}} comes from his invention of the bowhammer, a cross between a fiddle bow and a dulcimer hammer, attached to the finger with a ring. The bowhammers, one worn on each finger except thumbs, allow Masley to bow, strike, and pick the cymbalom's strings. These bowhammers, along with a pick on each thumb, allow for the creation of unique musical effects and highly complicated music.|$|E

The score features performances recorded with percussionist Bashiri Johnson, vocals by world music singer Azam Ali and vocals by international recording artist Judith Bérard, as well as world music and middle-eastern instrumentation such as doubek, kora, khangira, bowhammer <b>cymbalom,</b> lakota slide, walimba, ney, duduk and custom-made instruments.|$|E
5000|$|Marika Papagika {{distinguished}} {{herself from}} most of her contemporaries by virtue of her sweet soprano voice with its relatively high tessitura, her vocal timbre, somewhat reminiscent of Western classical singers, and her diction. The style and sound of her recordings is further distinguished by the particular accompaniment which graced most of them, namely the unusual combination of <b>cymbalom</b> and violoncello, plus a violin or a clarinet, and, very occasionally, a xylophone. Her occasional forays into more purely Western songs also set her apart from her female contemporaries {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. It is perhaps reasonable to understand the performance styles of Mr. & Mrs Papagika & Co. as a true echo of the [...] "santouro-violi" [...] (santouri and violin) music of late 19th century urban Ottoman and mainland Greece.|$|E
50|$|Some klezmer revival bands look to loud-instrument klezmer, jazz, and Dixieland for inspiration. Their {{bands are}} similar to a typical jazz band, with some differences. They use a clarinet, saxophone, or trumpet for the melody, and make great use of the {{trombone}} for slides and other flourishes. When a <b>cymbalom</b> sound is called for, a piano may be played. There is usually a brass instrument ensemble, and sometimes a tuba substitutes for bass. Performers in this style include The Klezmorim, The Klezmatics, The Klezmer Conservatory Band, and The Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. Other bands look back to different eras or regions {{in an effort to}} recreate specific styles of klezmer—for example, Budowitz, the Chicago Klezmer Band, Veretski Pass, Di Naye Kapelye, and the Hungarian band Muzsikas with its album Maramoros: the Lost Jewish Music of Transylvania.|$|E
5000|$|Doina is an improvisational lament usually {{performed}} solo, and {{is extremely}} important in weddings. Its basis is the Romanian shepherd's lament, so it has an expressive vocal quality, like the singing of the khazn. Although it has no form, {{it is not just}} random sounds in a Jewish mode—the musician works with very particular references to Jewish prayer and East European laments. Often these references might occur in the form of harmonic movements or modal maneuvers that quote or otherwise invoke traditional Jewish cantorial practices. Typically it is performed on violin, <b>cymbalom</b> or clarinet, though it has been done on banjo, xylophone, flute, cornet, saxophone, tuba, and many other instruments. Often the doina is the first of a three-part set, followed by a hora, then either a freylekhs or khusidl. One can even hear recordings of contemporary vocalists singing the doina, including Michael Alpert and Elizabeth Schwartz.|$|E
50|$|She {{emigrated to}} America through Ellis Island in 1915 with her husband, Kostas (Gus) Papagika, a <b>cymbalom</b> player {{who was also}} her accompanist. In July 1918, she made her first trial {{recording}} in the States for Victor Records, though her first published Victor recordings were made in December of that year. In July, 1919 she also began recording for Columbia Records. Marika Papagika was thus {{among the first to}} record Greek music in the USA. She also recorded a number of songs in Turkish. By 1925, Marika and Kostas had opened a nightclub on in New York on W. 34th St near 8th Ave, called Marika's, likely the first café-aman—a gathering place characterized by Greek cuisine and Greek music—to appear in the States. Marika's wasn't just a café-aman, but a speakeasy for Greek people as well as for other Mediterranean immigrants. Marika's attracted not only Greeks as regular patrons, but also Albanians, Arabs, Armenians, Bulgarians and Turks.|$|E
5000|$|Bell {{was born}} in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Because he had been misdiagnosed {{at an early age}} as having a disease that would lead to blindness, his parents gave him a musical upbringing. He was {{something}} of a child prodigy, composing his first concerto at the age of 12. He graduated from the Royal College of Music in 1957. While studying there, he became friends with the flautist James Galway. From 1958 to 1990 he composed several classical works, including three piano sonatas, two symphonies, Three Images of Ireland in Druid Times (in 1993) for harp, strings and timpani, Nocturne on an Icelandic Melody (1997) for oboe d'amore and piano and Three Transcendental Concert Studies (2000) for oboe and piano. He had mastered and held a notable collection of instruments, including various harps, harpsichord, piano, <b>cymbalom,</b> and {{all the members of the}} oboe family of instruments (musette, oboe, cor anglais, bass oboe) and the heckelphone ...|$|E
5000|$|Masley studied {{creative}} writing at Northwestern Michigan College {{in the early}} 1970s. Starting in 1973 he studied hammered dulcimer with Robert Spinner. He played traditional two-hammer dulcimer until 1979, when he developed a ten-hammer technique, presumably by attaching one hammer to each finger. In the winter of 1981, Masley was a caretaker for an isolated fishing lodge in northern Michigan, and spent some of his time there with musical experimentation. At that point he experimented with attaching horsehair to his fingers in order to bow at dulcimer strings. In 1981, he sometimes worked as a street musician in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1982, he ordered a <b>cymbalom</b> from William Webster in Detroit, Michigan and moved to Palo Alto, California. In 1983, he developed the bowhammer, and began working with guitarist Barry Cleveland as the duo [...] "Thin Ice", releasing albums in 1984 and 1985. In 1985, Masley moved to Berkeley, California and began to record his solo albums.|$|E
5000|$|Folk {{hammered}} dulcimers {{are usually}} {{referred to by}} their regional names, but throughout central and eastern Europe they are {{often referred to as}} [...] "cimbalom" [...] (<b>cymbalom,</b> cymbalum, tsymbaly, tsimbl, țambal, cimbál, cimbale etc.). These instruments can differ from each other in size, tuning, number of strings and method of holding and moving the hammers or [...] "beaters". They are smaller and more portable than the concert cimbalom. In performance they were (or are) often carried by a single musician: typically using a strap around the player's neck and leaning one edge of the instrument against the waist. Like the concert cimbalom, the folk hammered dulcimer / small cimbalom is played by striking the strings with two beaters. However, these are generally much shorter than the beaters used with the concert cimbalom (usually half the length), and often without soft coverings over the area which strikes the string. These instruments also lacked damper mechanisms; therefore, the hand, fingers, and even forearms are used for damping. Tunings are often partially chromatic or even diatonic rather than the fully chromatic tuning of the concert cimbalom, and they can vary regionally. Construction of these instruments is more closely related to the particular style of music played on them than is the case with the concert cimbalom. In addition to the emergence of the concert cimbalom in Hungary, some other regions in Eastern Europe also further developed their local version of folk dulcimer and more formal schools of playing followed (see Tsymbaly).|$|E
