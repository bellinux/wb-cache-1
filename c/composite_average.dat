40|$|A {{formalism}} {{is presented}} for quantifying the sampling error of an arbitrary linear estimate of a time-averaged quantity constructed {{from a time}} series of irregularly spaced observations at a fixed location. The method is applicable to any irregularly sampled time series; it is applied here to satellite observations of chlorophyll from the coastal zone color scanner (CZCS). The two specific linear estimates considered here are the <b>composite</b> <b>average</b> formed from the simple average of all observations within the averaging period and the optimal estimate formed by minimizing the mean squared error of the temporal average based {{on all of the}} observations in the time series. The formalism requires a priori knowledge of the variances and correlation functions of the chlorophyll signal and CZCS measurement error. In the usual absence of the necessary detailed information on these parameters, values obtained here from in situ measurements of chlorophyll and fluorescence off the coast of southern California can be used. The resulting estimates are referred to here as "suboptimal estimates," which are optimal only if the assumed values for the parameters are correct. Suboptimal estimates are shown to be much more accurate than composite averages. Moreover, suboptimal estimates are also shown to be nearly as accurate as optimal estimates obtained using the correct signal and measurement error variances and correlation functions for realistic ranges of these parameters. Suboptimal estimation is thus a very useful and practical alternative to the <b>composite</b> <b>average</b> method generally used at present...|$|E

This quantity is usually indirectly defined by r(t) =Ïƒ(t) Ï‰(t) where the r(t) are the daily returns of the market index and the Ï‰(t) are i. i. d. random variables with vanishing average and unitary variance. The relation r(t) =Ïƒ(t) Ï‰(t) alone is unable to give an operative definition of the index volatility, which remains unobservable. On the contrary, we show that using the whole information available in the market, the index volatility can be operatively defined and detected...|$|E

This phenomenon is studied in Kampar Kiri sub- watershed that is located in watershed outlet of Lipat Kain water level recorder. This study aims to analyze the effect of land use change on the flood discharge in Kampar Kiri sub watershed. The calculation of flood discharge uses HEC-HMS. Input data modelsare daily rainfall data, land use maps of 2005 and 2011 and soil type maps. The results showed that there were significant changes in land use on open land and dry land farming mixed bush at - 87, 648 % and - 70, 035 %. Land conversion also occurs in dry forest primary, secondary dry forest, scrub, plantations, secondary swamp forest, mixed gardens, vegetation regularly, as well as plantations.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} high-frequency news flow and the states of asset return volatility. To estimate asset return volatility and smoothing probability, we first apply the Markov Regime-Switching Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. Second, the different states of asset return volatility are identified by comparing the previously generated smoothing probability with certain thresholds. Subsequently, we employ discrete choice models to investigate the impact of high-frequency news flow on the volatility states of hourly returns of the constituent stocks in the Dow Jones <b>Composite</b> <b>Average</b> (DJN 65). Our dataset for high-frequency news flows is constructed from the new RavenPack Dow Jones News Analytics database that captures 3 Ì†e 1200 types of firm-specific and macroeconomic news releases at high frequencies. Estimated results show that different types of news flows have varying significant effects on the likelihood of volatility states of intraday asset returns...|$|E
