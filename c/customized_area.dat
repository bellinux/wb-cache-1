40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether the structure-function relationship in glaucoma can be strengthened by using more precise structural and functional measurements combined with individualized structure-function maps and custom sector selection on the optic nerve head (ONH). Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: One eye of each of 23 participants with glaucoma. Methods: Participants were tested twice. Visual fields were collected on a high-resolution 3 °× 3 ° grid (164 locations) using a Zippy Estimation by Sequential Testing test procedure with uniform prior probability to improve the accuracy and precision of scotoma characterization relative to standard methods. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT; 4 scans, 2 per visit) with manual removal of blood vessels. Individualized maps, based on biometric data, were used. To <b>customize</b> the <b>areas</b> of the ONH and visual field to correlate, we chose a 30 ° sector centered on the largest defect shown by OCT and chose visual field locations using the individualized maps. Baseline structure-function correlations were calculated between 24 - 2 locations (n= 52) of the first tested visual field and RNFL thickness from 1 OCT scan, using the sectors of the Garway-Heath map. We added additional data (averaged visual field and OCT, additional 106 visual field locations and OCT without blood vessels, individualized map, and customized sector) and recomputed the correlations. Main Outcome Measures: Spearman correlation between structure and function. Results: The highest baseline correlation was 0. 52 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 13 - 0. 78) in the superior temporal ONH sector. Improved measurements increased the correlation marginally to 0. 58 (95 % CI, 0. 21 - 0. 81). Applying the individualized map to the large, predefined ONH sectors did not improve the correlation; however, using the individualized map with the single 30 ° ONH sector resulted in a large increase in correlation to 0. 77 (95 % CI, 0. 47 - 0. 92). Conclusions: Using more precise visual field and OCT measurements did not improve structure-function correlation in our cohort, but customizing the ONH sector and its associated visual field points substantially improved correlation. We suggest using customized ONH sectors mapped to individually relevant visual field locations to unmask localized structural and functional loss.

40|$|Development is {{important}} to the initial phase of a new restaurant multi-unit manager (MUM), and appropriate training should be conducted in concert with acceptance of the position. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the need for individual training of restaurant MUMs in order to facilitate a smoother transition between executive level management positions. The exhaustive literature review aided in the creation of three research questions to be answered through the interpretation of collected interview data. Restaurant MUMs were invited to participate via LinkedIn, a social media network for professionals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 restaurant MUMs over a two-week period and then transcribed into Word documents and uploaded into ATLAS. ti for analysis. The use of tools within ATLAS. ti, such as network mapping and semantic layouts, allowed the researcher to interpret the correlation between codes and themes created and therefore, answer the research questions. Conventionally, managers have to leave their restaurants or area for many days in order to obtain the necessary training to be more effective in their positions. This study has concluded that while MUMs are aware of their tasks and responsibilities, they are not aware of training available in order to gain the skillset necessary to complete the tasks. Blanket training programs will not work for MUMs, they need training to be <b>customized</b> to such <b>areas</b> as new openings, wide-spread markets and the changing workforce.

40|$|Contour {{processing}} and figure-ground detection within human retinotopic areas were investigated, using event-related functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) (Part 1 and 2) and VEP (part 3). An isoeccentric square (6 Â°) was defined by either i) texture, ii) motion, iii) color or iv) gray-level, while stimuli were otherwise virtually identical. A demanding foveal letter discrimination task prevented subjects from noticing the peripheral contour stimulus, thus avoiding attentional bias in activation of early visual <b>areas.</b> <b>Customized</b> retinotopic mapping and cortical flattening techniques were used to identify the retinotopic localization of the contour related responses and to investigate contextual responses. BOLD-modulations related to contours were mostly restricted to the subpart of visual cortex corresponding to the retinotopic representation of the contours. The activation patterns in different visual areas varied in respect to the contour defining modality. All modalities activated areas V 2 and V 4, but in other retinotopic areas the responses differed. Therefore, we suggest that these specific activation patterns reflect different neuronal populations engaged in the processing of different contour modalities. Here, V 2 may serve as the main contour processing area, while higher retinotopic areas contribute modality specific information. Using VEP we found a clear negativity, specific for contour segregation with highly similar latency (210 ms at O 1 and O 2) and comparable amplitude for both versions. The amplitude of the motion-defined contour segregation negativity was of comparable latency but significantly smaller. In a stimulus combining the motion- and the texture-defined contour the negativity was present, but the amplitude was not significantly larger than in the experiments using only the orientation-defined contours. The discrepancies between these electrophysiological results and the previously reported fMRI-results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} is {{a mature}} technique for colourful graphic arts. It excels at <b>customized,</b> large <b>area,</b> high resolution, and small volume production. With the developments in conductive, and dielectric inks, there is potential for large area inkjet electronics fabrication. Passive radio frequency devices can benefit greatly from a printing process, since {{the size of}} these devices {{is defined by the}} frequency of operation. The large size of radio frequency passives means that they either take up expensive space “on chip” or that they are fabricated on a separate lower cost substrate and somehow bonded to the chips. This has hindered cost-sensitive high volume applications such as radio frequency identification tags. Substantial work has been undertaken on inkjet-printed conductors for passive antennas on microwave substrates and even paper, yet there has been little work on the printing of the dielectric materials aimed at radio frequency passives. Both the conductor and dielectric need to be integrated to create a multilayer inkjet printing process that is capable of making quality passives such as capacitors and inductors. Three inkjet printed dielectrics are investigated in this thesis: a ceramic (alumina), a thermal-cured polymer (poly 4 vinyl phenol), and a UV-cured polymer (acrylic based). For the conductor, both a silver nanoparticle ink as well as a custom in-house formulated particle-free silver ink are explored. The focus is on passives, mainly capacitors and inductors. Compared to low frequency electronics, radio frequency components have additional sensitivity regarding skin depth of the conductor and surface roughness, as well as dielectric constant and loss tangent of the dielectric. These concerns are investigated with the aim of making the highest quality components possible and to understand the current limitations of inkjet-fabricated radio frequency devices. An inkjet-printed alumina dielectric that provides quality factors of 200 and high density capacitors of 400 pF/mm 2 with self-resonant frequencies into the GHz regime is developed in this thesis. A multilayer fully printed process is demonstrated using PVP dielectric and dissolving type vias, giving better than 0. 1 ohm resistance. In the multilayer process, capacitors and inductors have self-resonant frequencies around 1 GHz. These fully printed devices have quality factors less than 10. Finally, 3 D inkjet-printed UV-cured material is utilized with a novel silver organo-complex ink at 80 oC providing conductivity of 1 x 107 S/m. A lumped element filter is demonstrated with an insertion loss of only 0. 8 dB at 1 GHz. The combination of inkjet printing 3 D polymer and conductive metal together allows for complex shapes. A fully printed antenna with 81 % radiation efficiency is shown. With these promising results and future advances in conductive inks and low-loss dielectrics, the performance of inkjet passives could one day overcome conventional fabrication methods...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{distinct}} advantages over terrestrial plants, microalgae biomass is currently sought after for various applications, ranging from human health, aquaculture, high value chemicals {{and also as}} a feedstock for bioenergy production. However, low biomass productivity and inflated production cost have restricted the commercialization of commodity end-products (e. g. biofuel) derived from microalgae. Among the primary factors limiting the growth and productivity of microalgae is the availability and distribution of light (quantity and quality). Identifying these shortcomings, the combination of spectrally selective photovoltaic filters above microalgae cultivation systems for the full exploitation of available sunlight has been previously proposed. Through this system, wavelengths of incoming sunlight most efficient for the growth and productivity of microalgae would be selectively filtered in and transmitted to the algae culture through the photovoltaic filter while all remaining ineffective wavelengths such as infrared (IR), green-yellow and ultraviolet (UV) would be captured and converted into electricity by the photovoltaic apparatus. Thus, in order to evaluate the viability and efficacy of such integrated systems, it is first vital to identify the most efficient light spectra for the targeted microalgae. In this work, the response of two Nannochloropsis spp. (MUR 266 & MUR 267) grown and acclimated under various light spectra were evaluated. Two distinct laboratory controlled experimental setups (filtered and non-filtered) were carried out to evaluate the impact of different light spectra on the growth, biomass productivity, biochemical composition and also photosynthetic response of the selected microalgae. The first study involved the selective filtration of incident light, bringing forward changes in both spectral distribution and the concomitant reduction in irradiance. The filtered light studies were exactly in accordance to the proposed PV-microalgae system in which incoming sunlight would be selectively filtered. The irradiance level of each filtered light spectra was relatively equalized according to its distribution and proportional number of photons found in white light. Under such conditions, light acclimatized cultures of Nannochloropsis MUR 266 and MUR 267 showed the highest light to biomass conversion efficiency when blue light (BL, 400 - 700 nm) (1. 93 ± 0. 14 mg L- 1 d- 1 per photon) and white light (WL, 400 - 700 nm) (1. 87 ± 0. 08 mg L- 1 d- 1 per photon) were respectively used. Total lipid content was significantly enhanced under BL for both species of Nannochloropsis {{when compared to the}} other treatments of blue-green (BGL, 450 - 600 nm), red (RL, 600 - 700 nm), pink (PL, 400 - 525 nm and 600 - 700 nm) and WL. As the biomass productivity of microalgae is directly governed by the efficiency of photosynthesis, the photosynthetic response of both Nannochloropsis spp. under the different filtered light spectra was evaluated using both chlorophyll a fluorescence and oxygen evolution based methods. In this study, most parameters (αETR, ETRmax, α O 2 P-I, O 2 Pmax) measured using both methods inclined to be higher under PL and WL for Nannochloropsis MUR 266 and MUR 267 respectively than the other treatments. Building up on the results of the filtered light study, a narrower band of blue light (LEDB, 430 - 490 nm) was introduced in the second experimental setup to optimize the proposed PV-microalgae system for higher electricity production. In order to eliminate the effects of light irradiance as observed in the previous study and to elucidate the impact of spectral quality, the radiant flux of each treatment was standardized (non-filtered) in this study. Biomass productivities trended to be higher for both MUR 266 and MUR 267 cultures acclimated under BL, LEDB and WL when compared to PL and RL. Total lipid yield was significantly higher in cultures grown under BL (0. 26 ± 0. 02 g L- 1) and PL (0. 15 ± 0. 01 g L- 1) for MUR 266 and MUR 267 respectively when compared to the positive control of WL. The photosynthetic response (Fq′/Fm′, αETR and ETRmax) of MUR 266 and MUR 267 measured using chlorophyll a fluorescence tended to be higher under BL and LEDB when compared to RL, PL and WL. Based on the results of both the filtered and non-filtered light studies, it can be concluded that blue wavelengths (BL and LEDB) and WL was most efficient for MUR 266 and MUR 267 respectively. Direct comparison between both species of Nannochloropsis identified MUR 266 to be a more suitable candidate for application in the PV-microalgae system due to enhanced growth, lipid content and photosynthesis under short wavebands of light such as blue (BL and LEDB). Modelling of the PV-microalgae technology indicated between 150 and 210 W m- 2 of electrical energy can be potentially generated if only blue wavelengths (BL and LEDB) are selectively filtered and channelled to MUR 266 from incoming sunlight while converting all the remaining portions of available light into electricity through photovoltaic cells. According to the PV-microalgae concept of dividing incident light for two distinctive purposes, a novel flat plate photobioreactor (insulated glazed photobioreactor, IGP) with its illumination surface <b>area</b> <b>customized</b> with insulated glazing units (Tropiglas/ClearVue) was also designed and developed as part of this dissertation.
