6000|$|In {{the savage}} state every family owns a shelter {{as good as}} the best, and {{sufficient}} for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I speak within bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have their nests, and the foxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams, in modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a shelter. In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially prevails, the number of those who own a shelter is a very small fraction of the whole. The rest pay an annual tax for this outside garment of all, become indispensable summer and winter, which would buy a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long as they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring compared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his commonly because he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this tax, the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared with the savage's. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars (these are the <b>country</b> <b>rates)</b> entitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and paper, Rumford fire-place, back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a poor civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a savage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of man--and I think that it is, though only the wise improve their advantages--it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run. An average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer's life, even if he is not encumbered with a family--estimating the pecuniary value of every man's labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more, others receive less;--so that he must have spent more than half his life commonly before his wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a rent instead, this is but a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms? ...|$|E

Evidence on the pattern of long-term government bond yields suggests that long-term commitment to the gold standard mattered even when bonds were denominated in gold: countries that remained on gold throughout the classical era were charged lower rates than countries that had a mixed record of adherence. Estimation of a CAPM model, using the differential between peripheral <b>country</b> <b>rates</b> and UK rates augmented by a list of `fundamentals,' and a dummy variable to capture gold standard adherence, reveals that capital markets attached significant weight to gold standard adherence.

We surveyed {{the use of}} this technique in the Nordic countries in autumn 2015. Methods: A link to a web-based survey of surfactant administration methods was emailed to the directors of all neonatal units in the Nordic Region, apart from Finland, where only the five university-based departments were invited. Results: Of the 73 units (85 %) who responded, 23 (32 %) said that they used LISA.

40|$|PURPOSE: The European Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) {{requested}} a multinational {{study with the}} aim to investigate the risk of acute liver failure (ALF) leading to registration for transplantation in patients exposed to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The method of this multinational, multicentre, retrospective case-population study, named SALT (Study of Acute Liver Transplant), is documented here. METHODS: This was a multicentre, multinational retrospective case-population study performed in France, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. The study period was 3 years (1 January 2005 - 31 December 2007). Cases were patients ≥ 18  years of age with ALF {{at the time of}} registration on the transplant list for liver transplantation who had been exposed to an NSAID within 30  days preceding the initial symptoms of liver disease (index date). Exposure was defined as exposure to any NSAID. Per <b>country</b> <b>rates</b> of NSAID-exposed transplantation-registered ALF were computed as the ratio of the number of cases identified in the country to total population exposure. Overall and per-drug sales for NSAIDs and for paracetamol were obtained from Intercontinental Marketing Services (IMS) Health for all participating countries. Population exposure was measured as the defined daily dose and as estimated annual number of patients exposed (primary endpoint) with 95  % confidence intervals. RESULTS: The study protocol was approved by the CHMP. Of the 57 eligible liver transplant centres, 54 {{agreed to participate in the}} study. All national authorizations were received with relevant administrative burden, mainly due to bureaucracy. CONCLUSION: The present study created a multinational research network to estimate population-based absolute rates of drug-exposed ALF leading to registration on the transplantation list. This study design was chosen to obtain a fast response to a public health issue, namely, that of an increased risk of a rare, very serious adverse reaction. This model could be used to study other drug-related issues in ALF...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about factors {{associated}} with mental health problems (MHP) of the elderly in socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods, and comparisons between Central European and Western European countries on this topic are lacking. We examined whether MHP occurred more frequently in deprived neighbourhoods and among deprived people. Next, we examined whether the association of MHP with area deprivation differed by country and whether this {{could be explained by}} the socioeconomic (SE) characteristics of the residents. METHODS: We obtained data on non-institutionalized residents aged 65 years and above from the EU-FP 7 : EURO-URHIS 2 project from Slovak (N = 665, response rate 44. 0 %) and Dutch cities (N = 795, response rate 50. 2 %). An elevated score on General Health Questionnaire- 12 (≥ 2) indicated MHP. Education and household income with financial strain were used as measures of individual SE status. We employed multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall rates of MHP were significantly higher in Slovakia (40. 6 %) than in the Netherlands (30. 6 %). The neighbourhood unemployment rate was not associated with the mental health of elderly in either <b>country.</b> <b>Rates</b> of MHP were significantly higher among elderly with low and medium income [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 75, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 16 - 2. 62; OR = 1. 64, 95 % CI = 1. 12 - 2. 41, respectively] and financial strain (OR = 2. 26, 95 % CI = 1. 56 - 3. 28) when compared with those with high income and no strain, respectively. Individual-level SE characteristics explained differences between the two countries. CONCLUSION: The risk of MHP among the elderly is associated with their individual-level SE position but not with neighbourhood deprivation in both Slovakia and the Netherlands...|$|E

40|$|Background: Reduction of HIV- 1 {{breast-feeding}} transmission {{remains a}} challenge for prevention of pediatric infections in Sub-Saharan Africa. Provision of formula decreases transmission but often increases child mortality in this setting. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study of HIV- 1 exposed infants of mothers receiving pre and postnatal medical care at Drug Resource Enhancement Against AIDS and Malnutrition centers in Mozambique was conducted. Live-born infants of HIV- 1 -infected women receiving medical care were enrolled, HIV- 1 testing was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months of age using branched DNA. Mothers were counseled to breast-feed exclusively for 6 months and were provided HAART antenatally mid postnatally for the first 6 months. Women with CD 4 cell counts less than 350 /cmm at baseline continued HAART indefinitely. Results: Of 341 infants followed from birth, 313 mother-infant pairs (92 %) completed 6 months and 283 (83 %) completed 12 months of follow-up. HIV- 1 diagnosis was ascertained in 287 infants (84 %) including 4 who died. There were 9 cases of HIV- 1 transmission: 4 of 341 (1. 2 %) at 1 month, 2 of 313 (0. 6 %) at 6 months, and 2 of 276 (0. 7 %) at 12 months (cumulative rate: 2. 8 %).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the question: Who bears the larger {{portion of the}} excess burden of a tariff-the country that imposes it, or a country that it trades with? For a country that can influence its terms of trade, {{there are two ways}} of approaching this question. This paper shows that under certain assumptions, the extra burden from a marginal change in the homecountry tariff is shared equally between the home and foreign country at a tariff rate equal to twice the optimal tariff for the home country. Also, the cumulative welfare effect of a tariff in the home country, relative to free trade, turns out to be equalized across countries when the home tariff equals four times its optimal tariff. The paper provides an application of these results and points policymakers to the types of data that are relevant if they want to negotiate over "burden sharing.

40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{characteristics of}} the population geography of the Sudan are seen in its vastness of the area, its low population density, its high population fertility, decreasing mortality rates and uneven distribution of developmental projects among its regions. All these have important effects upon the economic and de mographic characteristics of its population. They also underline the uneven distribution of the country's population, {{as a result of}} which large-scale migration movements occur. Three types of population movements in the Sudan are discussed; inter-provincial movements, rural-urban migration and seasonal migration for cotton picking in the Gezira scheme. In the discussion of the first type, the analysis covers issues related to the general levels of movements amongst the 18 provinces of the <b>country,</b> <b>rates</b> of in- and out-migration in each province and their net migration balances. Also, it discusses the spatial structure of the movement, and some gaining and losing provinces are singled out. The impacts of the movements and their selective nature are also revealed.
