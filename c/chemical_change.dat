5|$|The {{diet and}} {{physiology}} of Edmontosaurus have been probed by using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen as recorded in tooth enamel. When feeding, drinking, and breathing, animals take in carbon and oxygen, which become incorporated into bone. The isotopes {{of these two}} elements are determined by various internal and external factors, such as the type of plants being eaten, the physiology of the animal, salinity, and climate. If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later changes, they can be studied {{for information about the}} original factors; warmblooded animals will have certain isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings, animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions, and so on. Enamel is typically used because the structure of the mineral that forms enamel makes it the most resistant material to <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> in the skeleton.|$|E
25|$|Electrochemistry is {{the branch}} of {{physical}} chemistry that studies the relationship between electricity, as a measurable and quantitative phenomenon, and identifiable <b>chemical</b> <b>change,</b> with either electricity considered an outcome of a particular <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> or vice versa. These reactions involve electric charges moving between electrodes and an electrolyte (or ionic species in a solution).

25|$|Many {{chemicals}} undergo reactive decay or <b>chemical</b> <b>change,</b> especially {{over long}} periods of time in groundwater reservoirs. A noteworthy class of such chemicals is the chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene (used in industrial metal degreasing and electronics manufacturing) and tetrachloroethylene used in the dry cleaning industry. Both of these chemicals, which are carcinogens themselves, undergo partial decomposition reactions, leading to new hazardous chemicals (including dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride).|$|E
25|$|Cell surface receptors (membrane receptors, transmembrane receptors) are receptors {{that are}} {{embedded}} in the membranes of cells. They act in cell signaling by receiving (binding to) extracellular molecules. They are specialized integral membrane proteins that allow communication between the cell and the extracellular space. The extracellular molecules may be hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, or nutrients; they react with the receptor to induce changes in the metabolism and activity of a cell. In the process of signal transduction, ligand binding affects a cascading <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> through the cell membrane.|$|E

25|$|The {{substance}} (or substances) initially {{involved in}} a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a <b>chemical</b> <b>change,</b> and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and {{the information on the}} precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.|$|E
25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as microplastics, these particles act like sponges and soak up Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) around them. Thus laden {{with high levels of}} POPs, the microparticles are often ingested by organisms in the biosphere.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{ambiguity}} over {{the source of}} individual items derived from gelatin, many Orthodox rabbis regard it as generally being nonkosher. However, Conservative rabbis and several prominent Orthodox rabbis, including Chaim Ozer Grodzinski and Ovadia Yosefthe former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israelargue that gelatin has undergone such total <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> and processing {{that it should not}} count as meat, and therefore would be kosher. Technically, gelatin is produced by separating the three strands in each collagen fiber's triple helix by boiling collagen in water.

25|$|In general terms, {{the free}} energy change (ΔG) of a {{reaction}} determines whether a <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> will take place, but kinetics describes {{how fast the}} reaction is. A reaction can be very exothermic and have a very positive entropy change but will not happen in practice if the reaction is too slow. If a reactant can produce two different products, the thermodynamically most stable one will in general form, except in special circumstances when the reaction {{is said to be}} under kinetic reaction control. The CurtinHammett principle applies when determining the product ratio for two reactants interconverting rapidly, each going to a different product. It is possible to make predictions about reaction rate constants for a reaction from free-energy relationships.|$|E
25|$|Compression fossils, such {{as those}} of fossil ferns, are the result of {{chemical}} reduction of the complex organic molecules composing the organism's tissues. In this case the fossil consists of original material, albeit in a geochemically altered state. This <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> is an expression of diagenesis. Often what remains is a carbonaceous film known as a phytoleim, in which case the fossil is known as a compression. Often, however, the phytoleim is lost and all that remains is an impression of the organism in the rock—an impression fossil. In many cases, however, compressions and impressions occur together. For instance, when the rock is broken open, the phytoleim will often be attached to one part (compression), whereas the counterpart will just be an impression. For this reason, one term covers the two modes of preservation: adpression.|$|E
500|$|In a more {{concrete}} manner, however, {{the concept of}} aggregates or units of bonded atoms, i.e. [...] "molecules", traces its origins to Robert Boyle's 1661 hypothesis, in his famous treatise The Sceptical Chymist, that matter is composed of clusters of particles and that <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> results from the rearrangement of the clusters.

500|$|The {{process of}} protein {{denaturation}} (as distinguished from coagulation) {{had been discovered}} in 1910 by Harriette Chick and Charles Martin, but its nature was still mysterious. [...] Tim Anson and Alfred Mirsky had shown that denaturation was a reversible, two-state process [...] that results in many chemical groups becoming available for chemical reactions, including cleavage by enzymes. [...] In 1929, Hsien Wu hypothesized correctly that denaturation corresponded to protein unfolding, a purely conformational change {{that resulted in the}} exposure of amino-acid side chains to the solvent. [...] Wu's hypothesis was also advanced independently in 1936 by Mirsky and Linus Pauling. [...] Nevertheless, protein scientists could not exclude the possibility that denaturation corresponded to a <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> in the protein structure, a hypothesis that was considered a (distant) possibility until the 1950s.|$|E

500|$|The {{chemical}} structure of proteins {{was still under}} debate at that time. [...] The most accepted (and ultimately correct) hypothesis was that proteins are linear polypeptides, i.e., unbranched polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. [...] However, a typical protein is remarkably long—hundreds of amino-acid residues—and several distinguished scientists were unsure whether such long, linear macromolecules could be stable in solution. [...] Further doubts about the polypeptide nature of proteins arose because some enzymes were observed to cleave proteins but not peptides, whereas other enzymes cleave peptides but not folded proteins. [...] Attempts to synthesize proteins in the test tube were unsuccessful, mainly due to the chirality of amino acids; naturally occurring proteins are composed of only left-handed amino acids. Hence, alternative chemical models of proteins were considered, such as the diketopiperazine hypothesis of Emil Abderhalden. However, no alternative model had yet explained why proteins yield only amino acids and peptides upon hydrolysis and proteolysis. [...] As clarified by Linderstrøm-Lang, these proteolysis data showed that denatured proteins were polypeptides, but no data had yet been obtained about the structure of folded proteins; thus, denaturation could involve a <b>chemical</b> <b>change</b> that converted folded proteins into polypeptides.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the reprocessing technique of enzymatic bath with ultrasonic cleaning and ethylene oxide sterilization on the chemical properties and morphological structure of polymeric coatings of guide wire for regular guiding catheter. Methods: These techniques simulated the routine of guide wire reprocessing in many hemodynamic services in Brazil and other countries. Samples from three different manufacturers were verified by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results: A single or double sterilization of the catheters with ethylene oxide was not associated with morphological or <b>chemical</b> <b>changes.</b> However, scanning electron microscopy images showed that the washing method was associated with rough morphological changes, including superficial holes and bubbles, in addition to <b>chemical</b> <b>changes</b> of external atomic layers of polymeric coating surfaces, as detected by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy method, which is compatible with extended <b>chemical</b> <b>changes</b> on catheter surfaces. Conclusion: The reprocessing of the catheters with ethylene oxide was not associated with morphological or <b>chemical</b> <b>changes,</b> and it seemed appropriate to maintain guide wire coating integrity.

If the mechanical effects are different, the <b>chemical</b> <b>changes</b> likewise are not equivalent. This is especially to be seen in the case of stimulation at 50 shocks per second: a slowly rising, long continued, strong slow contraction takes place with no apparent change in the phosphate content; a quickly rising fast contraction occurs with a large increase in the phosphate. 2. Since equivalent <b>chemical</b> <b>changes</b> accompany equivalent mechanical action, the two types of contraction do not differ in the essential mechanism of the <b>chemical</b> <b>changes</b> involved, and only one type of contractile substance is present. 3.
