40|$|The <b>cultivation</b> <b>{{contract}}</b> is {{a contract}} strictly related {{with the process}} of production in agriculture. It is not an obligatory contract although national and EU regulations require that it must be signed for selected agricultural products. The aim of the article is an attempt to indicate the contemporary role of the <b>cultivation</b> <b>contract.</b> The article also attempts to answer the question if the current legal regulations secure the interest of both parties of the contract. The contract in question has numerous functions, which are modified along with the technological progress. However, it should still be seen as the main stem of the system supplying raw materials for the agri-food industry. Besides, it also plays a vital role as a legal instrument limiting broadly understood risk in agricultural production. ...|$|E

Peasants refused to sell their surplus products for money which could effectively buy nothing. Facing starvation in the cities {{and the death of}} industry as peasant-workers returned to their villages, the Soviet state resorted to the use of force to obtain necessary grain to maintain its urban economy. This resort to forced requisitioning had the effect of further decimating agricultural production,already seriously weakened by the loss of millions of able-bodied peasant men to the front. Wherever requisitioning was applied, the area of land dedicated to <b>cultivation</b> <b>contracted.</b>|$|R

30|$|From a {{regional}} point of view, as already said, {{most of these}} works addressed {{the pros and cons}} of vertical coordination mainly in rural areas of developing countries, and more precisely, they analyzed whether vertical coordination might improve the livelihood conditions of small holder farmers and if it would be useful to trigger a virtuous development in the rural areas of these countries. To illustrate, a meta-narrative approach was used by Barret et al. (2012) to make a comparative analysis of case studies carried out in five low-income countries (Ghana, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Nicaragua). Authors found that the well-being of farmers is generally increased by the participation to contract farming. Miyata et al. (2009), analyzing apple and onion farmers of a province in China, found that those applying contract farming showed higher income. A contingent-evaluation experiment carried out on various farm types and crops in six regions of Madagascar demonstrated that the increase of 1 % in the probability to participate to contract farming has a direct effect on farmers’ income of more than 0.5 % (Bellemare 2012). Narayanan (2014) carried out an impact evaluation of vertical coordination in some supply chain in southern India. Results showed that participation profits were heterogeneous, depending on (i) the sector (higher for papaya and chicken meat), on (ii) contract scheme, and on (iii) farm type. Narayanan (2014) also performs a profit (coming from coordination) decomposition (loss) exercise: incomes realized by coordinated farmers are high enough to compensate higher costs due to the <b>cultivation</b> <b>contracts.</b> Chang et al. (2006) evaluated a program launched in Taiwan in 2005 to support the subscription to marketing contracts in the rice sector. Authors highlight that farms involved show, on average, greater returns (11 %), lower production costs (13 %) and that the combination of these dimensions results in a plus in the gross product margins (about 50 %). Finally, other Indian studies, concerning the same topic (Tripathi et al. 2005; Singh 2007; Gulati et al. 2008), demonstrate both higher costs and returns associated to <b>cultivation</b> <b>contracts,</b> with the latter caused by increased yields, higher prices, as well as by reduction of transaction costs (for specialized warehouses, transportation, marketing).|$|R

It currently has 100 acres of vineyard under <b>contract</b> <b>cultivation</b> with local growers. About 550 tonnes of fruit will be sourced from local growers. [...] A Cool Room has been installed at the winery, which ensures that the grapes are cooled and maintained at a temperature of 16 degrees after harvesting, ideal for creating more aromatic and flavorful wines.|$|R
50|$|FES {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{organizations}} focused on giving India’s rural poor rights to common land (“the Commons”). Commons in India have been continuously projected as 'wastelands' and diverted for alternate uses such as biofuel <b>cultivation,</b> corporate <b>contract</b> farming and industrial zones. While more than 90% of India’s population depends on the Commons for their livelihood, few have formal rights to these resources. To challenge the growing threats that Commons face from their reallocation, over exploitation and encroachment, FES launched the ‘Commons Initiative’ in 2009. The Initiative aims to build strategic collaborations and bring together practitioners, decision-makers and scholars for a long-term campaign that would influence policy and programmatic action on Commons in India. In this regard, FES works towards representing landless communities, organizing long-term leasing arrangements and securing tenure with State governments.|$|R

In 2000, a company called Phyto Nova (Pty) Ltd. initiated large-scale <b>cultivation</b> and <b>contract</b> manufacturing of tablets, made from the powdered herb (i. e. thin stems and leaves). Most of these commercial Sutherlandia solid dosage forms are made from the dried leaf powder but recently a new product, viz.

However, the pharmaceutical quality and stability of these preparations have not yet been investigated. The objectives of this study were firstly, to develop a validated stability-indicating HPLC assay for sutherlandioside B (SU-B); secondly, to compare the SU-B levels in the two commercially available Sutherlandia products viz, the Phyto Nova Sutherlandia SU 1 ™ tablet and the Promune™ capsule, and, thirdly, to determine the effect of elevated temperature and humidity as well as acid hydrolysis on the SU-B levels in these two products.

According to the results, experts have put profitability secure {{at the top of}} development of plant factory industry. It is urgently needed in economic sector that products from plants factory secure the market and adjust the shipping date through <b>contract</b> <b>cultivation</b> and year-round production. Also, illuminant technology is also important in technology development section and R&D. On the other hand, consumers do not yet fully understand the benefits of the plant factory, and this will lead to continued slow sales.

40|$|Contract {{farming is}} an {{agreement}} between farmers and processing and/or marketing firms for the production and supply of agricultural products under forward agreements, frequently at predetermined prices. Marigold {{is one of the}} most commonly grown flower crops used extensively as decorative plants, religious and social functions in different forms. It has gained importance amongst the growers and flower dealers on account of its easy cultivation and commercial uses. Considering the importance of contract farming in marigold, the present study has been undertaken to study the resource use efficiency in marigold <b>cultivation</b> under <b>contract</b> farming and to suggest policy measures to promote contract farming for sustainable increase in production and income of marigold farmers. The collected data were analysed by adopting average and percentage analyses, Cobb- Douglas and Stochastic Frontier production functions. The following findings and policy implications emerged from the study. The results of Cobb-Douglas production function would show that the inputs namely potassium, seed, irrigation, farm yard manure, plant protection chemicals, human labour and machine power were found to contribute significantly and positively to the yield. However the MVP/MFC ratios indicated the scope to increase the use of only nutrient potassium, seed, plant protection expenses, and machine power. The major problems faced by contract farmers were low price for the produce, labour scarcity, and non-provision of advance by the firm for growing marigold. In the case of non-contract farming the major problem was rejection of the produce in the market followed by price fluctuation, poor quality inputs, labour scarcity, problems in transportation for marketing the produce and lack of technical advice in cultivating marigold...|$|R
40|$|The {{substantial}} agricultural entry by the enterprises {{other than}} the agricultural production legal person had been done before nationwide development of the designated "structural reform district (Kozo-Kaikaku Tokubetsu Kuiki) " of 2005. It {{is divided into two}} routes of "Entry into the facilities type agriculture that doesn't use the farmland" and "Entry (The agricultural production legal person's establishment by support from the enterprise to the farmer institution etc. is included) by the <b>contract</b> <b>cultivation</b> method". The enterprise acquired directly of the farmland and was able to borrow neither by two routes. The introduction of the lease method from 2005 and the revision Agricultural Land Law enforcement in 2009 that succeeds it do not pass the agricultural production legal person's establishment in addition to two the above-mentioned routes and enable the farm management by the farmland borrowing. As a result, the technique of the agricultural entry by a general enterprise changed greatly. The construction industry and the food business are occupying many to the type of business of the enterprise that enters agriculture. And there is a regionality in the region where the enterprise enters agriculture, and the construction industry enters the region for which the regional economy depends on the investment in public works. A lot when industry related to food enters an active region of agriculture, such as Hokkaido and Tohoku, on the other hand. Food companies often enter agriculture for a stable securing of the ingredient and process materials used by itself, and execute the production method with sticking to of organic farming etc. In this text, the feature with a general not only the its company production of farm products but also connection of the farmer in the region to the production contract dealings of food companies to enter agriculture in addition for securing a stable product was extracted. 2009 年度秋季大会シンポジウム共通論題「農地制度改革と農業参入、農業生産法人...|$|R
