5000|$|In {{scientific}} photography it {{was soon}} observed that when using photographic films with very high contrast (also known as lith films), the image produced by the Sabatier effect exhibited a multitude of lines of various width, representing a specific amount of exposure within a certain range. This led {{to the use of}} the Sabatier effect for obtaining first and second order equidensities for photogrametry and equidensitometry. Interpretation or measurement of an image is sometimes aided by simplification of the density pattern. By use of tone separation or equidensitometry a <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image</b> can be converted into a single iso-density line delineating a contour of equal density. This results in data reduction and enables keying (areas or lines with iso-densities to unique patterns, grey values or colours). This keying to singular grey- or colour values is known in modern image processing as using L.U.T.s. Some applications for equidensitometry are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Inks used {{in color}} {{printing}} presses are semi-transparent {{and can be}} printed {{on top of each}} other to produce different hues. For example, green results from printing yellow and cyan inks {{on top of each other}}. However, a printing press cannot vary the amount of ink applied to particular picture areas except through [...] "screening," [...] a process that represents lighter shades as tiny dots, rather than solid areas, of ink. This is analogous to mixing white paint into a color to lighten it, except the white is the paper itself. In process color printing, the screened image, or halftone for each ink color is printed in succession. The screen grids are set at different angles, and the dots therefore create tiny rosettes, which, through a kind of optical illusion, appear to form a <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image.</b> You can view the halftoning, which enables printed images, by examining a printed picture under magnification.|$|E

40|$|A {{halftone}} {{image is}} needed when the output device is {{not capable of}} reproducing the <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image.</b> There are two fundamental problems in halftone imaging, i. e. synthesis and reconstruction, which we will address in this work. In synthesis, the objective is coverting the <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image</b> to a binary image {{in such a way}} that the rendered image gives the viewer the impression of tonal graduation similar to the original <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image.</b> In this work, we will consider synthesis process for the discrete-parameter images. The objective in the reconstruction problem, which can be considered as the an inverse process to the synthesis, is reconstruction of the <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image</b> from its halftone version. ^ In the first part of this work, after careful study of screening and Fourier spectrum of discrete-parameter halftone image, we propose two iterative methods to reconstruct a <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image</b> from its halftone version which has been generated by screening. To be able to apply these methods, we need to know the screen function which can be considered as the distortion operator. Thus, we estimate the screen function from the halftone image. Successive approximation is used as the first method of the reconstruction and Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) is used as the second method. In both methods, the optimum relaxation parameters are found and employed to speed up the convergence rate. A new technique for relaxing the constraint on the bandwidth of frequency domain operator is proposed to achieve a sharp reconstructed image. ^ The second part of this work deals with the synthesis or design of optimum halftone image for the display device and printer. A model based approach, where the characteristics of the output device is an intrinsic part of halftoning algorithm, is introduced. In addition to the characteristics of the output device, the human visual system along with other perceptual factors are explicitly incorporated to define an error metric in order to measure the quality of the halftone image. Direct Binary Search (DBS) is used to find the halftone image which has the minimum difference between perceived, displayed/printed <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image</b> and the perceived, displayed/printed halftone image. Since the algorithm is iterative, it is computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a lookup-based efficient method, which reduces the computational cost substantially. ^ Although there are similarities between a display and a printer as the output devices, the differences like nonlinearity in the phosphor luminance in the display device and non-additivity caused by dot overlap for the printer, would require different approaches for modeling these devices. The spot model for the display device and printed dot for the printer are measured. The synthesis algorithm includes the gamma compensation for the display device and the effect of non-additive dot overlap for the printer. ...|$|E

40|$|Context {{modeling}} is an extensively studied {{paradigm for}} lossless compression of <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>images.</b> However, without careful algorithm design, high-order Markovian modeling of <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>images</b> {{is too expensive}} in both computational time and space to be practical. Furthermore, the exponential growth {{of the number of}} modeling states in the order of a Markov model can quickly lead to the problem of context dilution; that is, an image may not have enough samples for good estimates of conditional probabilities associated with the modeling states. In this paper new techniques for context modeling of DPCM errors are introduced that can exploit context-dependent DPCM error structures to the benefit of compression. New algorithmic techniques of forming and quantizing modeling contexts are also developed to alleviate the problem of context dilution and reduce both time and space complexities.

40|$|Abstract —Digital halftoning is {{a process}} to convert a <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image</b> into a binary image with black and white dots. This process is {{necessary}} to print a <b>continuous-tone</b> <b>image</b> using printers. The Error Diffusion {{is one of the}} most popular methods of digital halftoning, because it can generates high quality output images with relatively low computing time. Binary images generated by the Error Diffusion are fine grained in the sense that they have a lot of isolated small black and white dots. However, fine binary images are not appropriate for practical printing, because isolated black and white dots may disappear by dot-gain or dot-loss. Hence cluster-dot halftoning, which generates binary images has no isolated black and white dots are important. It is known that the Error Diffusion with some feedback operation can generate clustered-dot binary images. However, the resulting binary images have strong directional characteristic, which spoils the printing results. The main contribution of this paper is to presents new filters of the Error Diffusion for cluster-dot halftoning with no directional characteristic. Quite surprisingly, it can generate cluster-dot binary images with no directional characteristic using our new filter. Also, the size of cluster can be adjusted by an additional feedback operation. The experimental results show that the Error Diffusion using our new filter can generate better quality binary images than the previously published know results...|$|E
