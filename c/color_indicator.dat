50|$|The <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> tube (also {{referred}} to as the Draeger Tube or Stain Tube) is a device many natural gas pipelines use for a quick and rough measurement of moisture. Each tube contains chemicals that react to a specific compound to form a stain or color when passed through the gas. The tubes are used once and discarded. A manufacturer calibrates the tubes, but since the measurement is directly related to exposure time, the flow rate, and the extractive technique, it is susceptible to error. In practice, the error can be as high as 25 percent. The <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> tubes are well suited for infrequent, rough estimations of moisture in natural gas; for example, if the tube indicates 30 pounds of water, there is a high degree of certainty that it is over 10 pounds.|$|E

40|$|The {{color of}} natural dyes, as anthocyanins, is very easily {{changing}} as he temperature changes. The color {{change can be}} used as a <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> to provide information about product deterioration due to its sensitivity toward temperature and light. This indicator is called smart label of <b>color</b> <b>indicator.</b> This film label can be made of chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol and extract of erpa (Aerva sanguinolenta) leaves. The extraction was done under various leaf:water ratios. The filming was done in 2 methods, i. e. (i) by mixing the extract into film solution and drying the film at 50 C; and (ii) by brushing the extract on the film surface. The leaf extract had a pH of 5. 09 and the total yield of 116. 65 mg anthocyanin/ 100 g leaves. Filming of <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> in mixing method and dried at 50 C resulted a colorless film. Brushing method was the best method to produce smart label with quite stable property and 1 mL extract could be applied evenly per 40 cm 2 film area.

40|$|The {{computer}} screen photo-assisted techniques (CSPT) {{have been developed}} during the last 10 years through an extensive collaboration between University of Rome “Tor Vergata” and Linköping University in Sweden. CSPT has thus evolved into a concept we now call {{computer screen}} assisted digital photography, yielding detailed information about the interaction between <b>color</b> <b>indicators</b> and (volatile) analytes. In the present paper, we give a brief summary of the CSPT concept and its connection to digital photography. We concentrate, however, on the most recent results, which were obtained by using most of the degrees of freedom offered by a computer screen as a light source and a digital (web) camera as a detector. Thus, we describe in detail recent experiments on cotton yarns impregnated with <b>color</b> <b>indicators</b> for volatile organic molecules. The interaction between the <b>color</b> <b>indicators</b> and molecules, like trimethylamine, was investigated by CSPT in high dynamic imaging together with a background noise limiting algorithm. It is shown that the simultaneous use {{of the last two}} additions to the CSPT concept considerably enhances the chemical sensing ability of CSPT. It is concluded that the collaboration between Rome and Linköping has generated a useful platform for further developments of chemical analysis with a ubiquitous instrumentation, a (computer) screen and a web camera. This technique is aimed at facilitating the assembly of opto-chemical sensors with evident benefits in the reduction of cost of sensor systems and in an increased integrability with the existent telecommunication infrastructures...|$|R

In this work, an experimental study of the buoyancy-driven hydrodynamic instabilities that can occur when two miscible reactive solutions of an acid-base system are put in contact in the gravity field shows that the patterns observed and the instabilities taking place strongly depend on the presence of a <b>color</b> <b>indicator.</b> A reaction-diffusion-convection model explains how the <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> can modify the instability scenarios by affecting the density of the solutions and allows one to numerically recover the observed experimental patterns.

40|$|Three color-indicating {{devices have}} been {{conceived}} as simple, rapid, inexpensive means of detecting hazardous liquid and gaseous substances in settings in which safety is of paramount concern {{and it would}} be too time-consuming or otherwise impractical to perform detection by use of such instruments as mass spectrometers. More specifically, these devices are designed for detecting hypergolic fuels (in particular, hydrazines) and hypergolic oxidizers in spacecraft settings, where occasional leakage of these substances in liquid or vapor form occurs and it is imperative to take early corrective action to minimize adverse health effects. With suitable redesign, including reformulation of their <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> chemicals, these devices could be adapted to detection of other hazardous substances in terrestrial settings (e. g., industrial and military ones). One of the devices is a pad of a commercially available absorbent material doped with a <b>color</b> <b>indicator.</b> The absorbent material is made from 70 percent polyester and 30 percent nylon and can absorb about eight times its own weight of liquid. The <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> is a mixture of conventional pH <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> chemicals. Hydrazine and monomethyl hydrazine, which are basic, cause the <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> to turn green. In the original intended application, the pad is wiped on a space suit that is suspected of having been exposed to leaking monomethyl hydrazine during a space walk, before the wearer returns to the interior of the spacecraft. If the wiped surface is contaminated with hydrazine, the pad turns green. In addition, the pad absorbs hydrazine from the wiped surface, thereby reducing or eliminating the hazard. Used pads, including ones that show contamination by hydrazine, can be stored in a sealed plastic bag for subsequent disposal. The second device, which has been proposed but not yet developed, would comprise a <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> material in the form of either a coating on a space suit (or other protective garment) or a coating on a sheet that could be easily attached to and detached from the protective garment. The coating material would be a hydrogel doped with a suitable pH indicator. The hydrogel would also serve to maintain a level of moisture needed to support the chemical reaction mentioned in the next sentence. In addition to changing color to indicate the presence of any hypergolic fuel (which is basic) or hypergolic oxidizer (which is acidic) that might splash on the space suit, the pH indicator would also react with the hypergolic fuel or oxidizer and thereby bind it. The third device is a color dosimeter for detecting hydrazine liquid or vapor coming from microscopic leaks. This device is designed to satisfy several requirements specific to its original intended use in the auxiliary power unit of the space shuttle. These requirements include stability under vacuum, stability at moderate temperature, fast and irreversible change in color upon exposure to hydrazine, and visibility of the color change through polyimide tape...|$|E

Different angles of bended channels and different ways of coalescence are compared. It is shown that the homogenization of the droplets can be reached in less than 10 ms after coalescence.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop a simple plating medium to allow {{large-scale}} screening of water samples for the presence of Helicobacter pylori. Five conventional plating media (brain heart infusion, brucella agar, Columbia blood agar base, campylobacter agar kit Skirrow, and HPSPA medium), each containing a commercial antibiotic supplement, were initially evaluated. Eight strains selected as common waterborne organisms (Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Helicobacter pylori, and Pseudomonas strains) were individually plated onto each of these media. Three organisms (Acinetobacter, E. coli, and H. pylori) were able to grow on all five media. This growth was unacceptable since Helicobacter grows very slowly and competing organisms must be inhibited for up to 7 days. Therefore, a more selective medium (HP agar) containing a novel mixture of growth supplements plus amphotericin B and polymyxin B was developed. This medium also included a phenol red <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> for urease production. Aliquots of nonsterile well water that contained native flora (Flavobacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Pasteurella, Ochrobactrum, Rahnella, and unidentified molds) and were further adulterated with the eight strains listed above (106 CFU of each strain per 100 ml) were spiked with H. pylori and were plated. In spite of the heavy mixed microbial load, only H. pylori colonies grew during 7 days of incubation at 37 °C. The <b>color</b> <b>indicator</b> system allowed presumptive identification of H. pylori colonies sooner (12 to 20 h) than the conventional media tested allowed.
