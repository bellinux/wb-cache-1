40|$|Providing more {{reliable}} warnings based on monitored Partial discharges (PDs) {{is one of}} the main issues in PD diagnostics at this time. Due to noise, sometimes it is difficult to recognize PD activities from a circuit with huge noise or noise may be interpreted as PDs by current operational knowledge rules. Service quality is not optimal due to those reasons. To solve these issues and give a better translation of the PD activities measured by SCG, this paper focus on creating a better approach of detecting and analysis PDs by improving current operational knowledge rules. The first part of this paper explores a new model for unit blocks in PD raw data preprocessing stage, which is able to enhance the difference of the output of a statistical analysis of a PD chart to distinguish between areas with events from real PDs and areas strongly impeded by noise. The second part of this paper focusses on implementing artificial neural network (ANN) to detect real PDs. The performance analysis in the end of this part indicates a good reliability of this method. Subsequently the output of ANNs is combined with Weibull fit curve fitting to analyze the risk of detected PDs. The data were obtained from historic data of failures/defects, measured with the Smart <b>Cable</b> <b>Guard,</b> a PD detection and location system available for medium-voltage cables.

60|$|And this {{spreading}} usurpation of {{the world}} was so dexterously performed--a proteus--hundreds of banks, companies, syndicates, masked the Council's operations--that it was already far advanced before common men suspected the tyranny that had come. The Council never hesitated, never faltered. Means of communication, land, buildings, governments, municipalities, the territorial companies of the tropics, every human enterprise, it gathered greedily. And it drilled and marshalled its men, its railway police, its roadway police, its house guards, and drain and <b>cable</b> <b>guards,</b> its hosts of land-workers. Their unions it did not fight, but it undermined and betrayed and bought them. It bought the world at last. And, finally, its culminating stroke was the introduction of flying.|$|R

25|$|Physical {{controls}} {{monitor and}} control {{the environment of the}} work place and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities. For example: doors, locks, heating and air conditioning, smoke and fire alarms, fire suppression systems, cameras, barricades, fencing, security <b>guards,</b> <b>cable</b> locks, etc. Separating the network and workplace into functional areas are also physical controls.|$|R
25|$|A cable barrier, {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>guard</b> <b>cable</b> or wire rope safety barrier (WRSB), is a type of roadside or median safety traffic barrier/guard rail. It consists of steel wire ropes mounted on weak posts. As is the case with any roadside barrier, its primary purpose is to prevent a vehicle from leaving the traveled way and striking a fixed object or terrain feature that is less forgiving than itself. Also similar to most roadside barriers, cable barriers function by capturing and/or redirecting the errant vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the fine stonework of the arch, the abutments and retaining walls are constructed of split-faced granite in irregular courses, wedged in place by stone chips. The northeast abutment continues along the river as a wing wall up to a massive stone pier, the former site of a mill dam. The southeast abutment is a granite reconstruction of coursed ashlar over concrete, done in 1951. The original granite coping which lined the roadway shoulders {{has been replaced by}} concrete with steel <b>guard</b> <b>cables,</b> c. 1920s.|$|R

Richard E. Lewis, USNR, in command.

A number of the Army mine planters also became U.S. Coast Guard vessels.

40|$|Resumo: Foi desenvolvido um simulador numérico-computacional de um sistema de proteção elétrica contra descargas atmosféricas em prédios. Este simulador permite prever a distribuição de corrente nos cabos guarda, obtendo também o Campo Eletromagnético no {{interior}} ou exterior da estrutura. Ambos, corrente e Campo. são determinados no domíniodo tempo. Com este sistema, a estrutura de proteção é considerada como uma interconexão de linhas de transmissão e sua definição em termos computacionais é bastante simplificada através da utilização de pontos em coordenadas cartesianas definindo o início e fim de cada linha. A distribuição de corrente através da estrutura foi obtida utilizando a TécnicaNumérica TLM (Transmission Line Modelling), a qual além de ser de fácil compreensão, exige pouco esforço computacional, dentre outras vantagens. o Campo Eletromagnético é determinado em um ponto qualquer do espaço (Campo próximo ou Campo distante) utilizando a Técnica de Diferenças Finitas no domínio do tempo (FD-TD), quando cada linha da estrutura é considerada como sendo uma antena linear e o solo perfeitamente condutor. Conhecendo-se o Campo Eletromagnético gerado. este sistema torna-se uma importante ferramenta para projetos de Engenharia de proteção, seja na busca de umamelhor distribuição de equipamentos eletro-eletrônicos no interior de um prédio, a fim de evitar que os mesmos sejam expostos a Campos elevados, ou seja na escolha de uma melhor geometria da estrutura a fim de diminuir o efeito de uma descarga atmosféricaAbstract: A numerical simulator of {{the lightning}} protection system of structures has been developed. The simulator predicts the current distribution on the <b>guard</b> <b>cables</b> and the assotiated electromagnetic fields. The {{calculations are done}} in the time domain. In this work, the protective structure {{is assumed to be}} composed of an interconnection of transmission lines. The computational definition of the structure is simplified through the use of cartesian coordinates defining {{the beginning and the end}} of each line. The current distribution along the structure has been obtained by using the numerical technique TLM (Transmission Line Modelling), which is one of easy comprehension and demands 10 w computational efforts. The eletromagnetic field is determined at any point in space (near and far fields) using the Finite Diferences Technique in the time domain (FD- TD), where each line of the structure is considered as a linear antena and the ground is considered as an ideal conductor. Knowing the electromagnetic field generated, this approach becomes an important tool to be used in protection engineering projects in order to find the best distribution of electric and electronic equipments inside the building, avoiding the exposition to high fields, or to choose the best design of the structure, so reducing the efect of lightning. The results obtained with the simulator are in agreement with measurements and with analitical solution...|$|R
