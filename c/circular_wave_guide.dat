30|$|Microwave {{reactors}} can {{be designed}} to function in two different modes: multimode and monomode (also referred to as single-mode) reactors. In multimode reactor instruments (which {{is similar to a}} domestic oven in concept), the microwaves that enter the cavity are reflected by the walls and the load over the typically large cavity. In most instruments a mode stirrer ensures that the field distribution is as homogeneous as possible. In the much smaller monomode cavities, the electromagnetic irradiation is directed through an accurately designed rectangular or <b>circular</b> <b>wave</b> <b>guide</b> onto the reaction vessel mounted at a fixed distance from the radiation source, thus creating a standing wave. The key difference between the two types of reactor systems is that in multimode cavities several reaction vessels can be irradiated simultaneously in multi vessel rotors (parallel synthesis), in monomode systems only one vessel can be irradiated at any time. In the latter case high throughput can be achieved by integrated robotics that move individual reaction vessels {{in and out of the}} microwave cavity [133].|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The <b>circular</b> <b>wave</b> basin {{provides}} a means of physically modeling the nearshore without the typical problems associated with end walls. Three different coastal processes were examined to demonstrate {{the use of a}} spiral wavemaker in a <b>circular</b> <b>wave</b> basin. These were longshore currents, shear waves, and groin circulation. A beach was designed and constructed to concentrate breaking in a narrow region and minimize wave reflection. Currents in the longshore direction were generated by both the motion of the wavemaker and oblique wave approach. Two methods for measuring nearshore currents were employed. First, a 3 -D acoustic current meter was positioned at various locations in the cross shore and the local radial and tangential velocities were recorded. Second, a video camera was placed approximately 8 meters above the wave basin to record the motion of a ball in the nearshore. The video tape was digitized by an image processor and the motion of the ball was determined. Measurements of nearshore circulation in the <b>circular</b> <b>wave</b> basin were used to investigate longshore currents, shear waves, and groin circulation. Average measured longshore current profiles in the cross shore were compared with numerical model predictions. An analysis of the existence of shear <b>waves</b> in the <b>circular</b> <b>wave</b> basin was performed by calculating longshore and cross shore current spectra. Particular attention was focused on the low frequency end of the spectra where shear waves are most energetic. Model groins were placed in the <b>circular</b> <b>wave</b> basin and measured currents were compared to predicted circulation patterns. All three applications indicated that the <b>circular</b> <b>wave</b> basin is a useful device for simulating coastal processes in a laboratory environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{wide-band}} detector for the 1. 0 to 1. 6 mm atmospheric {{transmission window}} {{has been developed}} for astronomical observations at the McDonald Observatory 2. 7 m optical telescope. For observations of continuum astronomical sources, the relevant figure of merit is the « Noise Equivalent Temperature » or δ Trms. The present δ Trms = 0. 25 K for a 1 s observation. The astronomical objects which have been observed so far include the sun, moon, Venus, Jupiter, 3 C 273 and the galactic center. With the present detector sensitivity, a 1 mm source of 0. 7 flux units would give a signal to noise of one for a 3 h observation at the NRAO 11 m telescope. The detector uses a point contact Josephson junction, with a niobium point against tin.

The wide-band mode of operation is used, in which the incident continuum radiation from an astronomical source causes a depression of the junction critical current. The junction is biased with a 20 Ω source resistance, and the change in bias voltage due to the change in the junction critical current is measured. Two modes are used to chop the 1 mm radiation incident on the junction. For bright astronomical sources such as the sun and the moon, a total power chopper at the entrance of the wave-guide alternately opens and closes the radiometer entrance. For faint sources, a differential chopper chops between the source and adjacent sky...|$|E
