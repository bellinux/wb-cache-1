2500|$|Across {{the first}} seven years, since the entry into force of the Stability and Growth Pact, all EU Member States were {{required}} to strive towards a common MTO being [...] "to achieve a budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus over a complete business cycle - while providing a safety margin towards continuously respecting the government's 3% deficit limit". The {{first part of this}} MTO, was interpreted by the Commission Staff Service to mean continuously achievement each year throughout the business cycle of a [...] "cyclically-adjusted budget balance net of one-off and temporary measures" [...] (also referred to as the [...] "structural balance") at minimum 0.0%. In 2000, the second part was interpreted and operationalized into a <b>calculation</b> <b>formula</b> for the MTO also to respect the so-called [...] "Minimal Benchmark" [...] (later referred to as [...] "MTO Minimum Benchmark"). When assessing the annual Convergence/Stability programmes of the Member States, the Commission Staff Service checked whether the structural balance of the state complied with both the common [...] "close to balance or surplus" [...] criteria and the country-specific [...] "Minimal Benchmark" [...] criteria. The last round under this assessment scheme took place in Spring 2005, while all subsequent assessments were conducted according to a new reformed scheme - introducing the concept of a single country-specific MTO as the overall steering anchor for the fiscal policy.|$|E
2500|$|For example, if a user had a $1,000 {{transaction}} and repaid it in full {{within this}} grace period, {{there would be}} no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized {{on the back of the}} monthly statement. The general <b>calculation</b> <b>formula</b> most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the annual percentage rate (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB). [...] Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail finance charge (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).|$|E

The diameter of each disk can be expressed as some fraction of the average crown spread. Whether the tree is taller and each disk represents a greater length of the crown, or if the crown spread is larger or smaller, each disk will represent the same fraction of the total volume of the crown. Consider that there must be a single cylinder of the same height as the crown thickness that has the same volume as the irregularly shaped crown. The problem then becomes one of determining the diameter of this cylinder so that its volume equals that of the crown of the tree. The volume of each of the individual disks can be calculated by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: ...|$|E
