40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} a sensorimotor behavioral test that predicts infarct volume in animals with ischemic stroke. Stroke is the major cause of behavioral deficits in humans and research on stroke therapies require that neuroprotective compounds should both reduce infarct volume and improve performance. Previous work from our lab shows that estrogen treatment to older acyclic female rats increases infarct volume as compared to animals that have not received estrogen. Here, we used estrogen replaced and estrogen deficient animals and tested their behavior with the <b>corner</b> <b>test,</b> in conjunction with three other behavioral assays (the forelimb placement test, the rotarod test, and the four-point neurological score test). Our goal was to determine whether or not there is a correlation between performance during the <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> and ischemic volume. In this study, 16 acyclic (reproductively senescent) rats were used and assigned to one of two groups: one group received estrogen treatment after being ovariectomized via a gradual release pellet and the other did not receive an estrogen treatment. All the rats then went through a stroke surgery 3 weeks after the ovariectomy surgery. Before the stroke surgery, all rats also went through training on all behavioral assays and then were administered the assays again after the stroke surgery. Behavioral tests were performed every day after stroke, starting 24 hr after stroke. Our results indicate that there is a statistically significant negative correlation between performance on the <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> and infarct volume. These data suggest that the <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> may be a useful test for stroke studies that assess new therapeutic compounds...|$|E
40|$|Smoke {{production}} in fire represents a threat because fire smoke reduces visibility and because fire smoke is toxic. One {{way to reduce}} the risk of persons being overcome by smoke during evacuation is by setting requirements to the building materials’ ability to contribute to the smoke {{production in}} a fire. By regulating the use of building products based on their contribution to the optical smoke production in a fire, the toxicity aspects of the smoke will be covered to a high degree as well. In this work prediction models for optical smoke production in the Single Burning Item test (SBI) and in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test</b> have been developed. The models are of two kinds; classification models based on multivariate statistical analysis of Cone Calorimeter test results, and dynamic calculation models where empirically developed equations are combined with multivariate statistical classification models. The basic idea behind the dynamic smoke prediction models is that the smoke production rate is closely linked to the heat release rate. Prediction models for heat release rate in the two larger-scale methods were therefore a necessary starting point for the modelling of smoke production. Existing models simulating heat release in the SBI test and in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test</b> were modified to suit these needs; and were assessed to have high predictability after the modifications. My work comprise the following prediction models: •A modified version of the Wickström/Göransson model for prediction of heat release rate in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test.</b> •A statistical model for predicting time to flashover in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test</b> using the concept of FO-categories. •A model for predicting smoke production rate in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test.</b> •A statistical model predicting the level of maximum and average smoke production rate in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test.</b> •A modified version of the model by Messerschmidt et. al. for prediction of heat release rate in the Single Burning Item test. •A model for predicting smoke production rate in the Single Burning Item test. •A statistical model predicting the level of SMOGRA and the smoke classification in the Single Burning Item test. All models, both for prediction of heat release and smoke production, use results from Cone Calorimeter tests at heat flux level 50 kW/m 2 as input data. The empirical basis for the models is test data from a total of 65 different products. 32 of the products are tested both in the SBI test and in the Cone Calorimeter test; 56 are tested both in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test</b> and in the Cone Calorimeter test. Data from a total of 194 Cone Calorimeter tests have been analysed. Both the statistical classification models and the dynamic calculation models can easily be implemented in a PC worksheet, and the prediction results are readily achieved. The models’ predictability has been evaluated by comparing the predicted results to results from “real“ larger-scale tests, and by comparing predicted classification to the classification actually obtained. The actual and predicted classifications have been calculated according to the new European system for classification of building products based on reaction to fire test results, and according to the existing classification system based on the EUREFIC-programme. The results show that both heat release and smoke production are possible to predict with these models. The predictions of the Single Burning Item test results are more precise than the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test</b> results, this is probably because the ventilation conditions in the Cone Calorimeter test are more similar to the Single Burning Item test than to the conditions in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test.</b> The large-scale fire behaviour is found difficult to predict for some types of products where the fire behaviour depends on certain mechanical or chemical changes during the fire exposure. Such events are obviously not easily predicted from small-scale tests in the Cone Calorimeter, and will need more detailed modelling. This thesis presents a generic method of designing prediction models where test results from small-scale methods are used to predict fire behaviour in larger scale. The main feature of this kind of models is the integration of multivariate statistical models in the calculations. Statistical information makes it possible to discriminate between different kinds of products and fire behaviour, and thereby to choose calculation algorithms specially designed for different product groups. Products with high flamespread ability, products with low heat release, products with high smoke production and wood-based products are examples of product types that require special treatment in the modelling of fire behaviour in the Room <b>Corner</b> <b>test</b> and in the SBI test. Modelling of other large-scale test methods may need the option of discriminating between other kinds of groups, based on e. g. product type, geometrical considerations etc. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new intermediate-scale {{fire test}} has been {{developed}} as a screening tool to evaluate wall and ceiling assemblies for material flammability. The scale of the test is large enough for the tested materials to reveal their behavior in a full-scale fire, but still small enough to provide substantial cost savings compared to 25 -ft and 50 -ft <b>corner</b> <b>tests</b> used for decades to evaluate wall/ceiling panels and other building materials. The test consists of parallel panels of the material assemblies being evaluated, which are each 1. 07 m wide and 4. 9 m high and separated by 0. 53 m. A 360 kW propane sand burner is used as the ignition source. The parallel panel test is conducted under a 5 -MW fire products collector to measure fire heat release rate (HRR). Materials used during development of the new test include various thicknesses of: polyvinylchloride, fire retardant plywood, fiberglass-reinforced melamine and panels with metal facings over foamed polyurethane, polystyrene, and polyisocyanurate. Comparisons with the 25 -ft and 50 -ft <b>corner</b> <b>tests</b> indicate that fire propagation behavior in the <b>corner</b> <b>tests</b> correlates well with the maximum HRR in the parallel panel test as follows: fire will not propagate {{to the end of}} the test array in the 25 -f...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of {{functional}} outcome {{over the course}} of several weeks after ischemia is a key component in improving the clinical relevance of experimental stroke studies. Using a battery of behavioral tests, we characterized functional outcome in mice over 4 weeks following 30 min of proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). We evaluated rotarod, chimney, pole and cylinder tests to assess short term functional deficits in a transient stroke model which induces infarcts mainly in the striatum. The <b>corner</b> <b>test,</b> adhesive removal test, cylinder test, catwalk, paw preference test and novel tests of rotation were evaluated for long-term functional outcome. Rotarod detected deficits within the first week and pole test was reliable up to intermediate time points after MCAo. <b>Corner</b> <b>test,</b> adhesive removal test, catwalk and paw preference test detected deficits for up to 4 weeks, as did the novel corner rotation and bowl tests. Chimney and cylinder test did not prove useful in our model of mild stroke. In summary, we established the pole test and rotarod as useful tools to evaluate sensory motor deficits early after mild stroke, and <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> and adhesive removal test at later time-points. Alternatively, corner rotation may be a suitable test of long-term function. Test batteries may be further complemented by catwalk and paw preference test for clinically relevant deficits. There was no correlation of behavioral outcome with lesion size at 28 days, and determining whether these tests are useful for detecting a potential benefit of neuroprotective or regenerative therapies requires further testing...|$|E
40|$|The {{flammability}} {{hazard assessment}} of wall and ceiling linings has occupied {{the attention of}} fire scientists and engineers and regulators over the last fifty years. Several tests (small, medium, and large) {{have been developed to}} classify the flammability of linings and predict their burning behavior in real enclosure fire situations. We examine in some detail three such efforts: (a) the development of an experimental room and a 9 ft vertical wall full scale test by Ferris leading to the Early Fire Hazard test in Australia, (b) the ISO room <b>corner</b> <b>test,</b> and (c) The new SBI (Single Burning Item test) which maybe the most thoroughly examined test in the history of flammability testing. Of these tests, the experimental room used by Ferris and the ISO room <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> may be considered as end use applications for medium size rooms whereas the SBI test and the vertical wall test by Ferris are intermediate scale test designed to represent the room fire behavior in a more controlled way. Performance criterion in the ISO room <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> is the time to reach flashover. Performance criteria in the SBI test are related to the fire growth in an open corner (no ceiling) configuration due to upward flame spread. Performance criterion in the experimental room of Ferris was the time to reach untenable conditions in the room. Finally, performance criterion in the vertical wall of Ferris was the time interval from ignition until the flames reach the top of the wall. Examination of all these efforts has led to consistently validating a new correlation of the performance criteria of these tests with small-scale cone calorimeter tests whenever both data are available. Previous correlations are also discussed. The new correlation compares well with essential features of upward flame spread as this is related to flammability properties. Comparison between the ISO room <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> and the SBI test leads to suggestions regarding the suitability of these tests as a regulatory tool. Some comments are also directed towards a new test method of parallel wall panels recently proposed by Fmglobal. This test method can be analyzed using the same methodology outlined in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Room <b>Corner</b> <b>Test</b> (ISO 9705) is {{used for}} {{classification}} of surface materials and as a reference scenario {{for a number of}} countries, such as the European Single Burning Item test. Due to the cost of a Room <b>Corner</b> <b>Test</b> it is of interest to predict the course of the test before it is performed. By using the model from Wickström and Göransson, which use the time to ignition and the complete heat release rate from a Cone Calorimeter test (ISO 5660), it is possible to predict a Room <b>Corner</b> <b>Test</b> quite good. However, because of the complexity of the model there has been a need for a program which simplifies the use of the model. The program is called Cone Tools and has been used in the process of the work. The aim of the report was to simplify the equation system of the burning area in Cone Tools and, if possible, improve it. Tests were also performed to see whether the correction factor in Cone Tools could be improved. The burning area equations have been done linear to simplify the system. All tests were conducted in Cone Tools 3. 2. 1 which has been recoded by the use of Visual Basic. The current and the modified model were compared against nine different products heat release rate curve to see which model that makes the best prediction. The result was very interesting were the modified model did better or as good prediction in most cases compared to the current model. Some products, such as Plywood and FR ESP, were predicted very well by the modified model. The correction factor between different irradiance levels in Cone Tools is very crude and it is therefore of interest to improve it. This was done by using the same quadratic expression, as in Cone Tools 3. 2. 1, but taking the heat loss from the surface into account. The result showed that the current correction factor gave a better translation when comparing them against different products. Nine tests are quite few to determine if the modified model will work for a large number of diverse products. Therefore, more test needs to be performed before the modified can be accepted as a new and improved model.

Previous research, evaluated a strain gauged BlackStone Tek motorcycle Ducati rim loaded to 700 Nm on a dynamic <b>cornering</b> <b>test</b> machine. In the current study, these experimental results were used to validate an FEA model of the BlackStone Tek Ducati rim. The validated FEA was used to investigate the feasibility of using carbon fibre to manufacture a passenger car rim. The FEA model did not include the aluminium hub, and the analysis was therefore considered valid for the spokes and rim only. The FEA strains of the Ducati rim spokes were within an acceptable 25 % correlation range with the experimental results. The FEA strains were generally higher than the experimental results. Having validated the FEA model, a carbon fibre passenger car rim, was analysed at a bending moment of 2000 Nm. The inverse of the factor of safety from the spoke to the rim section was below 1. This indicates that the newly designed rim should pass the dynamic <b>cornering</b> <b>test,</b> a vital standard proving that the rim is structurally durable to function on a small to medium sized passenger car.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{reaction}} to fire performanceof wood and other building products, andparticularly thematerial fire properties time to ignition, rate of heat releaseand smoke production. These properties have been measured by asmall-scale fire test method, the Cone Calorimeter, andpresented for different types of building products. Uncertainty analysis, included instrument and assumptionuncertainty, has been performed for the case that both O 2 andCO 2 are measured for calculation of {{the rate of heat}} release inthe Cone Calorimeter. The partial derivatives for theuncertainty analysis are given. The relative uncertainty forthe rate of heat release measurements in the Cone Calorimeteris between ± 5 % to ± 10 % for rate of heat releasevalues larger than about 50 kW/m 2. The time to ignition in the Cone Calorimeter is compatiblewith the time to ignition in the ISO Ignitability test, whichis the main test method for measuring time to ignition. Thetime to ignition is an increasing linear function of density. The rate of heat release in the Cone Calorimeter is dependentof material thickness and of use of retainer frame. Thematerial thickness gives the heat release curve duration andshape. Thin materials have short burning time and two maximumvalues. Thick materials have long burning time and when thematerial is thicker than about 35 mm no second maximum appears. When the retainer frame is used the actual exposed surface isreduced from 0. 01 m 2 to 0. 0088 m 2, the rate of heat release isreduced and the burning time is increased. A comparison ofresults with and without use of the retainer frame gives thenequal results when the exposed area is set to 0. 0088 m 2 in thecase of using the retainer frame. The time to flashover in the full-scale room <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> waspredicted on the basis of Cone Calorimeter data at 50 kW/m 2 bya power law of ignition time, the total heat release calculatedover 300 s after ignition and the density of the product. Therelation gives a simple relation to evaluate if a productreaches flashover in the room <b>corner</b> <b>test.</b> The smoke production has also been measured in the ConeCalorimeter. The white light and the laser smoke measurementsystems have shown similar results. There is a correlationbetween Cone Calorimeter and room <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> smoke productionwhen the products are divided into groups: those that reachflashover in the room <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> in less than 10 min and thosethat have more than 10 min to flashover.

40|$|By use of {{test data}} from the Cone Calorimeter bench scale test and two full scale fire tests (IS 0 Room <b>Corner</b> <b>Test</b> and CSTB Room Fire Test), {{relationships}} between smoke test data for the two scales were investigated. The study was based on test results for 38 products. Bench scale and full scale smoke production were normalized to either area burnt, mass loss or heat release and then compared. The most interesting parameter was smoke production per heat release, and for the products tested in the CSTB Room Fire Test there was found good correlation and a correlation coefficient of 0. 99. It was shown that smoke production in full scale was only about 45 - 60 % of what was found in bench scale, and this is probably due to secondary combustion which occurs in the hot smoke layer. Before a secondary combustion occurs, the room fire is ventilation controlled and can produce more smoke than is found in bench scale. Thus the full scale fire influence smoke production {{in a way that}} may hinder relationship between bench scale and full scale smoke parameters. Full scale smoke test {{data from the}} IS 0 Room <b>Corner</b> <b>Test</b> were difficult to calculate, due to problems with finding the net heat release from the burnt products and the estimated burnt area. A one-to-one relationship between bench scale and full scale for the average effective heat of combustion (~ h,,, ~) was found and the plot obtained a correlation coefficient of 0. 99.

The most striking and long-lasting (1 month) sensorimotor deficits were postural asymmetries on the <b>corner</b> <b>test,</b> bilateral skilled forepaw reaching deficits on the staircase test and a contralateral sensorimotor impairment on the adhesive removal test. MCAo animals showed normal spatial learning abilities on the Morris water maze test, but they displayed learning deficits measured by the passive avoidance test. This latter deficit was significantly correlated with both cortical and striatal damage. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of three tests that had never been reported in the mouse after ischemia: the adhesive removal, staircase and pole tests, which showed deficits 1 month after ischemia and should therefore constitute meaningful tools in mice for assessing both neuroprotective and regenerative therapies in stroke preclinical studies...|$|E

This paper describes an improved pocket toolpath by inserting biarc transitions segments in contour-parallel toolpath. When reaching the sharp corner, the cutter moves along the biarc transitions toolpath {{so that the}} corner material is removed. The efficient toolpath is continuous for clearing {{residual material}} at sharp <b>corner.</b> Milling <b>test</b> has been conducted to demonstrate and verify {{the significance of the}} proposed method...|$|R
40|$|How {{can design}} {{interventions}} foster {{the use of}} public space for public debate? What might a twenty-first century speakers’ corner look like? How should the design process ensure that local people can contribute? The paper considers these questions through describing the collaboration between Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design (CSM), and Speakers’ Corner Trust (SCT). Between October 2008 and June 2011, MA Creative Practice for Narrative Environments (MACPfNE) staff and students: developed their conceptual thinking on creating / reclaiming spaces for citizenship; applied these ideas to the design of a generic speakers’ <b>corner,</b> <b>tested</b> in Litchfield, and at the Global Forum for Freedom of Expression in Oslo; developed a co-design approach to speakers’ corner whereby communities co-create their own version; tested this methodology in the process and implementation of a neighbourhood speakers’ corner in North London, and a pilot project for a speakers’ corner in every school. The case study projects suggest that the questions are inherently linked. Speakers’ corners interventions can affect the way public space is used and understood as a space for debate, if the process of their design and definition are done collaboratively from the start with local people. Case study projects also indicate the wider potential of the co-design methodology developed in the design of public spaces...|$|R

The injerto strategy is based on cooperative learning, and it is associated with the Science, Technology and Society (STS) educational approach, which got adapted to the WebQuest computer strategy. In {{the first part of the}} investigation, 34 students participated, building a concept map from the question, “What evolution is? ” It was then applied Cañas, Novak et al. ’s proposed taxonomy, selecting level 2 maps and up for conducting content analysis on these. This analysis focused on assessing whether if the concept map proposals showed categories profiling a proper high school degree scientific topic (definition, characteristics and examples), or not. The second part of the research consisted of developing a map including 29 concepts and their connectors about evolution conceptually speaking, basing on a WebQuest as source. Then, 18 concepts were removed from the full map, and collected into a list also given to the students, who got the task for picking and placing the right concept in the fields of the map accordingly with their best knowledge until the map was filled up. The same map and process got applied on another 49 -student group which had fully completed the evolution lesson, but never got into contact with the WebQuest. In this part of the research, we used the Structural Analysis of Concept Maps (SACMap) technique, (������������������������������ ������������� � ����� � ������� � �������), applying the Olmstead-Tukey <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> of association (������ � �� � ���������� � ��...|$|E
40|$|Design of {{multi-storey}} steel framed {{office and}} other commercial buildings for fire resistance {{has traditionally been}} undertaken {{on the premise that}} the building will suffer partial or total collapse unless the beams and columns are insulated from temperature rise under fully developed fire conditions. Since 1990, a growing body of evidence has shown that there is a substantial inelastic reserve of strength available from a typical composite steel beam/concrete floor slab system with uninsulated beams. An intensive research effort is underway in a number of countries {{to determine the extent of}} this reserve of strength and the mechanisms involved in its delivery. This research involves experimental testing and advanced finite element (FE) modelling. It is leading on to design procedure development to take account of the inelastic reserve of strength available from this type of building system. The most detailed experimental testing programme undertaken took place in 1995 and 1996 on an eight storey steel framed building at the former Cardington Large Building Test Facility in the UK. This programme included a number of large-scale fire tests using wood cribs and office furniture as the fuel. The University of Canterbury and HERA are involved in advanced finite element modelling of multi-storey steel framed buildings subject to severe fires. In order to validate the methodology and details used in this modelling, it is being applied to three of the LBTF fire tests. These are the BRE Large Enclosure Test, the Corus <b>Corner</b> <b>Test</b> and the Corus Demonstration Furniture Test. The first test uses wood cribs and generates near uniform fir...|$|E
40|$|In der vorliegenden Untersuchung wird die grundsaetzliche Vorgehensweise zur experimentellen Bestimmung der Verbrennungseffektivitaet X dargelegt und auf exemplarisch repraesentative Brandlasten angewendet. Im Hinblick auf allgemeingueltige Aussagen wurden zwei feste brennbare Stoffe - Holz und Polyethylen-Granulat - sowie zwei brennbare Fluessigkeiten - Hydraulikoel Mobil DTE Medium und Glykol - als Brandlasten gewaehlt. Der Versuchsaufbau entspricht dem sogenannten Room-Corner-Test (RCT) nach ISO 9705 mit dem {{international}} das Brandverhalten von Bekleidungsmaterialien und die Gefahr eines Feueruebersprunges in Raeumen im mittleren Massstab beurteilt wird. Unter Variation der Ventilationsoeffnung kann nach diesem Versuchskonzept auch das Maximum des effektiven Heizwertes bei ventilationsgesteuerten Braenden bestimmt werden. Durch Bezug des effektiven Heizwertes auf den genormten unteren Heizwert des betreffenden Stoffes laesst sich dessen Verbrennungseffektivitaet X errechnen. (orig.) The fundamental {{procedure for}} the experimental determination of the combustion effectiveness X is pointed out and applied in exemplary form to representative fire loads. In order to obtain generally valid statements, two flammable solids - wood and polyethylene granulate - and two flammable liquids -hydraulic oil Mobil DTE Medium and glycol - were chosen as fire loads. As an experimental setup, the room <b>corner</b> <b>test</b> (RCT) according to ISO 9705 was chosen, which is used internationally to judge the behaviour of clothing materials in case of fire and the danger of flashover in medium-sized rooms. Varying the ventilation opening, this experimental concept permits also to determine the maximum of the effective calorific value {{in the case of}} ventilation-dependent fires. By correlating the effective calorific value to the standardized lower calorific value of a given material, its combustion effectiveness X can be calculated. (orig.)
