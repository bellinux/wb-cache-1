Several gynaecologists who use temperature charts clinically were asked to score 60 charts taken from a selection of normal and infertile women, and their results were compared with those obtained by a group of non-experts. Since the full hormonal profiles had been obtained for each of the 60 charts the accuracy of the predictions could be assessed. About 80 % of the temperature charts were correctly interpreted by both groups as being either ovulatory or anovulatory but the day of ovulation was predicted correctly for only about 34 % of the charts. When the charts were examined retrospectively the thermal nadir was found to coincide with the luteinising hormone surge in 43 % of the charts from normal subjects but in only 25 % of those from the infertile patients.

We test whether commercially reared populations differ in their nectar foraging performance and whether this is influenced by both their source environment and the one they are introduced into. We do this by means of a reciprocal transplant experiment. Strong, consistent inter-population differences in performance occurred irrespective of test location: Canary Island bees (B. t. canariensis) were superior to Sardinian bees (B. t. sassaricus), which were generally superior to mainland European bees (B. t. terrestris). These inter-population differences in performance were largely explained by inter-population variation in forager size, with larger bees being superior foragers. However, even when body size was accounted for, â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cnativeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d bees were not superior to transplanted non-native bees in all but one case.

40|$|Most of {{the ethical}} debate about whether we should support human {{embryonic}} stem cell (hESC) research turns on a fundamental disagreement about how we should treat early human embryos. As it is currently done, the isolation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) involves dismantling the early human embryo – a process the embryo does not survive. Many people accord significant value to the human embryo (henceforth ‘embryo’) and think that embryos may not simply be used in whatever way suits our research interests. However, hESC research holds unique promise for developing therapies for currently incurable diseases, {{as well as for}} important biomedical research and drug and toxicity testing. This creates a dilemma: either one supports hESC research and accepts resulting embryo destruction, orone opposes hESC research and accepts that its potential benefits will be foregone. Of course, for some people there is no dilemma. If you believe an early human embryo is merely a collection of cells that has very little value in itself, the embryo’s moral status provides no reason to abstain from hESC research. On the other hand, if you believe that the embryo has the same moral status as a typical adult human, then isolating hESCs is equivalent to murder and is <b>clearly</b> <b>unjustified.</b> But for those who accord lesser but still significant moral status to the embryo, the dilemma is very real. A popular response to the dilemma has been to adopt some intermediate position between the dominant opposed ethical views that the moral status of the embryo always and never gives us decisive reasons to abstain from hESC research.

40|$|It is conjectured {{that several}} higher {{harmonic}} flows v_m {{may result from}} initial-state geometry fluctuations in å collisions coupled to a radially-expanding medium. But as with "elliptic flow" v_ 2 measurements, non-hydrodynamic mechanisms such as jet production may contribute to other higher azimuth multipoles v_m as biases. Careful distinctions should be maintained between jet-related and nonjet (possibly hydrodynamic) contributions to v_m (e. g., "nonflow" and "flow"). In this study we consider several questions: (a) To what extent do jet-like structures in two-dimensional (2 D) angular correlations contribute to azimuth multipoles inferred from various v_m methods? (b) If a multipole element is added to a 2 D fit model is a nonzero amplitude indicative of a corresponding flow component? and (c) Can 2 D correlations establish the necessity of nonjet contributions to some or all higher multipoles? Model fits to 2 D angular correlations are used to establish the origins of azimuth multipoles inferred from 1 D projections onto azimuth or from nongraphical numerical methods. We find that jet-like angular correlations, and specifically a 2 D peak at the angular origin consistent with jet production, constitute the dominant contribution to inferred higher multipoles, and the data do not require higher multipoles in isolation from the jet-like 2 D peak. Inference of "higher harmonic flows" results from identifying certain nominally jet-like structure as flow manifestations through <b>unjustified</b> <b>application</b> of 1 D Fourier series analysis. Although the peak structure at the angular origin is strongly modified in more-central collisions some properties remain compatible with relevant pQCD theory expectations for jet production.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} systematic analysis of when an individual or group {{has a right to}} secede that is grounded in self-determination. Since the primary question in a secessionist conflict concerns the territory being contested, any analysis of the right to secede must provide an account of what grounds the existing state's claim to political jurisdiction over its territory. With this in mind, I examine consent and teleological justifications for the state and find both inadequate. The consent account posits that a political state is justified just in case it has the consent of its citizens. I reject the consent approach for its unacceptable implication that unlimited secession is permissible from all existing states. I then suggest that our disinclination to allow unlimited secession is instructive since it indicates not only that we believe a consentual justification is morally unnecessary, but also that a state is justified in virtue of the peace it secures and the rights it protects. This teleological justification ultimately proves inadequate as well, however, because it both restricts secessionist movements that seem permissible and allows coercive annexations that appear <b>clearly</b> <b>unjustified.</b> As an alternative to these extremes, I propose a hybrid model of political legitimacy. According to my theory, while individuals and small groups may not secede, a larger group may, provided it is of sufficient size to satisfactorily perform the functions that are necessary for a state to ground its claim to territory. Thus I conclude a political state should limit political liberty in a manner analogous to the way it legitimately limits the liberty to drive a car. Specifically, since many people would be harmed if there were no legal restrictions on who could drive, states institute age and health requirements limiting who may drive. Citizens not eliminated by these standards must also demonstrate a minimum threshold of competence by passing tests. In similar fashion, a state may initially restrict the right to secede to groups of a specific size, and then further require that interested parties demonstrate their ability and willingness to govern in a stable, efficient, and liberal manner...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of collisional transfer of intensity due to line mixing has an increasing importance for atmospheric monitoring. From a theoretical point of view, all relevant {{information about the}} collisional processes is contained in the relaxation matrix where the diagonal elements give half-widths and shifts, and the off-diagonal elements correspond to line interferences. For simple systems such as those consisting of diatom-atom or diatom-diatom, accurate fully quantum calculations based on interaction potentials are feasible. However, fully quantum calculations become unrealistic for more complex systems. On the other hand, the semi-classical Robert-Bonamy (RB) formalism, which has been widely used to calculate half-widths and shifts for decades, fails in calculating the off-diagonal matrix elements. As a result, in order to simulate atmospheric spectra where the effects from line mixing are important, semi-empirical fitting or scaling laws such as the ECS (Energy-Corrected Sudden) and IOS (Infinite-Order Sudden) models are commonly used. Recently, while scrutinizing {{the development of the}} RB formalism, we have found that these authors applied the isolated line approximation in their evaluating matrix elements of the Liouville scattering operator given in exponential form. Since the criterion of this assumption is so stringent, it is not valid for many systems of interest in atmospheric applications. Furthermore, it is this assumption that blocks the possibility to calculate the whole relaxation matrix at all. By eliminating this <b>unjustified</b> <b>application,</b> and accurately evaluating matrix elements of the exponential operators, we have developed a more capable formalism. With this new formalism, we are now able not only to reduce uncertainties for calculated half-widths and shifts, but also to remove a once insurmountable obstacle to calculate the whole relaxation matrix. This implies that we can address the line mixing with the semi-classical theory based on interaction potentials between molecular absorber and molecular perturber. We have applied this formalism to address the line mixing for Raman and infrared spectra of molecules such as N 2, C 2 H 2, CO 2, NH 3, and H 2 O. By carrying out rigorous calculations, our calculated relaxation matrices are in good agreement with both experimental data and results derived from the ECS model...|$|R

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate diagnosis, treatment and prescription writing capability of graduating interns for common clinical scenarios. Materials and methods : This was a cross sectional study assessing the prescription writing ability of 41 interns for 10 common clinical situations based on an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE).

40|$|Summary Unjustified {{enrichment}} is {{an obvious}} part of the jurisprudence {{in the majority of}} countries in Europe. But not in the Nordic countries, and certainly not in Sweden. This depiction of the Swedish posture is based mostly on Hellner’s thesis from 1950. A lot has happened since then, not to mention Sweden’s entry in to the EU. It is therefore of great importance to awaken the debate about unjustified enrichment and its application in Swedish law. Does unjustified enrichment constitute a legal principle or a judicial political argument? What are its prerequisites and how can these be understood? An analysis of possible answers to these questions may shed new light over, what have been for some time, a denounced concept. The answers {{are to be found in}} not only in judicial doctrines, but in legislation and court cases. Because of the niggardly Swedish attitude an outlook is made in to the EU to show eventual contrasts regarding unjustified enrichment. The EU is one of the most influential international actors in terms of the Swedish judicial apparatus. For example a Norwegian doctor of Laws presents an innovative and legitimate systematization of the different claims that can be grounded on unjustified enrichment. The systematization is based on that unjustified enrichment should be an own discipline, distinguished from both contract law and tort law. A logical following-up is whether unjustified enrichment is necessary or not in Swedish law. Such a discussion is intelligible based on a rather subjective point of view. More recent judicial doctrine seems to be much more positively disposed towards unjustified enrichment as a legal principle or judicial political argument, in comparison with Hellner. This might be due to the influence of the EU and its member states. Other important factors may be the court cases that recently have enabled the possibility to plead for compensation based on unjustified enrichment in court, in a completely different manner than before. Although a variety of statutory provisions indicates that unjustified enrichment is already a part of Swedish law. Yet traces from the Scandinavian realism can be found in both judgements and legislations, since the notion unjustified enrichment is rarely mentioned directly. The discussion of unjustified enrichment’s necessity or uselessness shows both its weaknesses, but also obvious strengths. Limiting <b>unjustified</b> enrichment’s <b>application</b> is essential to receive any recognition, but its necessity is indisputable, particularly under consideration that it de facto already constituted as part of Swedish law...|$|R

The time it took to get results from a polling place to the corresponding CEDAT was also directly related to the average distance between the polling place and the CEDAT. Almost two thirds of Calderón's votes came from districts with very low marginalization, arriving first, with almost three percentage points advantage over López Obrador. Moreover, it was only on those districts that Calderón obtained victories, while López Obrador was ahead mainly in districts with low, medium, and high marginalization; Madrazo only won in some districts with very high marginalization.

40|$|In {{a recent}} Letter, Cottingham, Kalafatis and Vinh Mau [1] studied, within the Lee-Wick model, the {{formation}} of quark stars in the cosmological quark-hadron phase transition. They conclude that {{the formation of}} quark stars with the solar baryon number N ⊙ ∼ 10 57 requires {{a high degree of}} supercooling which can be achieved with a reasonable choice of the parameters of the Lee-Wick model. We show below that the cosmological quark-hadron phase transition in the Lee-Wick model with such a high degree of supercooling cannot be completed and thus no quark stars can be formed in this scenario. Conclusions of Ref. [1] are {{based on the assumption that}} the expansion of the Universe is dominated by radiation during the phase transition, with the scale factor R(t) ∼ √ t. This assumption is, however, <b>unjustified.</b> For cosmological <b>application,</b> the potential energy of the Lee-Wick model has to be chosen properly. The very small value of the cosmological constant requires that the energy of the true vacuum, σ = σvac, is essentially zero, U(σvac) = 0. Then the energy of the false vacuum, σ = 0, is U(0) = B> 0. With this choice of U, when the degree of supercooling is as high as required in Ref. [1], the phase transition is slow and the expansion of the Universe becomes soon dominated by the vacuum energy B. As a result, bubbles of a new phase do not percolate. To show that the phase transition is slow we compare the bubble nucleation rate, Γ(t), and the expansion rate, H(t), by calculating the dimensionless quantity ǫ(t) = Γ(t) /H(t) 4 [2].

40|$|Liability {{insurance}} in claims disputes 1. Object of the Study Liability insurances have {{a central role}} in the control of damage and liability. Among other things, liability insurances have an effect on the cover of those suffering the damage, compensation norms and compensation practices. The liability for damages is also of special nature as an insurance risk, since it requires the acknowledgement of a normative legal relationship, i. e. liability for compensation. The developmental span of an insured event can be remarkably long and extend from the act which caused the damage to the res judicata award of damages. Despite the significance and the special nature of liability insurances, it has not been the subject of actual insurance law studies published in Finland. The purpose of this study is, for its own part, to make up for this deficiency. In particular, the study focuses on problems during the stage of filing insurance claims. The study investigates the relationship of the insurer and the insured from three different thematic perspectives, these being: 1) the legal repercussions and requirements of an insurer s claims settlement decision, 2) the insurer s right to control the insured event and 3) the distribution of expenses between the insurer and the insured. Each of these segments is divided into several individual legal questions, of which interpretational recommendations will be made. These more particularised questions will also be subjected to evaluations on how well the Finnish Insurance Contracts Act (ICA) accounts for the special characteristics of general liability insurances and how the established terms and conditions of insurance policies relate to the said Act s provisions. In spite of the focus on general liability insurance, this approach enables the evaluation of several questions of a general significance with regard to insurance law. The status of the damaged party will mainly be looked at only from the perspective of the mutual relationship between the insurer and the insured. The study s scope encompasses both corporate and consumer insurances. It will also take note of the terms and conditions prevalent in the industry and propose interpretational recommendations thereof. The following consists of a markedly simplified summary of this investigation s results. 2. An Insurance Company s Decision-making When deciding upon the payment of insurance compensation against liability insurance, the insurer usually has three options. It can either deny its liability for compensation based on the policy s limitation on liability, approve the claim and pay the settlement, or acknowledge the alleged liability of the insured to fall within the scope of the policy s coverage but deny liability for compensation on the grounds that the insured is not liable for damages. In the latter case, the insurer according to the terms and conditions of the policy is usually obligated to initiate investigations to clarify the insured s liability for damages. The decision-making of the insurer involves a number of issues with legal import, which are discussed in chapter 3. Pursuant to the provisions of section 70 of the Insurance Contracts Act, the insurer is obligated to initiate activities on behalf of the insured. The period of time is calculated on the basis of obtaining the clarification concerning the liability, meaning that settling the claims on behalf of the insured first is not required. The burden of proof is divided according to conventional compensation debt relations so that it is the obligation of the insured to prove that a liability for compensating a third party has arisen, and the obligation of the insurer to prove the grounds for limited liability possibly applicable to the case. In reality, the actual burden of proof concerning the insured s liability for damages in general liability insurances is usually borne by the party claiming damages. From the perspective of the insurer s and the insured's mutual relation, however, the burden of proof rests with the insured. The insurer despite the limitation on liability referred to in section 9 (2) of the Insurance Contracts Act can be found to be liable to compensate the damage, provided that the insured will be granted with a sufficient degree of trust regarding the settlement of claims. An effect of this kind may occur as a result of, e. g. the insurer s continued defence of the insured against the claim for damages while being aware of a limitation-of-liability factor possibly applicable to the case. The insurer is entitled to recover a compensation already paid only in exceptional cases. On the other hand, should such an entitlement arise, the insurer may not only be entitled to recover the actual compensation paid but the costs incurred in the insured s defence, regardless of whether the insurer s liability for costs was originally based on the provision concerning salvage costs as set forth in the Insurance Contracts Act (section 61) or the terms and conditions of the policy. The option of recovery may also arise as a consequence of the insured being found liable to compensate the insurer with the settlement which the latter has had to pay to the party claiming damages without cause. However, the usual prerequisite for recovery is that the insured has provided the insurer with misleading or incorrect information. In principle, the party suffering the damage is not liable to restore the compensation paid solely on the basis of an insurance coverage s inapplicability if the damaged party has been found to be entitled to the damages in the first place. 3. An Insurance Company s Right to Control an Insured Event A liability for compensation may arise through the long-term development of an insured event. This places emphasis on the insurer s need and its possibilities to participate in the control of an insured event in various ways. In practice, the insurer is always entitled to negotiate the compensation with the party claiming damages on the basis of the terms and conditions of the insurance and to take care of the legal proceedings on behalf of the insured. Nonetheless, an insurer s right to control the development of the insured event is often, all things considered, dependent on the interpretation of the norms of insurance law and, on an even wider scale, the definition of the relationship between the insurer and the insured. The purpose of chapter 4 is to evaluate issues relating to this. The problems surfacing in the chapter may have limited significance in connection with other types of insurance, in which the insurer is capable due to the development of the insurance risk of participating in the control of the insured event, in one way or another. The insured always has the ultimate right to decide its own status in a claims matter. The insurer, however, is, regardless of the terms and conditions of the policy, entitled to act on the insured s behalf without limitations even when the insured would be opposed to this, provided that the appropriate handling of the claims issue so demands. In accordance with section 32 of the Insurance Contracts Act, the insurer is entitled to give precautionary guidelines on how to prevent insured events. Should the insured not comply with such guidelines and the damage consequentially expand in scale, the insured will, as a rule, lose its right to compensation. However, in order to be considered binding, the insurer s guidelines must, in addition to being pertinent to the prevention of insured events, also be reasonably predictable as to their outcome. The commitment undertaken by the insurer on behalf of the insured and concerning the grounds for, or the amount of, compensation does not bind the insured, even to the extent of the deductible. Instead, in accordance with Finnish legal praxis (the Supreme Court 1990 : 12), the insured, with certain preconditions fulfilled, can become bound to a commitment concerning the insurer s procedures (the aforementioned ruling involved an extension of the time limit for the tort claim). According to typical insurance terms and conditions, the insurer is entitled to abandon further clarifications on a matter if it can come to agreement on the amount of compensation to be paid with the party suffering the damage, but the insured refuses to accept the settlement. Such terms and conditions also mean that the insurer s aggregate financial liability will be given a maximum limit. What these terms and conditions do not limit, however, is the insurer s liability in case the claim of the third party is <b>clearly</b> <b>unjustified.</b> The insurer nevertheless retains quite an extensive right, starting from the financial encumbrance brought on by legal proceedings, to make decisions as to the risks of litigation also in cases in which there is no certainty that the entered defence would be successful. The insurer s right to control the insured event requires that it receive information of the impending event at a sufficiently early time. However, section 73 of the Insurance Contracts Act does not stipulate that a claim be filed until a year from when the party entitled to compensation has become aware of such a right. The precise time of the commencement of the said period has been unclear with respect to liability insurance. This study recommends based on, inter alia, the judicial practice of the Insurance Complaints Board that the time be calculated from when the insured has become or should have become aware of its possible liability. The terms and conditions of general liability insurances which in practice require a more rapid notice than this are null and void when the Insurance Contracts Act is applied to them as statutory regulation. The terms and conditions determining the procedures of liability insurances, when considering their ultimate purpose, have to be viewed as the precautionary instructions referred to in section 31 of the Insurance Contracts Act.
