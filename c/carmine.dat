5|$|Fenmore was befriended by <b>Carmine</b> Basco (Marco Dapper), the {{man whom}} Lauren {{was having an}} affair with, while also trying to win over Summer again, who was {{crushing}} on Kyle Abbott (Hartley Sawyer). Fenmore asked Summer to their senior prom, and instead of going, Summer threw a party at her mother's penthouse. During a game of truth or dare, Fenmore was dared to kiss Summer, who had text messaged Kyle that she was in trouble. Kyle later punched Fenmore in the face; footage was caught on video and uploaded online, weakening Fenmore's social status. Afterward, he is befriended by Raven (Amanda Leighton); they go to a graduation party, do drugs and talk about their social struggles. When Fenmore discovers Carmine's affair with his mother, he isolates himself from his family and continues to do drugs. Afterward, he asks <b>Carmine</b> to help him obtain more drugs, and while he refuses, he finds Fenmore unconscious {{in the back of the}} local restaurant. When he awakens in the hospital, he tells his parents that <b>Carmine</b> gave him the drugs that he overdosed on, but he later confesses that this was a lie. After stealing drugs from the hospital and getting caught, Michael and Lauren send Fenmore to rehab.

Michael is later released after Fen confesses to killing <b>Carmine,</b> worrying his parents.|$|E

5|$|Some hemipterans {{are used}} to produce dyestuffs such as <b>carmine</b> (also called cochineal).

5|$|Textiles {{are made}} from both animal fibres, {{including}} wool and silk, and plant fibres, including cotton and flax. Dyestuffs too are made both from animals, including <b>carmine</b> from the bodies of insects, and from plants, including indigo, , and lichens.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} is born nearly featherless {{except for}} tiny primary quills {{and a fine}} down along its spine, humerus, forearm, and femur. Its skin is dark pink but displays variable black patches on its upperside. The gape is yellow. As the nestling develops, its plumage begins to resemble that of the adult, though it has white flecks on its wing coverts and the featherless skin on the head is black or dark brown, not powder blue, on the forecrown and dark reddish brown, not <b>carmine,</b> on the hindcrown. After fledging, the immature closely resembles the adult except for the bare patch {{on the back of}} the head being golden yellow instead of <b>carmine</b> and the tail being only a third as long as that of an adult.|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} aerial hunters of insect prey. Prey is caught either in continuous flight or more commonly from an exposed perch {{from which the}} bee-eater watches for prey. Smaller, rounder-winged bee-eaters typically hunt from branches and twigs closer to the ground, whereas the larger species hunt from tree tops or telegraph wires. One unusual technique often used by <b>carmine</b> bee-eaters is to ride {{on the backs of}} bustards.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} <b>carmine</b> bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.|$|E

5|$|Depictions in {{classical}} art are rare for such striking birds.

Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and <b>Carmine</b> bee-eaters being the most common subjects, with 18 and 11 countries respectively.|$|E

Eventually, she would join with her old friends Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio's reincarnated Tammany Hall. Their efforts were eventually successful, and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961.|$|E

One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound debridement. Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and anaesthetics.|$|E

5|$|The Brancacci Chapel, in the {{basilica}} of Santa Maria del <b>Carmine,</b> was founded around 1366/7 by Piero di Piuvichese Brancacci.

Peter was the name-saint of the founder, and the patron saint of the Brancacci family, but the choice also reflected support for the Roman papacy during the Great Schism.|$|E

5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and <b>carmine</b> on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the <b>carmine</b> and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
