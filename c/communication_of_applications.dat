40|$|Web {{services}} {{refer to}} a family of technologies that can universally standardize the <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> in order to connect systems, business partners, and customers cost-effectively through the World Wide Web. Web services will ease the constraints of time, cost, and space for discovering, negotiating, and conducting e-business transactions. As a result, they dramatically changed the way businesses design their applications as services, integrate with other business entities, manage business process workflows, and conduct e-business transactions. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate {{the current state of}} Web services technology and to evaluate the potential effectiveness of this technology for financial industry. By conducting several case studies, the advantages of Web services implementation are discussed, including financial areas and other related E-businesses. Non-technical aspects of Web services such as the value added, cost reduction, implementation contraction, project reusability, and business expanding are discussed as well. To demonstrate the use of Web services for financial industry, three Web service application prototypes were built within different domains relevant to international trading procedure. This simulation project is judged to be a successful demonstration of the potential applications of Web services for financial industry...|$|E
40|$|Web {{services}} {{refer to}} a family of technologies that can universally standardize the <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> in order to connect systems, business partners, and customers cost-effectively through the World Wide Web. Major software vendors such as IBM, Microsoft, SAP, SUN, and Oracle are all embracing Web services standards and are releasing new products or tools that are Web services enabled. Web services will ease the constraints of time, cost, and space for discovering, negotiating, and conducting e-business transactions. As a result, Web services will change the way businesses design their applications as services, integrate with other business entities, manage business process workflows, and conduct e-business transactions. The early adopters of Web services are showing promising results such as greater development productivity gains and easier and faster integration with trading partners. However, there are many issues worth studying regarding Web services {{in the context of}} e-commerce. This special issue of the JECR aims to encourage awareness and discussion of important issues and applications of Web Services that are related to electronic commerce from the organizational, economics, and technical perspectives. Research opportunities of Web services and e-commerce area are fruitful and important for both academics and practitioners. We wish that this introductory article can shed some light for researchers and practitioners to better understand important issues and future trends of Web services and e-business...|$|E

40|$|<b>Communication</b> {{characterization}} <b>of</b> parallel <b>applications</b> {{is essential}} to understand the interplay between architectures and applications in determining the maximum achievable performance. Although {{a significant amount of}} research has been conducted on execution-based architectural evaluations, very little effort has gone into capturing the <b>communication</b> behavior <b>of</b> an <b>application</b> mathematically. In this paper, we attempt to characterize the <b>communication</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> by temporal, spatial and volume attributes. We also study the impact <b>of</b> variation in <b>application</b> and architectural parameters on the communication behavior in terms of the three attributes. Our results show that for the chosen suite <b>of</b> <b>applications,</b> the message arrival and spatial distributions can be closely approximated by known statistical distributions and that the temporal as well as spatial distributions <b>of</b> all <b>applications</b> remain unchanged with respect to four parameters considered in this study. These results lead us closer to the belief {{that it is possible to}} abstract the <b>communication</b> properties <b>of</b> parallel <b>applications</b> in convenient mathematical forms that have wide applicability. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{interconnection}} {{design in}} computing clusters and data centers {{is expected to}} change significantly {{in the near future}} to sustain the increasing communication demand at controlled capitalization and operational cost. In particular, a shift from typ- ical and expensive full-bisection bandwidth interconnects (which safely cover the worst communication cases) to application oriented designs (which may provide cost-efficient data movement at larger system scales) is devised in academic research and industry initiatives. Having information <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> (e. g. repetitiveness, computing and communication phases, traffic pattern and bandwidth, etc.) allows for efficiently managing and provisioning of network re- sources at reduced cost. This paper presents an Application-Aware Predictive and Distributed Routing Balancing technique (PR-DRB), a new method that controls network inefficiencies based on <b>communication</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> and speculative routing, PR-DRB monitors increments in the communication latency and, then, dynamically re-distributes the network traffic over multiple paths (path expansion) to deal with load unbalances. Additionally, PR-DRB stores the number of paths used to balance the traffic (solution) and links it to the application's pattern that caused the unbalance (problem). This information allows PR-DRB to respond to similar situations in repetitive patterns, quickly converging to a stable solution. Evaluation results show latency and completion time reductions of up to 37 % for experiments conducted on 64 nodes executing the NAS benchmarks and the Lammps application...|$|R
