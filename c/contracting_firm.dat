5|$|A {{native of}} {{what would become the}} {{province}} of Ontario, May moved to Manitoba soon after completing education in his hometown. In Manitoba, he would take to briefly farming, before entering into the construction industry, which he would establish prominence in. After doing work for the railway, he would move to Winnipeg where he would join a <b>contracting</b> <b>firm</b> and become involved in the construction of many buildings. After moving west and living briefly in Carberry, Manitoba, May came to Edmonton in 1902.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{after the}} closing of his father's estate and sale his father's property, he moved west to {{homestead}} and farm at Manitoba, in the Little Saskatchewan district, near Minnedosa. A few years later, {{he had come to}} the realization that farming was not an efficient means of business for him; his farm had been situated in an area that was so far removed from a town that travel to deliver his products had been cumbersome. He then gained employment as a carpenter and builder with the Manitoba and North Western Railway, where he was tasked with building rail bridges and stations. He would later move to Winnipeg where he continued working in his field. He would join the <b>contracting</b> <b>firm</b> of Murray & McDermot, serving as foreman on various projects, including the building of the Manitoba Hotel. After some 13 years, he went to Carberry, Manitoba where he continued contracting, this time also entering the furniture business. In 1902, he would also be involved {{in the construction of the}} Union Bank building there.|$|E
5|$|In Edmonton {{he would}} rise {{to be one}} of the city's most {{prominent}} contractors, constructing many of the city's landmark buildings, as well as houses for its prominent residents. Long interested in municipal affairs, he entered civic politics with his election to the Edmonton Town Council in 1903. After an aldermanic term that saw the inclusion of Alberta as a province in Canada, in 1905 he was elected as mayor of the newly incorporated city; during his term he would oversee many improvements and advances to the city. Retiring after one term in office and returning to his <b>contracting</b> <b>firm,</b> he would eventually leave Edmonton in 1922 for Vancouver where he would live for 10 years leading up to his death in 1932. An active community man, May also founded and oversaw many local organizations. A Liberal in politics, he is remembered as a progressive mayor whose policies helped the accelerate development of city of Edmonton.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{structure}} of wages of workers in <b>contract</b> <b>firms</b> for a two-period economy {{in which there is}} interfirm mobility. A <b>contract</b> <b>firm</b> provides specific training for a worker during the first period, which increases his productivity if he stays in the second period, but the worker may quit to join an alternative firm after a successful search. When the worker cannot borrow in capital markets, the motive for consumption smoothing dominates and the <b>contract</b> <b>firm</b> acts as a banker and sets wage above marginal product in the first period and below it in the second. When the worker can borrow, insurance is the dominant concern and the <b>contract</b> <b>firm</b> acts instead as an insurer by setting the first-period wage below marginal product and the second-period wage above it. This dichotomy will fade away if the contract includes an exit fee as a quit penalty. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Building the Flatiron {{was made}} {{feasible}} by a change to New York City's building codes in 1892, which eliminated {{the requirement that}} masonry be used for fireproofing considerations. This {{opened the way for}} steel-skeleton construction. Since it employed a steel skeleton – with the steel coming from the American Bridge Company in Pennsylvania – it could be built to 22 stories (285feet) relatively easily, which would have been difficult using other construction methods of that time. It was a technique familiar to the Fuller Company, a <b>contracting</b> <b>firm</b> with considerable expertise in building such tall structures. At the vertex, the triangular tower is only 6.5 feet (2m) wide; viewed from above, this pointed end of the structure describes an acute angle of about 25 degrees.|$|E

In an eventual competitive move, other Kellogg engineering interests were merged with Rust Engineering becoming Kellogg Rust, which itself became The Henley Group, and later Rust International before it became the Rust Division of what is today Washington Group International, a specialty <b>contracting</b> <b>firm</b> that competes directly with Halliburton worldwide. Washington Group International is the successor to the Morrison Knudsen civil engineering and contracting corporation, and is also the owner of Montana Rail Link.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} differences in the collaborative activities between the Turkish <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> that are listed as the “Top 225 International Contractors” by Engineering News Record (ENR), according to their international revenues, and other large <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> that are not on this list. For this purpose, 30 large-scale Turkish general <b>contracting</b> <b>firms,</b> including 15 listed by the ENR, have been examined in terms of their collaborations during the innovation process as well as the levels of significance for the sources of information that serve as the means of “sources of innovation”. Results show some remarkable differences between the top-listed firms and other large-scale contracting companies. The levels of importance indicated for the collaborations made with “universities and research institutions” and the sources of information “conferences, fairs and exhibitions” and “scientific/ technical publications” show remarkable {{differences between the two groups}} of companies. Contractors who are not ENR listed are more active in making collaborations. While the number of collaborations is increasing in the timeline, both groups of contractors indicate the most important collaborations as “consultants, private R&D institutions” and “suppliers”. Findings also show a decreasing interest against collaborations with universities. Finally, findings of the research are discussed in the context of innovation, expecting to contribute to international <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> in evaluating their innovation approaches to their competitive advantage...|$|R

40|$|A {{strategic}} alliance is a co-operative arrangement between {{two or more}} organisations that forms part of their overall strategy, and contributes to achieving their major goals and objectives. Strategic alliances in building construction may be a useful evaluation criterion in assisting public sector construction managers evaluate and select tenders and encourage more co-operative relationships amongst construction project team members. This paper reviews competitiveness of the Australian building construction industry {{in the context of}} the theory of {{strategic alliance}}s between <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> and subcontractors; and explores whether implementing strategic alliances provides <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> any competitive advantage over competitors. A theoretical concept of strategic alliances is proposed and appropriate indicators of competitive advantage are developed. An analysis framework comprising six attributes of strategic alliances—trust, commitment, interdependence, co-operation, communication and joint problem solving is described. These attributes were used to collect data from 59 building construction firms in South-East Queensland to assess their respective levels of strategic alliance. The formation of strategic alliance relationships between <b>contracting</b> <b>firms</b> and subcontractors is proposed as a component of the tender evaluation process for public works sector...|$|R
500|$|In 1953 a {{religious}} education wing, also designed by Bailey, {{was added to}} the church building, increasing the size of the auditorium and adding classrooms and offices. [...] By the following year the church building had already reached its capacity and the congregation began holding two services on Sundays. [...] The church school, with an enrollment of over 500, also began holding two services on Sundays. [...] The church purchased adjoining property and in 1958 constructed the parsonage, a -story brick Colonial Revival building. [...] By 1959, there were eight Unitarian congregations in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs, with the Arlington church being the largest. [...] The congregation began planning for a new facility and chose Charles M. Goodman, a prominent local architect known for his modernist work, to design the church building. [...] A church committee wrote that it was [...] "confident that Mr. Goodman’s concept of design, his wide experience, and his original and creative genius promise for us a distinctive building which will portray in structural form the spirit and aspiration of this congregation." [...] Church leaders invited the congregation to give suggestions for Goodman's design which included [...] "an architectural style which would express the inspiring tradition of Unitarianism in Virginia" [...] and a [...] "free form and no stained glass, [...] a building to represent our cleavage with the past." [...] The congregation wanted the building to [...] "reflect their liberal, progressive beliefs and that would signify the UUCA's leadership position within the denomination." [...] According to one UUCA minister, [...] "Charles Goodman {{spent a lot of time}} with the congregation and incorporating the values and theology of the congregation into the design of the building." [...] Goodman finished his design in late 1961 and the church began seeking financing shortly thereafter. [...] His design included plans for a main sanctuary and adjoining wing, the latter which was not built at the time due to budget concerns. [...] Construction of the sanctuary was carried out by the Martin Brothers <b>contracting</b> <b>firm.</b> [...] The total cost was approximately $300,000, and the dedication was held on March 22, 1964, with a sermon by Dana McLean Greeley entitled [...] "Building a Faith for the Future." [...] UUCA's sanctuary is one of only three churches designed by Goodman and his only church building in Virginia. [...] His other two church designs are Bethesda United Church of Christ in Bethesda, Maryland, and Christ Church of Washington (now called Embassy Church) in Washington, D.C.|$|E

Shelly's husband sued contractor Bradford General Contractors, which had hired Pillco. The complaint alleged that Shelly would still be alive if the <b>contracting</b> <b>firm</b> had not hired him. Ostroy also sought to hold the owners and management of the building liable for Shelly's murder. According to a New York Post article, among other allegations, the complaint stated that Pillco was an undocumented immigrant...' as were his co-workers, and that [...] "it was in Bradford General Contractors' interest not to have 'police and immigration officials [...] to the job site' because that would have ground their work to a halt". On July 7, 2011, the lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Louis York. The court determined that Ostroy had not established legal grounds to hold the contractor liable, writing [...] "While this court sympathizes with [...] loss, plaintiffs have not presented sufficient legal grounds upon which to hold Bradford... liable for Pillco's vicious crime", and that there was likewise insufficient evidence presented to find that either the building's management agents or its owners [...] "had reason to believe that Pillco was a dangerous person who should not have been allowed to work at the premises" [...] in order to find them vicariously liable.
