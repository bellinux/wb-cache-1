5|$|I am {{completely}} {{at a loss}} in attempting to fathom the reasons why <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> and certain groups have now started a letter-writing campaign … to defeat the act. I am sure that if the letter writers would consult the facts, they would join with all others not only in hoping this act would become law but in working for its speedy passage and approval.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

5|$|The {{psychiatric}} incarceration of <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> {{was prompted}} by their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities. The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, {{was considered to be}} a form of mental illness that required treatment. The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds. Highly classified government documents which have become available after the dissolution of the Soviet Union confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.|$|E
5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why <b>certain</b> <b>individuals,</b> and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E

25|$|<b>Certain</b> <b>individuals</b> (Barbara Deming, Danilo Dolci, Devere Allen etc.) {{and party}} groups (e.g. Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism, Pacifist Socialist Party or War Resisters League) have {{advocated}} nonviolent revolution {{as an alternative}} to violence as well as elitist reformism. This perspective is usually connected to militant anti-capitalism.|$|E
25|$|Mood changes, {{including}} depression, {{can occur}} with hormone replacement therapy. However, many transgender women report significant mood-lifting effects as well. The risk of depressive side effects {{is more common}} in patients who take progestins. Medroxyprogesterone acetate, in particular, has been shown to cause depression in <b>certain</b> <b>individuals,</b> perhaps by affecting dopamine levels.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{companies}} that want their stock {{to be limited}} to being traded by only <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> may set up a restricted program. There are two SEC rules that allow this type of issuance of shares in the United States: Rule 144-A and Regulation S. ADR programs operating under one of these two rules make up approximately 30% of all issued ADRs.|$|E

Animals in this {{location}} have also been recorded as suffering infections caused by herpesviruses and in certain cases to be suffering from encephalitis caused by the protozoan Sarcocystis. Cases have been recorded of ciliate protozoa colonising the spiracle of <b>certain</b> <b>individuals,</b> but they not thought to be pathogens or at least they are not very harmful.|$|E
25|$|Most hip {{replacements}} {{consist of}} cobalt and chromium alloys, or titanium. Stainless steel {{is no longer}} used. All implants release their constituent ions into the blood. Typically these are excreted in the urine, but in <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> the ions can accumulate in the body. In implants which involve metal-on-metal contact, microscopic fragments of cobalt and chromium can be absorbed into the patient's bloodstream. There are reports of cobalt toxicity with hip replacement patients.|$|E
25|$|Areas of {{the brain}} {{responsible}} for planning and motor learning are sharpened. A related effect, caused by even low levels of alcohol, is the tendency for people to become more animated in speech and movement. This is due to increased metabolism in areas {{of the brain}} associated with movement, such as the nigrostriatal pathway. This causes reward systems in the brain to become more active, which may induce <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> to behave in an uncharacteristically loud and cheerful manner.|$|E
50|$|James R. Detert, Linda K. Treviño and Vicki L. Sweitzer {{propose that}} some {{individuals}} {{are more inclined}} to morally disengage than others. Based on their study, they found that <b>certain</b> <b>individual</b> differences predict and influence moral disengagement.|$|R

25|$|The {{recently}} re-instated Tanith First {{is excluded}} from {{this part of}} the invasion and is {{one of a number of}} scout/recon regiments inserted deep into the mainland behind enemy lines. As the Ghosts liberate a country town called Cantible, Gaunt is ordered by the Commissariat to make contact with the loyalist resistance in the Gereon , and leads a small team out into the wilderness to do so. However, it becomes apparent that <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> have their own agenda for re-taking Gereon.|$|E
25|$|More {{than any}} other feature in the test, content {{response}} can be controlled consciously by the subject, and may be elicited by very disparate factors, which {{makes it difficult to}} use content alone to draw any conclusions about the subject's personality; with <b>certain</b> <b>individuals,</b> content responses may potentially be interpreted directly, and some information can at times be obtained by analyzing thematic trends in the whole set of content responses (which is only feasible when several responses are available), but in general content cannot be analyzed outside of the context of the entire test record.|$|E
25|$|In Calvinist (Reformed) theology, {{unconditional}} {{election is}} considered to be one aspect of predestination in which God chooses <b>certain</b> <b>individuals</b> to be saved. Those elected receive mercy, while those not elected, the reprobates, receive justice without condition. This unconditional election is essentially related {{to the rest of the}} TULIP doctrinal outline and hinges upon the supreme belief in the absolute sovereignty of God over the affairs of man. God unconditionally elects certain people even though they are sinful as an act of his saving grace apart from the shortcomings or will of man. Those chosen have done nothing to deserve this grace.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{the case}} where a <b>certain</b> <b>individual</b> remains {{touching}} with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are formless, and—having seen with discernment—his fetters are ended. This is called an individual released both ways.|$|R
