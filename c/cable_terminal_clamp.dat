The Nikuviken <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> station will be connected with the Attila converter station by the 14 km long overhead line.|$|R
40|$|Cable {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been increasing in popularity in recent years due to several perceived benefits over the commonly used W-beam guardrail. A non-proprietary design was desired {{as an alternative to}} the many proprietary designs available. A non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> end <b>terminal</b> was necessary to accompany the non-proprietary, high-tension cable guardrail system under development. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for a non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> end <b>terminal.</b> An analysis of several <b>cable</b> guardrail end <b>terminals</b> was undertaken to identify any common features that may prove to be beneficial or detrimental to end terminal designs. Next, a study of the non-proprietary low-tension system was conducted to determine the cause of vehicle instabilities in full-scale testing. Since the high-tension and low-tension <b>cable</b> end <b>terminal</b> designs are similar, it is likely that any issues with the low-tension design will also be evident in testing of the high-tension design. LS-DYNA modeling of current <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> anchor hardware was then accomplished and compared to bogie testing results. The anchor model proved to be sufficiently accurate to preliminarily analyze alternative cable anchor designs. A final, optimized, high-tension cable anchor design was produced along with alternative terminal post recommendations for continuing development of the non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> end <b>terminal.</b> Advisor: John D.

50|$|On Parker Island, {{there is}} a <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> of HVDC Vancouver Island, which is the {{endpoint}} of the second overhead line section of HVDC Vancouver Island starting at {{the east coast of}} Galiano Island and which reaches Parker Island in a 880 m long span.|$|R
50|$|The crux of {{the matter}} is here, like in the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal,</b> that the inner bore of this bi-manchet is chosen smaller than the {{diameter}} over the cable-insulation. In this way a permanent pressure is created between the bi-manchet and the cable surface and cavities or electrical weak points are avoided.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 b, H_ 0 (s), the {{resulting}} current transfer function at the faulted <b>cable</b> <b>terminal,</b> has the {{characteristic of a}} band-pass filter. Since H_ 0 (s) is defined {{with respect to the}} incident voltage wave, it can be considered as an admittance which describes the relationship between the resulting current at the faulted <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> and the incident voltage. This admittance is highly inductive due to the presence of the series inductor and the converter arm inductors. Consequently, high-frequency components of the incident voltage are largely attenuated. In the low frequency region, this admittance is highly capacitive, mainly due to the equivalent converter capacitor. As a result, low-frequency components of the incident voltage are also largely attenuated. The bandwidth and gain of the frequency response of H_ 0 (s) increase as the series inductors decrease.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is now the}} British <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> for the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG). A new {{submarine}} cable terminating station building was constructed by E. Thomas (Mowlem) Ltd. {{on behalf of the}} new site owner, the telecommunications operator FLAG Atlantic, on the surf village site. The building received the CPRE/RIBA Cornwall Architecture Award in 2002.|$|R
50|$|At the terminal, {{the lines}} connects to three undersea cables taking {{electricity}} across Cook Strait. , Pole 2 uses {{two of these}} cables, with the third cable unused waiting the commissioning of Pole 3. The cables initially head south out of Fighting Bay, before turning east towards the North Island, and then turning north-east towards the North Island <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> at Oteranga Bay.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} line {{was designed and}} built by the New Zealand Electricity Department, and was completed in January 1965. The original construction of the line included the erection of 1623 steel lattice towers. In some South Island sections, the line reaches an altitude of 1280 metres. The longest span is 1119 m, near Port Underwood, close to the Fighting Bay <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> station.|$|R

30|$|At the Swanbank Power Station, a {{major fire}} in an ash plant control cubicle in 1995 caused {{extensive}} damage and downtime when the cabinet was completely burned out. As a result, VESDA smoke detection systems were installed in all equipment control cubicles. In 1996, another fire occurred, but was quickly detected and extinguished by control room operators. Only three <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> and one wire were burned, with minimal disruption (Anderson, 1996).|$|R
50|$|On 23 December 2010, the {{contract}} to manufacture and install the subsea and underground cables was awarded to Nexans, {{the contract}} to build converter stations was awarded to Siemens, {{the contract to}} build the Nikuviken <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> station and to expand the Anttila substation in Finland was awarded to Empower Oy, and the contract to build the transmission line between Anttila and Nikuviken was awarded to ETDE, a part of Bouygues.|$|R
50|$|On the Danish side, the {{converter}} station used as well by Konti-Skan 1 and 2 {{is close to}} Vester Hassing near Aalborg. From Vester Hassing a 34 km long overhead line with two conductors runs to the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> at the Danish coast near Staesnaes. This line, which {{is only in the}} proximity of {{the converter}} station and the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> equipped with a ground conductor, was originally used by the high voltage pole of Konti-Skan 1 and from Vester Hassing until a point a few kilometres south of the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> by the electrode line, which turned there eastwards to the ground electrode at Soera. At implementation of Konti-Skan 2 the whole overhead electrode line was replaced by two 27 km long underground cables and the second conductor of the overhead line got the high-voltage pole of Konti-Skan 2. The 23 km long submarine cable to the Danish island of Laeso starts at Stensnaes and consists of 3 parallel cables. Each of these cables has two copper conductors with a copper cross section of 310 square millimeters. One of these cables was used by Kontiskan 1 and one is used by Kontiskan 2. From the third cable, one conductor was used by Kontiskan 1 and the other is used by Kontiskan 2. Konti-Skan crosses Laeso-Island on a 17 km long overhead line with two conductors. Before the implementation of Konti-Skan 2 both conductors were switched parallel, today one conductor is used for the high voltage pole of Konti-Skan 1, while the other is used by that of Konti-Skan 2. Between Laeso and Sweden each high voltage pole of Konti-Skan uses a monopolar copper cable with a cross section of 1200 square millimetres.|$|R
50|$|Connecting two {{high-voltage}} cables {{with one}} another poses two main problems. First, the outer conducting layers in both cables shall be terminated without causing a field concentration, similar as with {{the making of a}} <b>cable</b> <b>terminal.</b> Secondly, a field free space shall be created where the cut-down cable insulation and the connector of the two conductors safely can be accommodated. These problems have been solved by NKF in Delft in 1965 by introducing a device called bi-manchet.|$|R
50|$|Locating faults in a {{cable system}} can be done either with the circuit de-energized, or in some cases, with the circuit under power. Fault {{location}} techniques can be broadly divided into terminal methods, which use voltages and currents measured {{at the ends of}} the cable, and tracer methods, which require inspection {{along the length of the}} <b>cable.</b> <b>Terminal</b> methods can be used to locate the general area of the fault, to expedite tracing on a long or buried cable.|$|R
50|$|GCHQ is {{believed}} to have forced some six global telecommunications and Internet companies to allow them to access more than 14 fiber optic cables that transport telephone communications. The six companies, BT, Vodafone, Viatel, Interoute, Verizon and Level-3, gave GCHQ access to the cables in return for payment, it {{is believed}} the companies had no choice in this decision. Three of the <b>cables</b> <b>terminal</b> stations are on German territory; two of the cables are partially owned by Deutsche Telekom, who have denied knowledge of or participation in GCHQs activities.|$|R
50|$|The line {{passes through}} Weka Pass into the Amuri district, {{travelling}} north through the region, west of Culverden, to Hanmer Springs. From here, the line turns north-east and travels through Molesworth Station into Marlborough {{and down the}} Awatere River valley, before turning north to meet State Highway 1 through the Dashwood and Wards Passes. The line travels east of Blenheim, meeting the eastern coast of the island at Cloudy Bay, and travelling up the coast into the Marlborough Sounds. The line turns east and then south-east around Port Underwood, before crossing to Fighting Bay on the coast, where the South Island <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> is located.|$|R

50|$|MI8, or Military Intelligence, Section 8 was a British Military Intelligence group {{responsible}} for signals intelligence and {{was created in}} 1914. It originally consisted of four sections: MI8(a), which dealt with wireless policy; MI8(b), based at the General Post Office, dealt with commercial and trade cables; MI8(c) dealt with the distribution of intelligence derived from censorship; and MI8(d), which liaised with the cable companies. During World War I MI8 officers were posted to the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> at Poldhu Point and Mullion in Cornwall and Clifden in County Galway, continued until 1917 when the work {{was taken over by}} the Admiralty. In WW2, MI8 was {{responsible for}} the extensive War Office Y Group and briefly, for the Radio Security Service.|$|R
50|$|Dangerous rusting {{strands of}} the old cable could still {{be seen on the}} beach in the early 1950s. These have since been removed and a careful search of the {{terminal}} building in 2004 revealed no vestiges whatsoever of <b>cable</b> or <b>terminal</b> equipment.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} methodology is used {{to analyse}} the travelling waves in a bipolar configuration with metallic return. First, the mutual coupling, in terms of very fast transient between the two poles is shown to be insignificant. Second, {{the influence of the}} number of the parallel branches in the same pole, is shown to be more pronounced in the low-frequency region, which implies that very fast transients are less influenced by the number of the parallel branches. Third, the series inductor at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> plays vital role in primary protection algorithms based on local measurements. Large series inductors give large margin in both voltage detection level and the time to identify the faulted cable. Fourth, the grounding impedances in a bipolar system have insignificant influences on the first travelling wave.|$|R
50|$|Figure 4 shows a {{photograph}} of the cross-section of such a device. At one side of this photograph the contours of a high-voltage cable are drawn. Here red represents the conductor of that cable and blue the insulation of the cable. The black parts in this picture are semi-conducting rubber parts. The outer one is at earth potential and spreads the electric field in a similar way as in a <b>cable</b> <b>terminal.</b> The inner one is at high-voltage and shields the connector of the conductors from the electric field. The field itself is diverted as shown in figure 5, where the equipotential lines are smoothly directed from the inside of the cable to the outer part of the bi-manchet (and vice versa at {{the other side of the}} device).|$|R
40|$|On-line partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection of three-phase belted medium voltage cable connections {{results in a}} number of interpretation differences as compared to off-line measurements where only one phase is energized. The induced currents and charges in the phase conductors and earth screen upon a PD not only depend on the discharge site, but also become phase angle dependent. Furthermore, simulations show that the PD distribution itself varies with the amount of eccentricity of the rotating electric field and may differ from the off-line distributions obtained with a linear field. Finally, the PD propagation in a multi-conductor cable also alters the signals measured at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals.</b> In this paper, induced charges and PD distributions are studied by means of computer simulation. The cable propagation characteristics are verified by measurements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High {{temperature}} superconducting (HTS) {{cable termination}} {{is an important}} component of the HTS cable system, which functions to connect the HTS cable and the conventional cable accessory. The stress cones of the HTS cable termination can improve the internal electric field distribution and the electrical insulation strength of the cable termination. In this paper, the mathematical model and equivalent circuit model of the stress cones are built and the genetic algorithm is adopted to the design of 110 -kV HTS <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> stress cone. The capacitance, radial electric field, axial electric field, voltage, insulation thickness and other parameters of the stress cone were compared before and after the optimization of the stress cone. Finally, the simulations of the stress cone with the optimized structure were made using finite-element analysis software COMSOL to test the optimization result...|$|R
50|$|To {{address the}} {{vaulting}} and rollover crashes, energy-absorbing terminals were developed. The {{first generation of}} these terminals in the 1970s were breakaway <b>cable</b> <b>terminals,</b> in which the rail curves back on itself and is connected to a cable that runs {{between the first and}} second posts (which are often breakaway posts). The second generation, in the 1990s and 2000s, feature a large steel impact head that engages the frame or bumper of the vehicle. The impact head is driven back along the guide rail, dissipating the vehicle's kinetic energy by bending or tearing the steel in the guide rail sections. A guide rail may also be terminated by curving it back to the point that the terminal is unlikely to be hit end-on, or, if possible, by embedding the end in a hillside or cut slope.|$|R
