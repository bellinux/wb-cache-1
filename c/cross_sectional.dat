At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> area of the gas molecules.

25|$|An {{acoustic}} horn converts large pressure variations {{with a small}} displacement area into a low pressure variation with a large displacement area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> area of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high acoustic impedance to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given displacement. Therefore the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low displacement. The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually decompress and increase in displacement until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large displacement.|$|E

With ground effect having been banned a few years earlier, the rear wing of a Formula One car once again created much of its downforce, but its effectiveness is reduced by the bodywork {{in front of it}} disturbing the flow of air.

25|$|In the {{original}} Tube design, trains passing through close fitting tunnels act as pistons to create air pressure gradients between stations.

This system depends on adequate <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> area of the airspace above the passengers’ heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the radius, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel headspace. In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where false ceiling panels attached to metal frames have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by some 94%.|$|E
25|$|C fiber axons {{are grouped}} {{together}} {{into what is}} known as Remak bundles. These occur when an unmyelinated Schwann cell bundles the axons close together by surrounding them. The Schwann cell keeps them from touching each other by squeezing its cytoplasm between the axons. The condition of Remak bundles varies with age. The number of C fiber axons in each Remak bundle varies with location. For example, in a rat model, large bundles of greater than 20 axons are found exiting the L5 dorsal root ganglion, while smaller bundles of average 3 axons are found in distal nerve segments. Multiple neurons contribute axons to the Remak bundle with an average ratio of about 2 axons contributed per bundle. The <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> area of a Remak bundle is proportional to the number of axons found inside it. Remak bundles in the distal peripheral nerve are clustered with other Remak bundles.
