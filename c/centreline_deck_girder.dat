50|$|The Southern Avenue {{bridge over}} Suitland Parkway {{was the first}} {{orthotropic}} <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge built in Washington, D.C.|$|R
50|$|The bridge uses an {{orthotropic}} steel <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> for {{a central}} {{section of the}} 360 m long main span, {{while the rest of}} the main span and the short lateral spans are a prestressed concrete girder. Both steel and concrete <b>deck</b> <b>girders</b> have the same external shape. This original design principle was later used for the 756 m main span of the Pont de Normandie, a cable-stayed bridge in Normandy, France.|$|R
5000|$|This {{railroad}} crosses Martins Creek on {{an unusual}} bridge with two different spans, a 67 ft riveted <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> and a 56 ft riveted lattice deck truss. The bridge originally had two 67 ft <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> spans, {{but these were}} doubled up to increase their strength. The 56 ft lattice deck truss spans were salvaged from Bridge No. 138 on the DL&W’s Buffalo Division and a new abutment constructed to accommodate the shorter span.|$|R
50|$|The Great Northern Railway Underpass at Stanley, North Dakota is a {{concrete}} <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge {{that was built}} in 1937. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
30|$|For this {{analysis}} the inertia I_z of the <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> varies from 0.01 to 28  m 4, {{and the rest}} of the variables that were displayed in Table  1 remain constant through the entire parametric study.|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{offshore}} platforms of the gravity-base type {{are almost always}} constructed in their vertical attitude. This allows the inshore installation of <b>deck</b> <b>girders</b> and equipment and the later transport of the whole structure to the installation site.|$|R
50|$|The Hansen Bridge is a 350 ft high {{concrete}} <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> {{bridge that}} carries Idaho State Highway 50 over the Snake River Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho. The bridge spans {{the border of}} Jerome and Twin Falls Counties.|$|R
50|$|There are 18 bridges {{existing}} in the area, the longest {{of which is}} located in barangay Pugay, a reinforced concrete <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> (RCDA),one in Mampirao, Salogon, and the rest are Spanish-type bridges that are made of bricks and reinforced concrete, spillways and footbridges.|$|R

30|$|Having both forces, the {{preliminary}} {{design of the}} cable and <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> can be achieved. It is {{important to point out}} that if the cable presents an almost rigid behaviour, the proposed method converges for the exact solution. Later on demonstrated in Fig.  11.|$|R
30|$|ABAQUS/standard version 6.7 {{was used}} to {{establish}} a 3 D full-scale FE model of the RC bridge. Different types of elements were utilized to create the model. The model consisted of a concrete slab on the steel girders, which in turn were supported by capped concrete columns. <b>Deck,</b> <b>girders,</b> cap, and columns were modeled separately, and then assembled together. <b>Deck,</b> <b>girders,</b> and stiffeners were modeled with shell elements, and cap and columns were modeled using continuum solid elements. The resulting FE model contains 50, 776 shell elements formed by 57, 878 nodes, of which 11, 016 elements {{were used for the}} deck slab and 24, 736 elements were needed to model girders. Also, 15, 024 solid elements were used in the model containing 19, 502 nodes.|$|R
30|$|This method {{requires}} that the hangers are rigid and without any deformation, and two geometric parameters and two stiffness that are require to be considered; {{the length of the}} mid span (L_span); the sag of the cable (f_w); the cable area (A_c); and the <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> inertia (I_g).|$|R

50|$|The bridge {{has been}} rebuilt several times. The wood tower column and track were redone in 1957 and 1971, and the steel grid deck on the ca. 1950 <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> movable span was {{installed}} in 1962. However, {{the integrity of the}} original design has been maintained and it operates in the original manner.|$|R

50|$|The Daniel Boone Bridge is {{the name}} for two bridges {{carrying}} Interstate 64, U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 61 across the Missouri River between St. Louis County and St. Charles County, Missouri. The older bridge, which carries westbound traffic is a continuous truss bridge, while the newer bridge, which carries eastbound traffic is a <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge.|$|R
50|$|In the {{cantilever}} strutted version, {{shown in}} the illustration at left, the top strut (or struts, depending on design) can be fashioned into a cantilever truss. By all going to the same footing, {{the upper part of}} the <b>deck</b> <b>girders</b> are thus in tension and the moment of the cantilever section is offset by the moment of the water impinging on that section.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} headstocks, now {{encased in}} concrete, are 610mm deep wrought iron girders of similar construction to the <b>deck</b> <b>girders.</b> Cast iron piles 2.4m and 1.2m sections and bolted through either {{internal or external}} flanges are used to support the headstocks. The piles are 610mm in diameter with 25mm thick wall. Attempts have been made, unsuccessfully, to fill the piles with concrete.|$|R
50|$|The Congressman William L. Clay Sr. Bridge, {{formerly}} known as the Bernard F. Dickmann Bridge and popularly as the Poplar Street Bridge or PSB, completed in 1967, is a 647 ft <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge across the Mississippi River between St. Louis, Missouri, and East St. Louis, Illinois. The bridge arrives on the Missouri shore line just south of the Gateway Arch.|$|R
50|$|Thousands {{of small}} {{concrete}} <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridges subsequently {{have been built}} throughout Iowa following the design standard set by the Iowa State Highway Commission (ISHC) in 1913. The River Street Bridge {{and only a few}} others preceded that standard, only a few of which remain in use, while the River Street Bridge has carried traffic with no significant change to the bridge up to the 1994 date of its National Register of Historic Places nomination. The nomination in part reads:Of these pre-ISHC bridges - and among all of Iowa's <b>deck</b> <b>girders,</b> actually - the River Street Bridge is unique for its faux arch design. The arched form was generally held to be the most aesthetically successful configuration for urban bridges for its symmetry and associations with classical architecture. The River Street Bridge acknowledges this sense of aesthetic in its arched spandrels. A simple beam bridge in arch clothing, it is a noteworthy, small-scale exercise in urban bridge design.|$|R
25|$|After nearly 50 {{years of}} {{additional}} service, which included weight restrictions and closings during cold weather (for a {{time it was}} restricted to carrying vehicles with a maximum weight of three tons, {{and it was only}} open to vehicular traffic during periods when the temperature is above 30 degrees Fahrenheit), the old bridge was replaced by a <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge which was completed in 1995.|$|R
50|$|On June 23, 2010, a {{brush fire}} {{severely}} damaged the Lobato Trestle, {{a long and}} high <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge. The railway trucked locomotive 484 and some coaches from Chama to Cumbres so that operations could continue {{on both sides of}} the break. On June 20, 2011, the Lobato Trestle was returned to service, and trains were once more traveling the full length of the railroad.|$|R
50|$|Fort Road Bridge is {{a girder}} bridge that spans the Mississippi River between St. Paul, Minnesota and Fort Snelling, Minnesota. It {{was built in}} 1960 by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and was {{designed}} by Sverdrup & Parcel Engineering Company. It is the third bridge on the site, the first bridge, a <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge was built in 1880. The second bridge, a metal arch bridge was built by 1912.|$|R
50|$|The West Hartford Bridge is a steel <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge {{carrying}} Town Highway 14 (the Quechee-West Hartford Road) {{across the}} White River {{in the village}} of West Hartford, Vermont. It was built by the town with state assistance in 2006, replacing a Parker through truss bridge built by the state after Vermont's devastating 1927 floods. The 1929 bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.|$|R
50|$|The Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge or Celilo Bridge is a {{single-track}} railroad bridge {{opened in}} 1912 over the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It consists of eight steel truss spans and several <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> spans, and since 1957 it has included a vertical-lift section. The bridge {{was designed by}} engineer Ralph Modjeski and erected by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co., of Leavenworth, Kansas.|$|R
50|$|The span was {{originally}} opened in 1912 {{as part of}} the last major railroad constructed in Pennsylvania. It served the Western Maryland Railway's expansion from Cumberland, Maryland to Connellsville, Pennsylvania and was one of two bridges to cross a meandering section of the Yough in Ohiopyle. The original <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge was located {{near the center of the}} tiny community of Ohiopyle and opened the rugged region to tourism.|$|R
30|$|The loads {{that are}} going to be {{introduced}} are the live loads that can be produced by traffic, which depend on the country structural codes. The dead load is not applied, since during the construction phase of the suspension bridged it is all transferred to the cable (Holger 2013). Although the method is precise, it relays on some simplifications such as: it is admitted a parabolic cable shape; the hanger tendons are rigid and continuous; the load that is transferred to the cross section of the <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> is uniform; the effect of the shorting due to the compression of the deck is negligible; it does not take into account the horizontal and vertical flexibility of the towers; for the <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> only the bending flexibility is taken into consideration; the cable is already deformed due to the self-weight of the cable and girder [this last hypothesis is very common in other simplified methods (Timoshenko and Young 1965; Von-Karman and Biot 1940), since it happens due to the construction phase (Parke and Hewson 2000; West and Robinson 1967)].|$|R
30|$|The {{theory of}} the {{displacements}} of a suspension bridge was first formulated by Melan in 1888 (Melan 1913). This was the first method to be used because it is extremely efficient when it’s used {{in the analysis of}} a bridge with a flexible <b>deck</b> <b>girder.</b> There are several ways to study the forces currently on a structure like this, which have been applied over the years in the design of suspension bridges.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} {{is supported by}} four concrete piers in the river, three piers on land, and two abutments. Carrying a single track on a concrete deck, the bridge includes six 120 ft <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> spans used on the approaches. The black-colored bridge was designed and built by Hensel Phelps Construction. Constructed of weathering steel, the bridge super{{structure is}} oxidized, which prevents rust. It also means the bridge {{does not need to}} be painted.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} 1898 ft long and {{consists}} of seven 230 ft deck arch spans and nine <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> sections. The roadbed is 27 ft wide, and the structure is 34 ft wide overall. Piers 1 and 8, at the ends, rest on solid rock. The intermediate piers rest on driven timber pilings. Piers 2, 4, 5 and 7 rest on 180 vertical piles, while piers 3 and 6, required to resist lateral thrust, have 260 piers driven at an angle.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> {{slenderness}} on the lateral buckling load of arched steel bridges is investigated. Models {{in the literature}} consider the deck infinitely stiff out-of-plane: this reductive hypothesis is removed in this article and a formulation describing the lateral behaviour of the slender tied arch in terms of two geometric parameters is proposed. A comparison with the relevant Eurocode 3 instructions for preliminary stability checks reveals that a correction function to include deck slenderness is necessary. Some modifications to code formulations are proposed...|$|R
50|$|The Big Piney Creek Bridge is a {{historic}} bridge, carrying Arkansas Highway 123 across Big Piney Creek in Ozark-St. Francis National Forest, northeast of Hagarville, Arkansas. Its main span is a Warren through truss structure, 141 ft in length, with steel <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> approach spans giving the bridge a total length of 461 ft. The trusses are mounted on concrete piers. The bridge was built in 1931, {{during a period of}} financial hardship, and was for economic reasons built with a single-lane 12 ft roadway.|$|R
50|$|The fixed spans were 116 ft long, made {{of three}} wrought iron hogback plate girders each, resting on three piers. The swing span was {{constructed}} of three hogback wrought iron box girders, each 250 ft long, each box girder having a thickness of 2 ft made of plates 0.3125 to 0.4375 in thick. In {{addition to the}} transverse <b>deck</b> <b>girders</b> the swing span was also braced by three transverse frames, which also served to support a bridgeman's hut over {{the centre of the}} bridge.|$|R
5000|$|The trail crosses Goose Creek in Loudoun County on a span that NVRPA {{built on}} top of the piers and {{abutments}} of the highest and longest (268 ft) bridge that the railroad constructed within the present boundaries of the regional park. [...] Visitors can view these remnants and the intact span, pier and abutments of the railroad's <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> bridge over Sycolin Creek from unpaved paths that travel between the streams in NVRPA's Two Creeks Trail Area {{on the north side of}} the trail.|$|R
40|$|Along {{conventional}} lines, {{we receive}} many complaints regarding steel railway bridges where structure noise stands out, so countermeasures against structure noise at steel bridges {{is an important}} issue. Development of construction methods that can control structure noise {{has been carried out}} in the past or is underway. However, a method of quantitatively predicting and evaluating noise along the track including structure noise generated from steel railway bridges, which is needed to propose an effective noise control construction method, has not yet been put in place. We thus surveyed and measured structure noise and vibration at an I-shaped steel <b>deck</b> <b>girder</b> (“I-girder 1 ”: Fig. 1) and steel <b>deck</b> box <b>girder</b> (“box girder 1 ”: Fig. 2) of a steel bridge and at flat ground (Fig. 3) along a conventional line in the Kanto area 1).
