30|$|The use of glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> {{products}} in Japanese post and beam housing has grown {{dramatically in the}} last decade. This leads to a growing market for wood lamina which is a prior product for manufacturing glued laminated posts and beams in Japan. The Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS) for glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> and structural glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> are dictated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) Notification 1152 [1] and MAFF Notification 235 [2] respectively. This notification provides visual and machine grading requirements for various wood species of lamina. Manufacturers of the glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> {{have the option of}} visually or machine graded lamina on which the strength grades of glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> are based. The choice of the grading methods will often depend on the yields that can be achieved in visual grades as compared to the machine grades [3]. If the actual structural properties of the lamina in a particular species are higher than those visually graded, then there are technical and material benefits to be achieved by machine grading the laminae.|$|R

50|$|Brettstapel {{was invented}} in the 1970s by the German {{engineer}} Julius Natterer and is now commonly used across Austria, Switzerland and Germany, whilst slowly emerging in the UK. Originally it consisted of low grade timber posts continuously nailed together to form panels strong enough to support mines and railways. In 1999 a German company developed a doweled system which relied on the varying moisture content to form solid structural panels however many companies introduced glue to the system to strengthen it. In 2001, a new variant of Brettstapel was developed where diagonal dowels replaced the perpendicular ones thus resolving separation issues and allowing for longer spans. Presently only one company uses the diagonal dowel system whilst all except for two (who still use nails) use perpendicular dowels, mostly without glue. There are now a range of companies producing CLT <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> (rotating layers of boards) using timber dowels based upon Brettstapel.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the strength properties of glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> composed of edge-glued laminae and to investigate the influence of edge gluing on the strength properties. Glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> composed of multiple-grade laminae (symmetrical composition, strength grade E 95 -F 270, 10 laminations) was produced from karamatsu (Larix kaempferi) edge-glued laminae according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard. The bending, tensile, and compressive strengths of the glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> were measured. The average bending, tensile, and compressive strengths were 33.4, 24.5, and 35.9 MPa, respectively, and these values are almost equal to those of glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> composed of karamatsu single-piece laminae. It was determined that finger-joints and knots in the edge-glued laminae played a significant role in the failure of specimens. However, the use of glued edge-joints did not appear to affect the failure of specimens.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} bending {{tests performed}} on composite beams made from glulam beams and <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> (CLT) panels. The composite beam, with a T-cross section, represents {{a section of}} a floor element in a multi-storey CLT construction system. The shear connections used were made either of double-sided punched metal plate fasteners, either of inclined screws, or {{of a combination of}} both fastener types. The screws are used to secure the shear connection with double-sided nail plates with respect to possible separation forces between the glulam and the CLT. An additional test with a screw glued connection was made for comparison as the upper bound case in terms of composite action. The results show the beams with double-sided nail plates (with or without screws) achieved a very high level of composite action and an overall satisfactory behaviour. Almost full composite action was achieved for the screw-glued composite beam. A detailed design example of the beam element according to the Eurocode 5 and Finnish National Annex is presented.

40|$|Abstract]: <b>Cross</b> <b>Laminated</b> <b>Timber</b> (CLT) is {{made from}} {{dimensional}} lumber, laminated in layers with the grain in each layer placed orthogonal to the layer before it. The resultant product is not dissimilar to thick plywood. CLT {{is made from}} timber, which is an environmentally attractive option {{in comparison to the}} reinforced concrete or steel structures which dominate the multistorey building market sector. Timber is {{one of the very few}} sustainable carbon neutral building materials available. New technology such as advanced Building Information Modeling (BIM) software and high accuracy CNC machinery are giving CLT the advantage over traditional on-site construction methods. Prefabrication is the key to CLT’s improved construction time-frames, far greater quality control, than on-site construction can deliver. There are no CLT manufacturers currently producing in Australia. Hyne and Son Pty Ltd. is a leading Australian manufacturer and distributor of engineered, structural and decorative softwood products to the building industry. This project forms part of an initial investigation into <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> wall panels, manufactured from non-structural low grade pine. Initially, the investigations will be directed solely at the low-rise multistorey residential market sector, which Hyne already services with other products. The steps required to firstly select a suitable CLT panel using Finite Element Analysis through to fabrication of a sample CLT panel, experimental design and testing of structural properties, and finally comparing results with accepted formula from the Australian standards for the design of plywood. Considerations such as fire, and deflection under load are also made. Results from initial investigations show that, even though fabricated from low grade structural timber, CLT has enormous axial capacity. Conclusions are drawn as to the application of certain parts of AS 1720 Timber Structures to <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> design...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} years, timber {{has become a}} {{cutting-edge}} product, {{but it has not}} achieved the limits of its evolution. The belief that timber can be used solely for the construction of holiday houses, garden sheds, and other functional facilities is proving to be obsolete. Nowadays, both public and private timber constructions can compete with the most challenging building structures. What enhanced the development of timber was the invention of cross laminated timber; a construction element that allows for highly complicated and demanding architectural and constructional building designs. This graduation thesis presents a design of a <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> panel construction in a seismic area. First, the thesis highlights the advantages of timber constructions in terms of sustainable development. It goes on to describe cross laminated wooden panels, which have more uniform and better mechanical properties than one-way laminated timber elements. For the structural design of <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> panels, the HOBS (‘Homogenised, Orthotropic plane stress Blass reduced cross Section’) method was used, as proposed by Blass and Fellmoser. The design of the load-bearing construction elements made of <b>cross</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> was based on an architecture student’s blueprints of a student residence halls. The modelling of the construction was conducted by the Sofistik software, which is used for basic limit states and seismic state. The crucial load-bearing elements and connectional joints were designed for the ultimate limit state. Service limit state check was performed by controls for deflection of timber panels and the displacement of flooring during seismic activity. A simplified calculation, adhering to the standard SIST EN 1995 - 1 - 2 and based on a reduced crosssection method, was used to verify the construction's compliance with the fire safety regulations. The thesis ends with a description of preservational methods for timber construction...|$|E
