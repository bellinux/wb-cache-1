In this paper, we take the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> area and the reasons why changes triggered as the subject of our study. We use the technology of Remote Sensing (RS) to gain data of crops area of Ningbo in the period from 1986 to 2005, when China was conducting the reform and opening up and reconstruction of agriculture, which {{caused a lot of}} change in crops area. We adopt Data Mining (DM) to gain knowledge and analyze this phenomenon, as well as predicate the tendency of the crops area in the future. In this paper, the evolution algorithm of data mining is used to model the changes and the tendency of crops coverage as time goes by. We take into account four factors: State Management (SM), Local Management (LM), Market (MK) and Weather (WH). In our research, we found firstly the factor of “SM ” is a dominant factor but its influence will decline in the future, secondly the factor of “MK ” is a rising and important factor, thirdly the factor of “LM ” is in the rising stage but it wouldn’t have more share than the factor of “MK”, and finally “WH ” factor which accounts for a large proportion in the past and now is declining to the lightest one. According to our experiment, it is predicated that Chinese crops area downward trend will decelerate, on the contrary it will have a continuous rising until it gets to the optimization conditions and then realize the harmonious use of the land. 1...|$|E

Historically, hinterlands to these cities have acted as breadbaskets producing food to the urban residents. Accordingly, {{a large amount of}} available freshwater has been needed to support these croplands. However, the rapid expansion of cities in developing countries has significantly changed both the croplands around cities and the water demand. It is thus important to quantitatively investigate the water-food nexus of cities related to the changing hinterland agriculture. Water footprint is an indicator reflecting the human impact on water. In this study, we quantified both the blue and green water footprint <b>of</b> major <b>crop</b> products in Suzhou city, China using a bottom-up accounting method. A novel decomposition analysis was carried out with a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to study the driving forces that changed the water footprint during the period 2001 - 2010. The drivers were designed to reflect the factors related to farmland, such as yield and crop area. This is different from previous decomposition analyses, which focused on economic factors such as GDP. The results show that the <b>crop</b> water footprint <b>of</b> Suzhou city has seen a general decreasing trend between 2001 and 2010. The decomposition analysis showed that the decline <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> area was the main driver that decreased the crop water footprint, followed by the virtual water content (water consumption per unit of production). In contrast the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> combination and yield contributed to an increase in the crop water footprint.

The intense and extensive agriculture <b>of</b> water demanding <b>crops,</b> such as cotton, {{and the absence of}} reasonable water resources management have lead to a remarkable water demand increase, which is usually fulfilled by the over-exploitation of groundwater resources. This unsustainable practice has deteriorated the already disturbed water balance and accelerated water resources degradation.

Thus, it is urgent and important to accurately estimate the leaf nitrogen contents (LNC) <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> for precision nitrogen management. Based on the correlation between LNC and reflectance spectra, the hyperspectral LiDAR (HSL) system can determine three-dimensional structural parameters and biochemical <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops.</b> Thereby, HSL technology has been widely used to monitor the LNC <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> at leaf and canopy levels. In addition, the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of chlorophyll, related to the histological structure and physiological conditions of green plants, {{can also be utilized}} to detect nutrient stress in crops. In this study, four regression algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs), partial least squares (PLS) and two artificial neural networks (ANNs), back propagation NNs (BP-NNs) and radial basic function NNs (RBF-NNs), were selected to estimate rice LNC in booting and heading stages based on reflectance and LIF spectra. These four regression algorithms were used for 36 input variables, including the reflectance spectral variables on 32 wavelengths and four peaks of the LIF spectra. A feature weight algorithm was proposed to select different band combinations for the LNC retrieval models. The determination coefficient (R 2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the retrieval models were utilized to compare their abilities of estimating the rice LNC.

Spatiotemporal <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> wheat phenology and seasonal temperature, as well as the correlations between them were presented. During the investigation period, heading dates advanced significantly at 43 stations from the 108 investigated stations: maturity dates advanced significantly at 41 stations from the 109 investigated stations. Lengths of growing period (from sowing to maturity) and vegetative growing period (from sowing to heading) were significantly reduced at about 30 % of the investigated stations, especially for spring wheat in northwestern China, despite thermal accumulation during the periods increased. In contrast, although significantly and negatively related to mean temperature, lengths of reproductive growing period (from heading to maturity) increased at 60 % of the investigated stations, owing to increase in crop cultivars thermal requirements or/and decrease in mean temperature. The results showed that besides the complex influences of agronomic factors, climate change contributed substantially to the shift of wheat phenology. Mean day length during vegetative growing period had a decreasing trend at most of the investigated stations owing to delay of sowing date or/and advancement of heading date, which counterbalanced the roles of temperature in controlling the duration of vegetative growing period. In-depth analyses showed that thermal requirements from sowing to almost each development stage increased, however the thermal requirements to complete each single development stage changed differently, which tended to increase yield and adapt to ongoing climate change. Our findings have important implications for improving climate change impact studies, for breeding scientists to breed higher yielding cultivars, and for agricultural production to cope with ongoing climate change.

The framework includes coupled components for operation of hydrotechnical projects (reservoir operation and irrigation works) and estimation of agricultural water demands at several spatial scales using remote sensing. The study area was sub-divided into irrigation zones based on land use maps derived from Landsat 5 TM images for the year 2007. Satellite-based energy balance for mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration (METRIC) was used to derive actual evapotranspiration (ET) and crop coefficient (ETrF) values from Landsat TM imagery. Agricultural water needs were estimated using the FAO method for each zone and each control node of the system for a number of water resources management strategies. Two operational strategies of hydro-technical project development (present situation without operation of the reservoir and future situation with the operation of the reservoir) are coupled with three water demand strategies.

This {{irrigation area}} is supplied by Lambunu River through its intake in Lambunu Weir and the irrigation water is supplied gravitationally. In the year 2014, planting pattern {{used in the}} area was paddy-paddy with 3, 825 ha and 3, 645 ha for planting schedule I and II, respectively. Ir- rigation operational pattern in Lambunu varied due to the development in irrigation system, the decrease of function of irrigation structures, the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern, and the fluctuation of irrigation water availability. Today, Lambunu Irrigation Area captures 5, 041 ha of potential areas. Due to the changes in irrigation system and water availability, {{it is necessary to}} do some optimiza- tion in irrigation operational patern in Lambunu in order to find optimum planting area and opti- mum farming production. Of some alternatives irrigation operational patterns, carried out based on grouped and rotation system for paddy-paddy-secondary crops, the most optimum irrigation operational patterns has been found. It is irrigation operational patterns with ungrouped system and three planting schedules as follows: - Paddy I is in December I to March II - Paddy II is in April I to July II - Secondary crops in August I to November II Crop intensity for paddy and secondary crops in the area is 200 % and 23 %- 28 %, respectively. Grouped system will give the same result. However, it will reduce the maximum discharge of irrigation water demand...|$|R

The results are as follows. 1) The sown areas of winter wheat in the 11 cities in the Hebei Plain all shrunk during the study period. The shrinkage rate was 16. 07 % and the total shrinkage area amounted to 49. 62 x 10 (4) ha. The shrinkage was most serious in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan metropolitan agglomerate, with a shrinkage rate of 47. 23 %. 2) The precipitation fill rate of winter wheat was only 20 %- 30 %, while those of spring maize and summer maize both exceeded 50 %. The irrigation water resources demanded by the winter wheat -summer maize double cropping system ranged from 400 mm to 530 mm, while those demanded by the spring maize single cropping system ranged only from 160 mm to 210 mm. 3) The water resources conserved {{as a result of the}} winter wheat sown area shrinkage during the study period were about 15. 96 x 10 (8) m(3) /a, accounting for 27. 85 % of those provided for Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei by the first phase of the Mid-Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. </p...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{land use}} is {{affected}} by government policies and leads to different consequences of regional sustainability. In this work, changes in cropping patterns including acreage, cropping locations and management-related environmental impacts were simulated under various policy scenarios for Quzhou County, China. This county is in China's major agricultural region, the North China Plain. Four dominant crop systems were categorized (winter wheat/summer maize, winter wheat/summer maize/spring maize, cotton, and vegetables) and analyzed, following two alternative policy scenarios that either prioritized government funding to subsidize crop production ("subsidy" scenario) or promoted advanced irrigation techniques ("technique" scenario). Input output coefficients for all four crop systems were determined, mainly irrigation demand, yield, and price of produce, but other factors like a limited {{area of arable land}} and scarce regional water resources were also considered. For the simulation, a UNDO Inc. system was linked with the CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects) model. Temporal <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> systems were simulated with the LINDO system, whereas spatial dynamics <b>of</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns were simulated with the CLUE model, based on land suitability maps. The results show that crop patterns changed variably with time under the two scenarios, and water availability was the primary constraint on sustainability of land use. Under the subsidy scenario, winter wheat/summer maize/spring maize became dominant across the entire county, replacing other crop systems. In contrast, the vegetable system gradually occupied farmland surrounding the township under the technique scenario. The different policies produced opposite consequences for regional sustainability. Although a "subsidy" policy contributed to farmers' income, it did not encourage water conservation for sustainable crop production, leading to land abandonment because of water shortage. In contrast, the "technique" policy partially cut direct financial benefits to farmers, but promoted water conservation and made a substantial contribution to agricultural sustainability.

Here, the wheat phenology at more than 100 national agro-meteorological experiment stations across China spanning the years 1981 - 2007 was examined. Spatiotemporal <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> wheat phenology and seasonal temperature, as well as the correlations between them were presented. During the investigation period, heading dates advanced significantly at 43 stations from the 108 investigated stations: maturity dates advanced significantly at 41 stations from the 109 investigated stations. Lengths of growing period (from sowing to maturity) and vegetative growing period (from sowing to heading) were significantly reduced at about 30 % of the investigated stations, especially for spring wheat in northwestern China, despite thermal accumulation during the periods increased. In contrast, although significantly and negatively related to mean temperature, lengths of reproductive growing period (from heading to maturity) increased at 60 % of the investigated stations, owing to increase in crop cultivars thermal requirements or/and decrease in mean temperature. The results showed that besides the complex influences of agronomic factors, climate change contributed substantially to the shift of wheat phenology. Mean day length during vegetative growing period had a decreasing trend at most of the investigated stations owing to delay of sowing date or/and advancement of heading date, which counterbalanced the roles of temperature in controlling the duration of vegetative growing period. In-depth analyses showed that thermal requirements from sowing to almost each development stage increased, however the thermal requirements to complete each single development stage changed differently, which tended to increase yield and adapt to ongoing climate change. Our findings have important implications for improving climate change impact studies, for breeding scientists to breed higher yielding cultivars, and for agricultural production to cope with ongoing climate change...|$|R

Given the serious threats to food security, attention should shift to an action-oriented research agenda, where we see four key challenges: (a) changing the culture of research; (b) deriving stakeholder-driven portfolios of options for farmers, communities and countries; (c) ensuring that adaptation actions are relevant to those most vulnerable to climate change; (d) combining adaptation and mitigation...|$|R
