50|$|The {{district}} court considered each patent separately. It found claim 1 of the '065 patent {{representative of the}} invention. That claim provides:A computer program product embodied on a <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> storage <b>medium</b> for processing network account information comprising::computer code for receiving from a first source a first network accounting record;:computer code for correlating the first network accounting record with accounting information available from a second source; and:computer code for using the accounting information with which the first network accounting record is correlated to enhance the first network accounting record.|$|R
40|$|A method, apparatus, system, {{article of}} manufacture, and <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> storage <b>medium</b> provide {{the ability to}} measure wind. Data at a first {{resolution}} (i. e., low resolution data) is collected by a satellite scatterometer. Thin slices of the data are determined. A collocation of the data slices are determined at each grid cell center to obtain ensembles of collocated data slices. Each ensemble of collocated data slices is decomposed into a mean part and a fluctuating part. The data is reconstructed at a second resolution from the mean part and a residue of the fluctuating part. A wind measurement is determined from the data at the second resolution using a wind model function. A description of the wind measurement is output...|$|R
40|$|WO 2004077360 A UPAB: 20041011 NOVELTY - Video coding method {{involves}} texture {{analysis and}} synthesis. According to the method, video scene texture is analyzed such that synthesized texture areas are determined. Video scene coding is then undertaken using the synthesized texture area data. Texture area data and metadata are generated. Coded data and metadata are evaluated by a decoder so that video scenes are reconstructed by synthetically generated textures by evaluation of determined area metadata. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:- (a) a chip and or processor arrangement for video coding; (b) {{a computer program}} for video programming and; (c) a <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> storage <b>medium</b> for storing a program for video programming. USE - Video-coding method based on texture analysis and synthesis. ADVANTAGE - The amount of video data to be transferred is reduced...|$|R
5000|$|In CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc., Federal Circuit {{found that}} a broadly worded method claim and a claim reciting a <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> <b>medium</b> for {{executing}} the method claim were ineligible. Federal Circuit concluded the claims were drawn to a method of verifying the validity of credit card transactions over the Internet, and the steps in the method could be performed in the human mind or by a human using a pen and paper.|$|E
50|$|The court {{categorized}} Claim 2 as a Beauregard claim, a claim {{involving a}} <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> <b>medium</b> containing instructions {{for a computer}} to perform the process. The court noted that Claim 2 contains language nearly identical to that in Claim 3 will only a few additions. As such, Claim 2 was also found unpatentable because it is related to a mental process. While CyberSource claims that the claim is indeed patentable because it is coupled with a manufacture or machine unlike in Claim 3, the court ignores the claim's structural category based on its general language. Citing court decisions in Gottschalk v. Benson, the court determined that mental processes are not patentable, {{even if they are}} performed by computers.|$|E
50|$|The court {{turned to}} the '510 patent, whose claim 16 was representative:A {{computer}} program product stored in a <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> <b>medium</b> for reporting on a collection of network usage information from a plurality of network devices, comprising::computer code for collecting network communications usage information in real-time from a plurality of network devices at a plurality of layers;:computer code for filtering and aggregating the network communications usage information;:computer code for completing a plurality of data records from the filtered and aggregated network communications usage information, the plurality of data records corresponding to network usage by a plurality of users;:computer code for storing the plurality of data records in a database;:computer code for submitting queries to the database utilizing predetermined reports for retrieving information on {{the collection of the}} network usage information from the network devices; and:computer code for outputting a report based on the queries;::wherein resource consumption queries are submitted to the database utilizing the reports for retrieving information on resource consumption in a network; and::wherein a resource consumption report is outputted based on the resource consumption queries.|$|E

5000|$|In Content Extraction &Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, National Ass’n, {{we found}} that claims {{directed}} to the abstract idea of collecting data from hardcopy documents, recognizing certain information within the collected data, and storing that information in memory were ineligible. This was true despite noting that, if the claims were construed in the most favorable manner to the appellants, the claims would require scanning and processing technology.In Ultramercial, {{we found that}} claims directed to the abstract idea of using an advertisement as an exchange orcurrency were ineligible even though the claims were tied to a general purpose computer and invoked the Internet.In buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc., we found that claims directed to the abstract idea of creating a contractual relationship—a transaction performance guaranty—were ineligible despite the recitation of a computer that received and sent information over a network.In Bancorp Services, L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. [...] we found that a broadly worded method claim and a claim reciting a <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> <b>medium</b> for executing the method claim were ineligible. We concluded the claims were drawn to a method of verifying the validity of credit card transactions over the Internet, and the steps in the method could be performed in the human mind or by a human using a pen and paper.These cases may be contrasted with instances {{in which we have}} found patents directed to patent-eligible subject matter. For example, in DDR Holdings, LLC v.Hotels.com, L.P., we found that claims reciting a solution that was necessarily rooted in computer technology to overcome a problem specifically arising in the realm of computer networks were eligible. We drew a distinction between the patent-eligible claims at issue and patent-ineligible claims in the past that had merely recited commonplace business methods aimed at processing business information, applying known business processes to particular technological environments.|$|E
