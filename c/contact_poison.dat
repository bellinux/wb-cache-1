5|$|Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler is {{credited}} with the first synthesis of DDT (DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane) in 1874. The insecticidal properties of DDT were identified in 1939 by chemist Paul Hermann Müller of Geigy Pharmaceutical. For his discovery of DDT as a <b>contact</b> <b>poison</b> against several arthropods, {{he was awarded the}} 1948 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In the fall of 1942, samples of the chemical were acquired by the United States, Britain and Germany. Laboratory tests demonstrated that it was highly effective against many insects.|$|E
5|$|Hydrofluoric acid is a <b>contact</b> <b>poison</b> {{with greater}} hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a colorless, tasteless, {{and almost}} odorless {{crystalline}} organochlorine {{known for its}} insecticidal properties and environmental impacts. First synthesized in 1874, DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Müller in 1939. DDT {{was used in the}} second half of World War II to control malaria and typhus among civilians and troops.

50|$|A {{larvicide}} (alternatively larvacide) is an insecticide that {{is specifically}} targeted against the larval life stage of an insect. Their most common use is against mosquitoes.

50|$|The {{thickness}} of the barrier film is also quite important; with too thin a layer, the copper <b>contacts</b> <b>poison</b> the very devices that they connect to; with too thick a layer, the stack of two barrier metal films and a copper conductor have a greater total resistance than aluminium interconnects, eliminating any benefit.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to being a highly corrosive liquid, hydrofluoric acid is also a powerful <b>contact</b> <b>poison.</b> [...] Because of the ability of hydrofluoric acid to penetrate tissue, poisoning can occur readily through exposure of skin or eyes, or when inhaled or swallowed. Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, and this can provide false reassurance to victims, causing them to delay medical treatment. Despite having an irritating odor, HF may reach dangerous levels without an obvious odor. HF interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful. Accidental exposures can go unnoticed, delaying treatment and increasing the extent and seriousness of the injury. Symptoms of HF exposure include irritation of the eyes, skin, nose, and throat, eye and skin burns, rhinitis, bronchitis, pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs), and bone damage.|$|E

A chemical commonly used in the United States is methoprene, considered slightly toxic to larger animals, which mimics and interferes with natural growth hormones in mosquito larvae, preventing development. Methoprene is frequently distributed in time-release briquette form in breeding areas.|$|R

For 122 cases a nonphysician was the initial <b>poison</b> control center <b>contact.</b> Of the nonphysician contacts, 41 had already consulted a health care provider and been referred to the poison control center for assistance. Of the 70 persons with exposure, only 21 had been aware before their exposures that poison control center services might include occupational chemical illness consultation.

40|$|The Dufour's gland {{secretion}} of C. scutellaris {{contains a}} series of C 23 long chain derivatives characterized {{by the presence of}} a cross-conjugated dienone linked to either a primary acetate, an aldehyde, or a carboxylic acid function. These compounds further differ from each other by the degree of unsaturation and (or) the position of an isolated double bond in the carbon atom chain. A combination of spectroscopic data and chemical degradations led to structures 1 a-c, 2 a-c, and 5 a-c for the major components of the secretion. The highly electrophilic character of these compounds accounts for their efficiency as <b>contact</b> <b>poisons.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Owing to its lesser chemical dissociation in water (remaining a neutral molecule), hydrogen fluoride penetrates tissue more quickly than typical acids.

The bioactivity of eugenol on RFB is tested with normal bioactivity technique such as topical application and fumigant methods. The results show that treated with eugenol oil, the egg of RFB can not complete its life history. Furthermore, different developmental stages of RFB egghave different sensityvity to eugenol. Under the condition of (31 ±) ℃ and 50 %- 85 %, the egg at the age of about 72 h is the most sensitive to eugenol, and even at the concentration of 6 uL/mL,it cancompletely inhibit the egg hatching of RFB. The eugenol has distinctively <b>contact</b> <b>poison</b> to larva and adult. The LC 50 of larva and adnlt respectively are 218. 999 9 uL/mL and 363. 077 4 uL/mL, which mean that the larva ismore sensitive to eugenol than to adult, and the <b>contact</b> <b>poison</b> of eugenol to larva is higher than to adult.
