5|$|In December 2009, Infinity Welcomes <b>Careful</b> Drivers was {{released}} in Germany with the title Roter Zwerg (Red Dwarf in German).|$|E
5|$|In an end tag, Blake confronts Coulson {{about his}} insubordination, warning {{him that he}} could lose his team if he is not <b>careful.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{copyright}} prosecution, ReactOS must be expressly completely distinct and non-derivative from Windows, a goal which needs very <b>careful</b> work.|$|E
5|$|Proper {{discipline}} {{for children}} while being <b>careful</b> not to provoke them.|$|E
5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} were even more prone to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very <b>careful</b> control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5|$|Adhesion problems. The {{locomotives}} {{were often}} prone to wheelslip, and required very <b>careful</b> driving when starting a heavy train from rest, but once into their stride they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and being remarkably stable when hauling heavy expresses.|$|E
5|$|As {{one area}} in which OPEC members {{have been able to}} {{cooperate}} productively over the decades, the organization has significantly improved {{the quality and quantity of}} information available about the international oil market. This is especially helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of <b>careful</b> planning.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen is {{recognised}} globally as an {{exemplar of}} best practice urban planning. Its thriving mixed use city centre {{is defined by}} striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through <b>careful</b> replanning {{in the second half}} of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{reaction}} of indium with the pnictogens produces the gray or semimetallic III–V semiconductors. Many of them slowly decompose in moist air, necessitating <b>careful</b> storage of semiconductor compounds to prevent {{contact with the}} atmosphere. Indium nitride is readily attacked by acids and alkalis.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Pope Urban VIII had {{personally}} asked Galileo to give arguments {{for and against}} heliocentrism in the book, and to be <b>careful</b> not to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.|$|E
5|$|His mother, Queen Hedvig Eleonora, {{remained}} the formal regent until Charles XI attained his majority on 18 December 1672, {{but she was}} <b>careful</b> not to embroil herself in political conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Franz {{maintained}} {{a photo album}} against orders never to take photographs inside Treblinka. He named it Schöne Zeiten ("Good Times"). His album is a rare source of images illustrating the mechanised grave digging, brickworks in Małkinia and the Treblinka zoo, among others. Franz was <b>careful</b> not to photograph the gas chambers.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, <b>careful</b> rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). <b>Careful</b> correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|One {{advantage}} of this camera system {{is that it allows}} the game designers to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the possibility to create a mood through camerawork and <b>careful</b> selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E
5|$|Pallas {{has been}} {{observed}} occulting stars several times, including the best observed of all asteroid occultation events on 29 May 1983, when <b>careful</b> occultation timing measurements were taken by 140 observers. These resulted in the first accurate measurements of its diameter.|$|E
5|$|Schubart's poem {{takes the}} {{viewpoint}} of a male speaker, advising women to be <b>careful</b> of young men. By removing the stanza, Schubert removes the moral and creates uncertainty in {{the sex of the}} narrator.|$|E
5|$|Small commercially reared parasitoidal wasps, Trichogramma ostriniae, provide {{limited and}} erratic {{control of the}} European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis), a serious pest. <b>Careful</b> {{formulations}} of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis are more effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} some very <b>careful</b> readers; the ornithologist Alfred Newton noticed that Rennie had used an {{identical}} paragraph to describe two birds, the beam bird (now called the spotted flycatcher) and the pied flycatcher, though their descriptions were separated by 300 pages.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the film's première, it was made freely {{available}} from the iTunes Store for one month, during which time it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. The film garnered near universal critical acclaim from reviewers, who compared it favorably to The Darjeeling Limited and praised its richness, poignancy, and <b>careful</b> construction.|$|E
5|$|The divers made <b>careful</b> {{maps of the}} {{material}} they recovered, but {{had no way of}} determining on the spot what was inside the metal conglomerates encrusted by marine growth.|$|E
5|$|The move 7.Bf4 {{is similar}} in spirit to 7.Nd2, in that White hopes to {{inconvenience}} Black by a quick attack on d6. After 7...Bg7 8.Qa4+! Bd7 9.Qb3 White attacks both b7 and d6, and Black must be <b>careful</b> not to drift into a passive position after 9...Qc7 10.e4 0-0.|$|E
5|$|The proper METHOD for {{studying}} poetry and good letters is {{the method of}} contemporary biologists, that is <b>careful</b> first-hand examination of the matter, and continual COMPARISON of one 'slide' or specimen with another. No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significant}} differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults, and these are taken into <b>careful</b> consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any pediatric patient. The differences, which are quite significant in infants, gradually disappear as the human body approaches a mature age and body mass index.|$|E
5|$|This <b>careful</b> {{treatment}} of the Haraldskær Woman's remains explains the excellent state of conservation of the corpse; conversely, Tollund Man, a later discovery, was not properly conserved {{and most of the}} body has been lost, leaving only the head as original remains in his display.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} {{period of about}} five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours. Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs. During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs, small pens designed to aid both <b>careful</b> observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without <b>careful</b> moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} can affect dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom of}} the hold shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect. The only way to control these risks is by good ventilation practices and <b>careful</b> monitoring for the presence of water.|$|E
5|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, {{different}} medical issues can appear, such as oral and dental disease, pressure ulcers, malnutrition, hygiene problems, or respiratory, skin, or eye infections. <b>Careful</b> management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed {{when they do}} arise. During {{the final stages of}} the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of hospice.|$|E
5|$|Ballistics was {{the first}} game {{developed}} at Grin. <b>Careful</b> planning and production methods enabled a very quick completion time of 6 months; the game was finished before even acquiring a distribution partner. Grin used TQM methods to ensure a high standard of work, and JIT techniques to ensure the timing of different production phases came together.|$|E
5|$|Both {{articles}} {{address the}} issue of who the killer could alternatively have been, and both of them mention Carol's other lovers, and John Rapson, responsible for murdering Carol's sister. Both of the articles mention {{that he was in the}} Barrow area around the time of the murder, but both of them are <b>careful</b> to point out that they are not accusing him of being the murderer.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{emphasized}} a <b>careful</b> {{approach to}} the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.|$|E
5|$|By <b>careful</b> examination, the {{luminosity}} {{was found}} to proceed from the gills and not the stipe, nor from any fragment of rotten wood attached to the specimen. This phosphoresence was not observed in all specimens brought in for examination, and seemed to depend on some peculiar condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Careful</b> {{measurement}} of {{the positions of the}} planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Careful</b> {{selection}} of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending {{on the law of}} the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as a son of a sovereign, he might not be able to claim any of the royal status of his father.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} {{captured}} Zero had been {{transmitted to the}} U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) and Grumman Aircraft. After <b>careful</b> study, Roy Grumman decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except in range, without sacrificing pilot armor, self-sealing tanks and fuselage structure. The new F6F Hellcat would compensate for the extra weight with additional power.|$|E
