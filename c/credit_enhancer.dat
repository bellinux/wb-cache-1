Periodically during the {{reinvestment}} period, this provision permits the seller under certain conditions, and with Trustee approval, to withdraw individual accounts {{from the pool}} of receivables securitized. The conditions of the securitization frequently require that (1) accounts be selected on a random basis, (2) the removal be limited {{to no more than}} one per month, (3) the amount of any one removal be limited to a specified fixed percentage of receivables in the pool, (4) the removal cannot materially and adversely affect the interests of an investor or third-party <b>credit</b> <b>enhancer,</b> and (5) the pool of receivables have specified minimum credit characteristics prior to a proposed removal.

It shows that for investment grade bonds, CE on average inflates the bond yield spread by 23 basis points. In a sharp contrast, for speculative bonds, CE on average lowers the bond yield spread by 60 basis points. Further investigation reveals {{that the effect of}} CE is a joint effect of credit rating enhancement and increased expected equity idiosyncratic volatility. Finally, the third essay reports that the underperformance of a special type of <b>credit</b> <b>enhancer,</b> credit risk insurers (CRIs), during the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis is mainly attributed to the greater systemic risk of CRIs. It also shows the credit spreads of insured bonds increase significantly after their insurers are downgraded or put in the negative watch list. ...|$|E
