40|$|This brief article {{provides}} an overview of the economic outlook based on the latest economic data. Economic prospects over the last quarter have not improved, and have shown signs of worsening in some areas. Recovery from the persistent and lengthy recession is unlikely to become apparent until the second half of this year. Provisional figures for the fourth quarter of last year indicate that UK gross domestic product fell by 0. 3 %. Unless subject to an unusually large upward revision, this means that non-oil GDP has fallen for six successive quarters, the longest recession since the Second World War. While still less deep overall than the 1979 - 81 recession, the extent of the present slump should not be underestimated. For example, in 1991 GDP declined by 2. 5 %, the largest decline in a single calendar year for sixty years. Investment spending has also been badly hit over the last year; capital expenditure by UK manufacturing industry fell by 15 % in 1991, and was still declining in the final quarter of last year. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of <b>outstanding</b> consumer credit (excluding bank loans) has fallen every month from August last year to January, and retail sales are struggling to show any signs of upward movement...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of backing films on transdermal delivery of cyclobenzaprine patch. Different backing films were chosen to prepare the cyclobenzaprine transdermal patch. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of cyclobenzaprine released from different patches was evaluated in vitro. To investigate the interaction between cyclobenzaprine and backing films, the partitioning experiments and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy were performed. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of cyclobenzaprine released from the patch with Cotran™ 9700 as backing film was less than that of other patches with different backing films. Furthermore, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of cyclobenzaprine released from the patch with Cotran™ 9700 as backing film decreased significantly after 7 [*]d storage at room condition. The partitioning experiments indicated a strong adsorption of cyclobenzaprine onto the Cotran™ 9700, which could explain the decrease of <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of cyclobenzaprine released from the patch with Cotran™ 9700 as backing film. According to the ATR-FTIR results, there was no interaction between Cotran™ 9700 and cyclobenzaprine. The effect of backing films on the release behavior of cyclobenzaprine transdermal patch was attributed to the adsorption of cyclobenzaprine onto the Cotran™ 9700...|$|R

40|$|In Japan, {{information}} on daily Japanese cedar pollen counts is made public during pollen season. If symptom severity and treatment outcome are predictable {{according to these}} pollen counts, management of seasonal allergic rhinitis may become more precise. The aims {{of the study were}} to evaluate the relationship between airborne pollen counts, symptom severity and treatment outcome in Japanese cedar pollinosis patients. In the randomized study, patients with moderate to most severe Japanese pollinosis were treated with fexofenadine (60 mg BD) or fexofenadine and nasal corticosteroids for 2 weeks. During the same period daily airborne pollen counts were measured. A total of 105 adult patients were enrolled. No difference of treatment efficacy was seen among groups. Detailed results of efficacy and safety were previously described elsewhere. In univariate analysis, the mean <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of airborne pollen exposure for 4 days prior to the study tended to affect symptom severity (P = 0. 053) and the mean <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of airborne pollen during the treatment period tended to show difference among five treatment outcome categories (P = 0. 066). In multivariate analysis, the mean <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of airborne pollen exposure for 4 days prior to the study was identified as the only significant factor of symptom severity (P = 0. 0327) and <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of airborne pollen during the treatment period (P = 0. 027) and allergic history (P = 0. 027) were significant factors of treatment outcomes.

Statistically significant differences in the cumulative exhaled metallic mercury levels were observed between acatalasemic and hypocatalasemic mice, between normal and hypocatalasemic mice, and between acatalasemic and normal mice using the method of one way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

40|$|The {{amount of}} mercury exhaled from normal and acatalasemic mice exposed to {{metallic}} mercury vapor after administration of aminotriazole or ethanol was investigated. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of mercury exhaled from acatalasemic mice {{was significantly higher}} than that of normal mice. Moreover, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of mercury exhaled from acatalasemic mice pretreated with aminotriazole or ethanol {{was significantly higher than}} that of normal mice, although the difference in mercury exhaled from normal and acatalasemic mice was not significant. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of mercury exhaled from normal and acatalasemic mice pretreated with aminotriazole or ethanol was significantly higher than that of control mice. The results suggest that catalase activity in the lungs was inhibited by aminotriazole or ethanol, resulting in an increase in the level of mercury exhaled from the mice. The mercury concentration in organs of normal and acatalasemic mice, and mice exposed to metallic mercury vapor after administration of aminotriazole or ethanol was investigated. The mercury concentration in the liver of acatalasemic mice, and acatalasemic mice pretreated with aminotriazole or ethanol was higher than that of normal mice. In contrast, the concentration in the lungs and blood were lower than those of normal mice...|$|R
40|$|Relationship between {{permeation}} {{of ethanol}} and leaching of hemoglobin from capillary blood, {{as a possible}} index of skin irritancy, was examined in hairless rats. Ethanol solutions were applied in vivo on the abdominal skin for 5 h and then content of Fe, instead of hemoglobin, in the application site was measured. Permeation of ethanol through the skin was examined in vitro in the corresponding condition. The index, i. e. Fe content in the skin, shows correlation with <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of ethanol permeated or maximum flux of ethanol through the skin, while that wasn't correlated with concentration and content of ethanol in the applied solution. Since a slow and continuous permeation of ethanol for 8 h didn't damage the skin, the maximum flux is more important parameter for the effect of ethanol on the skin irritation than the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of ethanol permeated. Relationship between permeation of ethanol and morphine hydrochloride (MPH) was also examined. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of MPH was correlated with the maximum flux of ethanol. A formulation containing ethanol should be designed carefully so as to attain effective skin permeation of drug while avoiding the occurrence of skin irritation...|$|R

The drug loading and release behaviors of HAp hollow ellipsoidal capsules were also investigated. The ibuprofen-loaded HAp hollow ellipsoidal capsules showed a slow and sustained release of ibuprofen in SBF. A linear relationship between the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of the released ibuprofen and the square root of time was found for the first 12 h. Compared with HAp nanostructured hollow ellipsoidal capsules, the Eu 3 +:ACP porous nanosphere drug delivery system also showed a slow and sustained drug release profile. However, the IBU/Eu 3 +:ACP porous nanosphere drug delivery system exhibited a faster drug release rate than that of HAp nanostructured hollow ellipsoidal capsules. On the other hand, the drug release kinetics is different for the two drug delivery systems. For the IBU/Eu 3 +:ACP porous nanosphere drug delivery system, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of the released drug has a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of release time (ln(t)), instead of the square root of time. However, for IBU/HAp nanostructured hollow ellipsoidal capsule drug delivery system, a linear relationship between the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of the released ibuprofen and the square root of time was found. The different drug release properties for the two drug delivery systems may be explained by the different chemical compositions, structures, and morphologies of the two samples.|$|R
