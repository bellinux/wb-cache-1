Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006 in China. Four themes were found. China’s textile and <b>clothing</b> <b>industries</b> have transitioned from a planned economic system to a market economic system. The major textile and clothing production and trading centers nowadays are located along the East Coast of China. Different formats of textile and clothing enterprises have gone through different transitional processes. Most of these companies today face three challenges: the instability of the trading environment, changing currency exchange rates, and an increasing energy price. New strategies have been developed, such as focusing on quality rather than quantity, developing Chinese brands, and moving facilities to other countries to avoid safeguards and restraints and to get even cheaper labor. Contributions and limitations are discussed as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Sizing {{systems have}} been widely used for large scale <b>clothing</b> <b>industries.</b> There is some dissatisfaction because of loosing of fit, small cover factor and large numbers of size charts. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is to}} establish a sizing system using artificial neural network. A nonlinear sizing system is created by self organizing method (SOM) and compared with Statistical method (SM). The result showed that the number of size chart and the aggregate loss of fit reduced by using self organizing method. This study suggests that by using of SOM, the cover factor and aggregate loss of fit is improved and the number of size chart is reduce, making sizing system more suitable for <b>clothing</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R

25|$|Hamilton's Coppley Apparel Group {{is doing}} {{something}} rare in the Canadian <b>clothing</b> <b>industry</b> - adding jobs. The company plans to expand its employment by almost 200 jobs - about 30 per cent - starting with 50 additional jobs this year in 2007. Coppley's growth burst will bring its workforce to about 750 people, {{the majority of them}} in Hamilton. The new jobs follow exploding sales growth as the company uses computer-aided custom tailoring of suits that give struggling retailers a much-needed cash-flow boost. Coppley, which has been a fixture in downtown Hamilton for more than 150 years, pioneered a method of using a computer, a grid and a digital camera to do the work of a master tailor, producing made-to-measure suits in as few as seven days - work that used to take six weeks.|$|E
25|$|The <b>clothing</b> <b>industry</b> in New York City was {{staffed by}} many {{immigrants}} from Eastern and Southern Europe. Historian Witold Kula {{found that many}} Jewish immigrants, and to a much lesser extent, Italians, were identified upon their arrival to the United States as having work background as tailors {{even if they did}} not. Kula identified several letters written by Jewish immigrants back to their families in Poland indicating that they were just learning the trade, when in fact, they had papers stating that it was their native profession. The new immigrants generally did not speak English nor did the immigration agents speak any Polish, Yiddish, or Italian. Kula suggests that the Immigration agents were influenced by the demands of the workforce and essentially staffed the industries based on their expectations of each ethnic group. By 1912, the needle trades were the largest employer of Polish Jews in the United States, and 85% of the needle trade employees were Eastern European Jews.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's Mill {{was one of}} {{the first}} of many {{factories}} constructed in Leeds from around 1790 when the most significant were woollen finishing and flax mills. Manufacturing diversified by 1914 to printing, engineering, chemicals and clothing manufacture. Decline in manufacturing during the 1930s was temporarily reversed by a switch to producing military uniforms and munitions during World War II. However, by the 1970s, the <b>clothing</b> <b>industry</b> was in irreversible decline, facing cheap foreign competition. The contemporary economy has been shaped by Leeds City Council's vision of building a '24-hour European city' and 'capital of the north'. The city has developed from the decay of the post-industrial era to become a telephone banking centre, connected to the electronic infrastructure of the modern global economy. There has been growth in the corporate and legal sectors, and increased local affluence has led to an expanding retail sector, including the luxury goods market. In a 2010 index of sustainable cities, Leeds placed 6th for the second year running.|$|E
