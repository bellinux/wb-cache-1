5000|$|A {{dedicated}} {{building for}} the School was planned for the Yeerongpilly site and its first stage - comprising part of the animal hospital and the northern wing of the main building - was completed in 1938. Facilities for anatomy were still required so the 1909 stable was altered for this purpose by infilling the door openings on the north with weatherboards and casement windows, lining interior walls with VJ pine boards, inserting a ceiling and covering the brick floor with a concrete slab. (It is not clear if all brick floors were simply covered or some removed. Some <b>channeled</b> <b>brick</b> flooring remains in the room on the south-eastern corner of the stable in 2011.) In [...] a skillion-roofed, weatherboard-clad annex was erected along the stable's eastern side.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMerchants find {{themselves}} in an increasingly complex environment. On one hand, this complexity is shaped by the establishment of new commerce <b>channels</b> (<b>brick</b> and mortar, online, social media, mobile) and store formats (pop-up shops, pick-up and drop-off points, and most importantly – mashups). On the other hand, their customers also demonstrate multi-optional behaviour and needs structure. The aim {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate how ethnographic approach supplemented by the analysis of large data sets can help improve operational ergonomics of diverse retail environments merchants operate in. To gain access to the richness of data, the researcher engages with merchants beyond a lab setting to actively observe and participate in what people do and how they organize their workspace. The researcher continuously visits merchants’ businesses and observes what they do: how do they sell and ship their products; interact with their customers; organize their workspace. Finally, the researcher employs the analysis of large data parallel to ethnographic research to supplement her qualitative research methods. All these techniques guide the way in which the researcher constructs proper multichannel platform for occupational ergonomics in virtual and physical retail spaces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, development and {{deployment of the}} British Energy Trace Analysis (BETA) condition monitoring system that performs automated analyses on reactor refueling data to help support the continued safe operation of Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGR) in the UK. The system performs automated analyses of {{a particular set of}} refueling data to detect the presence of damage in the graphite bricks, which compose the core. By detecting anomalous changes in the load of fuel during refueling, the system can identify likely cracks in the fuel <b>channel</b> <b>bricks.</b> Though the example presented here {{describes the}} development of a condition monitoring system for AGR stations, the methodology used to extract knowledge from condition monitoring analyses could potentially be adapted to other applications. Based on feedback from the plant operators, future versions of the software will include the storage of previous analyses and more advanced analyses in a centralized system that can be accessed remotely. Constructing a database of previous analyses will also allow the generation of envelopes of normal behavior, which will increase the ability of the system to detect anomalous behavior. Future work for the BETA system includes the application of data fusion techniques to combine the existing analyses with other reactor data sources to further enhance the ability of BETA to detect fuel channel distortions...|$|R
50|$|The Lincoln Typhoid {{outbreak}} of 1904/5, was caused mainly by surface water run-off into the River Witham from the Asylum Farm fields {{on the hill}} slope behind Bracebridge, where untreated effluent was run from the Asylum down a tunnel behind houses on Canwick Avenue into a <b>brick</b> <b>channel</b> {{at the top of}} the fields, which just overflowed to fertilise them by irrigation.|$|R
50|$|In 1909 {{a stable}} was erected {{to the north}} of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. The Department of Agriculture and Stock Annual Report for 1910 {{described}} the building:"The stable provide four stalls, a loose-box, and feed-room, with a room for harness, tools, etc., and another room for small animals, specially ventilated. The manger fittings are of iron, with water-pots and hay-racks combined. The floors of stalls are laid with a special <b>channelled</b> stable <b>brick,</b> and a tramway is laid the whole length of the building with an overhead traveller for removing the carcasses of dead animals."A similar building of 12 stalls, designated as cattle byres, was erected immediately to the north but it does not survive. The total cost of the complex to October 1909 was £5,000.|$|R
500|$|There {{have been}} several film and TV {{productions}} depicting life in Newark. Life of Crime, was originally produced in 1988 and {{was followed by a}} 1998 sequel. New Jersey Drive, a 1995 film about the city when it was considered the [...] "car theft capital of the world". Street Fight is an Academy Award-nominated documentary film which covered the 2002 mayoral election between incumbent Sharpe James and challenger Cory Booker. In 2009, the Sundance <b>Channel</b> aired <b>Brick</b> City, a five-part television documentary about Newark, focusing on the community's attempt to become a better and safer place to live, against a history of nearly a half century of violence, poverty and official corruption. The second season premiered January 30, 2011. Revolution '67 is an award-winning documentary which examines the causes and events of the 1967 Newark riots. The HBO television series The Sopranos filmed many of its scenes in Newark, and is partially based on the life of Newark mobster Richard Boiardo. The Once and Future Newark (2006) is documentary travelogue about places of cultural, social and historical significance by Rutgers History Professor Clement Price.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{retailers}} typically make {{a variety}} of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel and presentation. In the digital age, {{an increasing number of}} retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple <b>channels,</b> including both <b>bricks</b> and mortar and online retailing. Digital technologies are also changing the way that consumers pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1804, Farquhar succeeded Sir George Alexander William Leith, as Lieutenant-Governor of Penang. Almost {{immediately}} upon assuming his new role, Farquhar began submitting {{a great many}} schemes {{for the improvement of}} the island, to his East India Company superiors in Bengal, which some have said, were near-impossible. These included turning Pulau Jerejak into a dock for building and refitting ships, buying a great deal of timber from Siam for that purpose; and a highly involved, complex and detailed plan to supply George Town with water from the waterfall gardens using a long <b>brick</b> <b>channel,</b> employing a hundred convicts to cut the canal, construct the aqueduct, lay earthenware pipes through the streets and tin pipes to conduct water to houses.|$|R
50|$|The Roman Baths {{were built}} in about 75 BC. Later, {{during the reign of}} Lucius Verus (161-169 AD) they were rebuilt and the {{building}} clad with marble. Modest in size, they consisted of a pelastre, an open-air exercise area surrounded by an arcade of columns; a hall with cold baths; and two halls heated by a hypocaust, by which hot air was circulated under the rooms through <b>brick</b> <b>channels.</b> One was a hot air sweating room or laconicum, the other a caldarium, or hot bath, including a masonry bathing pool. On the south, next to the pelastre, was a large swimming pool. Water was fed into the pool through the mouth of a stone theatrical mask. The original is now in the nearby museum in St. Remy but a reproduction sits in its original position.|$|R
40|$|Ignalina NPP is {{the only}} nuclear power plant in Lithuania {{consisting}} of two units, commissioned in 1983 and 1987. Unit 1 of Ignalina NPP was shut down for decommissioning {{at the end of}} 2004 and Unit 2 is to be operated until the end of 2009. Both units are equipped with channel-type graphite-moderated boiling water reactors RBMK- 1500. The paper summarizing the results of deterministic and probabilistic analyses is developed within 1991 – 2007 by specialists from Lithuanian Energy Institute. The main operational safety aspects, including analyses performed according the Ignalina Safety Improvement Programs, development and installation of the Second Shutdown System and Guidelines on Severe Accidents Management are discussed. Also the phenomena related to the closure of the gap between fuel <b>channel</b> and graphite <b>bricks,</b> multiple fuel <b>channel</b> tube rupture, and containment issues as well as implication of the external events to the Ignalina NPP safety are discussed separately...|$|R
50|$|The {{properties}} {{face the}} Hudson River and are visible {{across the river}} from Interstate-787 on Albany’s west bank. Located in what was originally settled as Bath, then later Bath-on-Hudson (incorporated into the City of Rensselaer in 1903), the property is situated at the riverfront southern boundary of Beverwyck, William Paterson van Rensselaer's estate situated facing the river on the ridge northeast of the Bath ferry landing. The house features an operating water-collection system for the many mineral springs that percolate in the area that was originally used for indoor plumbing; this system includes brick and cast-iron cisterns, <b>channels</b> with <b>brick</b> walls and ash-plank linings and an outflow now connected to the city storm-sewer system channeling the constant flow of 52 F water. In February 2013, a City contractor installing new sewer lines south on Forbes Avenue discovered a substantial underground water spring flow mid-street, between # 5 and 7 Forbes Avenue. After excavating 18 ft deep, a dewatering system of crushed stone and perforated drainage pipes was installed between Tracy and Central Avenues to divert this flow south to the city storm sewer system. This diversion—thought to be from an underground diagonal streamflow across the hillside between Forbes and Broadway—relieved virtually ALL groundwater inflow in all basements along Forbes Avenue, including drying up completely the springs and drainage system in the cellar of this subject structure. Years later, the cellar remains dry for probably the first time in 175 years.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} improve the gravity {{discharge}} {{of water from the}} district, the sluice into the River Nene at Peters Point was rebuilt in 1937. Its width was reduced slightly to , but the cill was lowered to [...] below Ordnance Datum. In order to cope with the silty sub-soil in which the foundations had to be built, well point dewatering equipment was used {{for the first time in}} England. This consists of inserting small tubes into the ground and pumping them with a high-efficiency vacuum pump to lower the ground water levels, creating a dry and stable working environment. The need to grow more food during the Second World War led to large areas of low-lying grassland being ploughed up for crops, and this required improved drainage. The Main Drain Improvement Scheme was drawn up in 1942, and widening and deeping of the Main Drain and other channels was carried out. Ten new bridges were required, to accommodate the wider <b>channels,</b> and old <b>brick</b> structures were demolished and replaced by open span bridges. Feeder drains were improved, and the area served by the drainage board increased to [...]|$|R
50|$|After {{the outer}} steel mantle has been cleaned, {{it is again}} lowered over the outer bell model. The mantle and the outer bell mould are then lowered over the inner mould and the outer and inner {{sections}} are clamped together, leaving a space between them. The clamped mould is supported, by being buried in a casting pit which bears the weight of metal and allows even cooling. Ingots of either ready-made bronze or its component metals are melted in a melting furnace and heated until liquid at a temperature of approximately 1100 C. The liquid metal is then skimmed to remove impurities {{before the start of}} the casting process. When everything is ready, the molten bronze is transferred to the moulds using either ladles or a system of <b>brick</b> <b>channels</b> specially constructed in the casting pit, through which the hot metal can then flow from the melting furnace into the space between the two moulds. Holes in the top of the mantle ensure that gases are able to escape. If gas remained in the metal, the bell would be porous and susceptible to cracking. Porousness can also develop if the mould is damp, is not at the proper temperature, or if the metal, when poured, is not hot enough. The bell is allowed to cool for several days. Large bells can take over a week to cool completely. Small bells, those under 500 lb, can be removed from the moulding pit the following day.|$|R
40|$|Information {{technology}} (IT) {{has become}} an integral part of the success and globalisation of business over the last two decades. It is hard to imagine how the efficiencies expected in today’s fast paced business world could possibly be achieved without the advancements in IT. The most significant of these advancements is arguably the advent of the Internet which has empowered businesses of all sizes by giving them the means to promote their products and services at a relatively low cost in markets that would previously have been inaccessible. The aim of this study was to assess whether e-commerce represents an alternative <b>channel</b> for a <b>brick</b> and mortar company wishing to follow a market penetration strategy. The study was based around a company, Canoa Eastern Cape, which trades in the office automation industry in the Eastern and Southern Cape of South Africa. The study investigated the history of Canoa Eastern Cape, focusing predominantly on the growth strategies followed by the business in the past. With a view to the future, growth strategies which could potentially be followed by Canoa Eastern Cape were also investigated. The result of these investigations was a recommendation that Canoa Eastern Cape should follow a market penetration strategy, which will see the business marketing its existing products within its current market by making use of a new distribution channel, more specifically e-commerce. In order to assess the suitability of e-commerce as a tool within a market penetration strategy a literature study was conducted to get a better understanding of ecommerce and its viability as business tool. The literature study focused on eight core concepts felt to be critical in the evaluation of e-commerce, namely: • the development of e-commerce over the past years; • the future of e-commerce; • whether e-commerce is a financial success or not; • requirements for e-commerce to be successful; iv • products that customers are prepared to buy online; • industries most affected by e-commerce; and • demographics of e-commerce users; and • e-commerce in the office automation industry. Using the information gained in the literature study as a basis from which to start, an empirical study was conducted. The objective of the empirical study was to obtain data which would be used to assess the level to which e-commerce has been adopted by consumers in the specific geographic area and whether these consumers are willing and able to make use of e-commerce as an alternative to conventional purchasing for the procurement of office automation consumables and office automation equipment. A quantitative research paradigm was adopted, making use of a structured questionnaire to gather information from the sample of Canoa Eastern Cape’s customers. The data collected from the empirical study were analysed using univariate and bivariate analysis. The findings of the empirical study suggested that: • demographics are a poor indicator of adoption of e-commerce; • there is a significant adoption rate within the sample: o 79. 85 percent of the respondents reported to have used e-commerce before for personal use; and o 59. 13 percentreported to have used e-commerce before for business use; • there is a high rate of willingness to use e-commerce again: o 91. 09 percent of the respondents indicating that they would use e-commerce again for personal use; and o 80. 18 percent indicating that they would use e-commerce again for business use; • there is a high likelihood that consumers will buy office automation consumables through an e-commerce channel, with 65. 82 percentof the respondents indicating that they would be likely or very likely to buy consumables through an e-commerce channel; • there is no significant difference in the adoption rates between the three main areas within the targeted sample, that is, East London, Port Elizabeth and George and Knysna. Given the findings of the empirical study it is felt that an e-commerce solution does present a viable alternative <b>channel</b> for a <b>brick</b> and mortar company trading in the Office Automation Industry in the Eastern and Southern Cape wishing to follow a market penetration strateg...|$|R
