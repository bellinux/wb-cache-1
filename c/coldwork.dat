50|$|The {{shockwave}} generated <b>coldwork</b> (plastic strain) in {{the workpiece}} material creates compressive and tensile residual stresses {{to maintain an}} equilibrium state of the material. These residual stresses are compressive at the workpiece surface and gradually fade into low tensile stresses below and surrounding the laser peened area. The cold work also work hardens the surface layer. The compressive residual stresses, {{and to a lesser}} extent, the cold work, from laser peening have been shown to prevent and mitigate high cycle fatigue (HCF), low cycle fatigue (LCF), stress corrosion cracking, fretting fatigue and to some degree, wear and corrosion pitting. It is outstanding at mitigating foreign object damage in turbine blades.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fractures of {{mechanical}} components and structures are often produced by initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks. Especially, {{in the case}} of aircrafts, since fatigue failure generally was caused by an invisible small crack, it is necessary to detect an initial crack during in-service inspection. The purpose of this research is to identify and recommend methods of inspection that would provide timely detection of fatigue failures. In this paper, acoustic emission (AE) technique has been used to detect fatigue crack. Acoustic emission technique is very useful to prevent catastrophic failure of large scale structures with unknown discontinuities such as fatigue crack. This research is focused on the capability of AE technique to provide diagnostic information to detect fatigue crack growth and initiation under cyclic loading. The <b>coldworked</b> 2024 -T 351 and 7050 -T 7451 aluminum alloys are used for this study and these alloys usually applied in aircraft primary members...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 113 - 116) Current {{emphasis on}} long life structures has influenced {{the manner in}} which high strength fasteners are utilized in reducing stress concentrations surrounding fastener holes in mechanically fastened joints. This has resulted in interference fit fasteners, <b>coldworked</b> fastener holes, and other methods to introduce beneficial stresses into the installed fastener system. Not much work has been done on the analytical aspects of how these advanced fastener systems work or in the formulation of a representative math model defining these beneficial stresses. This thesis addresses itself to the task of formulating the analysis necessary for the definition of these beneficial stresses utilizing theory from advanced mechanics of materials. A series of fatigue test of metallic joints were conducted to substantiate the theory. Joint fatigue specimens were examined using x-ray diffraction and laser illumination equipment in order to quantify residual stress gradients existing around the fastener holes after the application of a single cycle of high intensity pre-stress. The Stress Severity Factor (SSF), which is an equivalent stress concentration factor for bolted joints, is defined and utilized in conjunction with a structural analysis computer program to define the SSF occurring at each fastener location in the fatigue test specimen. The specimens tested always failed at locations of the highest SSF. To substantiate the SSF calculations, a unique two dimensional photoelastic model of the fatigue test joint specimen was designed and fabricated. Using reflective polariscope techniques, the apparent stress concentration factor at each fastener hole location was determined. The photoelastic data taken was in good agreement to the Stress Severity Factor values calculated using the Jarfall SSF Equation...|$|R

40|$|In a {{comparison}} of Ni and stainless steel subsize tensile specimens, {{it was found that}} property changes induced by irradiation to an estimated fast flux of 4 x 10 /sup 20 / nvt were qualitatively similar to those produced by cold working. No basis for direct correlation was found. Tensile properties, elongation, hardness, density, electrical resistivity, corrosion, and annealing results are presented. It was determined that irradiation left the nickel and stainless steel specimens more ductile than did cold working to a comparable ultimate strength.

A synergistic approach to performance enhancement. of aluminium alloys has been investigated through combined cold-work and hard coating thereby affording increased performance in teIflls of both fatigue and surface hardness. With an' emphasis on <b>coldwork</b> processing, two different methods of introducing surface compressive residual stresses in this manner have been used. This leads to an interest in the influence of residual stress in the hard coated aluminium on its behaviour.

40|$|The {{hardening}} behaviour of three cold-worked platinum alloys, Pt 5 at% Mo, Pt 5 wt% Ru and Pt 5 wt% Cu, {{has been investigated}} through a systematic series of heat treatments. All three of the experimental alloys showed a hardness increase during annealing within a specific temperature range. The hardness of the Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru alloys was found to increase rapidly at annealing temperatures above the recrystallisation temperature, with the final hardness similar to the original <b>coldworked</b> hardness. The hardness of Pt-Cu showed an increase of up to 30 % at low annealing temperatures of between 200 °C and 500 °C. In addition, the Pt-Cu alloy also showed the increased hardness found in Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru at high annealing temperatures, but the hardness increase was not to the same extent. Specimens subjected to the annealing treatments were studied by means of optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, {{in order to determine}} the effect of annealing on microstructure and structural order. Resistivity, XRD and OTA techniques were employed in order to study the mechanisms of ordering with temperature, but these techniques did not produce any significant results. It was concluded that the most likely cause for the hardness increase observed in all three experimental alloys was due to a change in structural order upon annealing. The Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru alloys hardened through an increase in short-range order at annealing temperatures above the recrystallisation temperature. The Pt-Cu alloy hardened through the development of long-range order on annealing between 200 °C and 500 °C. This increase in hardness was in· addition to the high dislocation density in the alloy specimen due to prior cold-work...|$|R

40|$|Slat-band {{chains are}} used as {{conveyors}} by the food industry, breweries and bottling plants. The operating conditions require abrasion resistance and strength which are at the limit of {{the capabilities of the}} current material of choice, cold worked type 430. In an unconventional way of strengthening this material, Mintek developed a process in which the cold worked material is aged between 450 °C and 500 °C. The present work aims to elucidate the strengthening mechanism, using type 430 stainless steel containing 16. 42 % Cr and 0. 036 % C, in the cold-rolled condition (38 % reduction in area), with and without prior solution heat treatment. The Cr-rich precipitate α" may form in the 450 °C to 500 °C range (due to the miscibility gap in the Fe-Cr system), resulting in the increased hardness and lowered ductility. Mossbauer studies confirmed that the α", at this composition and temperature, forms through the process of nucleation and growth. Hardening due to α" precipitation was only observed after aging for 64 hours or more, however. After increasing the dissolved interstitial content by solution heat treatments (in the vicinity of 900 °C), increases in Vickers hardness of 30 - 50 kg/mm 2 could be obtained after only 8 minutes at 475 °C. This hardness increase corresponds to an increase in tensile strength of more than 100 MPa. The increased hardness {{does not appear to be}} caused by strain aging, and presumably results from fine carbide or nitride precipitation. Solution treatment at 930 °C also introduced some martensite (α') into the microstructure, which raised the hardness of the unaged cold worked material. Overaging of the carbide and nitride precipitates was observed at 475 °C, but not at 450 °C, probably due to the lower diffusion rates at the lower temperature. No averaging of the α" precipitates occurred, for aging times up to 2072 hours. Samples aged for selected periods of time at 475 °C had low impact strengths - even well before the formation of α" - and revealed predominantly cleavage fracture with some ductile fracture areas, mostly at grain boundaries. Both impact strength and lateral expansion indicated that embrittlement accompanies the increased hardness obtained by aging. Calculation of critical crack lengths from the impact data, however, revealed that a maximum flaw length of 0. 8 mm, for specimens solution treated at 880 °C, could be tolerated before catastrophic failure. Since it is not expected that flaws of that size would exist in the as manufactured links, fatigue will probably determine the lifetime of the chains, although the lower K 1 c values indicate that less crack propagation will be tolerated before brittle fracture. During the aging treatment, the strength may be lowered by recrystallisation of the <b>coldworked</b> material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the start of recovery, but no recrystallisation. Some large precipitates (around lμm in diameter) were present. These were identified, through their diffraction patterns, as M 23 C 6; these carbides were present in both aged and unaged material and hence represent precipitates which had not dissolved during the initial solution treatments. The α" precipitates- and the presumed newly formed nitride and carbide precipitates - were too fine for detection by TEM. Potentiodynamic testing of the treated material in a 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution indicated that, although the probable hardening mechanisms imply localised Cr depletion of the matrix, the general corrosion resistance and passivation behaviour were not affected. It is concluded that the strength of the chain may be increased markedly by short-term heat treatments at 475 °C, with lowered toughness, but with no decrease in corrosion resistance. Martensite, work hardening, and precipitation of carbides and nitrides all contribute to the final strength, with α" formation only becoming significant after longer aging times.
