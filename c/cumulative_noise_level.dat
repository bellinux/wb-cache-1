Exposure to {{excessive}} noise has the ability to cause both physiological and psychological effects in humans. A systematic noise survey was conducted at different locations within Oil Mill Market and Eleme Junction in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. Modelling of noise levels within the market area is presented. A <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of 108. 6 dB (A) was obtained along East-West Road between Oil mill market and Eleme junction; Eleme junction showed <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of 105. 4 dB (A); also, Elelenwo by Oil-Mill market showed noise level of 103. 8 dB (A); while, Oil-Mill Market showed <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of 108. 2 dB (A). Computed mean noise value is 109 ± 3 dB (A), computed Leq index is 123. 6 ± 2. 3 dB (A), while computed noise pollution level is 117. 1 dB (A). Findings showed that use of grinding machines and generators within the market accounted for 27 % of noise within the market; mobile sellers contributed 26 %; while vehicular movement along the East-West highway and Eleme junction constituted 19 % of the noise produced in the area. High noise pollution prevails within the market environment withpotentialhealth effects on traders and the public. State and/or Local Governments should carry out awareness campaigns among traders on the effects of noise on their health. Noise control by-laws or regulations should be enforced so as to regulate the activities of mobile advertisers or sellers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Increased {{noise level}} with the {{technological}} advancement becomes a serious problem in the textile industry {{and it has become}} a crucial occupational hazard to its workers. Maximum noise level of some textile machines is as high as 95 dB and locating many machines inside a single room causes to increase the <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> by at least 5 dB beyond maximum noise level of a machine. So the noise level inside a textile factory is well above the limits specified by NIOSH and it amounts to be hazardous. This article analyzes the quality of noise and its distribution inside the factory. A mathematical model is developed to predict the noise distribution pattern and the model is validated with the noise data gathered following the standard methods. Economically viable noise control panels are designed and carry out a pilot implementation in order to prove the effectiveness of the noise control method experimentally. Further, authors present the potential applications of the proposed design and evaluate its usefulness. Index Terms- Noise analysis, noise control, noise pattern model...|$|E
40|$|Very high {{air traffic}} density {{in the largest}} {{airports}} and in their vicinity involves that the air traffic in the largest airports and their areas of operations approaches the capacity limits. Such high density of the air traffic adversely influences the natural environment {{in the vicinity of}} the airports due to the increasing <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and the concentration of environmentally hazardous substances. One of the possibilities to improve the situation is to work out innovative solutions aimed at decreasing the aircraft pollution and improving the transport effectiveness. One of the major concepts is using magnetic levitation (MAGLEV) technology to support aircraft take-off and landing. If the aircraft could take-off and start the initial climb phase with the ground power, the installed power may be reduced, resulting in less weight, less drag and less overall fuel consumption which leads to emission reduction. These advantages, the lower fuel consumption and emissions, increase sustainability of the transportation system. Different conditions of the take-off give possibilities to shape the trajectory after the take-off in order to decrease the negative influence on the environment. The aim of the present work was to determine the optimal conditions of the take-off and the optimal climb trajectory of the aircraft aided in the ground phase of the take-off by the system using the MAGLEV technology, minimizing the fuel consumption. The simplified algorithm of optimization of the flight trajectory was used in this work; it uses the method of approximation of the flight path by the third degree polynomial...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the drugs}} used for {{chemotherapy}} treatments {{are known to be}} ototoxic, and can result in permanent hearing threshold shifts. The degree of ototoxic damage can be influenced by many factors including dosage, duration of exposure, genetics, and coadministration with other ototoxic agents. Cisplatin is known for its ototoxic effects on hearing thresholds, particularly in the high frequencies. Recent studies have indicated a synergistic relationship between Cisplatin administration and moderate to high <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> exposure starting between 70 - 85 dB SPL. This study measured the <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the Portland Veteran′s Affairs Medical Center′s outpatient chemotherapy clinic.

40|$|Background Occupational noise might {{increase}} the risk of workplace injury through a variety of mechanisms, including interference with communication and increased stress. Objectives The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effect of chronic noise exposure on serious workplace injury, and how the timing of exposure influenced risk. Methods The authors examined a cohort of 26 000 workers, who worked between 1950 and 1989. Cases were those hospitalised for a work-related injury (ICD- 9 codes 800 e 999, and E codes E 800 eE 999), from April 1989 to December 1998. Cumulative exposure levels were estimated for subjects based on a quantitative retrospective exposure assessment. An internal comparison of <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> exposure and subchronic durations of noise exposure and injury was conducted using Poisson regression. There were 163 cases for the cumulative and 161 cases for the subchronic analysis. Results <b>Cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> exposure were associated with a decreased risk for injuries, with the risk generally decreasing as <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> increased, while most durations of subchronic exposure were associated with an increased risk for injury. An inverse U-shaped trend was observed with the time period of 90 days to 1 year demonstrating the most elevated RR compared with 0 e 1 days of exposure. Conclusions Workers highly exposed to noise, or exposed for long periods of time, might develop effective methods of communicating the risk and preventing injuries when exposed to noise...|$|R

One of the immediate impacts of civil aviation on the environment is noise pollution.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} for {{the noise and}} fuel burn reduction potential of an innovative double deck concept aircraft with two three-shaft direct-drive turbofan engines. The engines are mounted from the fuselage so that the engine inlet is over the main wing. It is shown that such an aircraft can achieve a cumulative Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) about 28 dB below the current aircraft noise regulations of Stage 4. The combination of high bypass ratio engines and advanced wing design with laminar flow control technologies provide fuel burn reduction and low noise levels simultaneously. For example, the fuselage mounted engine position provides more than 4 EPNLdB of noise reduction by shielding the inlet radiated noise. To identify the potential effect of noise reduction technologies on this concept, parametric studies are presented to reveal the system level benefits of various emerging noise reduction concepts, for both engine and airframe noise reduction. These concepts are discussed both individually to show their respective incremental noise reduction potential and collectively to assess their aggregate effects on the total noise. Through these concepts approximately about 8 dB of additional noise reduction is possible, bringing the <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of this aircraft to 36 EPNLdB below Stage 4, if the entire suite of noise reduction technologies would mature to practical application. In a final step, an estimate is made for this same aircraft concept but with higher bypass ratio, geared, turbofan engines. With this geared turbofan propulsion system, the noise is estimated to reach as low as 40 - 42 dB below Stage 4 with a fuel burn reduction of 43 - 47 % below the 2005 best-in-class aircraft baseline. While {{just short of the}} NASA N+ 2 goals of 42 dB and 50 % fuel burn reduction, for a 2025 in service timeframe, this assessment shows that this innovative concept warrants refined study. Furthermore, this design appears to be a viable potential future passenger aircraft, not only in meeting the regulatory requirements, but also in competing with aircraft of different advanced designs within this N+ 2 timeframe and goal framework...|$|E
40|$|A system noise {{study is}} {{presented}} for the blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft configured with advanced {{technologies that are}} projected to {{be available in the}} 2025 timeframe of the NASA N+ 2 definition. This system noise assessment shows that the <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> of the baseline configuration, measured by the <b>cumulative</b> Effective Perceived <b>Noise</b> <b>Level</b> (EPNL), have a large margin of 34 dB to the aircraft noise regulation of Stage 4. This confirms the acoustic benefits of the BWB shielding of engine noise, as well as other projected noise reduction technologies, but the noise margins are less than previously published assessments and are short of meeting the NASA N+ 2 noise goal. In establishing the relevance of the acoustic assessment framework, the design of the BWB configuration, the technical approach of the noise analysis, the databases and prediction tools used in the assessment are first described and discussed. The predicted <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> and the component decomposition are then analyzed to identify the ranking order of importance of various noise components, revealing the prominence of airframe noise, which holds up the levels at all three noise certification locations and renders engine noise reduction technologies less effective. When projected airframe component noise reduction is added to the HWB configuration, it is shown that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> margin to Stage 4 can reach 41. 6 dB, nearly at the NASA goal. These results are compared with a previous NASA assessment with a different study framework. The approaches that yield projections of such low <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> are discussed including aggressive assumptions on future technologies, assumptions on flight profile management, engine installation, and component noise reduction technologies. It is shown that reliable predictions of component noise also {{play an important role in}} the system noise assessment. The comparisons and discussions illustrate the importance of practical feasibilities and constraints in aircraft system noise studies, which include aerodynamic performance, propulsion efficiency, flight profile limitation and many other factors. For a future aircraft concept to achieve the NASA N+ 2 noise goal it will require a range of fully successful noise reduction technology developments...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To survey current, Danish {{industrial}} <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> {{and the use}} {{of hearing}} protection devices (HPD) over a 10 -year period and to characterise the association between occupational noise and hearing threshold shift in the same period. Furthermore, the risk of hearing loss among the baseline and the follow-up populations according to first year of occupational noise exposure is evaluated. Materials and Methods: In 2001 – 2003, we conducted a baseline survey of noise- and hearing-related disorders in 11 industries with suspected high <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> In 2009 – 2010, we were able to follow up on 271 out of the 554 baseline workers (49 %). Mean <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> per industry and self-reported HPD use are described at baseline and follow-up. The association between <b>cumulative</b> occupational <b>noise</b> exposure and hearing threshold shift over the 10 -year period was assessed using linear regression, and the risk of hearing loss according to year of first occupational noise exposure was evaluated with logistic regression. Results: Over the 10 -year period, mean <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> declined from 83. 9 dB(A) to 82. 8 dB(A), and for workers exposed > 85 dB(A), the use of HPD increased from 70. 1 to 76. 1 %. We found a weak, statistically insignificant, inverse association between higher ambient <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> exposure and poorer hearing (− 0. 10 [*]dB hearing threshold shift per dB-year (95 % confidence interval (CI) : − 0. 36; 0. 16)). The risk of hearing loss seemed to increase with earlier first year of noise exposure, but odds ratios were only statistically significant among baseline participants with first exposure before the 1980 s (odds ratio: 1. 90, 95 % CI: 1. 11; 3. 22). Conclusions: We observed declining industrial <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> increased use of HPD and no significant impact on hearing thresholds from current ambient industrial <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> which indicated a successful implementation of Danish hearing conservation programs...|$|R
40|$|An {{aircraft}} system noise study is presented for the Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) aircraft concept with three open rotor engines {{mounted on the}} upper surface of the airframe. It is shown that for such an aircraft, the <b>cumulative</b> Effective Perceived <b>Noise</b> <b>Level</b> (EPNL) is about 24 dB below the current aircraft noise regulations of Stage 4. While this makes the design acoustically viable in meeting the regulatory requirements, even with the consideration of more stringent noise regulations of a possible Stage 5 {{in the next decade}} or so, the design will likely meet stiff competitions from aircraft with turbofan engines. It is shown that the <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> of the BWB design are held up by the inherently high <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> of the open rotor engines and the limitation on the shielding benefit due to the practical design constraint on the engine location. Furthermore, it is shown that the BWB design has high <b>levels</b> of <b>noise</b> from the main landing gear, due to their exposure to high speed flow at the junction between the center body and outer wing. These are also the reasons why this baseline BWB design does not meet the NASA N+ 2 noise goal of 42 dB below Stage 4. To identify approaches that may further reduce noise, parametric studies are also presented, including variations in engine location, vertical tail and elevon variations, and airframe surface acoustic liner treatment effect. These have the potential to further reduce noise but they are only at the conceptual stage...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of unexpected aircraft noise events will frequently evoke intense complaints about annoyance over such events. It is {{recognized that the}} relationship between the volume of complaints and the corresponding maximum <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> does in fact depend on the circumstances of the complainants and the time of year. The frequency of {{occurrence of}} the respective noise events is also a factor. The possible practical value of the addition of the maximal <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> to the well-known <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> descriptors L(sub eq), L(sub dn), etc. may be considered. One might start by considering the difference between the L(sub eq) and the average maximal <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of the twenty loudest single noise events on an average day. A somewhat less sharply focused consideration of the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> was adopted. In that standard the scope of noise-mitigation measures is defined generally with reference to L(sub eq). If the average maximal <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> L(sub max) of the entire aircraft fleet mix exceeds the L(sub eq) by more than 20 dB(A) and if more than 20 daily aircraft noise events exceed the L(sub eq) than the difference L(sub max) - 20 becomes the key criterion for noise-mitigation measures. A statistical correlation {{of a large number of}} data from aircraft-noise-monitoring sensors located both directly underneath and laterally disposed to an aircraft flight-path has supplied a basis for the determination of the distribution of the maximal <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> about the average value, L(sub max), of each type of aircraft.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a runway allocation planning tool that seeks to maximize the permissible number of flight operations into and out of an airport within a given annual noise budget. Although the model that underlies the planning tool is generic in nature, the tool has been customized for application to a specific airport, viz. Amsterdam airport Schiphol in the Netherlands. The noise budget regulations applicable at Schiphol stipulate limits on the annual <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> loads at a large number of enforcement points arranged around the airport. To ensure an equitable distribution of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> load at the enforcement points, an efficient allocation and distribution of the annual flight movements over available runways and routes is required that takes weather induced restrictions into account. To this end, a Linear Programming (LP) optimization formulation has been developed that implements a minimax performance criterion that aims to minimize the maximum <b>cumulative</b> <b>noise</b> load value occurring at any of the enforcement points. The numerical results obtained for the operational year 2005 clearly demonstrate the potential of the tool to maximize the yearly number of flight movements within the assigned noise budget.

In this study, we incorporate the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the hedonic model letting the property price depend on both the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Hedonic models for both rail and road noise are estimated. Data consists of characteristics of sold properties, property-specific noise calculation, and geographical variables. We use the hedonic approach to estimate the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for maximum noise abatement where we model the effect as the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> subtracted with the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Furthermore, we control for the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the estimations.

The experimentation commenced with flow linearization process and {{this was followed by}} a design/build/test laboratory procedure to ascertain the minimum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> achievable by varying the inlet pipe size, resonating chamber length and the orifice size of the geometric build up of the silencers. Results from experimentation shows a reduction in <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> to the tune of 13. 2 dB (A) when comparison is made with the initial <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of silencer used as the baseline level at 76. 9 dB (A). The results was incorporated to generate an optimum model for the IC-engine (Volkswagen Passat Model) of 1921 cm 3 engine capacity used as the test engine during the experimentation. <b>Noise</b> <b>level</b> in dB (A) were depicted on noise level-time graph...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effect of}} visual feedback on classroom <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> using a SoundEar II device that monitors <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in real time with feedback on intensity levels using a lighting system. During phase one, <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> from three classrooms in the same school were measured over 36 h of classroom activities. For phase two, six teachers from two schools completed a questionnaire describing their experiences using the device. Visual feedback resulted in a 1. 4 -dBA reduction in the average <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> Classroom <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> were above 70 dBA for 33 % {{of the time in}} the baseline period compared to 24 % in the intervention period with visual feedback provided on <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> Teacher perceptions indicated that visual feedback was beneficial to classroom <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> and positively influenced the behaviour of learners. Visual feedback reduced overall classroom noise and can provide a cost-effective, noninvasive tool to create a more enabling classroom environment. [URL] Pathology and Audiolog...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} work well, many {{computer}} vision algorithms require that their parameters be adjusted {{according to the}} image <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> making it an important quantity to estimate. We show how to estimate an upper bound on the <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> from a single image based on a piecewise smooth image prior model and measured CCD camera response functions. We also learn the space of <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> functions– how <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> changes with respect to brightness–and use Bayesian MAP inference to infer the <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> function from a single image. We illustrate the utility of this noise estimation for two algorithms: edge detection and featurepreserving smoothing through bilateral filtering. For {{a variety of different}} <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> we obtain good results for both these algorithms with no user-specified inputs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{agricultural}} tractor {{is one of}} the most commonly used vehicles on farms and one of the most prominent sources of noise. This article presents an exemplary assessment of the audible and infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the cabins of selected modern wheeled {{agricultural tractor}}s. Materials and Methods: Operator-perceived audible and infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the cabins were examined for 20 types of modern tractors during typical conditions of work. The tractors had been in use for no longer than 3 years, with rated power between 96 kW and 227 kW, designed and produced by world-renowned companies. <b>Noise</b> <b>level</b> measurements were performed in accordance with PN-EN ISO 9612 : 2011 (ISO 9612 : 2009). Results: Audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> (A-weighted) ranged from 62. 1 to 87. 4 dB-A (average: 68. 2 to 83. 8 dB-A) for different work tasks. The factors influencing <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> include performed tasks, soil, weather conditions and the skills of individual drivers. In spectrum analysis, the highest <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> occurred at frequencies 250 Hz, 1 and 2 kHz. Infrasound <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> (G-weighted) ranged from 87. 3 to 111. 3 dB-G. The driver-experienced exposure to infrasound was found to increase significantly when the vehicle was in motion. Conclusions: Average audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> have no potential to adversely affect the hearing organ during tasks performed inside the closed cabins of the analysed modern agricultural tractors. Due to the relatively low audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> inside the cabins of modern agricultural tractors, non-auditory effects are the only adverse symptoms that can develop. Modern agricultural tractors emit considerable infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> All tractors introduced into the market should be subjected to tests with regard to infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Governments {{all over}} the world have enacted {{environmental}} noise directives and noise control ordinances/acts to protect tranquility in residential areas. However, {{there is a lack of}} literature on the evaluation of whether the Acceptable <b>Noise</b> <b>Levels</b> (ANLs) stipulated in the directive/ordinance/act are actually achievable. The study aimed at measuring outdoor environmental <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in Hong Kong and identifying whether the measured <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> are lower than the stipulated ANLs at 20 categories of residential areas. Data were gathered from a territory-wide noise survey. Outdoor noise measurements were conducted at 203 residential premises in urban areas, low-density residential areas, rural areas, and other areas. In total, 366 daytime hourly Leq outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> 362 nighttime hourly Leq outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> and 20 sets of daily, that is, 24 Leq, 1 -h outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> were recorded. The mean daytime Leq, 1 -h values ranged 54. 4 - 70. 8 dBA, while the mean nighttime Leq, 1 -h values ranged 52. 6 - 67. 9 dBA. When the measured <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> were compared with the stipulated ANLs, only three out of the 20 categories of areas had outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> below ANLs during daytime. All other areas (and all areas during nighttime) were found to have outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> at or above ANLs. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focus on}} noise {{evaluation}} done at LRT Kelana Jaya Line during train operation. The {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> during train operation and evaluate the actual <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> measurement at selected LRT stations. After that, a concept to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> during train operation was proposed. In addition, the actual <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> measurement was compared with the theoretical permissible noise based on existing predetermined guidelines and standards. For train interior <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> sound level meter was installed at front end and gangway by following noise measurement procedure provided by standards and guidelines. For noise at train stations, <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> recorded at different distance from trackside which is 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 meters. The results show that for train interior <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> most of the time of train operation was exceeded the limitation provided by Prasarana based on standard ISO 3381, 75 dB. The <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> also exceeded <b>noise</b> limit in tunnel which is 80 dB during train operation. For station <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> data, only at distance 2 meter and 4 meter from track can achieve <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> more than 5 dB than limits provided by DOE, about 80 dB. In conclusion, interior train <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> may need to be decrease and at Setiawangsa station has the highest <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> than other stations...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> at high-traffic intersections of Gusau town is {{reported in this}} work. Five high-traffic locations tagged LOC-A, LOC-B, LOC-C, LOC-D and LOC-E were selected and evaluated at different periods of the day using an MS 6700 IEC 651, ANSI. Si. 4 Type- 2 Sound Level meter. Result analyses indicates that LOC-C has the highest <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> with LNP = 95 and TNI = 94, while LOC-B has the lowest <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> with LNP = 82 and TNI = 67. These <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> imply that Gusau metropolis has an unacceptable <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> well above the globally recommended levels of 60 - 65 dB(A) and the national recommended level of 82 dB(A). The paper therefore makes recommendations on minimizing these intolerable <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> with consequences for environmental and human health in the study location...|$|R
