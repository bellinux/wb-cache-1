5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E
5|$|Central America gained its {{independence}} along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence {{was signed in}} Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E

50|$|A space {{elevator}} cable {{rotates along}} with {{the rotation of the}} Earth. Therefore, objects attached to the cable would experience upward <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> in the direction opposing the downward gravitational force. The higher up the cable the object is located, the less the gravitational pull of the Earth, and the stronger the upward <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> due to the rotation, so that more <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> opposes less gravity. The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> and the gravity are balanced at geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO). Above GEO, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is stronger than gravity, causing objects attached to the cable there to pull upward on it.|$|R
5|$|The {{circulation}} in Venus's troposphere follows the so-called cyclostrophic approximation. Its windspeeds are roughly {{determined by the}} balance of the pressure gradient and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> in almost purely zonal flow. In contrast, the {{circulation in}} the Earth's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance. Venus's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the upper troposphere (tropopause), between 60–70km, altitude, which corresponds to the upper cloud deck. The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, where the contrast between clouds is the highest. The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100±10m/s at lower than 50° latitude. They are retrograde {{in the sense that they}} blow in the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet. The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes, eventually reaching zero at the poles. Such strong cloud-top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super-rotation of the atmosphere. In other words, these high-speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates. The super-rotation on Venus is differential, which means that the equatorial troposphere super-rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the midlatitudes. The winds also have a strong vertical gradient. They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3m/sperkm. The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth. They actually move at only a few kilometres per hour (generally less than 2m/s and with an average of 0.3 to 1.0m/s), but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, this is still enough to transport dust and small stones across the surface, much like a slow-moving current of water.|$|E

50|$|Within {{this view}} of physics, any other {{phenomenon}} that is usually attributed to <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> {{can be used to}} identify absolute rotation. For example, the oblateness of a sphere of freely flowing material is often explained in terms of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force.</b> The oblate spheroid shape reflects, following Clairaut's theorem, the balance between containment by gravitational attraction and dispersal by <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force.</b> That the Earth is itself an oblate spheroid, bulging at the equator where the radial distance and hence the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is larger, is taken as one of the evidences for its absolute rotation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{nowadays}} {{taught that}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is a fictitious force {{that can only}} be observed from a rotating frame of reference. This teaching is based on the argument that when no inward centripetal force is acting, a particle will proceed in its straight line inertial path. In situations where the physical effects of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> are detected, this is dismissed as being merely the effects of inertia. Polar coordinates relative to a point origin expose a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> acting on a particle that is moving in a straight line, but this <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> tends to be masked from view by virtue {{of the fact that the}} radial position vector is rotating. This article will examine ways to expose the physical reality of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R
25|$|A related {{problem is}} that of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> for the Earth-Moon-Sun system, where three {{rotations}} appear: the daily rotation of the Earth about its axis, the lunar-month rotation of the Earth-Moon system about their center of mass, and the annual revolution of the Earth-Moon system about the Sun. These three motions influence the tides.|$|E
25|$|While the monist {{forces have}} led to a fusion between some of the goddesses (108 names are common for many goddesses), <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> have also {{resulted}} in new goddesses and rituals gaining ascendance among the laity in different parts of Hindu world. Thus, the immensely popular goddess Durga was a pre-Vedic goddess who was later fused with Parvati, a process that can be traced through texts such as Kalika Purana (10th century), Durgabhaktitarangini (Vidyapati 15th century), Chandimangal (16th century) etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{sensation}} of weight {{is caused by}} the force exerted by fluids in the vestibular system, a three-dimensional set of tubes in the inner ear. It is actually the {{sensation of}} g-force, regardless of whether this is due to being stationary in the presence of gravity, or, if the person is in motion, the result of any other forces acting on the body such {{as in the case of}} acceleration or deceleration of a lift, or <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> when turning sharply.|$|E
50|$|In {{classical}} mechanics, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is an outward force {{associated with}} rotation. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> {{is one of}} several so-called pseudo-forces (also known as inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> in {{countering}} gravity, {{as in this}} behavior of the tides, has led <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> sometimes to be called [...] "false gravity" [...] or [...] "imitation gravity" [...] or [...] "quasi-gravity".|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the {{reactive}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is sometimes used in mechanics and engineering. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} just <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> rather than as reactive centrifugal forcealthough this usage is deprecated in elementary mechanics.|$|R
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} impact of the Coriolis effect is in the large-scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere. In meteorology and oceanography, it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary. In accommodation of that provisional postulation, the centrifugal and Coriolis forces are introduced. Their relative importance {{is determined by the}} applicable Rossby numbers. Tornadoes have high Rossby numbers, so, while tornado-associated <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> are quite substantial, Coriolis forces associated with tornadoes are for practical purposes negligible.|$|E
25|$|A {{classic example}} of fictitious force in {{circular}} motion is the experiment of rotating spheres tied by a cord and spinning around their center of mass. In this case, as with the linearly accelerating car example, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can be based upon the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain {{the tension in the}} string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> must be introduced to predict the observed tension.|$|E
25|$|The Rossby {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} to Coriolis forces. A small Rossby number indicates a system is strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number indicates {{a system in which}} inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large, in low-pressure systems it is low, and in oceanic systems it is around 1. As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces.</b> In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> {{is needed}} to explain the {{concavity}} {{of the water in}} a co-rotating frame of reference (one that rotates with the water) because the water appears stationary in this frame, and so should have a flat surface. Thus, observers looking at the stationary water need the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> to explain why the water surface is concave and not flat. The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> pushes the water toward the sides of the bucket, where it piles up deeper and deeper, Pile-up is arrested when any further climb costs as much work against gravity as is the energy gained from the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force,</b> which is greater at larger radius.|$|R
25|$|Reactive <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force,</b> being {{one-half}} of the reaction pair together with centripetal force, is a concept which applies in any reference frame.

50|$|Newton himself {{appears to}} have {{previously}} supported an approach {{similar to that of}} Leibniz. Later, Newton in his Principia crucially limited the description of the dynamics of planetary motion to a frame of reference in which the point of attraction is fixed. In this description, Leibniz's <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> was not needed and was replaced by only continually inward forces toward the fixed point. Newton objected to Leibniz's equation {{on the grounds that it}} allowed for the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> to have a different value from the centripetal force, arguing on the basis of his third law of motion, that the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> and the centripetal force must constitute an equal and opposite action-reaction pair. In this however, Newton was mistaken, as the reactive <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> which is required by the third law of motion is a completely separate concept from the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> of Leibniz's equation.|$|R
25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces,</b> suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.|$|E
25|$|Later historians {{stressed}} {{the fact of}} Henry's early death and the succeeding throne quarrel as a stroke of fate and a major setback {{for the development of}} a German nation state begun under his father Frederick Barbarossa. On the other hand, the emperor's stern measures in Sicily earned him the reputation of a cruel and merciless ruler. Present-day historical research classifies Henry as a man of his time; though a capable ruler he had to cope with the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> of the disintegrating empire while at the same time he overstretched the Hohenstaufen realm to an extent that finally could not be kept together.|$|E
25|$|Dumfries is a {{relatively}} prosperous community but the town centre has {{been exposed to the}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> that have seen retail, business, educational, residential and other uses gravitate towards the town's urban fringe. This was started in the 1980s with the building of the Dumfries bypass. The immediate effect of this was as intended the diversion of transiting traffic away from the town centre. This brought with it an accompanying reduction in economic input to the town centre. The second effect of this has been more pronounced. Sites close to the bypass have attracted development to utilise the bypass as a high speed urban highway without the bottlenecks of the town centre and without the constraining limited town centre parking.|$|E

The changes of stress, diameter and natural frequency of the turbine shaft for self-developed micro-spindle for micro-cutting following with the rotational speed were studied by finite element (FE) simulation, which showed that stress, diameter of the turbine shaft and frequency of torsional vibration in elastic shaft coupling integrated with the turbine shaft caused by the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> increases almost linearly with increase of rotational speed and the higher the speed, the larger the increase.

25|$|However, the {{whirling}} arm {{does not produce}} a reliable flow of air impacting the test shape at a normal incidence. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> {{and the fact that}} the object is moving in its own wake mean that detailed examination of the airflow is difficult. Francis Herbert Wenham (1824–1908), a Council Member of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, addressed these issues by inventing, designing and operating the first enclosed wind tunnel in 1871. Once this breakthrough had been achieved, detailed technical data was rapidly extracted by the use of this tool. Wenham and his colleague John Browning are credited with many fundamental discoveries, including the measurement of l/d ratios, and the revelation of the beneficial effects of a high aspect ratio.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical inertia is {{the basis}} of this storage method. When the {{electric}} power flows into the device, an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc. Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time. This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces.</b> The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic, however, tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 1990, Gorbachev {{was elected}} {{as the first}} {{executive}} President of the Soviet Union with 59% of the Deputies' votes. He was the sole candidate on the ballot.

Nonetheless, the Congress posed problems for Gorbachev: Its sessions were televised, airing more criticism and encouraging people to expect ever more rapid reform. Perestroika meant changing the planned economy into a more active, self-financed system, where the duration of central planning would not exceed five years, and which would be more able to react to economic needs. Communist rule in the Soviet Union weakened, and centralized power from Moscow was unable to combat <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> in the South.

5000|$|It wasn't {{until the}} latter half of the 18th century that the modern [...] "fictitious force" [...] {{understanding}} of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> as a pseudo-force artifact of rotating reference frames took shape. In a 1746 memoir by Daniel Bernoulli, [...] "the idea that the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is fictitious emerges unmistakably." [...] Bernoulli, in seeking to describe the motion of an object relative to an arbitrary point, showed that the magnitude of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> depended on which arbitrary point was chosen to measure circular motion about. Later in the 18th century Joseph Louis Lagrange in his Mécanique Analytique explicitly stated that the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> depends on the rotation of a system of perpendicular axes. In 1835, Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis analyzed arbitrary motion in rotating systems, specifically in relation to waterwheels. He coined the phrase [...] "compound centrifugal force" [...] for a term which bore a similar mathematical expression to that of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force,</b> albeit that it was multiplied by a factor of two. [...] The force in question was perpendicular to both the velocity of an object relative to a rotating frame of reference and the axis of rotation of the frame. Compound <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> eventually came to be known as the Coriolis Force.|$|R
