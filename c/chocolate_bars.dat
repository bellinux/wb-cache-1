5|$|Catherine of Braganza {{brought the}} Portuguese habit of tea to England around 1660. Initially, its expense {{restricted}} it to wealthy consumers, {{but the price}} gradually dropped, until by the 19th century its use was widespread. Introduced in the 16th century, coffee became popular by the 17th century, especially in the coffee houses, the first opening in Oxford in 1650. Hot chocolate was a popular drink by the 17th century, long before it {{was used as a}} food. <b>Chocolate</b> <b>bars</b> were developed and marketed by three English Quaker-founded businesses, Joseph Fry's (1847), Rowntree's (1862), and Cadbury's (1868).|$|E
40|$|<b>Chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> {{games are}} {{variants}} {{of the game}} of Nim in which {{the goal is to}} leave your opponent with the single bitter part of the <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar.</b> The rectangular <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> game is a thinly disguised form of classical multi-heap Nim. In this work, we investigate the mathematical structure of triangular <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> games in which the triangular <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> can be cut in three directions. In the triangular <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> game, a position is a P-position if and only if x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 0, where the numbers x,y,z stand for the maximum number of times that the <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> can be cut in each direction. Moreover, the Grundy number of a position (x,y,z) is not always equal to x ⊕ y ⊕ z, and a generic formula for Grundy numbers in not known. Therefore, the mathematical structure of triangular <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> game is different from that of classical Nim. Comment: 33 page...|$|R
50|$|This was {{demonstrated}} through research by approaching students before an exam—when students likely had their attention focused elsewhere—versus approaching students leisurely walking around and offering {{to sell them}} a <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar.</b> The <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> was advertised positively: chilled, favored by consumers on a taste test, and offered at a discount. In the experimental condition, the <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> was described as discounted since it was broken. The <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> was packed in a transparent wrapper, so the broken piece of chocolate could clearly {{be seen by the}} students. Students in the low-effort experimental group were twice as likely to purchase the <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> after being presented negative information, while in the high-effort group, students were half as likely to purchase the <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R

5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has two modes of play: story and free play. Story mode {{involves}} a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory. The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business. Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player {{with a small amount of}} cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use. In story mode, players begin with a single factory and a recipe for simple <b>chocolate</b> <b>bars,</b> the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of using CBS {{in this research}} {{is to improve the}} physical properties and quality of appereance and structure stability of <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar.</b> Based on chemical composition, CBS and Cocoa butter have different profile, but they have similar physical properties due to high lauric acid content. The advantage of lauric acid is to affect shinny appreance of chocolate surface, and also soapy taste that closely related to rancidity reduction. Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) is one of lauric fat that easily found in Aceh. In this research, <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> is formulated comprising various concentration of CBS (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 %) with respect to cocoa butter, and cocoa mass composition (200 g and 300 g). It was found that melting point was affected by CBS concentration. The higher CBS concentration, the lower melting point of <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar.</b> An increase in VCO concentration reduced significantly the melting point of <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar.</b> Melting point was comparable to other <b>chocolate</b> <b>bar</b> commercial (29 - 32 oC).

25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened {{screening}} room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only <b>chocolate</b> <b>bars</b> and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate {{is sold in}} <b>{{chocolate}}</b> <b>bars,</b> {{which come}} in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins or crisped rice. Chocolate {{is used as a}}n ingredient in a huge variety of candy bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate. Chocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M's) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts). Some non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate and chocolate milkshakes. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes.|$|E

25|$|Argentine Patagonian cuisine {{is largely}} {{the same as}} the cuisine of Buenos Aires – grilled meats and pasta – with {{extensive}} use of local ingredients and less use of those products which have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since the guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and centolla (king crab) are also common, though over-fishing of centolla has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, there is a noted Alpine cuisine tradition, with <b>chocolate</b> <b>bars</b> and even fondue restaurants, and tea rooms are a feature of the Welsh communities in Gaiman and Trevelin {{as well as in the}} mountains. Since the mid-1990s there has been some success with winemaking in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuquén.|$|E
25|$|Cadbury {{has enjoyed}} a {{substantial}} fan base in India. The Dairy Milk primarily is a huge success. Initially, the company had appointed Amithabh Bhachan as the brand ambassador in 2004. However the brand soon faced a significant backlash with worms being spotted in the <b>chocolate</b> <b>bars.</b> With its new campaigns however the company did get back on its feet. Cadbury {{is known for its}} marketing campaigns in India that have known to instill a sense of playfulness and innocence with its campaigns. One campaign that promoted the product by using the country's love for cricket was very successful. The ad is noted to be the best advertisement made in India by the Times of India. Another famous campaign hosted by the company in the past was the 'Shubh Aarambh' Campaign. This campaign made use of the traditional practice of Indian households of having something sweet before every auspicious occasion. It is a traditional belief that this leads to a favourable outcome for the people. This campaign was also a huge hit and positioned Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolates as part of a family name. Cadbury today holds 70% of the market share of the chocolate industry in the country.|$|E
500|$|In 1828, Coenraad Johannes van Houten {{developed}} the first cocoa powder producing {{machine in the}} Netherlands. The press separated the greasy cocoa butter from cacao seeds, leaving a purer chocolate powder behind. This powder, much like instant cocoa powder used today, was easier to stir into milk and water. As a result, another very important discovery was made: solid chocolate. By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter, it was then possible to manufacture <b>chocolate</b> <b>bars.</b> The term [...] "chocolate" [...] then came to mean solid chocolate rather than hot chocolate, with the first chocolate bar being created in 1847.|$|E
