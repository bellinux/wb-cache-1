5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was prevented from becoming close to her extended family. The enforced isolation meant the only companions of her own age whom she frequently {{came into contact with}} were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria {{does not appear to have}} been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive <b>comment</b> <b>in</b> her personal journals.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was made available to the public for <b>comment</b> <b>in</b> 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters, and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.|$|E
5|$|Parentage : The Apollodorus {{responsible}} for the Library lists Troilus last of Priam and Hecuba's sons – a detail adopted in the later tradition – but then adds that {{it is said that}} the boy was fathered by Apollo. On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus {{in the middle of a}} list of Priam's sons without further <b>comment.</b> <b>In</b> the early Christian writings the Clementine Homilies, it is suggested that Apollo was Troilus' lover rather than his father.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later <b>comment</b> <b>in</b> 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxième Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him {{to reduce the number of}} unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the riot, the England team cancelled the remaining games they were scheduled to play in Sydney. The incident also caused much press <b>comment</b> <b>in</b> England and Australia. In Australia, the newspapers were united in condemning the unrest, viewing the chaos as a national humiliation and a public relations disaster. An open letter by Lord Harris about the incident was later published in English newspapers, and caused fresh outrage in New South Wales when it was reprinted by the Australian newspapers. A defensive letter written in response by the New South Wales Cricket Association further damaged relations. The affair led to a breakdown of goodwill that threatened the future of Anglo-Australian cricket relations. However, friction between the cricketing authorities finally eased when Lord Harris agreed to lead an England representative side at The Oval in London against the touring Australians in 1880; this match became the fourth-ever Test and cemented the tradition of Anglo-Australian Test matches.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how the valence of framed messages and consumers 2 ̆ 7 {{familiarity with the}} brand impacts consumer attitudes toward the brand. An online {{study was conducted with}} a sample of 126 Chinese students who were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups. Based on the prospect theory, five hypotheses were explored. This study found that: (1) : positive <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> social media advertising have a positive effect on consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward the brand; (2) negative <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> social media advertising have a negative effect on consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward the brand; (3) negative comments have more effect than positive <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> social media advertising on consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward the brand; (4) among consumers who are unfamiliar with the brand, negative comments have more effect than positive <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> social media advertising on consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward the brand; (5) among consumers who are familiar with the brand, positive <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> social media advertising have no significant effect on consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward the brand, but for brand familiar consumers, negative <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> social media advertising also have an effect on their attitudes toward the brand. The contribution of this study is to help Chinese companies and international companies have a better knowledge of Chinese consumers and helping them for their digital marketing campaigns...|$|R

25|$|The {{teams of}} Mexico and the United States are widely {{considered}} {{as the two}} major powers of CONCACAF.

Although the first match was played in 1934, their rivalry was not considered major until the 1980s, when the teams began to frequently compete in CONCACAF cups. On August 15, 2012, the United States defeated Mexico at Estadio Azteca in the first victory for the U.S. against Mexico on Mexican soil in 75 years.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{unsubstantiated}} {{story that}} during {{his meeting with}} Hitler, Mannerheim lit a cigar.

When Mannerheim lit up, all in attendance gasped, for Hitler's aversion to smoking was well known. Yet Hitler continued the conversation calmly, with no <b>comment.</b> <b>In</b> this way, Mannerheim could judge if Hitler was speaking {{from a position of}} strength or weakness. He was able to refuse Hitler, knowing that Hitler was in a weak position, and could not dictate to him.|$|E
