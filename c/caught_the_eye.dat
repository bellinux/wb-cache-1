5|$|Craig's innings also <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of Australian {{selectors}} and he {{was selected}} for the Test team. He was named twelfth man for the Fourth Test, before making his debut in the Fifth Test after Miller and Ray Lindwall were rested due to mild injuries. Australia were leading the series 2–1 heading into the deciding match.|$|E
5|$|For several years, Howard {{appeared}} in New York plays. Among these were House & Garden, a 2002 Alan Ayckbourn production {{held at the}} Manhattan Theatre Club, in which she portrayed a disdainful, flirtatious teen.

5|$|During 1947 Katsura <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of American {{serviceman}} Vernon Greenleaf (no {{relation to}} the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf), a master sergeant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps {{who had been in}} the armed services for 22 years. Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where she was giving billiard exhibitions. Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura and was quickly smitten with her. They were married on November 30, 1950, but never had any children.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Auerbach began {{coaching}} {{basketball at}} the St. Albans School and Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C. Two years later, {{he joined the}} US Navy for three years, coaching the Navy basketball team in Norfolk. There, he <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of Washington millionaire Mike Uline, who hired him to coach the Washington Capitols in the newly founded Basketball Association of America (BAA), a predecessor of the NBA.|$|E
5|$|Alcmene {{belongs to}} the Pelopid line—her mother Lysidice was a {{daughter}} of Pelops and Hippodameia—, and the passages preceding her Ehoie also concern Pelopids. Three of Pelops' daughters married sons of Perseus: Lysidice married Electryon, Nicippe wed Sthenelus, and Astydameia wed Alcaeus. Nicippe and Sthenelus' daughter Astymedusa married Oedipus, and at the funeral games in his honor his son Polynices <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of his future wife Argeia, the daughter of Adrastus. Pelops' son Atreus {{was the father of}} Pleisthenes who, contrary to the better known genealogy, was the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus. Their mother was Aerope, the daughter of Catreus, and their births were reported in the verses directly preceding the Ehoie of Alcmene.|$|E

50|$|He played {{regularly}} {{during two}} {{seasons with the}} Lobi Stars. His performances <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of scouts from Sunshine Stars FC and in 2014 he was signed by Sunshine Stars F.C..|$|R
50|$|Mara {{made his}} first steps in {{professional}} football in Sibiu, at Inter, where he played for two years. The excellent games made there <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of <b>the</b> big clubs of Romania.|$|R
5|$|He {{received}} his wings {{in the summer}} of 1936. He met Jimmy Rawnsley at this time, a 32-year-old electrical engineer who would later serve as aerial gunner and radar operator on all but three of John's successful air battles. Cunningham subsequently became a junior test pilot with de Havilland, working with light aircraft alongside Geoffrey de Havilland, the company founder's son and chief test pilot. The company was short of test pilots and Cunningham <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of de Havilland as his flight experience grew. It was reflected by his promotion to flying officer on 5 December 1937. At this time John began to care more for test-flying than manufacture and design. He became one of four of de Havilland's top test pilots.|$|E
5|$|International {{selection}} attracted scouts from Football League clubs, and Gill {{was invited}} to Birmingham City {{to take part in}} trial matches. Halfway through the season, Roberts had brought striker Howard Forinton to Yeovil from Oxford City; his 23 goals in 21 games did much to secure the Isthmian League title and promotion to the Conference, and also <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of Birmingham manager Trevor Francis. A deal was struck which saw Gill and Forinton join the First Division side in August 1997 for a combined fee of £100,000, with Gill valued at £30,000 plus an additional £10,000 payable when he played ten first-team matches.|$|E
5|$|That season, McNichol {{scored a}} hat-trick against {{eventual}} runners-up Reading, which <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of manager Ted Drake. Shortly {{before the next}} season started, he became Drake's first signing for his new club, Chelsea, at a fee of £12,000 plus the player Jimmy Leadbetter, a club record fee received for Albion. He had scored 39 goals in all competitions from 165 appearances. Although scouts from bigger clubs had been watching the player since soon after his arrival at the club he had apparently already turned down moves to Manchester City, Everton and Huddersfield Town Brighton's supporters were disappointed, seeing his sale as a backward step.|$|E

5|$|While {{only a few}} Arabians were {{exported}} {{from behind}} the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, those who did come to the west <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of breeders worldwide. Improved international relations between eastern Europe and the west led to major imports of Polish and Russian-bred Arabian horses to western Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, greater political stability in Egypt, {{and the rise of}} the European Union all increased international trade in Arabian horses. Organizations such as the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) created consistent standards for transferring the registration of Arabian horses between different nations. Today, Arabian horses are traded all over the world.|$|E
5|$|Born in Livingston, West Lothian, Paul {{started playing}} {{football}} around {{the age of}} nine years playing for his local under-11 team Livingston United. Paul continued to play for Livingston United each year and when he played in under-13 this is when he <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of Arsenal Scout Malcolm McGregor. Dickov joined the youth ranks of Arsenal in 1989, before being promoted to the first team in 1990. Under George Graham chances were limited for Dickov {{as he struggled to}} break into the Arsenal team who were rich in talent with players such as Ian Wright. He helped the club win the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994, and beforehand he {{had been a member of}} Arsenal's squad during its first season in the Premier League. Whilst at Highbury he spent several loan spells at both Luton Town and Brighton & Hove Albion. He left Arsenal in 1996 having made 26 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals.|$|E
5|$|The Lafayette Afro Rock Band {{was formed}} as the Bobby Boyd Congress in 1970, in homage to their {{original}} vocalist Bobby Boyd. Upon deciding that the funk scene in the United States was too saturated for them to viably compete in, they relocated to France in 1971; with Bobby Boyd splitting from the group to pursue a musical career in America, they renamed themselves 'Soul Congress', then 'Ice'. After regular performances in Paris' Barbès district—an area made up primarily of North African immigrants—they <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of producer Pierre Jaubert and became the house session band at his Parisound studio. The influence of their surroundings led Ice to increasingly weave African rhyme schemes, textures, and beat tendencies in their original funk style, and as such they changed their name to Lafayette Afro Rock Band following the 1972 release of the poorly produced Each Man Makes His Own Destiny.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, Cabramatta High School has <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of many {{well-known}} stars, including Australian Idol's Jessica Mauboy, Australia's Got Talent's Justice Crew, singer Israel Cruz, {{as well as}} Jet Valencia, {{the director}} of Australia's Got Talent's Kookies n Kreme.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} season, {{he played}} in the Country trials in Brisbane. He was selected for the Queensland Colts in 193233 and represented Queensland Country against Douglas Jardine's England cricket team during the Bodyline tour. In England's innings of 376, Tallon conceded only five byes and stumped Herbert Sutcliffe, {{regarded as one of the}} finest batsmen in Test history. He did not get a chance to display his batting prowess as the Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood rattled him with a series of deliveries aimed at the throat, before bowling him for two. Tallon's fast and efficient skills behind the stumps further <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of cricket officials in early 1933 at the Country Week Carnivals. Tallon distinguished himself with his tidy keeping to the express pace bowling of Eddie Gilbert, whose suspect action and indigenous heritage were later the subject of controversy.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Schalke, Holtby was once again loaned out for the 2010–11 season, this time to Mainz. Under the {{management}} of Thomas Tuchel at Mainz, Holtby formed a strong partnership with attackers Ádám Szalai and André Schürrle which helped the club to seven successive wins {{at the start of}} the season. His impressive form for the club <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of national team coach Joachim Löw who selected him for the senior Germany squad in November 2010. He ultimately made 32 appearances for the season across all competitions and scored 6 goals as Mainz ended the season in fifth place, 18 points ahead of Schalke, and qualified for a spot in the UEFA Europa League for the next season. Upon the expiration of his loan at Mainz, Holtby paid tribute to Tuchel, describing him as a brilliant coach who had made him a much better player.|$|E
5|$|In Kinkladze's {{first season}} at the club, Dinamo won a league and cup double. However, due to the ongoing Georgian Civil War, during 1993 the Dinamo Tbilisi {{management}} sought to put their players in a more stable environment. As part of this, Kinkladze was sent on loan to 1. FC Saarbrücken in Germany. Kinkladze made his Saarbrücken debut in a 2. Bundesliga match against Tennis Borussia Berlin, a 2–2 draw on 4 March 1994. He was unable to settle into the side at Saarbrücken, rarely playing a full 90 minutes, and was sent off in a 1–3 defeat to Hertha Berlin. At {{the end of the}} season, Kinkladze returned to Tbilisi to resume his career in Georgia, where he was named the national Player of the Year for 1993. Dinamo president Merab Jordania was still uncomfortable with Kinkladze playing in Georgia amid political instability, and offered the player to Atlético Madrid for approximately £200,000; they gave him a trial, but no contract. He then trained with Real Madrid's reserves, where he <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of Boca Juniors scouts, who took him to Argentina for a month's loan. Kinkladze met his childhood hero Diego Maradona, but did not gain a permanent contract, as manager Silvio Marzolini regarded him as too similar to Boca's Argentine international playmaker Alberto Márcico.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a series}} of {{positive}} displays, <b>the</b> keeper <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of Air India FC coach Bimal Ghosh, who {{is known to have}} a skill for spotting young talent.

5|$|After {{an early}} spell at Tavelsjö IK, Blomqvist signed for then {{recently}} formed Umeå FC in 1992. In the spring {{portion of his}} first season for the club, he helped them to the Division 2 Norra Norrland title, promoting the club to Division 1 Norra for the autumn. At the time {{this was the second}} tier of Swedish football. Subsequently, he signed for IFK Göteborg on 11 September 1993. Blomqvist played a part in the club's Allsvenskan win that year. He scored eight goals in 24 league appearances en route to the league title in 1994. Furthermore, he played a part in Sweden's advance to the semi finals of the World Cup and scored in the club's 3–1 win over Manchester United in the Champions League, knocking them out of the competition. This performance <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of United manager Alex Ferguson and helped the team qualify for the quarter-finals of the tournament. Another title followed in 1995, with Blomqvist's goal against Helsingborgs IF, when he performed a variant of the Pelé runaround move, voted goal of the season. In his last season for Göteborg, he played against former club Umeå, who had reached the Allsvenskan {{for the first time in}} their history. In 1996, Blomqvist was voted Fan's Player of the Year and Midfielder of the Year. At the end of the 1996 season, he signed for newly crowned Serie A champions Milan.|$|E
25|$|Perryman <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> {{at the age}} of 17 in 1973, when he took 6/44 in 23 overs for Warwickshire Young Amateurs as {{they beat}} their Buckinghamshire {{counterparts}} in the Hilda Overy Trophy.|$|E

50|$|Even then, {{the college}} going David Ngaihte wasn't {{serious about the}} offer but took it up {{just for the sake}} of playing the game he loves.With nothing to prove, he <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of <b>the</b> capital's {{football}} aficionados and soon earned a berth for the Delhi Santosh Trophy team.|$|R
50|$|Flores {{began his}} {{coaching}} career {{by following the}} footsteps {{of one of his}} predecessors at Valencia, Rafael Benítez, by taking charge of Real Madrid's youth teams. After gaining plaudits during his time at the youth teams he <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of <b>the</b> newly promoted Getafe CF, also in Madrid.|$|R
5000|$|The fans {{call him}} Al-Ghezal, which means [...] "the deer" [...] in Arabic. He wears the number 10 shirt for Al-Hilal.
