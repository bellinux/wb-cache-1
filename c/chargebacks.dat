25|$|Chargebacks: A {{chargeback}} is {{an event}} in which money in a merchant account is held due to a dispute relating to the transaction. <b>Chargebacks</b> are typically initiated by the cardholder. In {{the event of a}} chargeback, the issuer returns the transaction to the acquirer for resolution. The acquirer then forwards the chargeback to the merchant, who must either accept the chargeback or contest it.|$|E
25|$|Barcode {{verification}} examines scanability and {{the quality}} of the barcode in comparison to industry standards and specifications. Barcode verifiers are primarily used by businesses that print and use barcodes. Any trading partner in the supply chain can test barcode quality. It is important to verify a barcode to ensure that any reader in the supply chain can successfully interpret a barcode with a low error rate. Retailers levy large penalties for non-compliant barcodes. These <b>chargebacks</b> can reduce a manufacturer's revenue by 2% to 10%.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chargeback</b> fraud, {{also known}} as {{friendly}} fraud, occurs when a consumer makes an online shopping purchase with their own credit card, and then requests a <b>chargeback</b> from the issuing bank after receiving the purchased goods or services. Once approved, the <b>chargeback</b> cancels the financial transaction, and the consumer receives a refund of the money they spent. When a <b>chargeback</b> occurs, the merchant is accountable, regardless of whatever measures they took to verify the transaction.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: IT <b>chargeback</b> is {{generally}} regarded as a necessary evil in which central IT costs are, as accurately as possible, divided among the business units that benefit from them. In this study of IT <b>chargeback</b> practices at ten large U. S. firms, we found that IT <b>chargeback</b> {{had the potential to}} be a valuable management tool. We observed three approaches to <b>chargeback</b> that differed according to their objectives, their policies regarding sourcing and level of accountability, and their administrative processes. While all three approaches led to cost reduction efforts by <b>chargeback</b> statement recipients, they had different impacts on business unit attitudes toward the IT unit. In particular, we found that <b>chargeback</b> could facilitate useful discussions between the IT unit and business units about business priorities and the value of IT services. In most cases, however, <b>chargeback,</b> while encouraging business unit managers to manage the demand for IT services, left them questioning whether the IT unit was effectively managing the supply of those services. Based on these findings we offer recommendations as to how firms can design <b>chargeback</b> systems that will generate positive attitudes and economic returns...|$|R
25|$|Two years later, the FTC and Karnani {{settled the}} case with a consent decree. The {{defendants}} agreed to make the prohibitions of the 2009 order permanent. They were further barred from processing any transaction until the goods were ready to ship and not disputing any customer <b>chargebacks</b> made prior to {{a year before the}} decree. A $500,000 judgement against the defendants was entered, but suspended due to their inability to pay unless business records submitted in response to the FTC's requests were found to be falsified. Karnani and the other defendants admitted no wrongdoing.|$|E

2500|$|According to PayPal, {{it protects}} sellers {{in a limited}} fashion via the Seller Protection Policy. In general the Seller Protection Policy is {{intended}} to protect the seller from certain kinds of <b>chargebacks</b> or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer. PayPal states the Seller Protection Policy is [...] "designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of non-receipt of any merchandise". The policy includes a list of [...] "Exclusions" [...] which itself includes [...] "Intangible goods", [...] "Claims for receipt of goods 'not as described and [...] "Total reversals over the annual limit". There are also other restrictions {{in terms of the}} sale itself, the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect). The PayPal Seller Protection Policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation (e.g., Sale of Goods Act) and in addition it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg, outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions.|$|E

5000|$|Cryptocurrency {{transactions}} are normally irreversible {{after a number}} of blocks confirm the transaction. One of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to credit cards is consumer protection against fraud, such as <b>chargebacks.</b> This is, however, a non-issue because third-party multisignature-based escrow can be used to mediate a transaction, this is effectively equivalent to enabling <b>chargebacks.</b> This is also much easier than performing an irreversible transaction using a system with native <b>chargebacks,</b> so this aspect is actually an advantage.|$|E
50|$|If a {{merchant}} encounters a <b>chargeback</b> {{they may be}} assessed a fee by their acquiring bank. A potential <b>chargeback</b> is presented {{on behalf of the}} card holder's bank to the merchant's credit card processing bank.|$|R

50|$|The phrase <b>chargeback</b> {{insurance}} is also sometimes {{used to describe}} the guarantee provided by online fraud prevention companies such as Forter, Riskified and Signifyd. Unlike with card present transactions, where the merchant is not liable for the cost of fraudulent transactions (unless they do not meet technological security requirements such as EMV), merchants are liable for card not present transactions which turn out to be fraudulent. For this reason, online fraud prevention companies who offer decisions (meaning, they provide an approve or decline decision for orders) rather than scores (where the merchant must themselves decide whether to approve or decline) sometimes offer {{to cover the cost of}} the <b>chargeback,</b> since the <b>chargeback</b> would not have occurred had their decision not been incorrect. This form of <b>chargeback</b> insurance, more properly called a <b>chargeback</b> guarantee, will typically cover all losses of the relevant type, not only through one gateway or processor.|$|R

40|$|With {{pay-per-use}} pricing models, elastic {{scaling of}} resources, and {{the usage of}} shared virtualized infrastructure, the Cloud offers more efficient use of capital, great cost reductions, and breakthrough agility. Yet, this new IT provisioning model profoundly changes the economics of IT. It turns out that to leverage the Cloud advantages, to realize the possible cost reductions, and to provide business consumers with the flexibility of pay-per-use, organizations have to introduce Cloud-friendly <b>chargeback</b> models. That is, they have to allocate IT service costs to business users {{in a way that}} reflects service consumption. To help organization transition to a Cloud environment, this work provides answers to three questions. Firstly, it explains how the Cloud impacts <b>chargeback</b> and why it requires new <b>chargeback</b> models.

5000|$|The idea of <b>chargeback</b> in a {{traditional}} (non-virtualised) sense is not new, and references go {{as far back as}} the 1980s. Publications available on the Internet generally support the notion that <b>chargeback</b> involved literally charging departments based on actual resource consumption rather than forecast usage. <b>Chargeback</b> is most relevant to IT departments, simply because almost all areas of an organisation use computing resources. Rather than IT having to justify expenditures for another area of the organisation, the burden is on those departments who are actually planning on using the resource provided by IT.|$|R
5000|$|Virtual <b>chargeback</b> {{can be a}} {{particularly}} difficult process to implement, due {{to the use of}} shared/common resources.

50|$|For {{transactions}} {{where the}} original invoice {{was signed by}} the consumer, the merchant may dispute a chargeback {{with the assistance of}} the merchant's acquiring bank. The acquirer and issuer mediate in the dispute process, following rules set forth by the corresponding bank network or card association. If the acquirer prevails in the dispute, the funds are returned to the acquirer, and then to the merchant. Only 21% of <b>chargebacks</b> lodged globally are decided in favour of the merchant. The 2014 Cybersource Fraud Benchmark Report found that only 60% of <b>chargebacks</b> are disputed by merchants, and that merchants have a success rate of about 41% with those they do re-present.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chargebacks</b> {{also occur}} when a bank error credits an account with more funds than intended. The bank makes a {{chargeback}} {{to correct the}} error. If an overdraft results and it cannot be covered in time, the bank could sue or press criminal charges. When a direct deposit is made to the wrong account holder or in a greater amount than intended a chargeback is made to correct the error. Finally, <b>chargebacks</b> occur when an account holder deposits a check or money order and the deposited item is returned due to non-sufficient funds, a closed account, or being discovered to be counterfeit, stolen, altered, or forged.|$|E
