2500|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of soil {{is the average}} <b>contact</b> <b>stress</b> between a foundation and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil. [...] Allowable bearing stress is the {{bearing capacity}} divided {{by a factor of}} safety. [...] Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field Plate Load Test is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of subgrade reaction (ks). The Modulus of subgrade reaction (ks) is used in foundation design, soil-structure interaction studies and design of highway pavements.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} of tire-pavement contact behavior {{plays an important}} role in the analysis of pavement performance and vehicle stability control. A threedimensional (3 -D) tire-pavement interaction model was developed using the finite element method (FEM) to analyze the forces and <b>contact</b> <b>stresses</b> generated during vehicle maneuvering (free rolling, braking/acceleration, and cornering). A pneumatic radial-ply tire structure with rubber and reinforcement was simulated. The steady-state tire rolling process was simulated using an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation. An improved friction model that considers the effect of sliding speed on friction coefficients was implemented to analyze the effects of pavement surface friction on <b>contact</b> <b>stresses,</b> friction forces, and cornering forces. The results show that the magnitudes and non-uniformity of <b>contact</b> <b>stresses</b> are affected by vehicle maneuvering conditions. As the pavement surface friction increases, the tangential tire-pavement <b>contact</b> <b>stresses</b> at various rolling conditions (free rolling, braking/acceleration, and cornering) and the vertical <b>contact</b> <b>stresses</b> at the cornering condition increase. It is reasonable to use the constant friction coefficient when predicting tire-pavement <b>contact</b> <b>stresses</b> at the free rolling condition or at the cornering condition with small slip angles. However, it is important to use the sliding-velocity-dependent friction model when predicting the friction force at tire braking...|$|R
