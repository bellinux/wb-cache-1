50|$|Functional imaging of {{the brain}} has shown that {{self-control}} is correlated with an area in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), {{a part of the}} frontal lobe. This area is distinct from those involved in generating intentional actions, attention to intentions, or select between alternatives. This control occurs through the top-down inhibition of premotor cortex. There is some debate about the mechanism of self-control and how it emerges. Traditionally, researchers believed the bottom-up approach guided self-control behavior. The more time a person spends thinking about a rewarding stimulus, the more likely he or she will experience a desire for it. Information that is most important gains <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory, and can then be processed through a top-down mechanism. Increasing evidence suggests that top down processing plays a strong role in self-control. Specifically, top-down processing can actually regulate bottom-up attentional mechanisms. To demonstrate this, researchers studied working memory and distraction by presenting participants with neutral or negative pictures and then a math problem or no task. They found that participants reported less negative moods after solving the math problem compared to the no task group, which was due to an influence on working memory capacity.|$|E

In some cases, effective reorganization can decrease task difficulty, implying a dissociation between frontal activity and basic memory demand. In a spatial working memory task, we studied the improvement of performance that occurs when materials can be reorganized into higher level groups or chunks.

Though structured sequences were easier to remember, event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) showed increased activation of lateral frontal cortex, in particular during memory encoding. The results show that, even when memory demand decreases, organization of working memory contents into higher level chunks is associated with increased prefrontal activity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A {{system for}} {{computer}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> pressure in a plasma nitriding unit {{by using a}} DCM (Distributed Controlled Modules) system is described. Plasma nitriding as a thermochemical process of materials surface treatment is widely used {{in many areas of}} industrial applications such as microelectronics, automotive industry, air space industry etc. This process is in development, especially concerning plasma generators and related electronics. The processes at the surface of workpieces require a very precise control of many process parameters, the most important being the working gas composition, substrate temperature, pressure and discharge voltage. Generally electrical discharge is used for both the plasma processing and heating of the substrate by the surface bombarding particles. The first process step is the so called cleaning and heating stage, which is characterized by large number of glow-to-arc discharge instabilities. Besides an independent and precise control of the process parameters cited above, a computer control is needed to minimized the arcing processes and the other plasma instabilities. The total pressure inside the processing chamber is important for homogeneity control of the surface treatment of complex shaped substrates. The local overheating due to so called hallow cathode effect may be controlled by appropriate working pressure adjustment. This paper deals with computer <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> pressure in the plasma nitriding unit JONEL 1254, which consists of gas supply station, vacuum chamber with corresponding vacuum components, plasma generator, measuring unit and control unit for computer acquisition and control of plasma processing parameters. The control unit is a DCM slave node, connected to the PC through the serial BitBus interconnect. Each DCM node contains a microcontroller Intel 8051, which provides data processing inside the node itself. A DCM communication software, actually an operating system for BitBus compatible modules, is developed and used for the communication between PC and control unit, i. e. between DCM master and slave node.

Even though TMS neuromodulation effects over the left DLPFC have successfully improved WM performance in patients with depression and schizophrenia in a multitude of studies, raising the potential of TMS as a safe efficacious treatment for WM deficits, TMS interventions in healthy individuals have produced mixed and inconclusive results. Here, we stimulated the left DLPFC of healthy individuals using a high-frequency repetitive TMS protocol and evaluated behavioral performance in a battery of cognitive tasks.

30|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, the neural {{mechanism}} of central executive and working memory is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new {{neural network model}} for the real-time <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory. The key idea is to consider separately the role of neural activation from that of oscillatory phase. Neural populations encoding different information would not confuse each other when the populations have different oscillatory phases. Depending on the current situation, relevant memories bind together through phase-locking between theta-frequency oscillation of a Central Unit and alpha-frequency oscillations of the relevant group of Memory Units. The Central Unit dynamically controls which Memory Units should be synchronized (and the encoded memory would be processed), and which units should be out of phase (the encoded memory is standby {{and would not be}} processed yet). Simulations of two working memory tasks are provided as examples. The model is in agreement with many recent experimental results of human scalp EEG analysis, which reported observations of neural synchronization and cross-frequency coupling during working memory tasks. This model offers a possible explanation of the underlying mechanism for these experiments.|$|E

Those match to situations where the advisor makes with farmers’ temporalities (season, multi-year, emergency). He/ she learns how to handle a situation and an action at the right time and manner.

Using previously unexploited data on couples work schedules we investigate the effect of flexible working on couples coordination of their daily work schedules in the UK.

We show that having flexitime at work increases a couples amount of coordination of their daily work schedules by a half to one hour, which is double the margin of adjustment enjoyed by couples with no flexitime. The impact is driven by couples with children. In contrast to flexitime, the other two forms of flexible working do not seem to increase synchronous time. Our results suggest that having flexitime plays an important role in relaxing the work scheduling constraints faced by families with young children, and that effective flexible working time arrangements are those that increase the workers and not the employers flexibility...|$|E
