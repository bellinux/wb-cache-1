500|$|The EyeTV {{software}} was updated to version 3.0 in 2008. 3.0 made user interface improvements, {{such as being}} able to mark favorites or automatically record shows in a series. A review in TechRadar gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars. The review noted that EyeTV was the de facto software for TV and <b>computer</b> <b>video</b> <b>integration</b> and praised its new features, but said it was expensive when purchased separately. A 2007 article in MacLife said their [...] "top picks" [...] for USB-powered tuners were those using the EyeTV software, such as the EyeTV hybrid or EyeTV 250. In addition to Elgato's EyeTV line of consumer devices, other brands such as Terratec and Miglia use the EyeTV software in their products through licensing agreements with Elgato.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>video</b> signals: <b>Computer</b> <b>video</b> {{can be set}} up to run at many {{different}} frame or field rates, ranging 50 frame/s to more than 240 frame/s. <b>Computer</b> <b>video</b> is generally progressive by default, but many interlaced modes exist. A scan converter is typically needed to convert these signals to one of the many acceptable broadcast standards, such as 59.97 Hz or 50 Hz. This type of conversion typically degrades the quality of the broadcast image, usually resulting with either [...] "motion artifacts" [...] or a lower resolution. It is recommended that the display rate be set to equal the target television rate if possible.|$|R

We apply a spatio-temporal gradient based <b>video</b> <b>integration</b> algorithm for fast and accurate integration of the three input HDR videos into a low dynamic range video, which is suitable for display. The spatiotemporal <b>video</b> <b>integration</b> generates <b>videos</b> with temporal coherency and without artifacts. In order to improve the computational speed, we propose using a diagonal multigrid algorithm to solve the Poisson equation. We show experimental results on a variety of dynamic scenes. ...|$|R
