5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>of</b> the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the <b>canyon</b> <b>of</b> the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E

5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the <b>canyon</b> <b>of</b> wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Hoover Dam is a {{concrete}} arch-gravity dam in the Black <b>Canyon</b> <b>of</b> the Colorado River, {{on the border}} between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction {{was the result of a}} massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert Hoover.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Placerville, the {{expressway}} {{through town}} starts, only to end several miles later. The final section of freeway, {{known as the}} El Dorado Freeway, begins near Camino, where the Lincoln Highway splits from US 50, and ends at {{the east end of}} Pollock Pines. Just east of Pollock Pines, US 50 continues as an undivided conventional highway with one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes, entering the river <b>canyon</b> <b>of</b> the South Fork American River near Riverton and crossing to {{the north side of the}} river near Ice House Road. From Ice House Road to the crest of the Sierras, US 50 is a steadily rising mostly two-lane road, staying just north of the river except for a 1995 cutoff that crosses the river twice in quick succession west of Kyburz, the boyhood home of ski racer Spider Sabich.|$|E

5|$|On September30, 1935, the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) {{completed}} Hoover Dam in the Black <b>Canyon</b> <b>of</b> the Colorado River. Behind the dam rose Lake Mead, {{the largest}} artificial {{lake in the}} U.S., capable of holding {{more than two years}} of the Colorado's flow. The construction of Hoover was a major step towards stabilizing the lower channel of the Colorado River, storing water for irrigation in times of drought, and providing much-needed flood control as part of a program known as the Boulder Canyon Project. Hoover was the tallest dam in the world at the time of construction and also had the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Flow regulation from Hoover Dam opened the doors for rapid development on the lower Colorado River; Imperial and Parker dams followed in 1938, and Davis Dam was completed in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the swell. At the summit is another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>of</b> the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell, the San Rafael Reef. Just as the highway exits the swell it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the swell near Green River.|$|E
5|$|Eleven U.S. {{national}} parks – Arches, Black <b>Canyon</b> <b>of</b> the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Petrified Forest, Rocky Mountain, Saguaro, and Zion – {{are in the}} watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and recreation areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado's major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming, and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding Glen Canyon National Recreation Area received more than twomillion visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9million people visited Lake Mead and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in 2008. Colorado River recreation employs some 250,000 people and contributes $26billion each year to the Southwest economy.|$|E

5|$|I-70 enters Colorado from Utah, {{concurrent}} with US6 and US50, on {{a plateau}} {{between the north}} rim of Ruby <b>Canyon</b> <b>of</b> the Colorado River and the south rim of the Book Cliffs. The plateau ends just past the state line and the highway descends into the Grand Valley, formed by the Colorado River and its tributaries. The Grand Valley is home to several towns and small cities that form the Grand Junction Metropolitan Statistical Area, the largest conurbation in the area locally known as the Western Slope. The highway directly serves the communities of Fruita, Grand Junction and Palisade. Grand Junction is the largest city between Denver and Salt Lake City and serves as the economic hub of the area. The freeway passes {{to the north of}} downtown, while US6 and 50 retain their original routes through downtown. US6 rejoins I-70 east of Grand Junction; US50 departs on a course toward Pueblo.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{guided the}} party into the Mohave Canyon, {{indicating}} {{the location of}} rapids and advising the Explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached {{the entrance to the}} Black <b>Canyon</b> <b>of</b> the Colorado, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the boiler, and damaging the wheelhouse. Using their skiff, the crew towed the Explorer to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes.|$|E
5|$|Southwest of {{the city}} of Rexburg, the Snake {{receives}} from the right the Henrys Fork, sometimes called the North Fork of the Snake River. The confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls, rounding the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir, receiving the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into the Snake River Plain, carving out many topographic features and significantly altering the Snake River landscape. The Snake River resumes its journey westwards, then enters the Snake River <b>Canyon</b> <b>of</b> Idaho, where it drops over Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon, and passing under the Perrine Bridge. Close to Twin Falls, the Snake approaches the southernmost point in its entire course, after which it starts to flow generally northwest.|$|E
