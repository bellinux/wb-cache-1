About a million and a half Guatemalans live and work in rural and urban cities and towns across the United States and Canada. Like many other migrant groups, most Guatemalans sustain strong transnational linkages between their homeland and el norte (the United States). In the Guatemalan example highlighted in this article, such bonds owe much to the long-standing Guatemalan-U. S. historical connections, to the geographic proximity of the country to the United States. Drawing on ethnographic material, this article examines the divergent kinds of transnational connections that Maya indigenous (K´iche´) migrants craft and keep alive between their home community and their two primary destination localities in the United States—Houston, Texas and Los Angeles, California. The article shows the different means of communication and technology, as well as the varying types of transnational organizing —particularly grass-roots efforts— that help shape <b>current</b> <b>linkages</b> between those who go and those who stay.

30|$|To {{understand}} the <b>current</b> <b>linkages</b> and state of resource dependency between the neighboring human settlements and the Park, data on various aspects related to socio-economic status {{and natural resources}} dependency was subjected to comparative trend analyses, taking off from an earlier study (Azeez et al., 1992) that examined issues relating to the dependency of the human settlements on KNP. For comparison, the same parameters that were considered earlier and the same methodology for data collection was adopted here. Three villages (Chakram Nagar, Barso, and Chak Ji Barpura) that were not covered earlier {{were included in the}} present study. Furthermore, change in population from 1991 to 2011 in Darapur Khurd and Banjara Nagla, and literacy rate in Chak Ji Barpura could not considered in the present analyses as the earlier details for those villages were not available. To ascertain the differences in the mean over time, we used Wilcoxon signed rank test for literacy rate, source of income and fuel use in 2 years (1991 and 2011) and Friedman rank test for groundwater level (1982, 2002 and 2012), households and population in 3 years (1991, 2001 and 2011).

These knowledge sources include Current Disease Descriptions (CDD), Physicians Data Query (PDQ), and Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM). Metacard can also be linked to Grateful Med, the NLM program which is used to search MEDLINE. A user can, with minimal training, use MetaCard to access these four different knowledge sources. The links (how one goes from one knowledge source to another) have been built on the basis of disease names. In organizing these links, it was helpful to use CDD as an additional source of knowledge about how diseases are named in various sources. Further plans are to expand the use of the Metathesaurus in building links to the knowledge sources. The question with each method of linking used will be to what extent the method provides a robust linkage whose utility can be anticipated. While future refinements or developments of links may give additional functionality, the <b>current</b> <b>linkages</b> are sufficient to provide a useful browsing tool.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents {{a study on}} the design of tooth-coil permanent magnet synchronous machines. The electromagnetic properties of concentrated non-overlapping winding permanent magnet synchronous machines, or simply tooth-coil permanent magnet synchronous machines (TC-PMSMs), are studied in details. It is shown that <b>current</b> <b>linkage</b> harmonics play the deterministic role in the behavior of this type of machines. Important contributions are presented as regards of calculation of parameters of TC-PMSMs,particularly the estimation of inductances. The <b>current</b> <b>linkage</b> harmonics essentially define the air-gap harmonic leakage inductance, rotor losses and localized temporal inductance variation. It is proven by FEM analysis that inductance variation caused by the local temporal harmonic saturation results in considerable torque ripple, and can influence on sensorless control capabilities. Example case studies an integrated application of TC-IPMSMs in hybrid off-highway working vehicles. A methodology for increasing the efficiency of working vehicles is introduced. It comprises several approaches – hybridization, working operations optimization, component optimization and integration. As a result of component optimization and integration, a novel integrated electro-hydraulic energy converter (IEHEC) for off-highway working vehicles is designed. The IEHEC can considerably increase the operational efficiency of a hybrid working vehicle. The energy converter consists of an axial-piston hydraulic machine and an integrated TCIPMSM being built on the same shaft. The compact assembly of the electrical and hydraulic machines enhances the ability to find applications for such a device in the mobile environment of working vehicles. Usage of hydraulic fluid, typically used in working actuators, enables direct-immersion oil cooling of designed electrical machine, and further increases the torque- and power- densities of the whole device...|$|E

40|$|A {{suite of}} 10 {{microsatellite}} loci {{was used to}} examine genetic divergence between two sympatric morphs of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (‘dark ’ and ‘pale’) inhabiting Gander Lake, Newfoundland. Results can be summarized as follows: (1) the morphs are strongly reproduc-tively isolated – gene flow–migration estimates were consistently low in long and short-term evolutionary timescales of analysis; (2) intermorph divergence based on allele size (RST) was significantly larger than those based on allele state (y) implying a cumulative effect of stepwise-like mutations; (3) historical (coalescent) and <b>current</b> (<b>linkage</b> disequilibrium) point estimates of effective population size (Ne) were consistently higher for dark than for pale S. alpinus. The first and second findings lend support to the hypothesis that divergence between forms may have preceded the last glacial period (ending c. 12 000 years BP). The third finding argues for significant differences in habitat quantity and quality between morphs, which were emphasized in a previous study.

Within the given sampling time, flux as well as torque errors are controlled by stator voltage vector which is evaluated from reference stator flux. The direct torque control is achieved by reference stator flux angle which is generates from instantaneous slip speed angular frequency and stator flux angular frequency. The amplitude of the reference stator flux is kept constant at rated value. This technique gives better performance in three-phase induction motor than conventional technique.

It has simple structure and provides dynamic behavior comparable with classical DTC. Direct Torque Control (DTC) {{is an accurate}} controller for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) due to its robust and fast torque response in steady-state and transient operating condition. However, the main disadvantage of DTC is high ripples in stator <b>current,</b> flux <b>linkage</b> and torque due to the application of same active voltage vector during the whole sample period and possibly several consecutive sample intervals. This can be overcome by using proper modulation technique. Space Vector Modulation (SVM) which synthesizes any voltage vector lying inside the sextant gives good performance, but however the complexity involved is more in calculating angle and sector. To reduce the complexity involved in SVPWM, a novel modulation technique named Unified voltage modulation or carrier based space vector pulse width modulation (CBSVPWM) is described using the concept of effective time. By using this method the inverter output voltage is directly synthesized by the effective times and the voltage modulation task can be greatly simplified. The actual gating signals for each inverter arm can be easily deduced as a simple form using the effective time relocation algorithm...|$|R
