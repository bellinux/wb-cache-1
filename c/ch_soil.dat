40|$|Soil {{stabilization}} is {{a common}} technique to increase the strength and durability and also to reduce the swell-shrink behavior of foundation soil or subgrade soil in pavement. Nowadays, several nontraditional stabilizers (e. g., Polymer, Enzyme, Ionic stabilizer etc.) are available in market whose behavior is not fully understood for wide range of soil types. In the present study two types of soils i. e., Carbondale soil ‘clay with high plasticity (CH) ’ and Galatia soil ‘silt with low plasticity (ML) ’ has been used. A commercially available liquid polymer “Soiltac” was selected as a stabilizer and mixed with both the soils at various percentages i. e., 0. 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 3. 0 % by dry weight of soil to study the effect of polymer on geotechnical properties of soil. Particle size distribution, liquid limit, plastic limit, specific gravity and standard Proctor tests were conducted to identify the basic index properties of the soil. Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests were conducted after 3 days, 7 days and 28 days of curing period for <b>CH</b> <b>soil.</b> For ML soil, UCS tests were carried out after 7 days and 28 days of curing period. In addition, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests were conducted for <b>CH</b> <b>soil</b> at unsoaked and soaked (soaked for 96 hours) conditions. With the addition of stabilizer, no significant changes in UCS values were obtained for ML soil.

40|$|Upland {{soils are}} {{important}} sinks for atmospheric methane (CH 4), a process essentially driven by methanotrophic bacteria. <b>Soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake often depends on land use, with afforestation generally increasing the <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 sink. However, the mechanisms driving {{these changes are}} not well understood to date. We measured <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 and N 2 O fluxes along an afforestation chronosequence with Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) established on an extensively grazed subalpine pasture. Our experimental design included forest stands with ages ranging from 25 to > 120 years and included a factorial cattle urine addition treatment to test for the sensitivity of <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake to N application. Mean CH 4 uptake significantly increased with stand age on all sampling dates.

Our data indicated that <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake in older forest stands was driven by reduced soil water content, {{which resulted in a}} facilitated diffusion of atmospheric <b>CH</b> 4 into <b>soils.</b> The lower soil moisture likely resulted from increased interception and/or evapotranspiration in the older forest stands. This mechanism contrasts alternative explanations focusing on nitrogen dynamics or the composition of methanotrophic communities, although these factors also might be at play.

A two-year field {{study was conducted to}} assess the effects of various forms of N (NH 4 + and N- 3 (-)) and associated N deposition rates (0, 10, 20 and 40 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) on alpine meadow <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 fluxes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. <b>Soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 fluxes, <b>soil</b> temperature, and soil moisture were monitored weekly using the static chamber technique and gas chromatography.

Our results showed that N addition significantly promoted plant growth and changed soil water-filled pore space (WFPS), but did not alter soil inorganic N storages over the short term. Low rates of N addition significantly decreased the seasonal amount of CH 4 uptake by 8. 6 % compared with the control. <b>Soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 fluxes were mainly determined by soil WFPS, followed by inorganic N availability. N addition increased the contribution of soil WFPS, pH and soil NO 3 - storage. The observed reduction in CH 4 uptake caused by N addition may be largely due to a decrease in physical diffusion, as the biochemical inhibition effects on methanotrophic bacteria are minor. These results suggest that soil inorganic N is a regulatory factor of <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake, and its promotion or inhibition to <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake depends on the N status in terrestrial ecosystems.

It remains unclear if ammonia-oxidizers affect interaction between methane (CH 4) uptake and N 2 O emission. Our specific goal was to test the impacts of changes in ammonia oxidizing communities elicited by N enrichment on <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake and N 2 O emission. Based on a field experiment, two-forms (NH 4 CI and NaNO 3) and two levels (40 and 120 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) of N were applied in the subtropical plantation forest of southern China. <b>Soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 and N 2 O fluxes, the abundance and structure of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities were measured using static chamber-gas chromatography, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Nitrogen addition tended to inhibit <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake, but significantly promoted soil N 2 O emission; moreover, these impacts were more significant with NH 4 + N than with NO 3 - - N addition. NH 4 CI addition significantly changed ammonia-oxidizer abundance with an increase in AOA and a decrease in AOB. Nitrogen additions significantly decreased the relative abundance of 329 bp and 421 bp of archaeal amoA gene. Negative relationships occurred between <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake and AOA abundance and between <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake and AOA/AOB ratio; however, a positive relationship was found between soil N 2 O emission and AOA abundance. These results indicate that a shift in abundance and composition of ammonia-oxidizing communities is closely linked to changes in <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 Uptake and N 2 O emission under N enrichment.

30|$|Due to {{variation}} in the experimental setup (e.g., pot size and growth duration), different aboveground biomasses were harvested ranging from 4 to 36  g per plant in the negative control treatment (P 0, BE 0). The different increases due to TSP addition (TSP, BE 0) indicated that soils had varying initial fertility levels (Figs.  1, 2) with the Czech soils (Humpolec and Lukavec) being the less depleted in P. Plants growing in the Vörden (DE), the Taastrup (DK), and, to a lesser extent, in the Castel (IT) soil, were obviously P limited (increase between 2 - to fivefold due to TSP addition), while the plants in the Buus (<b>CH)</b> <b>soil</b> showed a moderate P increase (1.6 -fold). The same response to TSP addition was observed with spring wheat with the Vörden and Taastrup soils [45], where a similar experimental setup was used. The Taastrup soil originates from a long-term field trial where no nutrients have been added for approximately 50  years [46], thereby explaining the response to application of easily available P sources. The Castel soil was taken from an alkaline site where native P is largely bound in calcium complexes. The Buus soil is from an organic field site where the plant available P fraction is indeed low (P CAL =  6.5  mg P/kg), but with a large organic P fraction (data not shown) which likely contributed to P supply during the experiment causing a moderate response to TSP addition.|$|E

40|$|Legumes {{and other}} forages may contain higher {{concentrations}} of minerals than ryegrass (Marley et al 2013), which {{may help to}} develop sustainable approaches to the management of these nutrients within agricultural systems. There has been extensive work {{on the effects of}} previous legume crops on N utilisation by a subsequent cereal crop but there have been fewer studies on other minerals essential to crop health. Cultivation is known to change the availability of nutrients within soil, with previous research showing differences amongst cultivation techniques in their effects (Canell et al 1980). Here, a study examined the effects of previous forage crops on the yield and mineral concentration of the grain and straw from a spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) crop followed by a winter barley (Hordeum vulgare) crop. Four replicate plots (12 m x 7. 5 m) of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), chicory (Ch) (Cichorium intybus), red clover (RC) (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (WC) (Trifolium repens) forages were established as pure swards in June 2009 in a randomised block design. Forages were harvested five times per annum during 2010 - 2012 and forage removed. Ryegrass plots received either low nitrogen (LowN PRG) or nitrogen at a rate of 200 kg N ha- 1 year- 1 (HighN PRG) and chicory plots received nitrogen at a rate of 200 kg N ha- 1 year- 1. Soil samples taken prior to wheat establishment showed no effect of previous forage cropping on soil pH or ammonium-N, P, Ca, Mg, Na, B, Cu or Zn concentrations. Soil nitrate-N concentrations were significantly lower in both PRG treatments when compared with WC and <b>Ch.</b> <b>Soil</b> K concentrations was significantly lower in both PRG treatments when compared with <b>Ch.</b> <b>Soil</b> Mn concentration was lower where Ch was grown compared to PRG. Forages were killed-off using a non-selective herbicide in spring 2013 before each plot was split and wheat was established either after ploughing (Pl) or by direct drilling (DD). On 5 April, spring wheat (cv. Tybalt) was sown on all plots using a Duncan Ecoseeder at a rate of 253 kg ha- 1. Fertiliser was applied at a rate of 176 kg N, 31 kg P 2 O 5, 105 kg K 2 O and 58 kg SO 3 ha- 1. Prilled lime was applied at 370 kg ha- 1. Plots were harvested on 29 August, using a Sampo harvester and the grain and straw removed. On 15 October, winter barley (cv. Pearl) was established, at a sowing rate of 196 kg ha- 1, using the same two establishment methodologies and plan used previously for wheat establishment. The following spring, fertiliser was applied to the barley at a rate of 132 kg N, 66 kg P 2 O 5, 97 kg K 2 O and 24 kg SO 3 ha- 1. Prilled lime was applied at 370 kg ha- 1. Plots were harvested on the 15 July 2014, using a Sampo harvester, with grain and straw removed. For both wheat and barley, grain and straw yield were assessed. Grain and straw mineral analysis was conducted by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy. N & S were determined by the Dumas Technique. Data were analysed by ANOVA as a split plot using Genstat? 11. 1. Multiple comparisons were based on Bonferroni adjusted LSDs. In the first cereal harvest (spring wheat) after each forage treatment, there was no effect of previous forage (PF) treatment on wheat grain or straw yield. Establishment method (EM) had no effect on straw yield (6344 and 6328 kg DM ha- 1 for DD and Pl treatments respectively) but DD resulted in a significantly higher grain yield when compared to Pl (P= 0. 032) (6936 and 6640 kg DM ha- 1 respectively). PF affected the total mineral offtake of N, P, Mg and S in the subsequent wheat crop as grain and straw. Offtake of N, Mg and S was significantly higher following WC when compared with HighN PRG. Offtake of P was significantly higher following LowN PRG when compared with RC. N offtake from Pl treatment was significantly higher than DD (P= 0. 016) (199. 7 and 193. 2 kg ha- 1 respectively). K offtake was significantly higher from DD treatment compared to Pl treatment (P= 0. 002) (83. 6 and 73. 9 kg ha- 1 respectively). Cu offtake was significantly higher from DD treatment compared to Pl treatment (P= 0. 004) (47. 8 and 45. 6 g ha- 1 respectively). By the second cereal harvest (winter barley), barley grain yield was not affected by PF but straw yield was significantly higher following Ch when compared to RC (6634 and 5904 kg DM ha- 1 respectively) with LowN PRG, HighN PRG and WC intermediate. EM had no effect on straw yield (6214 and 6251 kg DM ha- 1 for DD and Pl treatments respectively), nor overall grain yield (9012 and 9202 kg DM ha- 1 for DD and Pl treatments, respectively). The Pl Ch treatment had a significantly higher grain yield than DD Ch (9304 and 8685 kg DM ha- 1 respectively). PF had no effect on macro mineral offtake as barley straw and grain. Pl resulted in a significantly higher Cu offtake when compared with DD (P= 0. 014) (49. 1 and 46. 9 g ha- 1 respectively). The findings of this study confirm previous work showing the effects of previous forages on N uptake and utilisation by a subsequent cereal crop and also the extent to which other minerals are affected by cropping rotations and cultivation methods. These findings have started to unravel some of these effects to enable the development of more sustainable approaches to the management of these nutrients within agricultural systems.

This terrestrial CH 4 sink may contribute towards climate change mitigation, but the impact of changing soil moisture and temperature regimes on CH 4 uptake is not well understood in all ecosystems. Soils in temperate forest ecosystems are the greatest terrestrial CH 4 sink globally. Under predicted climate change scenarios, temperate eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia are predicted to experience rapid and extreme changes in rainfall patterns, temperatures and wild fires.

40|$|Abstract]: Ipswich City {{is located}} in {{south-east}} Queensland and is underlain by predominantly impermeable subsoils which cause periodic subsurface water-logging and typically classified as expansive, <b>CH</b> and MH <b>soils.</b> Council has battled with effective pavement design and construction due to poor subgrade behaviour. Unbound pavements are historically the dominant design used in Ipswich and are typically based on the AUSTROADS and Department of Transport and Main Roads manuals and experience. The subgrade of any foundation {{plays an important role}} in load bearing and support of traffic and pavement construction over expansive clays requires a suitable working platform to enable machinery to operate. Studies show the use of safe bearing capacity for subgrade assessment does not suit <b>CH</b> <b>soils.</b> Subgrade treatment needs to be a mandatory consideration coupled with using the lowest CBR readings to provide the maximum pavement thickness. The most effective method of subgrade treatment currently appears to be geosynthetics placed on the subgrade. The latest Austroads and Department of Transport and Main Roads manuals align with current world best practice for pavement design and it is recommended the latest versions continue to be used for new pavements. The Ipswich Planning Scheme Policy should refer directly to these documents and be specific for Ipswich soils, i. e. the greater depth pavement should be chosen based on a low CBR value and realistic design ESA's number. On expansive soils, a flexible surface should be constructed on an impermeable membrane or layer since flexible bases experience fatigue which can be easily maintained whereas rigid bases can crack rapidly and to the detriment of the entire foundation. Identification of the cause of pavement failure is necessary to determine the appropriate rehabilitation method for a failed pavement.

However, changes in <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 flux related to such disturbances are still rarely studied even though WF frequency is predicted to increase {{as a consequence of}} global climate change. We measured in-situ soil-atmosphere CH 4 exchange along a wet sclerophyll eucalypt forest regeneration chronosequence in Tasmania, Australia, where the time since the last severe fire or harvesting disturbance ranged from 9 to > 200 years. On all sampling occasions, mean CH 4 uptake increased from most recently disturbed sites (9 year) to sites at stand 'maturity' (44 and 76 years). In stands > 76 years since disturbance, we observed a decrease in <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake. A similar age dependency of potential CH 4 oxidation for three soil layers (0. 0 - 0. 05, 0. 05 - 0. 10, 0. 10 - 0. 15 m) could be observed on incubated soils under controlled laboratory conditions. The differences in <b>soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake between forest stands of different age were predominantly driven by differences in soil moisture status, which affected the diffusion of atmospheric CH 4 into the soil. The observed soil moisture pattern was likely driven by changes in interception or evapotranspiration with forest age, which have been well described for similar eucalypt forest systems in south-eastern Australia. Our results imply that there is a large amount of variability in CH 4 uptake at a landscape scale that can be attributed to stand age and soil moisture differences.

We measured soil-atmosphere exchange of methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in remnant forest, pasture and viticulture systems in four seasons, as well as differences in soil C density and the C density of remnant forest vegetation. This approach enabled comparative assessment of likely changes in ecosystem C density and soil non-CO 2 greenhouse gas exchange along a LUC continuum since European settlement. <b>Soil</b> <b>CH</b> 4 uptake was moderate in forest soil (- 27 μg C m(- 2) h(- 1)), and significantly different to occasionally large CH 4 emissions from viticulture and pasture soils.

However, there was a net decrease in ecosystem C density with forest conversion to pasture. Concurrently, net soil non-CO 2 emissions (CH 4 and N 2 O combined) increased with conversion from forest to pasture.

Soil temperature and moisture at the 10 cm depth were simultaneously measured with the greenhouse gas measurements. Inorganic N (NH 4 + -N and NO 3 − -N) in the 0 – 10 cm was determined monthly. From north to south, annual mean CO 2 emission ranged from 18. 09 ± 0. 22 to 35. 40 ± 2. 24 Mg CO 2 ha − 1 yr − 1 and annual mean CH 4 uptake ranged from 0. 04 ± 0. 11 to 5. 15 ± 0. 96 kg CH 4 ha − 1 yr − 1 in the four old-growth forests. Soil CO 2 flux in the old-growth forests was mainly driven by soil temperature, followed by soil moisture and NO 3 − -N.
