5|$|L. decemlineata is {{an iconic}} species {{and has been}} used as an image on stamps because of its {{association}} with the recent history of both North America and Europe. For example, in 1956, Romania issued a set of four stamps <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the campaign against insect pests and it was featured on a 1967 stamp issued in Austria. The beetle also appeared on stamps issued in Benin, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, and Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|Whether playing Dixieland, bebop, or avant-garde jazz, in big bands or {{in small}} groups, Manne's self-professed goal {{was to make the}} music swing. His fellow musicians attested to his {{listening}} appreciatively to those around him and being ultra-sensitive to the needs and the nuances of the music played by the others in the band, his goal being to make themand the music as a wholesound better, rather than <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> himself with overbearing solos.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{sales of}} private {{underground}} blast shelters increased noticeably after 2009, with many construction companies' advertisements <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the 2012 apocalypse. In Michigan, schools were {{closed for the}} Christmas holidays two days early, in part because rumours of the 2012 apocalypse were raising fears of repeat shootings similar to that at Sandy Hook. American reality TV stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt revealed that they {{had spent most of}} their $10 million of accumulated earnings by 2010 because they believed the world would end in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The pilot episode, {{which was}} filmed {{over a period}} of 21 days, served as the basis for {{additional}} tweaking of intended story lines. Long creative discussions took place among the writers and the network, leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months. One major change was the addition of extra material for Brother Justin's side of the story. Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well-established preacher, and as a recurring character rather than a regular one. However, after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that {{there was no room for}} Justin to grow in a television series. Hence, it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a small town, setting him back in his career by about one or two years. Expanding Brother Justin's role opened new possibilities, and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for the addition of the cootch (striptease) family; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., by the 1950s, the NAACP {{had begun}} <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> such portrayals of African Americans and mounted a {{campaign}} {{to put an end}} to blackface performances and depictions.

25|$|The names {{reported}} for dead animals {{do not follow}} this pattern. <b>Calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> a dead zebra, for example, uses the form hantaii (masculine hantaee, plural (rare) hataetee and hantaitchii). This is because these forms are not nouns, but imperative verbs; the morphology is clearer in the imperative plural, when addressing more than one person: hantatate, hantâte, hantaetate, hantaitchate (substitute -si for final -te when addressing only men; see below for the verbal object suffixes -ta-, -a-, -eta-, -itcha-).|$|E
25|$|Statistics {{on poverty}} in the kingdom are not {{available}} through the UN resources because the Saudi government does not issue any.

Authors of the video claim that 22% of Saudis may be considered poor (2009). Observers researching the issue prefer to stay anonymous {{because of the risk}} of being arrested.|$|E
