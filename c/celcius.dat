Methods: Twenty patients with primary hyperhidrosis were observed and treated in a standardized setting against a control group (n = 10). We obtained diverse data that permit determination of a point of time of measurement of surface temperature and definition of a degree of temperature variance.

Two independent methods are used: simulations with the ECHAM 4 atmospheric general circulation model and reconstructions based on geological and palaeoecological data. In both climatic transitions, January temperatures increased {{by as much as}} 20 degrees <b>Celcius</b> from - 25 degrees a - 15 degrees <b>Celcius</b> to - 5 degrees a + 5 degrees <b>Celcius.</b> During July the changes were smaller: temperatures increased on the average by 3 - 5 degrees from 10 degrees - 15 degrees <b>Celcius</b> to 13 - 17 degrees <b>Celcius</b> during both warming phases. In both transitions an increase in precipitation was balanced by a comparable increase in evapotranspiration so that the effective precipitation remained rather stable or increased slightly. The strong increase in January temperatures was forced by changes in the N Atlantic Ocean, as the variations in sea surface temperatures and the position of the sea ice margin determined the temperature change over land. The increase in July temperatures was mainly driven by the small increase in insolation and the deglaciation of Scotland and Scandinavia. The latter effects were much less than the changes in the N Atlantic Ocean. In addition, the magnitude of the two climate shifts was geographically changing as a result of different distances to the Atlantic Ocean and the land ice. Moreover, the timing of the major warming phases is spatially different, as this timing is mainly determined by the relative distance to the sea ice and land ice margins...|$|E

However, this device is unique, not clinically available and unable to provide information other than temperature. The 0. 014 -inch Radi PressureWire XT (RPW) contains a high-sensitivity thermistor in the sensor that has a sensitivity of 0. 1 degrees <b>Celcius.</b> We evaluated the ability of the RPW to detect an increase in plaque temperature in patients with ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with ACS and a culprit lesion of > 70 % stenosis and who were candidates for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were eligible (n = 20). Fractional flow reserve (FFR) post-adenosine administration and temperature estimations were performed prior to PCI. All demographic data are presented as mean +/- SD, and temperature data (using delta temperature from baseline) as mean +/- SEM. Fifteen men and 5 women were enrolled (age 59. 5 +/- 11. 6 years). The FFR pre-PCI was 0. 65 +/- 0. 06, consistent with hemodynamically significant stenoses. The baseline delta temperature was 0. 00 +/- 0. 01 degrees <b>Celcius.</b> The delta temperature at the culprit lesion was - 0. 02 +/- 0. 01 degrees <b>Celcius</b> (p = NS), a result below the resolution of the thermistor.

In particular, the coherence time of kilometer-long, fiber-based networks is analyzed. Joint measurements of the phase noise of parallel links to the same site (intra-site) and to different sites (inter-site) in such a network are presented. The coherence time of the phase noise and phase noise difference between links is evaluated {{by means of the}} Allan time deviation. Measurements are performed at a frequency of 2. 3 GHz under both stationary and non-stationary temperature conditions, for a duration of ten hours. In the setup analyzed, the phase noise was found to be white, with a phase drift component that determines the coherence time of the link. Coherence times between two to six minutes have been measured for a phase offset of 10 degrees <b>Celcius.</b> Values of the correlation coefficient r for intra-site phase noise processes higher than 0. 99 have been measured, while correlation coefficients for inter-site links exhibit lower values, r > 0. 87. All phase noise processes display a strong, negative correlation with the local environment temperature, with r <- 0. 75 and temperature drift coefficients in the range of - 20 $ degrees to - 30 degrees per <b>Celcius</b> degree. On the other hand, phase noise difference between links showed weak correlation with temperature, where coherence times were in the order of 15 minutes for inter-site links and 60 minutes for intra-site links. Moreover, it was found that hardware imbalances between links, as well as temperature gradients of several <b>Celcius</b> degrees per hour can considerably reduce coherence times. The results of this investigation suggest that, when parallel fiber optic links are used, the phase coherence of the measurement system might prevent the double-directional characterization of the wireless propagation channel, unless care is taken to minimize variations in the (distributed) temperature environment.

The precipitation behaviors were investgated on Gleeble 3500 thermo-mechanical simulator under the humid air with water vaour content of 19. 5 per vol percent. Several types of magnetite precipitates were examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The tribological properties of magnetite precipitates were investigated in pin-on-disc configuration. It was found that the dispersed magnetite particles originate from either the pro-eutectoid precipitation above 570 degrees <b>celcius</b> or the partical decomposition of wustite below 570 degrees <b>celcius.</b> The oxide film on the presence of free particles durin g eutectoid precipitation could be a lubricant and consequently resist wear, particularly for the oxide scale with a typical thickness in the range of 8 to 11 um in dry ai and moisture atmosphere. Furthermore, characterisation and precipitation process of the oxide scale are discussed, with respect to a probable mechanism to explain the lubricated properties has been proposed...|$|E
40|$|Limited water {{resources}} in Southern Utah with the competing interests {{of humans and}} native fishes require careful management. High instream temperatures resulting from low flows are a consideration in managing the Virgin River for two endangered fish species. Throughout these periods, fish behavior changes have been observed during those high turbidity. One hypothesis was that high turbidity decreased the amount of solar radiation {{in the water column}} due to increased reflection at the water surface resulting in reduced instream temperatures. To quantify the extent of changes in incoming energy to the river, a water tank was constructed to measure the effects of turbidity on solar radiation reflection off the water surface and attenuation with depth. We found that increases in turbidity led to a linear increase in solar radiation reflection for specific turbidity ranges. We also found that attenuation of solar radiation increased linearly as turbidity increased for specific turbidity ranges. The effects of turbidity on solar radiation behavior were translated into changes in instream temperatures through the use of an instream temperature model. The results indicated during summer low flow conditions that turbidity increases from 30 - 500 NTU decreased instream temperatures 1 degree <b>Celcius</b> on average with maximum increases of 2 degrees <b>Celcius...</b>|$|E
