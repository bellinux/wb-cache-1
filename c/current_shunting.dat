This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} publisher. The-patterns of electrical resistance and capacitance in the cochlea formed by the anatomical organisation of the tissue structures and fluids are important in determining the distribution of electrical potentials which arise during normal acoustic stimulation (von Bekesy, 1951). Cochlear potential distributions have in the past been measured by recording from the scalar fluids both the spread of cochlear microphonics and also potentials due to electrical stimulation. However, similar distributions in the hair cell-nerve ending region of the organ of Corti may not necessarily occur because of <b>current</b> <b>shunting</b> effects due to the electrical network patterns. To examine these <b>current</b> <b>shunting</b> effects, a three dimensional mathematical model of the electrical properties of the cat cochlea was constructed. This was formed from a two dimensional cochlear cross-section model similar to that proposed by Johnstone et al., (1966) for the guinea pig. Sixteen such sections were resistively coupled to form the three dimensional model. Results derived from this model predict that during electrical stimulation of the cochlea, the current in the organ of Corti region attenuates quite differently to the scalar voltage by a degree which depends on the stimulus electrode configuration. 17 - 19 August 1978 Open Acces...|$|E

BACKGROUND A minimally invasive cochlear implantation is enabled by image-guided and robotic-assisted drilling of an access tunnel to the middle ear cavity. The approach requires the drill to pass at distances below 1  mm from the facial nerve and thus safety mechanisms for protecting this critical structure are required. Neuromonitoring is currently used to determine facial nerve proximity in mastoidectomy but lacks sensitivity and specificity necessaries to effectively distinguish the close distance ranges experienced in the minimally invasive approach, possibly because of <b>current</b> <b>shunting</b> of uninsulated stimulating drilling tools in the drill tunnel and because of nonoptimized stimulation parameters. To this end, we propose an advanced neuromonitoring approach using varying levels of stimulation parameters together with an integrated bipolar and monopolar stimulating probe. MATERIALS AND METHODS An in vivo study (sheep model) was conducted in which measurements at specifically planned and navigated lateral distances from the facial nerve were performed to determine if specific sets of stimulation parameters {{in combination}} with the proposed neuromonitoring system could reliably detect an imminent collision with the facial nerve.

Such a model has already been used [Tan et al., J. Appl. Phys. 102, 103703 (2007) ], maintaining that, in general, it leads to a failure distribution described by a gamma mixture, and that as a result, this type of distribution (rather than a lognormal) should be used as a prior in any Bayesian mode fitting and subsequent reliability budgeting. Although it appears that the model is able to produce reasonably realistic resistance curves R(t), we are unable to find any evidence that the failure distribution is a simple gamma mixture except under contrived conditions. The distributions generated are largely sums of exponentials (phase-type distributions), convolutions of gamma distributions with different scales, or roughly normal. We note also some inconsistencies in the derivation of the gamma mixture in the work cited above and conclude that, as it stands, the Markov chain model is probably unsuitable for electromigration modeling and a change from lognormal to gamma mixture distribution generally cannot be justified in this way.

With the {{worldwide}} energy demand projected to increase in the coming years, it is vital to find alternative and renewable energy sources. Among the available renewable energy sources, solar energy is the most promising in meeting the worldwide energy demand. Recently, thin film solar cells have garnered attention due to their thinner architecture and relatively high optical absorption coefficients, as opposed to the conventional crytslline silicon solar cells. One of the most promising thin-film solar cell absorber materials is Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGSe), achieving power conversion efficiencies approaching those of crystalline Si. The highest efficiency CIGSe devices were made via costly vacuum-based co-evaporation process. CIGSe devices made from solution-processed methods have also garnered attention due to their lower costs, and their efficiencies have increased considerably in recent years. In this thesis, CIGSe absorber layers are fabricated via the solution-processed from nanoparticle-based sulfide CIGS. The most important step in fabrication of a CIGSe solar cell absorber layer is the selenization step, which is the thermal sintering of a CIGSe precursor layer in the presence of selenium vapor to achieve large, dense selenide grains that are required for adequate PV performance. It is determined that maintaining adequate selenium vapor pressure on the substrate during the selenization and subsequent cooldown is crucial in producing high efficiency solar cell devices. Furthermore, exposing the CIGSe grains to a Se-deficient atmosphere causes Se to evaporate from the grains, and subsequently modifying the CIGSe grain surface. The modified grain surface adversely impacts the PV performance of the final solar cell device by forming defects due to the decrease in selenium concentration. These defects are manifested in increased <b>current</b> <b>shunting,</b> and decrease the overall efficiency of the device...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONSynthesis, {{characterization}} {{and utility}} of carbon nanotube based hybrid sensors in bioanalytical applicationsbySushmee BadhulikaDoctor of Philosophy, Department of Electrical EngineeringUniversity of California, Riverside, USAProf. Ashok Mulchandani, ChairpersonThe detection of gaseous analytes and biological molecules is of prime {{importance in the}} fields of environmental pollution control, food and water - safety and analysis, and medical diagnostics. This necessitates the development of advanced and improved technology that is reliable, inexpensive and suitable for high volume production. The conventional sensors available for catering to these needs are often traditional thin film based sensors which lack sensitivity due to the phenomena of <b>current</b> <b>shunting</b> across the charge depleted region when an analyte binds with them. Thus one dimensional nanostructures are heralded for wide applications which apart from eliminating the <b>current</b> <b>shunting</b> due to their one dimensional geometries also facilitate device miniaturization and low power operations. Carbon nanotubes are a class of popularly known one dimensional nanostructures that exhibit excellent electronic and mechanical properties. Their properties of small size, high strength, high electrical and thermal conductivity and high specific area have resulted in their wide spread applications in sensor technology. However, to overcome the issue of low sensitivity of pristine carbon nanotubes and to widen their scope, efforts have been made to configure hybrid devices that combine the properties of carbon nanotubes along with other materials like metals, metal oxides, conducting polymers etc. Conducting polymers exhibit electronic, magnetic and optical properties of metals and semiconductors while retaining the attractive mechanical properties and processing advantages of polymers. Their high chemical sensitivity, room temperature operation and tunable charge transport properties has made them ideal for use as tranducing materials in chemical sensors. In this dissertation, various applications of carbon nanotube based hybrid devices such as CNT-conducting polymer and graphene-CNT based sensors have been demonstrated. Electrochemical polymerization enabled the synthesis of CPs and metal nanoparticles in a simple and efficient way on the surface of carbon nanotube based platforms thus resulting in the fabrication of hybrid devices exhibiting superior properties. In the first study towards demonstrating the synergistic behavior of the hybrid devices, PEDOT: PSS was electropolymerized on the surface of SWNTs and their response towards volatile organic compounds was evaluated. In terms of performance, when compared with bare SWNTs, these hybrid sensors exhibited better sensitivity over a wide dynamic range of concentrations of saturated vapors of VOCs. The second application involved electrodeposition of Polyaniline boronic acid on SWNTs by charge controlled electrochemical polymerization and their subsequent evaluation as chemiresistive sensors towards detection of D-fructose and D-glucose. The regeneration of the sensors based {{on the basis of the}} reversible nature of the binding between PABA and 1, 2 or 1, 3 -diols at lower values of pH was also studied. These enzyme free sensors exhibited a limit of detection of 2. 92 mM for D-fructose and 3. 46 mM for D-glucose. Molecular imprinting of conducting polymers (MICPs) is a very versatile technique that is used towards detecting biological entities such as receptors, enzymes, and antibodies with high specificity. A self-doped, molecularly imprinted conducting polymer (MICP) on aligned SWNTs surface has also been discussed which displayed better sensitivity towards D-fructose. Imprinting imparts higher selectivity towards D-fructose over D-glucose by template directed formation of imprinted cavities that are of same chemical nature in terms of shape, size and functionality as D-fructose. In the next study, nonenzymatic glucose sensor based on Platinum nanoflowers on multi-walled carbon nanotube-graphene hybrid has been developed. The hybrid sensor was synthesized of Carbon nanotube (MWNT) / graphene hybrid by one step chemical vapor deposition process and electrodeposition of high surface area platinum nanoflowers.

The <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> was realized through the implantation of a customized conduction electrode. After surgery, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for two hours for each rat under anesthesia. Subsequently, the rats were video monitored for 72 h to detect the occurrence of behavioral seizures upon awakening. The average number and duration of seizures on EEG and the number of behavioral seizures were measured. RESULTS: In KA model, the number of total EEG seizures in conduction group (9. 57 ± 2. 46) was significantly less than that in sham conduction group (15. 13 ± 3. 45) (p< 0. 01). The duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (26. 13 ± 7. 81 s) was significantly shorter than that in sham conduction group (34. 17 ± 7. 25 s) (p =  0. 001). A significant reduction of behavioral seizures was observed in the conduction group compared with KA (p =  0. 000) and sham conduction groups (p =  0. 000). In penicillin model, there was a 61 % reduction in total EEG seizures in conduction group compared with sham conduction group (p< 0. 01), and the duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (6. 29 ± 2. 64 s) was significantly shorter than that in the sham conduction group (12. 07 ± 3. 81 s) (p =  0. 002).

They are useful tools for stroke research and may be potential adjunct therapies for functional recovery. However, stroke often causes large cerebral lesions, which are commonly accompanied by a secondary enlargement of the ventricles and atrophy. These structural alterations substantially change the conductivity distribution inside the head, which may have potentially important consequences for both brain stimulation methods. We therefore aimed to characterize the impact of these changes on the spatial distribution of the electric field generated by both TBS methods. In addition to confirming the safety of TBS in the presence of large stroke-related structural changes, our aim was to clarify whether targeted stimulation is still possible. Realistic head models containing large cortical and subcortical stroke lesions in the right parietal cortex were created using MR images of two patients. For TMS, the electric field of a double coil was simulated using the finite-element method. Systematic variations of the coil position relative to the lesion were tested. For TDCS, the finite-element method was used to simulate a standard approach with two electrode pads, and the position of one electrode was systematically varied. For both TMS and TDCS, the lesion caused electric field "hot spots" in the cortex. However, these maxima were not substantially stronger than those seen in a healthy control. The electric field pattern induced by TMS was not substantially changed by the lesions. However, the average field strength generated by TDCS was substantially decreased. This effect occurred for both head models and even when both electrodes were distant to the lesion, caused by increased <b>current</b> <b>shunting</b> through the lesion and enlarged ventricles. Judging from the similar peak field strengths compared to the healthy control, both TBS methods are safe in patients with large brain lesions (in practice, however, additional factors such as potentially lowered thresholds for seizure-induction have to be considered). Focused stimulation by TMS seems to be possible, but standard tDCS protocols appear to be less efficient than they are in healthy subjects, strongly suggesting that tDCS studies in this population might benefit from individualized treatment planning based on realistic field calculations...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents an}} experimental investigation quantifying {{the degree of}} azimuthal correlation between ablating wire cores in wire array Z-pinch loads, {{as well as a}} theoretical and experimental investigation of the disruptive magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability that affects wire array and magnetized fusion concepts. Two experimental configurations were used to investigate correlated ablation between Z-pinch wire cores. The first configuration spaced wires 240 μm apart, a representative spacing for wire array loads fielded on the 26 MA “Z-Machine” at Sandia National Laboratories. The second configuration spaced wires 2. 47 mm apart or greater, a representative spacing for ~ 1 MA university scale accelerators. The closely-spaced wires were found to ablate in a strongly correlated manner in both real space and in spatial frequency space. The widely-spaced wires were found to ablate with a similar spatial frequency mode structure, but these modes did not lock in phase. Azimuthal <b>current</b> <b>shunting</b> and magnetic compression are two possible physical mechanisms for the observed correlation when the wires were spaced closely together. A generalized theoretical treatment of the MRT instability is presented for a planar geometry containing three regions using the ideal magnetohydrodynamic model. Magnetic fields parallel to the interfaces with parallel orientations are included. The densities and magnetic field magnitudes for each region are arbitrary. The generalized dispersion relation, growth rates, feed-through factors, stability conditions, and anisotropy effects are presented. The pressure may originate from an arbitrary combination of kinetic and magnetic pressures. Instability modes with wavevectors parallel to the magnetic field experience a stabilization effect from magnetic tension, whereas modes with wavevectors perpendicular to the magnetic field are unaffected. MRT growth was experimentally investigated using laser images of planar foil loads on the MAIZE facility at the University of Michigan. The construction of this 1 MA linear transformer driver (LTD) facility is documented, as well as experimental measurements of MRT growth on 400 nm aluminum targets. The foil was placed between two current return plates and the position varied to adjust foil acceleration. The measured e-folding times were approximately 100 ns for all cases, approximately 5. 6 x above theoretical predictions due to plasma expansion...|$|E
40|$|Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) {{has been}} used to treat various mental and {{neurological}} illnesses. Rodent models have been used to examine physiological changes in the brain after tDCS, as well as to develop safety standards. However, most animal tDCS studies implant an electrode on the brain, potentially altering the path of current during stimulation. Additionally, no studies have been completed specifically examining maximum safe anodal tDCS limits, and a pilot study conducted to determine an electrode montage to examine biological changes of learning and memory from anodal tDCS indicated brain lesion was occurring before a commonly cited lesion threshold of 142. 9 A/m 2. Therefore, the goal {{of this study was to}} examine both the effects of anodal tDCS and the rodent 2 ̆ 7 s scalp on <b>current</b> <b>shunting</b> during anodal tDCS in vivo. Anodal tDCS was applied to the skull of 35 anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats for 60 minutes after they were divided into groups either receiving stimulation with an electrode on the skull or scalp tissue. Within each skull and scalp electrode placement group, rats were further separated into groups by tDCS current intensity (µA) received, which was: sham (n= 4), 150 µA (n= 4), 300 µA (n= 4), 500 µA (n= 3), 1, 000 µA (n= 4), and 2, 500 µA (n= 3) for the skull electrode placement group. For the scalp electrode placement groups, only stimulations that induced lesion during the skull electrode stimulation were chosen: sham iv Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. 88 ABW Cleared 11 / 09 / 2015; 88 ABW- 2015 - 5473. (n= 2), 500 µA (n= 3), 1, 000 µA (n= 3), and 2, 500 µA (n= 3). Brain lesion was quantified using an Olympus BX- 63 microscope with Q 100 Blue Camera and CellSens software, which showed brain lesion during skull electrode placement first occurring at 500 uA, having a lesion volume of 0. 168 mm 3. At 1, 000 µA and 2, 500 µA, the average brain lesion within groups was 6. 363 mm 3 and 13. 013 mm 3, respectively. Stimulation of the scalp showed no brain lesion at any of the stimulation groups, suggesting the scalp tissue shunts a portion of the current, and as a result, has different physiological effects on brain lesion development...|$|E
