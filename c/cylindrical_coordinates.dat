40|$|A <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinate</b> {{colour space}} (lightness, saturation/chroma, hue) {{is derived from}} an {{opponent}} colour space in the RGB space. It is shown how <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinate</b> colour models widely used in the literature are related to or {{can be reduced to}} the derived model, thereby contributing to creating a unified <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinate</b> colour model. In particular, the widely used saturation expression max(R, G, B) − min(R, G, B) is derived from the proposed model. Properties of the derived chroma and saturation expressions are examined. Finally, some applications of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinate</b> colour spaces are briefly reviewed...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two common}} methods for {{extending}} the polar coordinate system to three dimensions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new full-vectorial finite-element method {{in a local}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system, to effectively analyze bending losses in photonic wires. The discretization is performed in the cross section of a three-dimensional curved waveguide, using hybrid edge/nodal elements.

This approach is used to evaluate bending losses in silicon wire waveguides.
