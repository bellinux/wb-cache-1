40|$|Current {{cellular}} {{technologies are}} based on the concept of <b>coherent</b> <b>communication,</b> in which the channel matrix used for demodulation is estimated via reference or pilot signals. Coherent systems involve a significant increase of the signaling overhead, either when the number of Transmission Points (TP) is increased, due to the use of Coordinated Multipoint transmission/reception (CoMP) with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) processing, or when mobile channel changes rapidly.

Both drawbacks of <b>coherent</b> <b>communication</b> motivate the use of non-coherent techniques.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} practical communication over a doubly selective (DS) channel, i. e., a time and frequency selective channel. The problem is approached in two different ways: <b>coherent</b> <b>communication</b> and noncoherent communication, and for each communication scheme we propose practical and near-optimal equalizers and maximum-diversity precoders. Toward these ends, we adopt 1) basis expansion (BE) modeling of the channel, which allows for an efficient and unified way of describing a DS channel in both time and frequency domain; and 2) tree-search algorithms (TSAs), which facilitate near-optimal performance with low complexity. For practical <b>coherent</b> <b>communication,</b> {{we focus on the}} pulse-shaped (PS) multicarrier modulation (MCM), where controlled inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and intercarrier-interference (ICI) can be leveraged for computationally efficient receiver structures.

40|$|The {{availability}} of high-speed digital-to-Analog converters for <b>coherent</b> optical <b>communication</b> systems {{makes it possible}} to digitally divide the available electrical bandwidth into subchannels on each optical carrier which enables a parallel implementation of the digital signal processing. In this paper, we use electrical multicarrier offset-QAM modulations to achieve crosstalk-free modulation for subcarriers spaced at the symbol rate. We show that in <b>coherent</b> optical <b>communication</b> systems, several impairments are bound to break the subcarrier orthogonality and cause failures of payload symbol recovering. We propose a dedicated digital signal processing architecture which implements channel estimation and a new algorithm to track the phase in multicarrier offset-QAM modulation.

40|$|Recently, we {{proposed}} a simultaneous quantum and classical communication (SQCC) protocol, where random numbers for quantum key distribution (QKD) and bits for classical communication are encoded on the same weak coherent pulse, and decoded by the same coherent receiver. Such a scheme could be appealing in practice since a single <b>coherent</b> <b>communication</b> system {{can be used for}} multiple purposes. However, previous studies show that the SQCC protocol can only tolerate very small phase noise. This makes it incompatible with the <b>coherent</b> <b>communication</b> scheme using a true local oscillator (LO), which presents a relatively high phase noise {{due to the fact that}} the signal and the LO are generated from two independent lasers. In this paper, we improve the phase noise tolerance of the SQCC scheme using a true LO by adopting a refined noise model where phase noises originated from different sources are treated differently: on one hand, phase noise associated with the coherent receiver may be regarded as trusted noise, since the detector can be calibrated locally and the photon statistics of the detected signals can be determined from the measurement results; on the other hand, phase noise due to the instability of fiber interferometers may be regarded as untrusted noise, since its randomness (from the adversary's point to view) is hard to justify. Simulation results show the tolerable phase noise in this refined noise model is significantly higher than that in the previous study where all the phase noises are assumed to be untrusted. We conduct an experiment to show the required phase stability can be achieved in a <b>coherent</b> <b>communication</b> system using a true LO. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|Signal and code {{design for}} {{noncoherent}} communication is {{in a relatively}} primitive state compared to the sophisticated design of <b>coherent</b> <b>communication</b> systems. A major reason for this gap is that, while signal space concepts provide a systematic tool for design and performance evaluation of <b>coherent</b> <b>communication</b> systems, analogous notions were not available for noncoherent systems. In this paper, using the geometric insight obtained by interpreting noncoherent detection as a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), {{we are able to}} provide a systematic design criterion for noncoherent systems in terms of the distances of signal points from the decision boundaries. One result based on this framework is the extension of the notion of differential encoding from PSK to more efficient QAM constellations. Another application is in noncoherent multiple antennae systems. Previously, noncoherent space-time codes were obtained by searching over a space of large dimension, which made it difficult to obtain high rate codes. However, differential coding can be extended to systems with multiple antennas for systematic construction of noncoherent space-time codes with high rates...|$|E
