40|$|Skin {{turbidity}} limits light based {{medical applications}} while increasing {{the risk of}} epidermal thermal injury. Collagen fibers {{are responsible for the}} majority of light scattering within skin. Chemicals, known as <b>clearing</b> agents, reduce tissue light scattering with the potential to increase the efficacy of light based imaging and therapeutic applications. Three hypotheses have been suggested for the <b>clearing</b> mechanism: index of refraction matching between <b>clearing</b> agent and collagen, tissue dehydration, and agent induced collagen structure perturbation. This study investigates optical <b>clearing</b> in skin while presenting a comprehensive <b>clearing</b> mechanism. <b>Clearing</b> was found to be a complex process with thermodynamic and kinetic components. Concentration gradients drive <b>clearing</b> agents to diffuse into skin and remove water. The introduction of <b>clearing</b> agents into the tissue reduces light scatter. The speed of <b>clearing</b> was found to increase with molecular size and number of hydroxyl groups. The molecular modeling program CHARMM suggests collagen affinity {{plays a major role in}} <b>clearing</b> agents? ability to interact with collagen and remove bound water. Collagen solubility is a measure of <b>clearing</b> agent affinity for collagen and was found as a predictor of agent <b>clearing</b> potential. Increasing agent molecular size led to a greater reduction of fibrillogenesis with corresponding high collagen solubility. Raman spectroscopy quantified <b>clearing</b> agent induced dehydration of dermal collagen. <b>Clearing</b> agent ability to dehydrate dermal collagen corresponded with collagen affinity and the ability to <b>clear</b> tissue optically. The most effective <b>clearing</b> agents were found to remove bound water with the greatest efficacy. Replacement of collagen triple helix bound water by <b>clearing</b> agents with an index of refraction similar to collagen optically homogenizes skin tissue leading to a reduction in light scattering. Through dehydration of collagen with concomitant diffusion of <b>clearing</b> agent into collagen, the skin is homogenized leading to a large reduction in tissue light scattering...|$|R
