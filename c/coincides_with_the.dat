5|$|Since exp(1) {{is equal}} to e and exp(x) {{satisfies}} this exponential identity, it immediately follows that exp(x) <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> repeated-multiplication definition of e'x for integer x, and it also follows that rational powers denote (positive) roots as usual, so exp(x) <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> e'x definitions {{in the previous section}} for all real x by continuity.|$|E

5|$|The English name Octopus {{card was}} also {{selected}} from the naming competition.

5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard. This sound generally <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> death of a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, {{the loss of the}} tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Widmouth Head, {{the path}} passes 'The Coastguard Cottages' in Hele Bay {{and enters the}} seaside resort of Ilfracombe, with its small harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the Balmoral, the Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> South West Coast Path.|$|E
5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 years ago, {{explosive}} activity {{occurred at}} Ciomadul. That timespan <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deposition of tephra from volcanoes in Italy in Europe; {{it is possible}} that tephra also came from Ciomadul. Indeed, the age of Ciomadul's last eruption overlaps with the age of the Campanian Ignimbrite. Some tephra layers found in two drilling cores of the Black Sea may have originated at Ciomadul.|$|E

5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda {{has been defined as}} the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 2007, Manitoba {{legislature}} {{passed a}} bill establishing a statutory holiday on the third Monday in February as Louis Riel Day, the same day some other provinces celebrate Family Day, beginning in 2008.

5|$|Seasonal rankings {{were based}} on average total viewers per episode of 24 on Fox. Most U.S. network {{television}} seasons start in mid-September and end in late May, which <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> completion of May sweeps. 24 aired during both February and May sweeps periods {{in all of its}} seasons, and during the November sweeps period in its first three seasons.

5|$|The NZ ETS {{contains}} special {{transitional provisions}} from 1 July 2010 (when fossil emissions enter the scheme) until 31 December 2012 (transition period). This end date <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> end {{date of the}} Kyoto Protocol. Although transitional measures are legislated to end after 2012, the Government has suggested {{that they will be}} extended in the event that major trading partners such as the USA and Australia do not implement emissions trading schemes of their own before then.|$|E
5|$|The Temple of the Warriors bears {{iconography}} depicting feathered serpents {{associated with}} Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This {{means that the}} building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rainy season) may be meaningful. However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.|$|E
5|$|The genera Escherichia and Salmonella diverged around 102 {{million years}} ago (credibility interval: 57–176mya), which <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{divergence}} of their hosts: the former being found in mammals and the latter in birds and reptiles. This {{was followed by a}} split of an Escherichia ancestor into five species (E. albertii, E. coli, E. fergusonii, E. hermannii, and E. vulneris). The last E. coli ancestor split between 20 and 30 {{million years ago}}.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost to forage {{after it is}} already completely dark outside, this <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> general time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. There is also some risk to the greater noctule from parasitism between bats.|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
