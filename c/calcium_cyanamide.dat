50|$|His work in {{the field}} of {{fertilizers}} led {{to the use of the}} fertilizer discovered by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas (Thomasmehl or Albert-Slag). Together with the German-Polish chemist Nikodem Caro, he developed the Frank-Caro process of extracting <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> in 1899, which was the foundation of the nitrogen and <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> fertilizer industry. In the same year those two and a few other businessmen founded Cyanidgesellschaft mbH, which would later become Bayrischen Stickstoff-Werke AG (BStW) in Trostberg.|$|E
50|$|A field {{experiment}} {{on the effects}} of various common agrochemicals (mineral fertilizer, lime and <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide)</b> as well as organic fertilizer (manure) on C. furcata revealed that mineral fertilizer had no direct effect on lichen growth, manure promoted the length of the podetia, and <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> proved to be lethal to C. furcata.

50|$|Calcium carbide is a {{chemical}} compound with the chemical formula of CaC2. Its main use industrially {{is in the}} production of acetylene and <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide.</b>|$|E

50|$|About 1,400 {{people are}} {{employed}} at the Chemiepark Trostberg, a large chemical industrial {{area near the}} town. The two main companies are AlzChem and BASF Bauchemie (construction chemistry). The Chemiepark Trostberg originated from a <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> production plant, founded in 1908. Between 1978 and 2000, the company was called SKW Trostberg AG.|$|E

50|$|Nitroguanidine is {{produced}} commercially by a two step process {{starting with the}} reaction of <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> with ammonium nitrate.

In the second step, the nitrate salt is treated with sulfuric acid, a process that dehydrates the salt and forms the N-N bond.|$|E
50|$|Knapp {{learned of}} calcium carbide (discovered in 1888) in 1894. The colorless {{compound}} {{was used in}} the production of acetylene and <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide.</b> Acetylene was critical to the large and quickly growing steel industry for its use in welding. That year, with Billings, he formed the Union Calcium Carbide Company. Over the next ten years, Knapp focused on getting the business off the ground.|$|E
50|$|Cyanamide is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula CN2H2. This white solid {{is widely used}} in agriculture {{and the production of}} pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. It is also used as an alcohol deterrent drug in Canada, Europe and Japan. The molecule features a nitrile group attached to an amino group. Derivatives of this compound are also referred to as cyanamides, the most common being <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> (CaCN2).|$|E
50|$|The Frank-Caro process, {{also called}} {{cyanamide}} process, is the nitrogen fixation reaction of calcium carbide with nitrogen gas in a reactor vessel at about 1,000°C. The reaction is exothermic and self-sustaining once the reaction temperature is reached. Originally the reaction {{took place in}} large steel cylinders with an electrical resistance element providing initial heat to start the reaction. Modern production uses rotating ovens. The synthesis produces a solid mixture of <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> (CaCN2) and carbon.|$|E
50|$|In 1909, Noguchi {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the Frank-Caro process, whereby atmospheric nitrogen was combined with calcium carbide (a key product of the young company) to produce <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide,</b> a chemical fertilizer. Nitrogenous fertilizers were key to boosting agricultural production in Japan at the time, due to its lack of arable land and the small-scale nature of its farms, so the company found a ready market for its product. Nichitsu also branched out into other products produced from calcium carbide, beginning production of acetic acid, ammonia, explosives and butanol.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} between 1890 and 1900, {{chemistry}} advanced on several fronts, and more scientists attempted to fix atmospheric nitrogen. In 1895, German chemists Adolf Frank and Nikodem Caro succeeded in reacting calcium carbide with dinitrogen to obtain <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide,</b> a chemical compound used as a fertilizer. Industrialization of the Frank-Caro process began in 1905. By 1918, there were 35 synthesis sites fixing 325,000 tonnes of nitrogen annually. However, the Cyanamide process consumed large amounts of electrical power and was more labor-intensive than the Haber process. Today, cyanamide is used primarily as a herbicide.|$|E
50|$|Nikodem Caro (23 May 1871, Łódź, then Russian Empire - 27 June 1935, Rome, Italy) was an {{industrial}} chemist and entrepreneur. Caro {{was born in}} Łódź, and studied chemistry in Berlin at the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg (now Technical University of Berlin) and got his doctorate from Rostock University. From 1895 on {{he worked in the}} Deutsche Dynamit AG with Adolph Frank on the development of <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> as a means of fixing nitrogen, hence the Frank-Caro process. Caro became an important figure in the nitrogen fixation industry and a rival of Fritz Haber.|$|E
5000|$|With {{financial}} help from Mitsubishi, Noguchi merged his two companies into Nihon Chisso Hiryo (lit. [...] "Japan Nitrogenous Fertilizer") in 1908. The name was frequently abbreviated to [...] "Nichitsu". Then, with his collaborator, Fujiyama Tsuneichi, {{he developed a}} 'continuous method' of production to replace the 'alternate method' of Frank-Caro's technology. He also produced ammonium sulphate out of the <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide,</b> because it was safer and better known. In 1914, he formed [...] "Hiroshima Electric", the forerunner of Chugoku Electric Power to develop the hydroelectric power potential of the Chugoku region of Japan.|$|E
50|$|After World War I, a {{calcium carbide}} and <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> factory was set up, {{followed}} by a nitrogen and later by a coke factory. In 1936, an installation of synthetic ammonia production was set in Târnăveni, the first of this type in the world — over the following years, the company involved in the latter process switched to weapons manufacturing. The administrative palace and the hospital were both built during the urban expansion — the latter was where the famous physician Constantin Ion Parhon, whose family was originally from Cetatea de Baltă, used to consult his patients.|$|E
50|$|In April 1923, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, {{together}} with Adam Podoski, came to Chorzów. By then, almost all workers had been replaced, and the new, Polish-speaking crew brought the production to the pre-1921 level. Poles concentrated their efforts at manufacturing <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide,</b> {{which in the}} 1920s and 1930s was commonly used as a fertilizer. In 1923, 39,000 tons of calcium cyanide was produced at Chorzów; by 1929, the production grew to 166,000 tons. Still, {{it was not enough}} for the Polish agriculture, so construction of a new plant at Mościce near Tarnów was initiated by a number of specialists from Chorzów, headed by Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski (pages 240 - 254).|$|E
50|$|Noguchi {{was born}} to a samurai class family in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. He studied {{electrical}} engineering at the Tokyo Imperial University and was hired by Siemens in 1898. He designed Japan's first commercial production plant for Calcium carbide in Sendai in 1903. In 1906, two Germans, A.Frank and N. Caro, invented a new method to produce <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide</b> to be used a fertilizer. Noguchi learnt of this invention in a newspaper and realized that the method {{could be used to}} utilize the calcium carbide that his plant produced. He went to Germany, and with the support of an acquaintance at Siemens obtained the patent rights, beating other, larger and better-known Japanese trading firms like Mitsui and Furukawa.|$|E
5000|$|The {{possibility}} that atmospheric nitrogen reacts with certain chemicals was first observed by Desfosses in 1828. He observed that mixtures of alkali metal oxides and carbon react at high temperatures with nitrogen. With {{the use of}} barium carbonate as starting material the first commercially used process became available in the 1860s developed by Margueritte and Sourdeval. The resulting barium cyanide could be reacted with steam yielding ammonia. In 1898 Adolph Frank and Nikodem Caro decoupled the process and first produced calcium carbide and in a subsequent step reacted it with nitrogen to <b>calcium</b> <b>cyanamide.</b> The Ostwald process {{for the production of}} nitric acid was discovered in 1902. Frank-Caro process and Ostwald process dominated the industrial fixation of nitrogen until the discovery of the Haber process in 1909. Prior to 1900, Nikola Tesla also experimented with the industrial fixation of nitrogen [...] "by using currents of extremely high frequency or rate of vibration".|$|E
