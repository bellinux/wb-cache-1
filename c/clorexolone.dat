40|$|In 63 healthy medical students, grouped in 21 {{randomized}} blocks, {{the comparative}} effects of <b>clorexolone,</b> hydrochlorothiazide and placebo on {{the quantity of}} urine excreted and on weight loss were studied. Each subject ingested a single 50 -mg. dose {{of one of the}} medications. An oral saltloading technique was employed. Measurements were recorded during the four hours following administration. This experiment, which {{was an integral part of}} a teaching program in pharmacology, permitted a practical demonstration to medical students of the four fundamental control measures in clinical pharmacology: the comparison with a standard medication and/or a placebo, the random distribution of treatments, the double-blind technique and the statistical analysis of data. In this study hydrochlorothiazide proved to have significantly greater diuretic activity than placebo and clorexolone; the latter medication did not demonstrate effects statistically superior to those of the placebo. A highly significant positive correlation was found to exist between the measurements of urine volume and weight loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} lithium on the urine concentrating {{response}} to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and the excretion of ADH {{has been studied}} in rats and man. The maximum urine osmolarity following 18 h dehydration and Pitressin (5 u) was decreased in {{three out of four}} patients during lithium treatment compared to their response to the same test in the absence of lithium. In a fifth patient, tested only during lithium treatment, the urine remained hypotonic to plasma throughout this test. Lithium increased the excretion of ADH in non-polyuric patients from 9 - 22 mu/ 24 h in the absence of lithium to 36 - 202 mu/ 24 - during lithium treatment. In four patients with lithium-induced polyuria, a diuretic acting on the distal tubules, <b>clorexolone,</b> reduced the polyuria. Lithium increased urine volume and the excretion of ADH in four rats receiving lithium in their diet. The response to exogenous ADH was decreased during lithium administration...|$|E
