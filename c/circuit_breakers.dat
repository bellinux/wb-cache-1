5|$|There was a {{call for}} {{automated}} transponders after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; no changes were made, as aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies. In the wake of Flight 370, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs. Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting {{on the need to}} cut power to equipment {{in the event of a}} fire. Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> were being considered.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E

By two days after the storm, Pennsylvania Power and Light restored power to about 80% of its impacted customers, with about 93% restored by two nights after the storm. By five days after Isabel, most power outages in southeastern Pennsylvania were repaired, with all outages restored by a week after the hurricane. Allegheny Power restored power to about 20% of its customers by two days after the storm. Most power outages for the company were restored by five days after the hurricane, with all power completely restored by a week after Isabel.|$|E

5|$|Upon making landfall, Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge that tracked up the Delaware River, with a station {{along the river}} in Philadelphia reporting a storm tide of 9.47feet (2.89m). There, the surge flooded low-lying areas along the river. The large circulation of the hurricane produced moderate winds throughout the state, with wind gusts in the southeastern portion of the state reaching 60mph (95km/h) in Forks Township. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania also recorded a wind gust of 49mph (79km/h), which contributed to severe delays at the Philadelphia International Airport. The moderate wind gust downed thousands of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. PECO energy reported their worst power outage on record with about 572,425customers losing electricity. The company estimated it would cost at least $20million (2003USD, $23million 2008USD) for it to install about 81miles (130km) of new cable and install about 7,600new fuses and <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> The Metropolitan Edison power company reported 300,000customers without power, with 500,000Pennsylvania Power and Light customers losing electricity.|$|E
