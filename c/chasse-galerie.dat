5000|$|In English this {{particular}} legend {{is known as}} [...] "The Canoe", or [...] "The Wild Hunt Bewitched". The second name is used to translate precisely <b>chasse-galerie</b> {{as it is known}} in Canadian French; the other term is much broader.|$|E
50|$|The tale {{appeared}} in a book of French-Canadian folktales called Legends of French Canada by Edward C. Woodley, published in 1931, republished in 1938. The tale is told as a recollection {{of one of the}} men who made <b>chasse-galerie.</b> The men travel from St. Maurice to St. Jeanne. The return accident is credited to whiskey-blanc.|$|E
5000|$|La <b>Chasse-galerie</b> {{also known}} as [...] "The Bewitched Canoe" [...] or [...] "The Flying Canoe" [...] is a popular French-Canadian tale of voyageurs who {{make a deal with}} the devil, a variant of the Wild Hunt. Its best-known version was written by Honoré Beaugrand (1848-1906). It was {{published}} in The Century Magazine in August 1892.|$|E
50|$|The {{legend of}} <b>Chasse-galerie</b> was an oral {{tradition}} in Quebec {{for years before}} Honoré Beaugrand wrote {{a book on the}} subject, with Guillaume Vigneault's screenplay marking the first feature film adaptation. Jean-Philippe Duval became the director after agreeing to make a third film, following his Matroni et moi and Dédé à travers les brumes. The budget was $7 million.|$|E
5000|$|An earlier {{volume in}} English, {{entitled}} The Flying Canoe (La <b>Chasse-Galerie)</b> {{was written by}} J.E. LeRossignol, by McLelland and Steward Publishers in 1929.

The Quebec black metal scene has also gotten some attention in recent years, including bands like Akitsa, Spirit of the Forest, Forteresse, <b>Chasse-Galerie,</b> Monarque and Nefastus Dies.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, {{he joined}} the cast of {{director}} Benoît Pilon's film Iqaluit, alongside Marie-Josée Croze and Natar Ungalaaq. Iqaluit was released in 2016, {{the same year as}} his Bad Seeds, and Chasse-Galerie: La Légende, where Papineau played Jack Murphy, the Devil in the <b>Chasse-galerie</b> mythology. Papineau was tasked to play the villain as suave with a slight English accent.|$|E
50|$|Various {{tales and}} stories are told through oral tradition, such as, among many more, the {{legends of the}} Bogeyman, the <b>Chasse-galerie,</b> the Black Horse of Trois-Pistoles, the Complainte de Cadieux, the Corriveau, the dancing devil of Saint-Ambroise, the Giant Beaupré, the monsters of the lakes Pohénégamook and Memphremagog, of Quebec Bridge (called the Devil's Bridge), the Rocher Percé and of Rose Latulipe, for example.|$|E
5000|$|This {{tribute to}} the {{fiddling}} traditions of Canada paying homage to the Anglo-Celtic roots of European Canadian settler culture began {{with the appearance of}} the horned fiddler in a flying canoe, a reference to the story of the <b>Chasse-galerie,</b> where the Devil rode a magical canoe. As the canoe descended from the ceiling, the opening of the song [...] "The Old Ways" [...] was performed by Loreena McKennitt.|$|E
50|$|Folktales {{were told}} by Raconteurs, who could tell tales lasting several hours, or even tell a story {{over the course of}} several evenings. Christian beliefs and superstitions are present in most Quebec folklore. La <b>chasse-galerie</b> (the flying canoe) is a {{well-known}} folktale about a group of lumberjacks who make a pact with the devil. Demons, witches, and werewolves were common folk motifs. The tales themselves were referred to by the name contes. The traditional conte form of story-telling has been adapted to the modern novel by writers such as Roch Carrier and Joseph Jean Jacques Ferron. Some folktales are classified under the traditional genre Märchen (fairy tales).|$|E
5000|$|In France, it {{was known}} as Mesnée d'Hellequin (Old North French: [...] "household of Hellequin"); in Canada it becomes <b>Chasse-galerie.</b> In West Slavic Central Europe it is known as divoký hon or štvaní (Czech: [...] "wild hunt", [...] "baiting"), Dziki Gon or Dziki Łów (Polish), and Divja Jaga (Slovene: [...] "the wild hunting party" [...] or [...] "wild hunt"). Other {{variations}} of the same folk myth are Caccia Morta (Dead hunt) or Caccia selvaggia (wild hunt) in Italy; Estantiga (from Hoste Antiga, Galician: [...] "the old army"), Hostia, Compaña and Santa Compaña ("troop, company") in Galicia; Güestia in Asturias; Hueste de Ánimas ("troop of ghosts") in León; and Hueste de Guerra ("war company") or Cortejo de Gente de Muerte ("deadly retinue") in Extremadura.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chasse-galerie</b> is a French-Canadian tale of voyageurs who, after a {{night of}} heavy {{drinking}} on New Year's Eve at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues (about 400 km) away. Since they have to be back in time for work the next morning they make a pact with the devil. Their canoe will fly through the air, on condition that they not mention God's name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they fly by in the canoe. One version of this fable ends with the coup de grâce when, still high in the sky, the voyageurs complete the hazardous journey but the canoe overturns, so the devil can honour the pact to deliver the voyageurs and still claim their souls.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{a leader}} of the Quebec [...] "neo-traditional" [...] scene, the band takes a {{definitely}} modern slant on that style, borrowing stories and characters from French Canadian folklore (the devil, the <b>chasse-galerie,</b> the shepherdess, the coureur des bois, drinking songs, etc.) to write about modern themes with a touch of humor. These themes include globalization (Qui nous mène?), politics (Ça va mal), generational conflicts (Dégénérations/Le reel du fossé), over-medicating (Remède miracle), the frenetic pace of modern life (Train de vie/le surcheval, Continuer pareil), recent Quebec history (2096 (chanson à boire)), etc. Some of their songs involve personalities from Quebec history such as [...] "La Corriveau" [...] (La Corrida de la Corriveau), [...] "The Great Antonio" [...] (Antonio) and [...] "Alexis le Trotteur" [...] (Train de vie/le surcheval). The band also wrote humorous songs about Québécois cultural phenomena such as poutine (Hommage en grain).|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Navarro's {{acquired}} versatility {{finds its}} way in a solo effort titled Stereo. Not without weaknesses, the album yet showcases a fine melodist, an original lyricist and a bare, nuanced acoustic guitar player. Recorded direct in a week's time, without post-production, the album explores the vast territory of roots music: Québécois and Irish traditionnals (Je me souviens, an original composition diving deep into the collective soul), delta blues (Le Gigueux, a piece that blends {{the myth of the}} crossroads with the québécois traditional of the <b>Chasse-galerie),</b> bossa nova (La cancion del inmigrante) or Appalachian folk (Cool Waters and Western métaphysique). A future member of Water on Mars, Benoit L'Allier plays acoustic guitar and electric bass on the album. At the time, l'Allier and Navarro shoot a short film, Route 389, on the theme of the Nordic experience (the piece Trois-89 opens the film).|$|E
50|$|After a {{night of}} heavy {{drinking}} on New Year's Eve, a group of voyageurs working at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues away (300 miles). The {{only way to make}} such a long journey and be back in time for work the next morning is to run the <b>chasse-galerie.</b> Running the <b>chasse-galerie</b> means making a pact with the devil so their canoe can fly through the air to their destination quickly. However, the travellers must not mention God's name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they whisk by in the flying canoe. If either of these rules is broken during the voyage, then the devil will take their souls. To be safe, the men promise not to touch another drop of rum to keep their heads clear. The crew took their places in the canoe which then rises off the ground, and they start to paddle. Far below they see the frozen Gatineau River, many villages, shiny church steeples and then the lights of Montreal. The bewitched canoe eventually touches down near a house where New Year's Eve festivities are in full swing. No one wonders at the trappers'/loggers' sudden arrival. They are embraced with open arms and soon are dancing and celebrating as merrily as everyone else. Soon it is late and the men must leave if they are to get back to camp in time for work. As they fly through the moonless night, it becomes apparent that their navigator had been drinking as he steers the canoe on a dangerously unsteady course. While passing over Montreal they just miss running into a church steeple, and soon after the canoe ends up stuck in a deep snowdrift. At this point the drunken navigator begins swearing and taking the Lord's name in vain. Terrified the devil will take their souls, the men bind and gag their friend and elect another to steer. The navigator soon breaks his bonds and begins swearing again. The crew become more and more shaken at the possibility of losing their souls, and they eventually steer the bewitched canoe right into a tall pine. The men spill out and are knocked unconscious. The ending of the story changes from version to version. Sometimes the men are condemned to fly the canoe through hell and appear in the sky every New Year's Eve, but in all but one version all escape the terms the devil made.|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo tem por objeto o processo de tradução e suas dificuldades a partir da análise da obra La <b>Chasse-Galerie,</b> do escritor franco-canadense Marie-Louis-Honoré Beaugrand (1848 - 1906). Nosso objetivo é mostrar as diferentes marcas culturais e linguísticas presentes na citada obra e os caminhos percorridos para encontrar uma tradução capaz de transpor, a partir da língua alvo, os mesmos significados e os mesmos sentimentos expressados na língua de partida, sem que a obra parecesse estrangeira aos olhos do leitor. Para atingir esse objetivo, tomamos por base os conceitos teóricos de Eco (2007) sobre a tradução que afirma que quando se traduz nunca se diz a mesma coisa, mas quase e Berman (2002), porque o seu posicionamento é o de que, uma tradução só é boa ou bem sucedida quando o tradutor deixa nela as marcas do estrangeiro, isto é, deixa entrar a cultura do estrangeiro (do texto de partida) para dentro da sua cultura (texto de chegada). The {{object of}} {{study of the}} present {{research}} is the translation processes and their difficulties. Based on La <b>Chasse-Galerie,</b> the piece of the French-Canadian writer Marie-Louis-Honoré Beaugrand (1848 - 1906), we aim at demonstrating the various cultural and linguistic aspects present in the mentioned {{work as well as}} the methods we used to reach a translation capable of transmitting to the target language the same meanings and feelings expressed in the original language of the tale without making the piece strange to the readers eyes. To meet this goal, we used the translation theory by Eco (2007), according to which something translated never says the same thing, but nearly, and by Berman (2002), because he believes an effective translation is the one which allows the reader to recognize traces of the source text, that is, traces of the original culture...|$|E
