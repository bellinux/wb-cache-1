5|$|The Hindu {{religion}} regards Hell {{not as a}} {{place of}} lasting permanence, but as an alternate domain from which an individual can return to the present world after crimes in the previous life have been compensated for. These <b>crimes</b> <b>are</b> eventually nullified through an equal punishment in the next life. The concept of Hell has provided many different opportunities for the Hindu religion including narrative, social and economic functions.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are met by Phoebe Green, an {{investigator}} from London's Metropolitan Police and Mulder's former lover from Oxford University. Green explains that a serial arsonist is targeting the British aristocracy, burning his victims alive while leaving {{no trace of}} evidence. The only links between the <b>crimes</b> <b>are</b> the suspect's love letters to the victims' wives. His latest target is Sir Malcolm Marsden, who is visiting Cape Cod for protection after escaping an attack by the killer. Mulder and Scully visit a pyrotechnics expert who says that only rocket fuel can burn hot enough to destroy evidence of its origins.|$|E

Susan collapses and {{is taken to}} hospital, where it is discovered {{that she has a}} high level of opiates in her system. It emerges that her vitamins have been swapped and Elly suspects that Finn was responsible. Finn is appointed acting principal while Susan recovers. When Finn's <b>crimes</b> <b>are</b> exposed, including the vitamin swap, Susan ignores her MS symptoms to return to the school to undo everything Finn implemented. Susan suffers an MS relapse and falls in the school yard. Karl persuades her to take sick leave and go to a retreat in Thailand. When they return, Susan is angry with Karl and later reveals that he tried to bring seeds and a Durian into the country, but was stopped at customs because of the smell, which he blamed on her soiling herself.|$|E
5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing <b>crimes,</b> <b>are</b> paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E

40|$|Main {{weakness}} of economics of <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> that {{it focuses on}} rational offender who is isolated from society. This thesis gives overview of game theory models, which take into account possible reactions of other actors to offender`s actions. I show that some variables of <b>crime</b> <b>are</b> dependent on individual`s social environment and I analyze them using moral costs of crime, where some gains and losses from <b>crime</b> <b>are</b> interconnected between people. Two own models are presented. First model deals with aggregated crime with significant role of moral costs of <b>crime.</b> Second model <b>is</b> a modification of Inspection game which includes moral costs of <b>crime</b> and <b>is</b> than modeled using evolutionary game theory. Result of first model is higher volatility of crime than in standard models of rational offender. <b>Crime</b> <b>is</b> maximally volatile in time in the second model. There is a critical level of moral costs of crime and after reaching this level, assumptions of inspection game are violated and society converges to state with zero <b>crime.</b> It <b>is</b> demonstrated on both models that <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> a self- propagating phenomenon, because of social interactions...|$|R
