If worn too low on the hips, {{there is a chance}} of the belt sliding down, as it is pulled downward by the stockings. The garment should fit closely on the waist, but not too tight. Some underwear, such as <b>corselettes</b> or girdles, referred to as shapewear, may come with suspender slings attached.|$|E
5000|$|Dior's [...] "New Look" [...] (that premiered in 1947) {{revived the}} {{popularity}} of girdles and the all-in-one <b>corselettes.</b> In the early 1950s, many couture houses used the interest in [...] "foundationwear" [...] to launch their own lines, soon after many lingerie manufacturers began {{to build their own}} brands. In 1957, Jane Russell wore the [...] "Cantilever" [...] bra that was scientifically designed by Howard Hughes to maximize a voluptuous look. The invention of Lycra (originally called [...] "Fibre K") in 1959 revolutionized the underwear industry and was quickly incorporated into every aspect of lingerie.|$|E
5000|$|Christian Dior's 'New Look' {{collection}} in 1947 brought a revolution to the fashionable silhouette of the Fifties. Dior's nostalgic femininity of round shoulders, full skirts, padded hips and tiny waists replaced the boxy {{style of the}} wartime period at WWII. The trend of hourglass silhouette brought by the popularity of Dior guaranteed the market for intimate apparel. Although intimate apparels are usually hidden by outerwear, intimate apparel is especially emblematic for the contradictory beauty in the 1950s as the silhouette was created depends {{on the type of}} foundation garments worn. Foundation garments became essential items to maintain the curvy silhouette, especially waspies, girdles and horsehair padding. For example, the sales of corsets doubled in the decade 1948-58 (Haye, 1996 p.187). Dior's 'New Look' collection brought back the boned intimate apparels for women, even the young one, in order to create the feminised silhouettes that embrace feminity. Symington Corset Company of Market Harborough was one of the famous intimate apparel producers in the 1950s as they are the official producer of Dior's <b>corselettes</b> and girdles. [...] "All the girdles were produced to the same design, in either black or white. The sugar-pink cotton velvet trimming was a particular feature of the range, and some were woven with Christian Dior's initials in the elastic panels on the side..." [...] (Lynn, 2010, p.106). A brand new 'Bri-Nylon' fabric was introduced by the British Nylon Spinners. This fabric was popular fabric to be applied on intimate apparel in the 1950s because {{it was one of the}} first easy-to-launder and drip-dry fabric. There was a full corset advertisement in 1959 shows the popularity of 'Bri-Nylon' and the design of the corselet in the 1950s. 'This exquisite Dior corselet features jacquard elastic net with the down-stretch back panel of stain elastic. The enchanting front panel is in Bri-Nylon lace and marquisette highlighted with criss-cross bands of narrow velvet ribbon. It has side fastening - partly hook and eye with zipping extension. The very light boning is covered with velveteen.' (Warren, 2001, p.30 [...] ) From the above advertisement, it is not hard to find that the corselets in the 1950s were constructed in details with boning, panels, different fabrics in different elasticity.|$|E

5000|$|A corselet, or <b>corselette,</b> {{is a type}} of {{foundation}} garment, sharing {{elements of}} both bras and girdles. It may incorporate lace in front or in back. The term originated by the addition of the diminutive suffix [...] "-ette" [...] to the word corset.|$|R
2500|$|Wearing a {{specialized}} garment designed to restrain a woman's breasts may {{date back to}} ancient Greece. Wall paintings in Crete, {{the center of the}} Minoan civilization, show a woman performing athletics in what {{has been described as a}} [...] "bikini". Minoan women on the island of Crete 3,000 years ago apparently wore garments that partially supported and also revealed their breasts; the best known example of this style is the Snake Goddess. Their clothing looked somewhat like modern fitted and laced corsets or a <b>corselette.</b> The support device was worn outside other clothing and supported and exposed the breasts, pushing them upwards and making them more visible. The succeeding Mycenae civilization emphasized the breast, which had a special cultural and religious significance, associating the mature figure with fertility and procreation.|$|R
