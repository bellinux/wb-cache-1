25|$|When an {{individual}} tries to suppress thoughts under a high cognitive load, {{the frequency of}} those thoughts increases and becomes more accessible than before. Evidence shows that people can prevent their thoughts from being translated into behavior when self-monitoring is high; this {{does not apply to}} automatic behaviors though, and may result in latent, unconscious actions. This phenomenon is made paradoxically worse by increasing the amount of distractions a person has, although the experiments in this area can be criticized for using impersonal concurrent tasks, {{which may or may not}} properly reflect natural processes or individual differences. Ironic process theory is one <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> that can explain the paradoxical effect seen above. However, given the mixed evidence and commensurate with the latest research, it is suggested that such a model needs to account for individual differences. It should also note possible neurological dynamics (see, for instance, obsessive–compulsive disorder), to be considered robust.|$|E

50|$|An {{accurate}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> {{is crucial}} for two reasons. First, a <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> provides the interpretative framework for linking test score interpretations to cognitive skills. That is, the test developer is {{in a better position}} to make defensible claims about student knowledge, skills, and processes that account for test performance. Second, a <b>cognitive</b> <b>model</b> provides a link between cognitive and learning psychology with instruction. Based on an examinee’s observed response pattern, detailed feedback about an examinee’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses can be provided through a score report. This diagnostic information can then be used to inform instruction tailored to the examinee, with the goals of improving or remediating specific cognitive skills.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>cognitive</b> <b>models</b> involves the creative scientific formalization of assumptions, based on theory, observation, and other relevant information.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} an esemplastic systematization of {{declarative}} computational <b>cognitive</b> <b>modeling,</b> {{a field that}} cuts across <b>cognitive</b> <b>modeling</b> based on <b>cognitive</b> architectures (such as ACT-R, Soar, and Clarion), human-level artificial intelligence (AI), logic itself, and psychology of reasoning (especially of the computational kind). The hallmarks of declarative computational <b>cognitive</b> <b>modeling</b> are the following two intertwined constraints: (1) The central units of information used in the approach are (at least in significant part) declarative in nature, and the central process carried out over these units is inference. (2) The approach to modeling the mind is top-down, rather than bottom-up. (These two points are interconnected because once one commits to (1), (2) becomes quite unavoidable, since bottom-up processing in the brain, as reflected in relevant formalisms (e. g., artificial neural networks), is based on units of information that are numerical, not declarative.) The systematization of declarative computational <b>cognitive</b> <b>modeling</b> is achieved by using formal logic, and hence declarative computational <b>cognitive</b> <b>modeling,</b> from the formal perspective, becomes logic-based computational <b>cognitive</b> <b>modeling</b> (LCCM).
