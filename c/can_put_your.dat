500|$|In October 1990, {{after he}} had ceased running the [...] "Wake up!" [...] TV spots, Peterson debuted an alarm clock {{in the shape of}} a {{television}} set with his face in the center and voice as the alarm, saying: [...] "Wake up! Wake up to a happy day!" [...] Peterson said of the promotion at the time: [...] "If you <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> face in 5,000 homes in Portland, it certainly can't hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Verdi's {{dissatisfaction with}} some of the librettist's work led him to find a local {{collaborator}} to help revise some of the sections. [...] Accordingly, he called upon an Italian exile in Paris, the politician, former professor of law, poet and writer Giuseppe Montanelli, to do this. Piave learned nothing of the revisions until he received a note from Verdi: [...] "Here is the libretto, shortened and altered more or less as it must be. [...] You <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> name to or it, just as you please". [...] However, he also learned nothing of the anonymous collaborator either. [...] After the premiere of Le trouvère on 12 January 1857, Verdi and Strepponi left Paris to return to Italy, then both went to Venice for the March premiere.|$|E

50|$|Extensors; {{these are}} the muscles that oppose the flexors of the hands and should be trained to achieve a good balance between {{opposing}} muscle groups; extensor muscles are key in grip because they must contract aggressively to support finger flexion. Shoving your hand in something like rice and extending it, or placing something such as rocks in a coffee <b>can,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> hand in there, and extending it {{to pick up the}} coffee can, are ways of training your hand extensors.|$|R
