50|$|The {{argument}} in Capital, Volume III (Marx intended to publish still more volumes, {{but did not}} manage to do so) is that the sales of newly produced commodities in the capitalist mode of production are regulated by their production prices. What products will sell for, {{has to do with}} what it normally costs to make them, plus the profit mark-up that will secure a normal average return on capital for the producing enterprise. For efficient producers, there will be a larger margin between their costs and their sales-revenue (more profit), and for less efficient producers, there will be a smaller margin between their costs and revenue (less profit). Marx's controversial claim is that the magnitude of the production prices for products is determined ultimately by their <b>current</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>costs</b> in average labour time, i.e. by the value of products.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{whether the}} dual production structure {{now in place}} {{in central and eastern}} European countries (CEECs) is efficient and stable in the medium term. The large, recently emerged corporate and co-operative farm structures may not be stable because of conflicts inherent in co-operative production under current ownership structures. Such units use high levels of capital and purchased inputs, and relative price changes for production factors may threaten their survival without subsidies. The few large individual private operators that have emerged may soon face restructuring problems, as they have been relying on cheap capital at prices that do not reflect <b>current</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>costs.</b> New, younger, relatively small-scale farmers appear to have major and as yet unexploited production potential. Although representing only a small share of the many family farms, they are nevertheless numerous enough to create a viable 'middle class' of commercially oriented, private farmers. Although this group currently faces severe technological and financial constraints, the emergence of medium-sized, individually owned and operated farm units is the most viable option for the future in CEECs. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{managing}} the university campus has become more complex and challenging, with many more stakeholders, opportunities and threats to consider. Decreasing public involvement and funding for universities puts pressure on the internal allocation of resources, comparing {{investments in real estate}} with investments in human resources. This urges the need for evidence-based management information to support campus decision-making. At the same time the university campus is aging, both technically and functionally, and in need of reinvestment, while many developments cause more uncertainty in future space demand. On top of that, various stakeholders make higher demands upon the added value of the campus for the performance of the university and for the regional knowledge economy. This research focused on information to support campus decisions. The dissertation covers a wide range of topics on campus management: from generating references for planning purposes – like <b>current</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>costs</b> and new space standards for the changing academic workplace – to strategies for the sustainable campus and new models that merge the campus and the knowledge city. The book includes profiles of fourteen Dutch campuses and forty campus projects to illustrate trends. The content of this book combines insights from theory – adding to new real estate management theories and the required management information for real estate decisions – and lessons for practice. The book can support the decisions of policy makers, architects, campus and facility managers about the campus of the future. Note: this dissertation is published as a book (full colour, 432 pages) and as an eBook (ePub for iPad).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a simple model where a regulated firm must make sunk investments in long-lived assets {{in order to}} produce output, assets exhibit a known but arbitrary pattern of depreciation, there are constant returns to scale within each period, and the <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> of assets is weakly falling over time due to technological progress. It is shown that a simple formula can be used to calculate the long run marginal cost of production each period and that the firm breaks even if prices are set equal to long run marginal cost. Furthermore, the formula for calculating long run marginal cost can be interpreted as a formula for calculating forward looking cost (where the current cost of using assets is based on the <b>current</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> of assets). However, through appropriate choice of the accounting depreciation rule, it can also be interpreted as a formula for calculating historic cost (where the current cost of using assets is based on the historic purchase cost of assets). In particular, the results derived in the simple benchmark model of this paper contradict the commonly expressed view that measures of forward looking cost are superior to measures of historic cost in environments with declining asset prices. ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Marx, Aristotle already {{described}} {{the basics of}} the value-form when he argued that an expression such as [...] "5 beds = 1 house" [...] does not differ from [...] "5 beds = such and such an amount of money", but according to Marx, Aristotle's analysis [...] "suffered shipwreck" [...] because he lacked a clear concept of value. By this Marx meant that Aristotle was unable to clarify the substance of value, i.e., what exactly was being equated in value-comparisons, or what was the common denominator commensurating a plethora of different goods. Aristotle thought the common factor must simply be the demand for goods, since without demand for goods that could satisfy some need or want, {{they would not be}} exchanged. According to Marx, the substance of product-value is human labour-time in general, labour-in-the-abstract or [...] "abstract labour". This value (an average <b>current</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> in labour-time) exists as an attribute of the products of human labour quite independently of the particular forms that exchange may take, though obviously value is always expressed in some form or other.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s (GASB’s) Statement 34 is having a dramatic impact on the financial reporting requirements {{of state and local}} governments. Introduced in June 1999, this provision recommends that governmental agencies report the value of their infrastructure assets in their financial statements. GASB recommends that government agencies use a historical cost approach for capitalizing long-lived capital assets; however, if historical information is not available, guidance is provided for an alternate approach based on the <b>current</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> of the assets. A method of representing the costs {{associated with the use of}} the assets must also be selected, and two methods are allowed by GASB. One approach is to depreciate the assets over time. The modified approach, on the other hand, provides an agency more flexibility in reporting the value of its assets based upon the use of a systematic, defensible approach that accounts for the preservation of the asset. Pavement management and pavement management systems provide agencies with the tools necessary to evaluate their pavement assets and meet the GASB34 requirements under the modified depreciation approach.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a simple model where a firm must make sunk investments in long-lived assets {{in order to}} produce output, there are constant returns to scale within each period, and the <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> of assets is weakly falling over time. It is shown that, so long as demand is weakly increasing over time, a simple formula can be used to calculate the long run marginal cost of production each period and that the firm breaks even if prices are set equal to long run marginal cost. Furthermore, the formula for calculating long run marginal cost can be interpreted as either a formula for calculating forward looking cost (where the current cost of using assets is based on the <b>current</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>cost</b> of assets) or as a formula for calculating historic cost (where the current cost of using assets is based on the actual historic purchase cost of assets.) In particular, then, the paper identifies a set of circumstances in which traditional accounting rules that allocate the cost of purchasing assets across all periods that the assets will be used can be used to calculate the true long run marginal cost of production. The result has applications both to the theory of calculating efficient prices under cost-based regulation and to the theory of how for-profit firms use accounting data to organize and guide their decision-making...|$|R

Its importance to government agencies has increased with the recent initiative by the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) recommending that States and local governments improve their annual financial reporting by incorporating the value of capital assets (including transportation infrastructure) into their financial statements. This initiative, referred to as GASB Statement 34, has established guidance in how transportation assets should be reported on financial statements and has established a schedule for compliance with its recommendations (Federal Highway Administration 2000).
