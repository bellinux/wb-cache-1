40|$|Abstract RF MEMS {{switches}} {{can be used}} {{to achieve}} reconfigurability of various RF systems and in particular, that of miniaturized antenna structures. In the case of micromachined antennas, which involve low voltage signals, RF MEMS switches with low actuation voltage are required for achieving reconfigurability. The <b>capacitive</b> <b>shunt</b> switch derives its switching property from the significant difference of its capacitance in the up-state and down-state. The actuation voltage of RF MEMS switches mainly depends on the spring constant of the switch membrane. In this paper, a low actuation voltage <b>capacitive</b> <b>shunt</b> switch suitable to be used along with micromachined antennas, is presented. A process flow for the fabrication is designed and simulated using Intellisuite.

40|$|Abstract—A novel RF MEMS switch {{design is}} {{proposed}} {{which uses a}} seesaw-type movable part to implement a <b>capacitive</b> <b>shunt</b> across a CPW transmission line. Unlike in other designs elastic recovery force is not used to restore the movable part to its rest position. Instead the switching action is solely induced through separate pull-up and pull-down electrodes. The design allows independent definition of the main electrical parameters (C-L-R) through the specification of the movable part geometries, thus achieving programmable maximum isolation for a given RF frequency. The theoretical power handling capability is augmented relative {{to that of other}} designs due to the inclusion of a pull-up electrode. For a design with a 10 μm gap between the movable part and the electrodes, and an actuation voltage of 80 V, dynamic analysis shows a switching time of less than 7 μs. The device can operate with lower actuation voltages (as low as 5 V) with a tradeoff in the switching time. Index Terms — <b>capacitive</b> <b>shunt</b> switches, RF-MEMS I...|$|E

40|$|Within the RSJ model, we {{performed}} a theoretical analysis of phase-locking in elementary strongly coupled Josephson junction cells. For this purpose, we developed a systematic method allowing the investigation of phase-locking in cells with small but non-vanishing loop inductance. The voltages across the junctions {{are found to be}} locked with very small phase difference for almost all values of external flux. However, the general behavior of phase-locking is found to be just contrary to that according to weak coupling. In case of strong coupling there is nearly no influence of external magnetic flux on the phases, but the locking-frequency becomes flux-dependent. The influence of parameter splitting is considered as well as the effect of small <b>capacitive</b> <b>shunting</b> of the junctions. Strongly coupled cells show synchronization even for large parameter splitting. Finally, a study of the behavior under external microwave radiation shows that the frequency locking-range becomes strongly flux-dependent, whereas the locking frequency itself turns out to be flux-independent.
