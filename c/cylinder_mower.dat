50|$|Of all the mowers, a {{properly}} adjusted <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> makes the cleanest {{cut of the}} grass, and this allows the grass to heal more quickly. The cut of a well-adjusted <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> is straight and definite, as if cut {{with a pair of}} scissors. This clean cut promotes healthier, thicker and more resilient lawn growth that is more resistant to disease, weeds and parasites. Lawn cut with a <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> is less likely to result in yellow, white or brown discolouration as a result of leaf shredding. While the cutting action is often likened to that of scissors, it is not necessary for the blades of the spinning cylinder to contact the horizontal cutting bar. If the gap between the blades is less than the thickness of the grass, a clean cut can still be made. If more however, the grass will slip through. Reel mowers also have more difficulty mowing over uneven terrain.|$|E
5000|$|Atco in {{more recent}} years have been {{producing}} rotary mowers powered by either petrol or electricity. Production of petrol-engined <b>cylinder</b> <b>mowers</b> continues with the [...] "Clipper" [...] range, in three sizes.|$|R
50|$|A roller mower, or rollermower, is a tractor-powered multi-spindled {{rotary mowers}} that have full width rollers front and rear. Most rollermowers attach to a four-wheeled tractor via the three-point linkage and are {{powered by the}} tractorâ€™s power {{take-off}} (PTO), though larger models connect three or more complete mowing decks to a separate chassis that is towed behind the tractor. Good rollermowers can produce a finish rivalling that of reel (<b>cylinder)</b> <b>mowers</b> while generally being far more robust and requiring considerably less maintenance. Modern machines can also cope efficiently with {{a wider range of}} grass lengths and densities than <b>cylinder</b> <b>mowers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Used in reel or <b>cylinder</b> <b>mowers,</b> <b>cylinder</b> blades are {{composed}} of three to seven helical blades welded in a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel, creating a scissor-like cutting action. Unlike other types of mower blades, reel/cylinder blades cannot be replaced; therefore, a broken blade requires replacement of the entire mower. For dull or rusty blades, cleaning and sharpening kits are available.|$|R
50|$|Top of Atco's <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> range, the Royale was {{designed}} for large areas of fine lawn. The traditional 6-bladed steel cutting cylinder gave 70 cuts per yard while the heavy duty rollers helped to produce a striped finish.|$|E
50|$|A {{cylindrical}} {{radial turbine}} resembling the blades of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> {{is embedded in}} the upper surface of the wing with its axis parallel to the wingspan, leaving approximately 2/3 of the turbine's outer diameter exposed with the remainder being enclosed in a trough formed at the leading edge and terminating in a comma-shaped wedge.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> or {{reel mower}} carries a fixed, {{horizontal}} cutting blade at the desired height of cut. Over {{this is a}} fast-spinning reel of blades which force the grass past the cutting bar. Each blade in the blade cylinder forms a helix around the reel axis, and the set of spinning blades describes a cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Reel <b>mowers,</b> {{also called}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>mowers</b> [...] (familiar as the hand-pushed or {{self-powered}} <b>cylinder</b> lawn <b>mower),</b> have a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel composed of helical blades, {{each of which}} in turn runs past a horizontal cutter-bar, producing a continuous scissor action. The bar is held at an adjustable level just above {{the ground and the}} reel runs at a speed dependent on the forward movement speed of the machine, driven by wheels running on the ground (or in self-powered applications by a motor). The cut grass may be gathered in a collection bin.|$|R
50|$|Tractor pulled mowers {{are usually}} {{in the form of}} an {{attachment}} to a tractor. The attachments can simply function by the movement of the tractor similar to manual push <b>cylinder</b> <b>mowers,</b> but also sometimes may have powered moving blades. They are commonly mounted on either the side or the back of the tractor.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower.</b> Push mowers have no engine {{and are usually}} used on smaller lawn areas where access is a problem, where noise pollution is undesirable and where air pollution is unwanted. As the mower is pushed along, the wheels drive gears which rapidly spin the reel. Typical cutting widths are 10 to 16 in. Advances in materials and engineering have resulted in these mowers being very light and easy to operate and manoeuvre compared with their predecessors while still giving all the cutting advantages of large professional cylinder mowers. Their distinct environmental benefits, both in noise and air pollution, are also strong selling points, something not lost on many international zoos, animal sanctuaries and exclusive hotel groups.|$|E
50|$|A {{gasoline}} engine or electric motor {{can be added}} to a <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> to power the cylinder, the wheels, the roller, or any combination of these. A typical arrangement on electric powered machines for residential lawns is for the motor to power the cylinder while the operator pushes the mower along. The electric models can be corded or cordless. On petrol machines the engine drives both the cylinder and the rear roller. Some variants have only three blades in a reel spinning at great speed, and these models are able to cut grass which has grown too long for ordinary push mowers. One type of reel mower, now largely obsolete, was a powered version of the traditional side-wheel push mower, which was used on residential lawns. An internal combustion engine sat atop the reel housing and drove the wheels, usually through a belt. The wheels in turn drove the reel, as in the push mower.|$|E
40|$|When {{choosing}} {{methods and}} technology for maintaining lawns {{it is necessary}} to formulate clearly the aim of the maintenance. Today it is difficult to formulate the aim since the terminology is ambiguous and unclear. This report presents different systems for describing green surfaces. The need for maintenance in the form of mowing grass depends on many different factors, both biological and technical. There {{is a great deal of}} literature on the biological aspects but relatively little concerning technology and methods for maintenance of grass surfaces. There is also a need for interdisciplinary research to study the relationships between different factors. There are many ways of shortening a grass blade. The most common ones are chopping and cutting, used by machines such as rotary lawn mowers and cylinder lawn mowers. In order to chop off grass efficiently, the peripherical speed of the blade must be approximately 35 m/s. When cutting, the friction between blades and grass must be great enough. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> is the most suited to very short and plane grass surfaces: it gives a very level cut and spreads the cuttings evenly if these are not collected. For other types of lawn it is better to use a rotary mower since it is less sensitive to damage than a <b>cylinder</b> <b>mower</b> and can also be used on taller grass. The primary disadvantage of the rotary mower is that it spreads the cuttings unevenly. The rotary mower is an interesting alternative to the rotary lawn mower because of its greater capacity, In general, it is possible to reduce the time required as well as the energy consumed by having sharp and correctly adjusted blades and by keeping the lawn mower in good shape. According to the manufacturer, the cylindrical rotary mower divided in sections can be used as an allround mower for different types of grass, but it has not undergone any thorough testing. Earlier research results with Colonial bentgrass show that grass grows faster if it is mown more often. These trials were carried out with very low heights, between 0. 5 and 1. 7 cm. Introductory studies carried out at Alnarp in this project suggest that if the cutting height is raised (from x to y), then this will have the opposite effect, that is that growth diminishes. New grass varieties with a slow growth rate also affect the cutting frequency. When evaluating cutting results, it is difficult to measure the quality of a grassed surface with quantitative methods. This report describes some, but there is a large number of parameters that must be taken into consideration and the methods are not always complete. The report describes a simple ball-rolling method, which however only measures one parameter of grass quality which must be weighed together with other qualities. Subjective methods can also be used, but it is difficult to compare results from different judges. In the future, image analysis can be used as a complement to evaluate the quality of a grass surface. In order to calculate mowing costs, we need data that describe capacity under different conditions. Time studies carried out in the project provide a basis for calculating the total time for mowing. In order to use resources efficiently we need to study mowing as a whole. Future research should focus around how green areas should be designed and the consequences on maintenance costs. This could apply to choice of grass type, meadow for example, and its position within a green area...|$|E

50|$|The term 'boss' {{when used}} in {{engineering}} can also relate to a finishing edge around (usually) a circular opening that allows the opening to locate onto, or within another opening thus locating or joining two items together {{with a view to}} the location or joining being temporary or semi-permanent.A common everyday example of a boss is the housing of the rotation spindle in a washing machine drum, or on a <b>cylinder</b> lawn <b>mower</b> {{at the end of the}} cutting blade cylinder which may house a bearing set to allow the cylinder to rotate through one plane, but held firm in another plane.|$|R
50|$|Two main {{styles of}} blades {{are used in}} lawn mowers. Lawn mowers {{employing}} a single blade that rotates about a single vertical axis are known as rotary mowers, while those employing a cutting bar and multiple blade assembly that rotates about a single horizontal axis are known as <b>cylinder</b> or reel <b>mowers</b> (although in some versions, the cutting bar is the only blade, and the rotating assembly consists of flat metal pieces which force the blades of grass against the sharp cutting bar).|$|R
