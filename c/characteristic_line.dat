[...] The earliest prints were monochromatic, and these lines {{were the only}} printed element; even {{with the advent of}} colour this <b>characteristic</b> <b>line</b> continued to dominate. [...] In ukiyo-e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces with figures typically in a single plane of depth. [...] Attention was drawn to vertical and horizontal relationships, as well as details such as lines, shapes, and patterns such as those on clothing. [...] Compositions were often asymmetrical, and the viewpoint was often from unusual angles, such as from above. [...] Elements of images were often cropped, giving the composition a spontaneous feel. [...] In colour prints, contours of most colour areas are sharply defined, usually by the linework. [...] The aesthetic of flat areas of colour contrasts with the modulated colours expected in Western traditions and with other prominent contemporary traditions in Japanese art patronized by the upper class, such as in the subtle monochrome ink brushstrokes of zenga brush painting or tonal colours of the Kanō school of painting.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{create a}} winning brand, the stylist, {{aesthetic}} designer, and company managers should continuously innovate without straying from the brand's car history, {{and they should}} use the country's culture as a value system and as background inspiration. In this context, the proposed approach assumes that aesthetic judgments related to the country identity of the car, rely on the car's important (primitive) <b>characteristics</b> <b>lines,</b> which have been considered foundational and necessary to make this determination. The issue is then to identify, extract and to interpret these <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines.</b> The proposed approach is based on two important hypotheses. The first hypothesis, called the singularities hypothesis, stipulates that the singularities {{can be used to}} identify the <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> in cars’ style. The second hypothesis, called primitives hypothesis, stipulates that cars of different brands, with their specific style, can be used in order to identify and extract characteristic styling primitives. Three spaces have been defined: the stylist space, the CAD space and the interpretation-emotional space. The CAD approach for identification and extraction of <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> has been implemented in CAD environment. The approach has been applied to the identification, extraction and characterization of <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> of French cars as well as the German cars. The application has shown a geometrical difference between the French <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> and the German <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

30|$|It {{is known}} from {{literature}} sources that in IR patterns of γ-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4, {{there are two}} main groups of <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> allowing to judge intricate structural differences. These are lines related to vibrations of М–О and М–О–Н bonds. Introduction of different metal ions into iron oxide, causing symmetry distortion of coordination environment of Fe 3 + or changes in Fe–O bond constant, can lead to the splitting or shifting of <b>characteristic</b> <b>lines</b> of Fe–O bond vibrations. In case of homogeneous distribution of ion of different nature in crystal lattice of spinel structure, we can usually observe only shift of absorption <b>line’s</b> maxima of <b>characteristic</b> oscillations.|$|R
