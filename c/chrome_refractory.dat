40|$|Most gasifiers are {{operated}} for refining, chemical production, {{and power}} generation. They are also considered a possible future source of H 2 for future power systems under consideration. A gasifier fulfills these roles by {{acting as a}} containment vessel to react carbon-containing raw materials with oxygen and water using fluidized-bed, moving-bed, or entrained-flow systems to produce CO and H 2, along with other gaseous by-products including CO 2, CH 4, SOx, HS, and/or NOx. The gasification process provides the opportunity to produce energy more efficiently and with less environmental impact than more conventional combustion processes. Because of these advantages, gasification is viewed {{as one of the}} key processes in the U. S. Department of Energy?s vision of an advanced power system for the 21 st Century. However, issues with both the reliability and the economics of gasifier operation will have to be resolved before gasification will be widely adopted by the power industry. Central to both enhanced reliability and economics is the development of materials with longer service lives in gasifier systems that can provide extended periods of continuous, trouble-free gasifier operation. The focus of the Advanced Refractories for Gasification project at the Albany Research Center (ARC) is to develop improved refractory liner materials capable of withstanding the harsh, high-temperature environment created by the gasification reaction. Current generation refractory liners in slagging gasifiers are typically replaced every 3 to 18 months at costs ranging up to $ 1, 000, 000 or more, depending upon the size of the gasification vessel. Compounding materials and installation costs are the lost-opportunity costs for the time that the gasifier is off-line for refractory repair/exchange. The goal of this project is to develop new refractory materials or to extend the service life of refractory liner materials currently used to at least 3 years. Post-mortem analyses of refractory brick removed from slagging commercial gasifiers and of laboratory produced refractory materials has indicated that slag corrosion and structural spalling are the primary causes of refractory failure. Historically, refractory materials with chrome oxide content as high as 90 pct have been found necessary to achieve the best refractory service life. To meet project goals, an improved high chrome oxide refractory material containing phosphate additions was developed at ARC, produced commercially, and is undergoing gasifier plant trials. Early laboratory tests on the high chrome oxide material suggested that phosphate additions could double the service life of currently available high chromium oxide refractories, translating into a potential savings {{of millions of dollars in}} annual gasifier operating costs, as well a significant increase in gasifier on-line availability. The ARC is also researching the potential of no-chrome/low-chrome oxide refractory materials for use in gasifiers. Some of the driving forces for no-chrome/low-chrome oxide refractories include the high cost and manufacturing difficulties of chrome oxide refractories and the fact that they have not met the performance requirements of commercial gasifiers. Development of no/low chrome oxide refractories is taking place through an examination of historical research, through the evaluation of thermodynamics, and through the evaluation of phase diagram information. This work has been followed by cup tests in the laboratory to evaluate slag/refractory interactions. Preliminary results of plant trials and the results of ARC efforts to develop no-chrome/low <b>chrome</b> <b>refractory</b> materials will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Severe slag {{attack of}} high {{temperature}} materials that line coal gasifiers {{used in the}} production of chemicals, liquid fuels, and/or electricity result in their unacceptably short lifetimes, lasting anywhere from 3 months to 24 months. Lengthening of this short service life to increase gasifier reliability and increase on-line availability of a gasifier is viewed as critical for greater technology acceptance and utilization. A phosphate containing high <b>chrome</b> oxide <b>refractory</b> has been developed by the Albany Research Center of DOE and scaled up by an industrial producer of refractories for plant trials.

40|$|An {{improved}} performance, high <b>chrome</b> oxide <b>refractory</b> for slagging gasifier applications {{has been}} developed, evaluated in field trials, {{and placed in}} commercial production. This refractory was conceived and engineered by the NETL, and produced and evaluated in collaboration with Harbison-Walker Refractories Company. Developed {{with the goal of}} reducing slag penetration and the subsequent spalling caused by slag penetration and thermal cycling, this material represents a major step forward in improving the service life of slagging gasifier refractories, and should reduce gasifier downtime caused by this type of failure. Field trial results of the NETL refractory will be discussed, along with a discussion of the known wear mechanisms in this material. The progress of NETL’s current research program to develop an alternative, non-chrome oxide refractory liner for slagging gasifiers will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Because of its {{excellent}} {{corrosion resistance}} and high temperature properties, <b>chrome</b> oxide <b>refractories</b> {{have been used}} in a number of severe service environments, including steelmaking and gasification. Refractory failure of Cr 2 O 3 /MgO or MgO/Cr 2 O 3 refractories in steelmaking can involve a phenomena called slabbing, peeling, or chemical spalling. A similar failure mechanism exists in the high chrome oxide materials used in gasification. Gasifiers contain the reaction between a carbon feedstock, water, and oxygen under reducing conditions; producing H 2 and CO used in chemicals or as fuel for power plants. A slagging gasifier typically operates between 1250 - 1575 °C, and with pressures between 300 - 1000 psi. Gasification refractory failure is by chemical dissolution and/or by spalling. Spalling is caused by slag penetration of the porous refractory surface and by expansion differences between the penetrated/non-penetrated areas, and is exacerbated by thermal cycling. Similarities between slabbing of steelmaking refractories and spalling of gasification refractories will be discussed...|$|R

However, {{in the presence of}} zinc, chrome can produce brown. Glazes with tin oxide present will often blush to pink if fumed with chrome or if chrome is present in the glaze with the tin, often intense pinks occur. If fired above cone 6, chrome will fume and become a gas in the kiln. Common saturation percentages for chrome at low saturation range from (.25 to [...]5%) and at higher percentages from (1 to 2%). <b>Chrome</b> is a <b>refractory.</b>|$|R
40|$|Slag {{attack of}} {{refractory}} materials used to line the hot face of slagging gasifiers limits their service life to between 3 and 24 months. These gasifiers use coal, petroleum coke, or combinations {{of them as}} raw materials to produce chemicals, liquid fuel, and/or electricity; with future consideration being given {{to the use of}} other abundant, low cost feedstock such as biomass. The ash from these materials generate liquid slags during gasification at temperature between 1300 - 1575 C and pressures up to 1000 psi, leading to severe slag attack of a vessel lining and causing unacceptable gasifier reliability and on-line availability. To maximize refractory life and provide protection of the gasifier metal shell, the best liners have contained a minimum of 60 - 70 pct chromia in combination with alumina, alumina/zirconia, or magnesia. The Albany Research Center of DOE has developed a phosphate containing high <b>chrome</b> oxide <b>refractory</b> liner that indicates potential for increased service life over currently used materials. This new liner has been produced commercially by a refractory company and installed in a gasifier for performance evaluation. Refractory issues in slagging gasifiers, the development and properties of the phosphate containing high chrome oxide material, and the preliminary results from the plant trial of this material will be presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{iron and}} steel {{industry}} {{is one of the most}} important industries in India. During 2014 through 2015, India was the third largest producer of raw steel and the largest producer of sponge iron in the world. The industry produced 91.46 million tons of total finished steel and 9.7 million tons of pig iron.

40|$|Gasifiers {{are high}} temperature, high {{pressure}} containment vessels used to convert carbon feedstock; such as coal or petcoke, into a synthesis gas (also called syngas) composed primarily of H 2 and CO. Syngas produced by gasification {{is used as}} a fuel in energy production, as a raw material feedstock for chemical synthesis, and can be a source of H 2 for a hydrogen based economy. Air cooled slagging gasifiers, one of several gasifier types used in industry, typically operate at temperatures between 1325 - 1575 o C, and at pressures between 300 - 1000 psi. They are lined on the hot face with high <b>chrome</b> oxide <b>refractory</b> materials; which may contain up to 95 wt pct chrome oxide, with possible additives of zirconia and alumina also present. Impurities in the carbon feedstock exist in many forms, and can be oxides of Si, Fe, Ca, Al, Na, and S in coal; with additional elements, such as Ni and V, present in petcoke. Depending on the feedstock source, the quantities of impurities generally range from one to over ten pct; leading to ash waste quantities reaching 100 tons/day, or more, in the operation of a single gasifier. Because of the high temperatures used during gasification, the ash by-products liquefy and react with, or penetrate the refractory liner pores; leading to refractory wear and corrosion, and ultimately, premature brick failure. This paper will discuss interactions between slag components and gasifier refractories, with post-mortem analysis of refractory liner failure being presented from systems using coal as a carbon feedstock...|$|R
40|$|Gasifiers {{are used}} commercially to react a carbon {{feedstock}} {{with water and}} oxygen under reducing conditions; producing chemicals used as feedstock for other processes, fuel for power plants, and/or steam used in other processes. A gasifier acts as a high temperature, high pressure reaction chamber, typically operating between 1250 - 1575 °C, and with pressures between 300 - 1000 psi. Ash that originates from mineral impurities in the carbon feedstock becomes a by-product of gasification. In a slagging gasifier it melts, forming a liquid which flows down the gasifier sidewall; penetrating and wearing away the refractory liner by corrosive dissolution, abrasive wear, or by other processes such as spalling. The refractory liner must withstand the severe service environment, protecting the steel shell against corrosive gases, temperature, and material wear. Users have identified refractory service life {{as the most important}} limitation to sustained on-line availability of gasifiers, limiting gasifier acceptance and use by industry. The National Energy Technology Laboratory in Albany, OR, has developed and patented (US Patent # 6, 815, 386) a phosphate containing high <b>chrome</b> oxide <b>refractory</b> for use in slagging gasifiers. In cooperation with ANH Refractories Company, this refractory material has been commercially produced and is undergoing field tests in commercial gasifiers. An analysis of data from these field tests indicates that the phosphate containing refractory results in an improved service life over other refractory materials currently used as gasifier liners. Results from the post-mortem analysis of the field trial in relation to the failure mechanisms in a slagging gasifier will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The SEM is an {{invaluable}} {{tool in the}} evaluation of advanced refractories and their failure. A reaction vessel?s refractory liner, at minimum, must protect the reaction vessel from elevated temperatures, corrosive slag and thermal cycling. To understand the failure mechanisms ARC staff had first to determine how an advanced <b>chrome</b> rich <b>refractory</b> was attacked by various components that make up a slag. Refractory cups were made from the refractory of interest and various compounds that {{can be found in a}} slag such as CaO, SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, NaCl were placed into the test cups and fired for 24 hours at the required temperature with the desired atmosphere. The cups are prepared for examination by embedding in epoxy and cross sectioning. SEM examination revealed how various slag compositions attacked and penetrated the refractory. The slag could corrode, free refractory grains or react with the refractory and from a new compound. It was found that the only way to measure slag component penetration was with multiple elemental X-ray maps. SiO 2 penetrated deeply and in many instances moved through the cup. The knowledge of slag refractory interactions gather during cup testing was applied to actual spent refractory from reaction vessels. Obtaining samples from the reaction vessel itself proved difficult due to time constraints imposed in relining. Samples were selected based on spent brick shape, color or location in the heap of spent refractory. Sample preparation affected the results dry, water or oil coolant during cutting may dissolve reaction products. The complex reactions between the slag and refractory made for very interesting and time consuming evaluation. Elemental X-ray maps at low and high magnification combined with point analysis aided in locating regions of interest. Crystals were found growing in voids and appear to be from vapor deposition. Other crystal structures are from the slag refractory interaction. Knowledge gathered from this and other supporting research resulted in a new patented refractory composition that resists slag penetration...|$|R
