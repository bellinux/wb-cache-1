40|$|Although {{global climate}} change has been {{identified}} as a serious global economic, social, and environmental threat to society, national governments have been slow to respond on a global scale. Environmental economic theory offers market-based solutions to address climate change efficiently through carbon control regimes, such as carbon taxation and cap-and-trade policy. A major political milestone was reached when an international agreement entered into force in 2008, known the Kyoto Protocol, which incorporated a market-based solution to address climate change on a global scale. This allowed a global market for emissions to form through the Clean Development Mechanism. Although the Kyoto Protocol aimed to address a global issue on a global scale through a single global market for emissions, fragmented sovereign cap-and-trade schemes have since emerged in the form of national and regional emission markets, commonly referred to as carbon markets. The Clean Development Mechanism offered the opportunity to generate carbon credits through carbon offset projects, such as <b>carbon</b> <b>restoration</b> projects. Although the Kyoto Protocol did not achieve the objective of forming an internationally accepted global carbon control regime, it seems to have set a trend of including offset programs in newly emerging carbon control regimes, such as South Africa’s proposed carbon tax. This study set out to assess the extent to which carbon control regimes are enabling sustainable local economic development, based on <b>carbon</b> <b>restoration</b> projects in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa using Portulacaria afra, commonly known as spekboom. As a starting point, this study assessed {{the current state of the}} international carbon markets using significant international cap-and-trade based markets as examples. Based on Newell et al. ’s (2013) selection of significant carbon markets and data availability, the United States’ Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme were selected. Historical, current and forecasted supply and demand data were gathered from Thomson Reuters’ Point Carbon research division. Further, historical futures and spot market price and volume data were gathered from the markets to compare how prices have fared over time. The Clean Development Mechanism’s market for Certified Emission Reduction credits was used for comparative purposes. The markets were found to be systemically oversupplied, leading to systemically low prices. The systemic oversupply in credits provides a limited incentive to initiate carbon offset projects, however, South Africa’s proposed carbon tax may be able to stimulate demand for domestic offset projects. Key success factors established through a comparative literature review on local economic development theory were incorporated into key informant interviews. The results were then analysed through the lens of Connelly’s (2007) model for sustainable development to provide recommendations for sustainable local economic development, regarding <b>carbon</b> <b>restoration</b> projects in the Eastern Cape using P. afra. The following opportunities were identified: the planting of P. afra on degraded land has the potential to mitigate climate change, offer water benefits to the surrounding communities, and promote biodiversity regeneration. There is potential for economic growth through job creation and the economic multiplier effect. Government funding is available and voluntary offset agreements do exist, eliminating a large portion of the cumbersome accreditation requirements. These projects also offer potential for social justice through the government funding requirements which stipulate that youth and women should be given preference for employment, potentially helping to alleviate inequality. The funding further stipulates that employees should be trained in transferable skills, offering potential for capacity building and social capital accumulation through education. These transferable skills include skills geared towards encouraging entrepreneurialism. Corresponding challenges were also found: excessive overgrazing through pastoralism has rendered some land degraded beyond restoration. Opportunists may resort to planting P. afra outside of the subtropical Albany Thicket biome to which it is endemic, leading to potential biodiversity loss rather than gains. Sufficient buy-in is required from private landowners for these projects to be sustainable, however, the projects entail a large opportunity cost to farmers as returns take at least 5 to 6 years. This may render these projects undesirable to most landowners and provides scope for free-riding, should pastoralists not have to bear the full costs of the project and property rights not be enforced through land user agreements. The projects require an exorbitant amount of upfront funding. Cash flow received from the projects does not extend in perpetuity. Requirements for social justice pertain only to government funded projects. A working model, generating and selling carbon credits through land restoration using P. afra, has not yet been established. As it stands, these <b>carbon</b> <b>restoration</b> projects are still highly speculative and carry a significant amount of investment risk, given the high mortality and low growth rates associated with the current planting method. The current systemic oversupply of carbon. credits in the international markets signal that returns from carbon credits are set to be low, at least until the oversupply issues are resolved. Should these challenges be overcome, <b>carbon</b> <b>restoration</b> projects using P. afra may have the potential to bolster sustainable local economic development in the impoverished regions of province as well as provide a locally-driven adaptation and mitigation strategy to address {{global climate change}}...|$|E
40|$|A {{vapor phase}} based {{silylation}} process {{was used to}} restore plasma damaged porous ultra low-kappa SiOCH dielectric films. The process was carried out with eleven different silylation agents. After processing of blanked wafers, the restoration performance was characterized by different analytic techniques like Fourier Infrared and Auger electron spectroscopy as well as contact angle and mercury probe measurements. Quantum mechanics calculations and practical results suggest three repair chemicals having two reactive groups to be most promising. However, a comparable electrical improvement, i. e. kappa-value improvement was achieved with chemicals having one reactive group. A thin dielectric layer formation {{was found to be}} one explanation for this effect. This is supported by a high surface free energy recovery after the repair process, without carbon incorporation near the surface.

30|$|It is {{concluded}} that the sites of rice-sugarcane rotation had greater soil water retention at FC and PWP, due to higher clay content in the soils. This has the implication on better management of rainwater {{as well as the}} irrigation water which is supplied from reservoir through canal systems. There will be better water holding capacity in these soils, and less loss of water due to deep percolation. As the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the sites of rice-sugarcane was less, the construction of water storage structures will be successful for multiple purposes like fish culture and providing irrigation to crops during dry spells. Since bulk density was slightly higher, it is {{concluded that}} the soils are mostly compact especially in the lower layers, and have less organic matter. Soils of rice-sugarcane rotation showed comparatively low bulk density due to greater organic matter. Soil organic carbon (SOC) status was low (0.34 - 0.95 %); soils with rice-sugarcane rotation system had greater organic carbon storage than other rice-based systems. The SOC storage information would help for future crop planning concerning soil organic <b>carbon</b> <b>restoration</b> and other soil properties especially for this command.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the motivations for pursuing and issues in obtaining either a Chain of Custody or Forest Management Certification through The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in community forestry enterprises in Mexico. The seven professionals interviewed for this study represent more than 100 collective years of experience with FSC certifications. A majority of participants identified a lack of business, technical and basic forestry skills as major hurdles for achieving FSC certification. A lack of understanding on the part of community foresters regarding the social equity aspect of FSC certifications was also expressed. Almost all participants identified access to external markets as a primary motivation for forestry operations to obtain FSC certification. Surprisingly, an expectation of price-premium markets for certified wood products was not a primary motivating factor in seeking certification. A more in-depth study focusing directly on community forestry operations in Mexico is needed to develop innovative solutions to the problems faced by foresters there. Future work should look to help ejidos find long-term solutions that will help protect biodiversity, reduce illegal logging, will make legal forestry enterprises economically viable, and that will benefit the people and families involved in community forestry operations.

Earthworm aspects of organic farming are twofold: ‘waste’ recycling through compost worms and soil enhancement from endemic field worms. Bio-physico-chemical benefits from sustained earthworm activity accrue for biodiversity, {{soil organic matter}} (SOM = worm-worked humus) derived from carbon sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 via photosynthesis/humification and nitrogen N 2 fixation from microbes rather than synthetic Haber-Bosch urea, plus greatly improved infiltration and soil-water-storage. Just as earthworm burrows filter all rainwater, all atmospheric carbon from leaf litter/roots is processed through their intestines in 12 yr cycles as they build topsoil. Earth’s total soil data are not readily available, but flat-surface estimates with ranges of 2, 400 - 6, 020 Gt of topsoil humus are newly recalculated herein as 10, 800 - 27, 090 Gt containing 6, 264 - 15, 712 Gt SOC with a median value > 10, 000 Gt global soil carbon. <b>Carbon</b> <b>restoration</b> in this humus resource alone has potential for rapid reduction of Mauna Loa’s 400 ppm atmospheric CO 2 by 100 ppm, i. e., to pre-industrial levels. This review highlights that organic husbandry – with earthworms at its core – offsets CO 2 emissions (remediation) while moisture, pH, and soil temperatures simultaneously improve, increasing crop resilience and biodiversity (mitigation & adaptation). Earthworms naturally monitor & maintain healthy soils thereby solving human-generated climate & critical species extinction problems at both local & global scale.

40|$|Pastoralism {{is rarely}} {{viewed as a}} major future form of land use, because of well- {{documented}} cases of rangeland degradation, attributed to irrational overstocking by pastoralists, and the subsequent losses of ecosystem services. However, pastoralists were actually encouraged to settle and adopt such strategies, copied from rangelands with higher and more reliable rainfall. This curtailed mobility resulted in a shift from opportunistic and extensive land use to more intensive and settled forms of use. The purpose of this review {{is to examine the}} link between pastoralism and the provision of ecosystem services by rangelands, focusing on biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. Pastoralists employ several techniques to manage rangeland resources, including mobility, herding, corralling, grazing reserves and the use of re. With these strategies, pastoralists have contributed to the enhancement of rangeland biodiversity and the long-term conservation of important wildlife habitats. Pastoralists also possess detailed knowledge of rangeland plants and their uses, which could be valuable in the assessment, conservation and utilisation of rangeland biodiversity. Similarly, traditional pastoral rangeland management practices, {{such as the use of}} seasonal grassland reserves and livestock mobility, in uence vegetation composition, coverage and abundance in rangelands and offer tools for biomass and soil <b>carbon</b> <b>restoration,</b> contributing to the mitigation of climate change. However, various internal and external factors have curtailed traditional management practices and livestock mobility, breaking the co-evolved balance of vegetation, wildlife and land use, thus exposing rangeland to continued livestock pressure, which often leads to degradation. Rather than abandoning pastoralism, the revitalisation of traditional practices and indigenous knowledge is vital to secure sustainable livelihoods for millions of pastoralists and to maintain rangeland biodiversity and ecosystem services...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSemi-arid {{succulent}} thicket in South Africa {{has experienced}} extensive livestock-induced transformation, reflected in extensive structural changes {{and loss of}} biodiversity, biomass and soil carbon. The ecological mechanisms contributing to this transformation are not fully understood but are believed to include the breakdown of ecosystem processes including litter production and decomposition, which are rate-limiting steps in nutrient cycling and incorporation of organic matter into the soil. In this study we investigated the effect of transformation on litter production and decomposition in succulent thicket. We measured litter production and decomposition of four dominant perennial woody plants (Euclea undulata, Pappea capensis, Portulacaria afra and Rhus longispina) across replicated fenceline contrasts. Litter production was measured over 14  months using mesh traps. Decomposition was measured over 15  months {{using a combination of}} litterbags and leaf packs. Litter production in succulent thicket was very high for a semi-arid system (approaching that of temperate forests), with the leaf- and stem-succulent P. afra contributing the largest component. Transformation caused a significant reduction in litter production at a landscape scale (4126 vs 2881  kg/ha/yr), primarily due to reduced cover of P. afra. Surprisingly, transformation had few significant effects on the rate of decomposition of litter, possibly due to a switch from biotic to abiotic decomposition processes. The perennial vegetation in succulent thicket, particularly P. afra, appears to {{play a critical role in}} the maintenance of the ecosystem by facilitating the incorporation of organic matter into soil. Transformation of succulent thicket leads to a disruption of the carbon cycle, ultimately resulting in degradation of the ecosystem. Successful restoration is likely to depend on increasing the rates of organic matter return to soils.

The pooled results for 24 yrs (1984 - 85 to 2008 - 09) revealed that the highest system productivity (7. 14 t/ha) was recorded with application of 50 % RDF through inorganic + 50 % N through FYM to sorghum and 100 % RDF to wheat crop in sequence which was comparable to inorganic fertilizer application i. e. 100 % RDF to both crops. Maximum net monetary return (48, 698 Rs/ha), and B:C ratio (3. 05) was observed with 50 % RDF through inorganic + 50 % N through FYM to kharif sorghum and 100 % RDF to wheat. Application of RDF through inorganic fertilizer to both crops showed consistency in yield even after 24 years. Reduction in yield was noticed under reduced fertilizer doses. However, increased yield was noticed due to integration of fertilizers. Substitution of 25 % and 50 % N applied through crop residue, leucaena lopping and FYM produced comparable and higher yield over 100 % NPK through inorganic fertilizer. Integration of nutrients resulted in built up of organic C to the extend of 6. 35 g/kg of soil as against 0. 42 gram per kg soil at the initiation of experiment (1984 - 85) The available nutrient status after 24 years was 407, 45 and 441 NPK kg/ha respectively as against initial values of 209, 11 and 350 NPK kg/ha respectively. The higher value of sustainable yield index (0. 57) was noticed with integration of nutrients i. e. 50 % N through inorganic + 50 % N through FYM followed by 100 % NPK to wheat through inorganic source. Sorghum-Wheat crop sequence was more sustainable when integration of nutrients through crop residue (0. 45) Leucaena lopping (0. 53) and FYM (0. 57) were taken with inorganic fertilizer. Marginal improvement in pH and EC was observed with integration of nutrients. Drastic reduction in crop yield and decline in soil fertility was observed with control.

40|$|Peatlands are {{important}} terrestrial <b>carbon</b> stores. <b>Restoration</b> of degraded peatlands to restore ecosystem services {{is a major}} area of conservation effort. Monitoring is crucial to judge {{the success of this}} restoration. Remote sensing is a potential tool to provide landscape-scale information on the habitat condition. Using an empirical modelling approach, this paper aims to use airborne hyperspectral image data with ground vegetation survey data to model vegetation abundance for a degraded upland blanket bog in the United Kingdom (UK), which is undergoing restoration. A predictive model for vegetation abundance of Plant Functional Types (PFT) was produced using a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and applied to the whole restoration site. A sensitivity test on the relationships between spectral data and vegetation abundance at PFT and single species level confirmed that PFT was the correct scale for analysis. The PLSR modelling allows selection of variables based upon the weighted regression coefficient of the individual spectral bands, showing which bands have the most influence on the model. These results suggest that the SWIR has less value for monitoring peatland vegetation from hyperspectral images than initially predicted. RMSE values for the validation data range between 10 % and 16 % cover, indicating that the models can be used as an operational tool, considering the subjective nature of existing vegetation survey results. These predicted coverage images are the first quantitative landscape scale monitoring results to be produced for the site. High resolution hyperspectral mapping of PFTs has the potential to assess recovery of peatland systems at landscape scale for the first time.

40|$|Inclusion of {{improved}} forest management {{as a way}} to enhance carbon sinks in the Copenhagen Accord of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (December 2009) suggests that forest restoration will play a role in global climate change mitigation under the post-Kyoto agreement. Although discussions about restoration strategies often pertain solely to severely degraded tropical forests and invoke only the enrichment planting option, different approaches to restoration are needed to counter the full range of degrees of degradation. We propose approaches for restoration of forests that range from being slightly to severely degraded. Our methods start with ceasing the causes of degradation and letting forests regenerate on their own, progress through active management of natural regeneration in degraded areas to accelerate tree regeneration and growth, and finally include the stage of degradation at which re-planting is necessary. We argue that when the appropriate techniques are employed, forest restoration is cost-effective relative to conventional planting, provides abundant social and ecological co-benefits, and results in the sequestration of substantial amounts of <b>carbon.</b> For forest <b>restoration</b> efforts to succeed, a supportive post-Kyoto agreement is needed as well as appropriate national policies, institutional arrangements, and local participation...|$|R

Yet the UNFCCC's goal {{is defined}} as a stock (atmospheric GHG concentration). Flow inventories are apt for the fossil fuel sector where flows are effectively one way, stock changes are almost entirely anthropogenic, and stocks are stable in the absence of human perturbation. For the land sector, flow-based GHG inventories obscure fundamental differences between ecosystems: in their <b>carbon</b> stock stability, <b>restoration</b> capacity, and density. This paper presents a national carbon accounting framework that is comprehensive and includes stocks as well as flows for reservoirs, lands and activities continuously over time.

30|$|Agroforestry in India {{contributes}} to the target set by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research for increasing forest cover from the present level of 23 % of land area to 33 %. The Report of the Task Force of Greening India for Livelihood Security and Sustainable Development (Planning Commission 2001) has suggested that 10 million ha of irrigated land and 18 million ha of rain-fed land should be managed under agroforestry systems. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report on Climate Change (McCarthy et al. 2001) has recognised the potential of agroforestry for addressing multiple problems and delivering a range of economic, environmental and socioeconomic benefits. Estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of agroforestry systems range from 0.7 - 1.6 Gt (Trexler and Haugen, 1994) to 6.3 Gt (Brown et al., 1996). Secondary environmental benefits include food availability, security of land tenure, increased farm income, restoration and maintenance of above- and below-ground <b>carbon</b> storage capacity, <b>restoration</b> and maintenance of biodiversity, and maintenance of watershed hydrology and soil conservation. Agro ecosystems can be designed to assist adaptation of communities and households to local and global change (Van Ardenne et al. 2003).|$|R

40|$|The {{extensive}} deforestation {{and degradation}} of tropical forests {{is a significant}} contributor {{to the loss of}} biodiversity and to global warming. Restoration could potentially mitigate the impacts of deforestation, yet knowledge on how to efficiently allocate funding for restoration is still in its infancy. We systematically prioritize investments in restoration in the tropical landscape of East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and through this application demonstrate the capacity to account for a diverse suite of restoration techniques and forests of varying condition. To achieve this we develop a map of forest degradation for the region, characterized on the basis of aboveground biomass and differentiated by broad forest types. We estimate the costs of restoration as well as the benefits in terms of carbon sequestration and improving the suitability of habitat for threatened mammals through time. When the objective is solely to enhance <b>carbon</b> stocks, then <b>restoration</b> of highly degraded lowland forest is the most cost-effective activity. However, if the objective is to improve the habitat of threatened species, multiple forest types should be restored and this reduces the accumulated carbon by up to 24 %. Our analysis framework provides a transparent method for prioritizing where and how restoration should occur in heterogeneous landscapes in order to maximize the benefits for carbon and biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have highlighted the dire prospects for biodiversity in fragmented agricultural landscapes and {{stressed the need}} for increasing the area of, and connectivity between, natural ecosystems. Some have advocated the use of naturally regenerating forest ecosystems for sequestering atmospheric carbon, with opportunities for dual <b>restoration</b> and <b>carbon</b> benefits. However, no studies have explicitly explored the feasibility of obtaining such dual benefits from a regenerating woody ecosystem. This thesis aims to provide a detailed assessment of the <b>restoration</b> and <b>carbon</b> potential of Brigalow regrowth, an extensive naturally regenerating ecosystem throughout the pastoral regions of north eastern Australia. It combines observational, experimental and modelling techniques to describe the agricultural legacy of pastoral development, identify constraints to restoration and explore methods to remove these constraints. A review of existing ecological knowledge of Brigalow ecosystems is provided in chapter 3, along with discussion of policy and socio-economic issues that are likely to influence how and to what extent regrowth is utilised for <b>restoration</b> and <b>carbon</b> purposes in the Brigalow Belt. The review found restoring regrowth is likely to have benefits {{for a wide range of}} native flora and fauna, including the endangered bridled nailtail wallaby. Knowledge gaps exist relating to the landscape ecology of Brigalow regrowth and the impacts of management and climate change on <b>carbon</b> and <b>restoration</b> potential. Also, a conflict exists between short-term carbon sequestration and long-term restoration goals. Regional demand for high biomass regrowth as a carbon offset is likely to be high but ambiguities in carbon policy threaten to diminish the use of natural regrowth for reforestation projects. A large cross-sectional study of regrowth is presented in chapter 4. Data were analysed using multi-level / hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). Firstly, we found that repeated attempts at clearing Brigalow regrowth increases stem densities and densities remain high over the long term, particularly in high rainfall areas and on clay soils with deep gilgais. Secondly, higher density stands have slower biomass accumulation and structural development in the long term. Spatial extrapolations of the HBMs indicated that the central and eastern parts of the study region are most environmentally suitability for biomass accumulation, however these may not correspond to the areas that historically supported the highest biomass Brigalow forests. We conclude that <b>carbon</b> and <b>restoration</b> goals are largely congruent within regions of similar climate. At the regional scale however, spatial prioritisation of <b>restoration</b> and <b>carbon</b> projects may only be aligned in areas with higher carbon potential. Given the importance of stem density in determining <b>restoration</b> and <b>carbon</b> potential, an experimental thinning trial was established in dense Brigalow regrowth in southern Queensland (chapter 5). Four treatments were applied in a randomised block design and growth and mortality of a subset of stems was monitored for two years. Data were analysed using mixed-effects models and HBMs and the latter were subsequently used to parameterise an individual-based simulation model of stand structural development and biomass accumulation over 50 years. The main findings of this study were that growth and mortality of stems is influenced by the amount of space available to each stem (a neighbourhood effect) and that thinning accelerates structural development and increases woody species diversity. The examination of neighbourhood effects is taken further by considering drought-related mortality in a Eucalyptus savanna ecosystem (chapter 6). For this work a multi-faceted approach was employed including spatial pattern analyses and statistical models of stem survival to test three competing hypotheses relating to neighbourhood effects on drought related tree mortality. The main finding of this study was that neighbour density and microsite effects both influence drought-related mortality and the observed patterns can readily be explained by an interaction between these two factors. As a whole, this thesis contributes the following scientific insights: (1) <b>restoration</b> and <b>carbon</b> goals may be aligned for naturally regenerating woody ecosystems, but the degree of goal congruence will vary across the landscape in question, (2) while some woody ecosystems retain an excellent capacity to regenerate naturally, the agricultural legacy may still have long term effects on <b>restoration</b> and <b>carbon</b> potential, (3) neighbourhood effects that operate at the stem scale strongly influence dynamics at the ecosystem scale...|$|R

Restoration of other bioregional habitats could yield additional socio-ecological benefits.
