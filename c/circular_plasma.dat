40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{characteristics}} of high+, low-q disruptions {{have been studied}} in PBX-M, a device with a nearby conducting shell. The coupling between {{the wall and the}} plasma was varied by choosing different plasma shapes, including nearly <b>circular</b> <b>plasmas,</b> D-shaped plasmas and bean-shaped plasmas (indented on the midplane), and by increasing the effective coverage of the plasma by the shell.

40|$|Abstract — When {{designing}} the control loops for tokamaks, {{it is important}} to acknowledge the effects of time delays. An assumption sometimes made for tokamaks having supercon-ducting coils is that these extra time delays will not have any undesirable effects on control. In fact, introducing extra delays into the axisymmetric control loops of certain superconducting tokamaks can have significant detrimental consequences. Aside from qualitative observations, the detrimental effects of extra time delays in tokamak control loops are not always well understood outside the control community. This study exposes and quantifies the detrimental effects imposed by time delays in the control loop in superconducting tokamaks, by focusing on plasma current control and radial position control in a vertically stable <b>circular</b> <b>plasma</b> in the KSTAR tokamak. Delays in the power supplies, data acquisition, and vessel structure are taken into account. Extremum-seeking-based optimal tuning of PID controllers is proposed as a possible method for remediating the negative effects of time delays. The Nyquist dual locus technique is employed to assess stability of the optimally tuned closed-loop system in the presence of time delays. I...|$|E

Quantitative agreement is found between this model scaling and experimental density width measured in Tore Supra, over a large set of plasma conditions. The sensitivity to control parameters (major radius, safety factor and normalized Larmor radius) is roughly explained by {{the sensitivity of the}} blob velocity model.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of an initially unmagnetized planar rarefaction wave {{has recently been}} shown to trigger a thermal anisotropy-driven Weibel instability (TAWI), which can generate magnetic fields from noise levels. It is examined here if the TAWI can also grow in a curved rarefaction wave. The {{expansion of}} an initially unmagnetized <b>circular</b> <b>plasma</b> cloud, which consists of protons and hot electrons, into a vacuum is modelled for this purpose with a two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. It is shown that the momentum transfer from the electrons to the radially accelerating protons can indeed trigger a TAWI. Radial current channels form and the aperiodic growth of a magnetowave is observed, which has a magnetic field that is oriented orthogonal to the simulation plane. The induced electric field implies that the electron density gradient is no longer parallel to the electric field. Evidence is presented here for that this electric field modification triggers a second magnetic instability, which results in a rotational low-frequency magnetowave.

In order to sustain the RS operation towards steady-state, an off-axis current drive with a lower hybrid wave at 2. 45 GHz is used to control the current profile. A steady-state RS discharge is formed and sustained until the LH power is turned off; the plasma confinement is enhanced with the development of an internal transport barrier. In the RS discharges with shaped plasma geometry, a double transport barrier is developed.

The various control systems at the start, in 1982, {{were based on}} analogue techniques, a standard at the time, and were later partly replaced by specially developed digital systems. These systems proved their robustness over the years. As a replacement for the old system, off-the-shelf products were used to ensure continuity, reliability and to reduce the development cost. To provide advanced control scenarios, the new system allows the implementation of more sophisticated algorithms for magnetic and kinetic control. The LabVIEW Real-Time (RT) modules and real-time hardware from National Instruments satisfy these requirements to a large extent. The new system has already been successfully commissioned at TEXTOR and {{is used to calculate}} in real-time the plasma density profile (10 ms), the Shafranov shift (10 ms), the plasma vertical and horizontal position (20 mu s) and to control the plasma shape (1 ms). TEXTOR has <b>circular</b> <b>plasmas</b> and has an iron core. Its central part is operated in saturation.

There is ample evidence that beta(2) -glycoprotein I (beta(2) GPI) is the major antigen for antiphospholipid antibodies. The auto-antibodies recognize beta(2) GPI when bound to anionic surfaces and not in solution. We showed by electron microscopy studies, MALDI-TOF MS, LC/MS-MS that beta(2) GPI can exist in at least two different conformations, a <b>circular</b> <b>plasma</b> conformation and an 'activated' open conformation. We also showed with surface plasmon resonance that the closed, circular conformation is maintained by interaction between the first and fifth domain of beta(2) GPI. By changing pH and salt concentration, we were able to convert the conformation of beta(2) GPI from the closed to the open conformation and back. In the activated open conformation, a cryptic epitope in the first domain becomes exposed that enables patient antibodies to bind and form an antibody-beta(2) GPI complex. We also demonstrate that the open conformation of beta(2) GPI prolonged the aPTT when added to normal plasma, while the aPTT is even further prolonged by addition of anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies. The conformational change of beta(2) GPI and the influence of the auto-antibodies may have important consequences for our understanding of the antiphospholipid syndrom...|$|E

The number density of mobile protons is thus less than that of the electrons. The protons of the rarefaction wave are accelerated to 1 / 10 of the electron thermal speed, and the acceleration results in a thermal anisotropy of the electron distribution in the entire plasma cloud.

In TFTR, 5 g of tritium were injected into <b>circular</b> <b>plasmas</b> over a 3. 5 year period, mostly by neutral-beam injection. In JET, 35 g were injected into divertor plasmas over a 6 month campaign, mostly by gas puffing. In TFTR, the bumper limiter provided a large source of eroded carbon {{and a major}} part of tritium was co-deposited on the limiter and vessel wall. Only a small area of the co-deposit flaked off. In JET, the wall is a net erosion area, and co-deposition occurs principally in shadowed parts of the inner divertor, with heavy flaking. In both machines, the initial tritium retention, after a change from deuterium [D] to tritium [T] gas puffing, is high and is due to isotope exchange with deuterium on plasma-facing surfaces (dynamic inventory). The contribution of co-deposition is lower but cumulative, and is revealed by including periods of D fueling that reversed the T/D isotope exchange. Ion beam analysis of flakes from TFTR showed an atomic D/C ratio of 0. 13 on the plasma facing surface, 0. 25 on the back surface and 0. 11 in the bulk. Data from a JET divertor tile showed a larger D/C ratio with 46 % C, 30 % D, 20 % H and 4 % O. Deuterium, tritium, and beryllium profiles have been measured and show a thin less than 50 micron co-deposited layer.

The method is quite general and {{can be applied to}} any <b>circular</b> low-beta <b>plasma</b> once suitable boundary conditions are imposed. In particular, due to its characteristics, it is appropriate for describing the Reversed Field Pinch (RFP) configuration. The curvilinear metric of the toroidal geometry is described by adopting flux co-ordinates, and the magnetic field is expressed by the contravariant representation with two independent potentials. The method leads to a system of Newcomb-like equations in the two independent potentials for modes with the same toroidal n-number and poloidal mode number m coupled by toroidicity. The advantage of this description is that the potentials together with the metric coefficients can be related in a straightforward manner to the magnetic field. Moreover it is formally simple and maintains a similarity with the cylindrical treatment. Indeed it is customary in RFPs to approach the analysis of MHD instabilities by using cylindrical geometry.

As the intemal kink mode is a weak instability, accurate equilibrium solutions {{are required to}} determine its stability boundaries. For this purpose, a numerical equilibrium code called CHEASE using Hermite bicubic elements has been developed. The code computes equilibria and provides a mapping to flux coordinates for MHD stability calculations. Several test cases are studied to show the convergence rate of the equilibrium. Convergence tests are also presented for the eigenvalues of the stability calculations when the equilibrium mesh is varied. Using CHEASE and the toroidal resistive MHD stability code MARS, effects of current profile, plasma cross-section and resistivity on {{the stability of the}} internal kink mode are investigated for tokamak equilibria. The results show that the internal kink mode is more unstable than previously thought. The numerical ideal stability results for a <b>circular</b> <b>plasma</b> cross section are compared with the results obtained by an analytic large aspect ratio expansion. It is found that the internal kink is significantly destabilized by the ellipticity of the plasma cross section combined with low shear. A large aspect ratio expansion of the Mercier and the resistive interchange criteria retaining effects of ellipticity and triangularity is given, showing analytically the destabilization by ellipticity. For resistive internal kink modes, the stabilizing effect of small aspect ratio is confirmed, but as for the ideal case, the stability is very sensitive with respect to shaping of the plasma cross section.

At the Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) in-vessel poloidal field coils driven by fast switching power supplies are used to stabilize highly elongated plasmas.

In order to excite the poloidal mode resonance, we use either an initial or a continuous velocity perturbation {{to drive the}} system.

It is found that with the initial perturbation alone, no polodial mode resonance can be obtained and the initially localized perturbation spreads out across all magnetic L shells. With the continuous perturbation, oscillating near the poloidal resonance frequency, a global-scale poloidal cavity mode can be obtained. For the first time, a localized guided poloidal mode resonance is obtained when a radial component of electric field {{is added to the}} initial perturbation such that the curl of the electric field is everywhere perpendicular to the background dipole magnetic field. During the localized poloidal resonance, plasma vortices parallel/antiparallel to the background dipole magnetic field B(sub 0). This circular flow, elongated radially, results in twisting of magnetic field flux tubes, which, in turn, leads to the slowdown of the <b>circular</b> <b>plasma</b> flow and reversal of the plasma vortices. The energy associated with the localized poloidal resonance is conserved as it shifts {{back and forth between the}} oscillating plasma vortices and the alternately twisted magnetic flux tubes. In the simulations the eigenfunctions associated with the localized poloidal resonance are grid-scale singular functions. This result indicates that ideal MHD is inadequate to describe the underlying problem and nonideal MHD effects are needed for mode broadening...|$|E
5000|$|Microvesicles (sometimes called, {{circulating}} microvesicles, or microparticles) are {{a type of}} extracellular vesicle (EV). Microvesicles are <b>circular</b> {{fragments of}} <b>plasma</b> membrane ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm shed from almost all cell types. Not {{to be confused with}} smaller intracellularly generated extracellular vesicles known as exosomes. Microvesicles play a role in intercellular communication and can transport mRNA, miRNA, and proteins between cells. [...] Microvesicles have been implicated in the process of a remarkable anti-tumor reversal effect in cancer, tumor immune suppression, metastasis, tumor-stroma interactions and angiogenesis along with having a primary role in tissue regeneration. They originate directly from the plasma membrane of the cell and reflect the antigenic content of the cells from which they originate.They remove misfolded proteins, cytotoxic agents and metabolic waste from the cell.|$|R
40|$|The Neptunian {{magnetosphere}} periodically changes every {{eight hours}} between a pole-on magnetosphere {{with only one}} polar cusp and an earth-type magnetosphere with two polar cusps. In the pole-on configuration, the tail current sheet has an almost <b>circular</b> shape with <b>plasma</b> currents closing entirely within the magnetosphere. Eight hours later the tail current sheet assumes an almost flat shape with plasma currents touching the magnetotail boundary and closing over the tail magnetopause. Magnetic field and tail current sheet configurations have been calculated in a three-dimensional model, but the plasma- and thermodynamic conditions were investigated in a simplified two-dimensional MHD equilibrium magnetosphere. It {{was found that the}} free energy in the tail region of the two-dimensional model becomes independent of the dipole tilt angle. It is conjectured that the Neptunian magnetotail might assume quasi-static equilibrium states that make the free energy of the system independent of its daily rotation...|$|R
40|$|MasterMonitoring {{impurity}} behaviors {{is extremely}} important to sustain the burning plasmas such as ITER. Accumulation of the impurities in the core may induce radiation cooling {{in the core of}} the plasma and energy balance at the divertor region is dominated by impurity distribution {{at the edge of the}} plasma. Impurities in burning plasmas consist of two branches: dominant species are from the first wall material such as Carbon (C), Tungsten (W), Iron (Fe) through erosion processthe other species are from externally injected materials for diagnostics and operational purpose. An impurity transport simulation code, Multiple Ionization State Transport (MIST), which is designed for <b>circular</b> cross-section <b>plasma,</b> has been used to study the radial distribution of impurities in various charge states in ITER-like plasma parameters. Assuming symmetry in all but the radial direction (cylindrical geometry), the plasma has been divided into 50 radial zones from the plasma center to the scrape off layer. Radial plasma profiles of electron and ion temperature, electron and ion density, and safety factor are used in this study. Study of impurity distribution has been investigated in both time independent (steady-state) and time-dependent cases. Here, the impurity profiles include charge state density, effective atomic number, local and total radiation power, line emission and brightness for variety possible impurity species, etc. Furthermore, in time independent case the impurity transport coefficients have been determined by comparing the code results with other calculated results of radiation power profile...|$|R
