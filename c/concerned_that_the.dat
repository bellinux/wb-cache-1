5|$|While Roddenberry, Kelley and Nimoy {{gave their}} {{approval}} to the revised script, Paramount was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film would go over-budget as written and ordered cuts. Shatner's envisioned angels and demons at the film's climax {{were converted to}} rock monsters that the false god would animate from the earth. Shatner wanted six of the creatures, but was forced to accept just one. <b>Concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> franchise's momentum following The Voyage Home had disappeared, Paramount rushed the film into production in late 1988 despite the writers' strike cutting into pre-production.|$|E
5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. <b>Concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Pacts of May, {{which ended}} the near-war {{tensions}} between Argentina and Chile, Argentina sold its two armored cruisers, Rivadavia and Moreno, that were under construction in Italy to Japan. Constitución and Libertad were put up for sale in early 1903. While the United Kingdom was not entirely interested in the ships, international politics took precedence: when the Russian Empire made an offer for the ships, the British grew <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Swiftsure class could be used against their new ally Japan. To prevent this, the British purchased both Chilean battleships on 3 December 1903 for £2,432,000.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E

5|$|By 1959 the United States was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> militarization of the Kola Peninsula {{would become}} the prime source of a Soviet attack on North America. A new {{discussion}} about location arose, with Alta and Kautokeino as the main alternatives. Banak was estimated to cost NOK4.9 million, NOK2.8 million less than Alta, had better instrument landing and weather conditions and allowed a longer runway.

The government and Parliament approved construction of Banak in 1959 on condition that it receive NATO funding.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall.

5|$|Cromwell's Castle is an {{artillery}} tower, built by Sir Robert Blake following the Parliamentary {{invasion of the}} Isles of Scilly in 1651. During the English Civil War between 1642 and 1646, {{the inhabitants of the}} Isles had been Royalist supporters of King Charles I, and rebelled against Parliament in favour of Charles in 1648. Tresco became a base for Royalist privateers and Parliament became <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dutch, then hostile to England, might exploit the situation, or that Royalist Irish forces might use the islands for an attack on England. In 1651 Parliament sent Robert Blake and a naval force to retake the island, which had been fortified by the Royalists.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Department of Energy, {{which had}} succeeded the Atomic Energy Commission, decided {{that since the}} Dayton sites already had been decontaminated, they did not warrant {{inclusion}} in the Army Corps of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). However, the local community in Dayton were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cleanup did not meet 21st century environmental standards. Therefore, the state of Ohio asked the United States Congress to have the Army Corps of Engineers conduct a review. This {{was carried out in}} 2004 and 2005. The review concluded that no radioactive contaminants were found that would warrant inclusion in FUSRAP.|$|E

5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
