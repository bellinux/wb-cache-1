40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} decellularized cartilage-derived matrix (CDM) scaffolds, by itself and as a composite scaffold with a calcium phosphate (<b>CaP)</b> <b>base,</b> for the repair of osteochondral defects. It was hypothesized that the chondral defects would heal with fibrocartilaginous tissue and that the composite scaffold would result in better bone formation. METHODS: After an 8 -week pilot experiment in a single horse, scaffolds were implanted in eight healthy horses in osteochondral defects on the medial trochlear ridge of the femur. In one joint a composite CDM-CaP scaffold was implanted (+P), in the contralateral joint a CDM only (-P) scaffold. After euthanasia at 6 months, tissues were analysed by histology, immunohistochemistry, micro-CT, biochemistry and biomechanical evaluation. RESULTS: The 8 -week pilot showed encouraging formation of bone and cartilage, but incomplete defect filling. At 6 months, micro-CT and histology showed much more limited filling of the defect, but the CaP component of the +P scaffolds was well integrated with the surrounding bone. The repair tissue was fibrotic with high collagen type I and low type II content and with no {{differences between the groups}}. There were also no biochemical differences between the groups and repair tissue was much less stiff than normal tissue (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: The implants failed to produce reasonable repair tissue in this osteochondral defect model, although the <b>CaP</b> <b>base</b> in the -P group integrated well with the recipient bone. The study stresses the importance of long-term in vivo studies to assess the efficacy of cartilage repair techniques...|$|E
40|$|In bridge design, {{economically}} addressing large, lateral earth {{pressures on}} bridge abutments {{is a major}} challenge. Traditional approaches employ enlargement of the abutment components to resist these pressures. This approach results in higher construction costs. As an alternative, a formal approach using ground anchors to resist lateral soil pressure on bridge abutments is proposed herein. The ground anchors are designed to minimise lateral forces at the pile <b>cap</b> <b>base.</b> Design examples for high stem abutments (heights 6 – 8 m) are conducted for a simple 33 m long concrete bridge span, with two to three traffic lanes. The abutments are supported by driven, reinforced concrete piles. As lateral forces at the pile cap are significantly reduced, only one row of piles is needed. When compared with common abutment design, the proposed approach halved the number of piles required and decreased the required abutment volume by 37 %...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} clinical need for bone substitutes {{because of the}} limited supply of autogenous tissue, and the significance of inherited or other bone diseases. The ultimate {{aim of this study}} was to form calcium phosphate (<b>CaP)</b> <b>based</b> matrices as bone grafts for medical applications. Amongst <b>CaP</b> <b>based</b> materials, <b>CaP</b> gels made by the sol-gel process have attracted much interest since they can be processed at room temperature allowing the incorporation of environmentally sensitive molecules such as growth factors. CaP gels can be engineered by changing process conditions. There is little previous work however on the effect of drying regimes on the CaP materials formed using the sol-gel process. The objectives of this research were to investigate the influence of drying conditions on the physicochemical properties of CaP gels and the effect of the resultant structures of CaP gels on the function of the incorporated therapeutic molecules. In addition, surface modification of the CaP gels was investigated as a means to enhance biological interaction and also a potential way of creating primary bonds between apatite crystals enabling mechanical reinforcement of the material, which is currently too weak to bear load. This work has confirmed that different drying regimes have a significant influence on the formation of the gel pore structure, with the storage of gel in humid conditions, enabling reprecipitation of an apatitic phase. This variation in pore structure has a significant influence on the catalytic of encapsulated enzymes. In addition, the pH fluctuation of <b>CaP</b> <b>based</b> matrices during processing determines the activity of biomolecules after incorporation. It has also been shown that it is possible to form thiol functional groups on the surface of CaP gels, which could be used in future for mechanical reinforcement or for the attachment of biological moieties.

40|$|International audienceThe {{new type}} of {{efficient}} pervaporative separation hybrid materials based on cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) and doped with 1 -methyl- 3 -(4 -vinylbenzyl) - 1 H-imidazol- 3 -ium chloride polymerizable ionic liquid (PIL) monomers (12. 3 – 44. 4 wt%) were elaborated for dehydration of propan- 2 -ol. Broad material and physicochemical characterization of membranes was performed including assessment of physicochemical, equilibrium, transport, and separation properties. Incorporation of PIL results in the plasticization of <b>CAP</b> <b>based</b> membranes. Additionally, with increasing loading of PIL from 12. 3 to 44. 4 wt% values of thickness-normalized Pervaporation Separation Index (PSIN) increase 1. 6 – 2. 4 times comparing to unloaded membrane (pure CAP). The distance parameters calculated {{on the base of}} the Hansen's solubility parameters were additionally employed to interpret swelling and pervaporative properties of membranes as well as to discuss interactions between solvents and prepared membranes. Lower value of distance parameter between pristine CAP and ethanol corresponds to the highest molar swelling degree of <b>CAP</b> <b>based</b> membranes. Swelling of CAP-PIL membranes in contact with water, ethanol, and propan- 2 -ol increased with of the increasing PIL content due to the hydrophilic character of ionic liquid. The gathered data provided insight into the potential applicability of the novel hybrid separation materials for pervaporative separation of liquid-liquid mixtures. © 2017 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
