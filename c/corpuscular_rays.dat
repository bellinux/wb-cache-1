His father met Vera Congehl earlier that year, and married her in 1929. They had two children, Doris, born in 1933, and Klaus, born in 1934. Bethe did not find the work in Frankfurt very stimulating, and in 1929 he accepted an offer from Ewald at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. While there, he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper, Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie ("The Theory of the Passage of Fast <b>Corpuscular</b> <b>Rays</b> Through Matter"). Starting from Max Born's interpretation of the Schrödinger equation, Bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a Fourier transform, which is known today as the Bethe formula.

40|$|Super-high energy <b>corpuscular</b> and gamma <b>rays</b> {{as well as}} cosmic high [...] {{power density}} sources are hard to explain in a galaxy model framework. Attempts to include some of those {{phenomena}} in the Standard Cosmological Model also encounter serious difficulties. In the present paper an alternative cosmological concept is discussed. There are several features in it. First of all, the whole Universe (Grand Universe) is a multitude of typical universes, like ours, evenly made of either matter or antimatter, hence, there is no violation of the baryon symmetry on the largest scale. Second, high-energy phenomena {{are the result of}} matter-antimatter annihilation processes in a typical universe evolution. Finally, the Ground Universe is a self-creating due to a balance of annihilation and pair creation in the inter-universe infinite space. This concept and its consistence with the major observational data are discussed in detail. Comment: submitted to the ANS Centennial Meeting, March 20 - 26, 1999, Atlanta, Georgi...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{experiments}} of Bothe and Kolhoerster(1) {{have led}} to an important and interesting conclusion. The ionization phenomena, by means of which cosmic rays are measured, are produced by highly penetrating <b>corpuscular</b> <b>rays.</b> It remains, however, an open question whether this corpuscular radiation is identical with the cosmic rays themselves, or is secondary in its nature, produced by primary rays of an electromagnetic character. Bothe and Kolhoerster admit both possibilities, {{but they seem to}} lean toward the first, owing to the fact that their <b>corpuscular</b> <b>rays</b> show a penetration of the same order of magnitude as that of the cosmic rays themselves...|$|E
40|$|More than 100 {{years ago}} Kristian Birkeland (1967 &ndash; 1917) {{addressed}} questions that had vexed scientists for centuries. Why do auroras appear overhead while the Earth's magnetic field is disturbed? Are magnetic storms on Earth related to disturbances on the Sun? To {{answer these questions}} Birkeland devised terrella simulations, led coordinated campaigns in the Arctic wilderness, and then interpreted his results {{in the light of}} Maxwell's synthesis of laws governing electricity and magnetism. After analyzing thousands of magnetograms, he divided disturbances into 3 categories: 1. Polar elementary storms are auroral-latitude disturbances now called substorms. 2. Equatorial perturbations correspond to initial and main phases of magnetic storms. 3. Cyclo-median perturbations reflect enhanced solar-quiet currents on the dayside. He published the first two-cell pattern of electric currents in Earth's upper atmosphere, nearly 30 years before the ionosphere was identified as a separate entity. Birkeland's most enduring contribution toward understanding geomagnetic disturbances flowed from his recognition that field-aligned currents must connect the upper atmosphere with generators in distant space. The existence of field-aligned currents was vigorously debated among scientists for more than 50 years. Birkeland's conjecture profoundly affects present-day understanding of auroral phenomena and global electrodynamics. In 1896, four years after Lord Kelvin rejected suggestions that matter passes between the Sun and Earth, and two years before the electron was discovered, Birkeland proposed current carriers are "electric corpuscles from the Sun" and "the auroras are formed by <b>corpuscular</b> <b>rays</b> drawn in from space, and coming from the Sun". It can be reasonably argued that the year 1896 marks the founding of space plasma physics. Many of Birkeland's insights were rooted in observations made during his terrella experiments, the first attempts to simulate cosmic phenomena within a laboratory. Birkeland's ideas were often misinterpreted or dismissed, but were verified when technology advances allowed instrumented spacecraft to fly in space above the ionosphere...|$|E
