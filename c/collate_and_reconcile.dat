S., Canada, Russia and eastern Asia, to tropical breeding grounds each winter along Pacific coasts of Mexico and Central America {{as well as the}} offshore islands of Mexico, Hawaii, and Japan. Humpback whales in the North Pacific and elsewhere were reduced to very low numbers during a period of intense commercial exploitation that ended in 1965. As the population recovers in abundance, the range of cultural and genetic diversity that survived the exploitation-driven bottleneck is able to adapt, endure and evolve. My work uses genetic tools and photo identification data to investigate the population dynamics, mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region evolution and potential drivers of a specialized feeding behavior in a recovering subpopulation of humpback whales in the Glacier Bay and Icy Strait (GBIS) sub-region of the southeastern Alaska (SEAK) feeding ground. I first <b>collated</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciled</b> available DNA profiles (mtDNA control region, 10 microsatellite loci and sex) from 556 individuals using tissue samples collected from 1987 to 2012. Photo identification records associated with 692 of 1, 026 total genetic samples collected in SEAK (now archived within the SEAK DNA Register and Tissue Database) corresponded to extensive life-history information, extending back to the early 1970 s, as archived within the SEAK Regional Database, curated by the National Park Service (NPS) and University of Alaska, Southeast (UAS). 	Changes in population structure in GBIS over 32 years (1973 - 2005) were investigated in order to determine whether the increase in local abundance was attributable to local fidelity and recruitment or immigration from outside of SEAK. Two temporal strata were defined: 'Founder' individuals identified between 1973 - 1985 (n = 74, n = 46 with DNA profiles) and 'Contemporary' individuals identified between 2004 - 2005 (n = 171, n = 114 with DNA profiles). There was no significant genetic differentiation between the strata, indicating that {{it is unlikely that the}} population increase within GBIS was due largely to immigration of whales from elsewhere in the North Pacific. However, two additional haplotypes were documented in the Contemporary stratum at low frequency, one of which was previously unreported in the North Pacific (haplotype A 8, see below). This relative stability in haplotype frequencies over time argues for strong regional fidelity of the maternal lineages represented in GBIS between 1973 and 1985. After excluding the 42 Contemporary whales with no photo ID record of a mother or genotype available for maternity inference, at least 73. 6...|$|R
