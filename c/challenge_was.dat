5|$|One major <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> the {{approach}} to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike {{the approach}} to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tradition}} of a <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> {{the most common}} {{way to ensure that}} members are carrying their unit's coin. The rules of a <b>challenge</b> <b>are</b> not always formalized for a unit, and may vary between organizations. The challenge only applies to those members that have been given a coin formally by their unit. This may lead to some controversy when <b>challenges</b> <b>are</b> initiated between members of different organizations and is not recommended. The {{tradition of}} the coin <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> meant {{to be a source of}} morale in a unit, and forcing the challenge can cause a reverse effect. The act of <b>challenging</b> <b>is</b> called a [...] "Coin Check" [...] and is usually loudly announced.|$|R

The <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} by M Beaumont on 26July 1911, in about 22½ hours. Paulhan and Grahame-White competed again later in 1910, for the newspaper's prize of £1,000 for the greatest aggregate cross-country flight, which Paulhan won.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E

5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E

5|$|F. During the series, it was {{revealed}} that the Victoria club had not filed a formal challenge. A letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn, president of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> accepted.|$|E

5|$|In 1904 {{the first}} Ranfurly Shield match was played. The shield, a provincial {{challenge}} trophy won by defeating the holder, {{was to become}} the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby. Due to their unmatched provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield. The first shield <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> played against Wellington, who were not expected to pose much of a threat. Auckland had not lost at home in six years, but, with Cunningham in the side, Auckland lost 6–3. The second notable match that season was against the touring British Isles who were conducting a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The Aucklanders defeated the British Isles side 13–0, with Cunningham scoring a try and contributing significantly to the dominance of his team's forwards.|$|E

30|$|There <b>are</b> many <b>challenges</b> {{to achieve}} our goal. The first <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> to achieve per-station {{fairness}} among wireless clients. Therefore, the access point must equally allocate bandwidth to each wireless client. The second <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> to achieve per-flow fairness between the uplink and downlink flows within a wireless station. The third <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> to adaptively adjust {{the allocation of}} the uplink and downlink bandwidth for each wireless station, {{in order to allow}} a given communication direction to obtain larger bandwidth than the other. Finally, the fourth <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> to adaptively re-allocate the remaining bandwidth to bandwidth-hungry wireless stations in order to increase link utilization.|$|R

5|$|In autumn Lord Hastings, {{the owner}} of the 1885 Derby winner Melton issued a {{challenge}} to Jack Hammond for a £1,000 match race between his horse and St. Gatien, with Melton to receive nine pounds. The <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> declined, as St. Gatien had already been heavily backed for the Cambridgeshire Handicap, a race in which he had been assigned 136 pounds and Hammond did not want to disrupt the horse's preparation. St. Gatien returned to the racecourse after a break of four months in Her Majesty's Plate over two miles at Newmarket on October 12. The race proved meaningless as a contest, his only opponent being a three-year-old filly called Jane who had finished runner-up in the 1000 Guineas. St. Gatien started at odds of 1/33 and won with predictable ease by twenty lengths.|$|E
5|$|Martina's {{participation}} in the 200m finals round was controversial. Martina came in second place to Usain Bolt, completing the event in 19.82 seconds over Usain Bolt's world-record breaking performance of 19.30 seconds. However, when American would-be bronze medalist Wallace Spearmon was disqualified for running outside of his lane, the American coaches reviewed video records of the race and found that Martina had done the same. The United States filed a protest against the Netherlands Antilles. The Dutch Antillean Olympic committee argued that the <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> invalid, having been filed after the 30-minute post-race deadline, but Martina was disqualified from receiving the silver medal anyway. Shawn Crawford of the United States, who originally finished the race in fourth place, was given the silver medal, and Walter Dix was given the bronze medal in place of Spearmon.|$|E

Support for the American and South Korean armies came through the United States and Japan. The re-equipping of the ROK Army presented the UN forces with major logistical problems in July. The biggest <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> a shortage of ammunition. Though logistics situations improved over time, ammunition was short {{for much of the}} war. Consumption of supplies differed among the various units and a lack of a previously drafted plan forced UN logisticians to create a system on the fly.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the {{challenges}} to staying in flow include states of apathy, boredom, and anxiety. Being {{in a state of}} apathy <b>is</b> characterized when <b>challenges</b> <b>are</b> low and one's skill level is low producing a general lack of interest in the task at hand. Boredom is a slightly different state in that it occurs when <b>challenges</b> <b>are</b> low, but one's skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challenges. Lastly, a state of anxiety occurs when <b>challenges</b> <b>are</b> so high that they exceed one's perceived skill level causing one great distress and uneasiness. These states in general differ from being in a state of flow, in that flow occurs when challenges match one's skill level. Consequently, Csíkszentmihályi has said, [...] "If <b>challenges</b> <b>are</b> too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If <b>challenges</b> <b>are</b> too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills." ...|$|R

5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 Mark Webber Pure Tasmania <b>Challenge</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} at the 2007 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne when Webber {{was joined}} by sports stars and Kylie Minogue, and Hollywood star Anthony Edwards. The trek was another gruelling physical and mental adventure race about Tasmania in aid of charity but albeit with a new format. Teams competed for honours in two unique categories: the Van Diemen Cup– designed exclusively for corporate teams of four people, and the 2theXtreme Cup– a two-person elite team entry. Both categories trekked, kayaked and cycled alongside {{each other as they}} covered approximately 450km through World Heritage wilderness and along the idyllic coast of the Freycinet National Park. It was held from 17–23 November, and for the first time, one of Webber's fellow Formula One drivers, Heikki Kovalainen, joined him in the challenge.|$|E
