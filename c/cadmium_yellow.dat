5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with <b>cadmium</b> <b>yellow,</b> one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

5000|$|For centuries, {{orpiment}} was ground {{down and}} used as a pigment in painting and for sealing wax, and is even used in Ancient China as a correction fluid. [...] It {{was one of the}} few clear, bright-yellow pigments available to artists until the 19th century. However, its extreme toxicity and incompatibility with other common pigments, including lead and copper-based substances such as verdigris and azurite, meant that its use as a pigment ended when <b>cadmium</b> <b>yellows,</b> chromium yellows and organic dye-based colors were introduced during the 19th century.|$|R

Refurbished Metrocars 4082 & 4033 both carry an Emirates livery.|$|R
25|$|Pigments appear {{the colors}} they are because they {{selectively}} reflect and absorb certain wavelengths of visible light. White light is a roughly equal {{mixture of the}} entire spectrum of visible light with a wavelength in a range from about 375 or 400 nanometers to about 760 or 780nm. When this light encounters a pigment, parts of the spectrum are absorbed by the molecules or ions of the pigment. In organic pigments such as diazo or phthalocyanine compounds the light is absorbed by the conjugated systems of double bonds in the molecule. Some of the inorganic pigments such as vermilion (mercury sulfide) or <b>cadmium</b> <b>yellow</b> (cadmium sulfide) absorb light by transferring an electron from the negative ion (S2−) to the positive ion (Hg2+ or Cd2+). Such compounds are designated as charge-transfer complexes, with broad absorption bands that subtract most of {{the colors of the}} incident white light. The other wavelengths or parts of the spectrum are reflected or scattered. The new reflected light spectrum creates the appearance of a color. Pigments, unlike fluorescent or phosphorescent substances, can only subtract wavelengths from the source light, never add new ones.|$|E
500|$|Cadmium (Latin cadmia, Greek καδμεία meaning [...] "calamine", a cadmium-bearing {{mixture of}} {{minerals}} that {{was named after}} the Greek mythological character Κάδμος, Cadmus, the founder of Thebes) was discovered simultaneously in 1817 by Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate. Stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in zinc carbonate (calamine), and, for 100 years, Germany remained the only important producer of the metal. The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, because it was found in this zinc ore. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reducing the sulfide. The potential for <b>cadmium</b> <b>yellow</b> as pigment was recognized in the 1840s, {{but the lack of}} cadmium limited this application.|$|E

40|$|I {{quantified}} cadmium in surficial sediments of six low-alkalinity seepage {{lakes in}} north-central Wisconsin. Dry-weight cadmium {{concentrations in the}} sediments (range 0. 02 - 7. 17 [mu]g · g[superscript]- 1) were strongly correlated with water depth in all six study lakes. However, when cadmium concentrations were expressed on a volumetric basis (range 0. 004 - 0. 67 [mu]g · cm[superscript]- 3) the positive correlation with water depth was significant for {{only one of the}} lakes. Whole-lake burdens of cadmium in sediments of the six lakes ranged from 625 to 5785 g and were strongly correlated with lake surface area, indicating that atmospheric deposition was the primary source of anthropogenic cadmium to the study lakes. Areal burdens of cadmium, which ranged from 62 to 92 g · ha[superscript]- 1, were strongly correlated with dissolved organic carbon in the lakes, suggesting that the transport of cadmium to bottom sediments of the study lakes was related to organic material. Bioaccumulation of <b>cadmium</b> by <b>yellow</b> perch (Perca flavescens) was quantified in Little Rock Lake, the site of an experimental pH-manipulation project. To assess the influence of acidification on cadmium bioaccumulation by fish, yellow perch were annually netted from the treatment and reference basins of Little Rock Lake. Between-basin comparisons of <b>cadmium</b> in whole <b>yellow</b> perch indicated that lake pH significantly influenced cadmium bioaccumulation by fish. After 1 year of residence in the lake, mean whole-body concentrations and burdens of cadmium in age- 1 yellow perch from the acidified treatment basin (pH 4. 9) in April 1990 and 1991 were significantly less than whole-body concentrations and burdens of cadmium in fish from the non-acidified reference basin (pH 6. 1). Moreover, mean whole-body concentrations and burdens of cadmium in age- 2 and older fish sampled in 1989, after 2 years of acidification to pH 5. 2, and in 1991, after 2 years of acidification to pH 4. 9, were greater in the reference basin than the treatment basin. Bioaccumulation of <b>cadmium</b> by <b>yellow</b> perch paralleled rates of growth within the Little Rock Lake populations sampled in 1989 and 1991. Estimated cadmium inventories in the yellow perch populations of Little Rock Lake in 1989 were 24 mg in the reference basin and 19 mg in the treatment basin...|$|R

40|$|Opila, Robert L. New {{condensed}} matter metrologies {{are being}} used to probe ever smaller length scales. In support of the diverse field of materials research synchrotron based spectroscopies provide sub-micron spatial resolutions and a breadth of photon wavelengths for scientific studies. For electronic materials the thinnest layers in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device have been reduced to just a few nanometers. This raises concerns for layer uniformity, complete surface coverage, and interfacial quality. Deposition processes like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) have been shown to deposit the needed high-quality films for the requisite thicknesses. However, new materials beget new chemistries and, unfortunately, unwanted side-reactions and by-products. CVD/ALD tools and chemical precursors provided by our collaborators at Air Liquide utilized these new chemistries and films were deposited for which novel spectroscopic characterization methods were used. The second portion of the thesis focuses on fading and decomposing paint pigments in iconic artworks. Efforts have been directed towards understanding the micro-environments causing degradation. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) and variable kinetic energy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VKE-XPS) are advanced XPS techniques capable of elucidating both chemical environments and electronic band structures in sub-surface regions of electronic materials. HAXPES has been used to study the electronic band structure in a typical CMOS structure; it will be shown that unexpected band alignments are associated with the presence of electronic charges near a buried interface. Additionally, a computational modeling algorithm, Bayes-Sim, was developed to reconstruct compositional depth profiles (CDP) using VKE-XPS data sets; a subset algorithm also reconstructs CDP from angle-resolved XPS data. Reconstructed CDP produced by Bayes-Sim were most strongly correlated to the real chemical distributions in our CMOS. Chemical speciation and degradation mechanisms in paint pigment materials from iconic artwork has been investigated using high energy X-rays by the techniques as X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Unique features in X-ray absorption spectra using XANES help identify the chemical species present in the paint sample by comparing similar spectral features from known reference standards. By carefully choosing X-ray energies that excite a subset of the present chemical species the distribution of constituents can be determined. This work furthers the understanding of supposed photo-oxidation degradation mechanisms and potential preservation efforts to maintain the painting integrity for <b>cadmium</b> <b>yellows</b> used in Henri Matisse's Le Bonheur de vivre and arsenic sulfides from an 18 th century still life painting from Adriaen Coorte.

40|$|Adsorption of <b>cadmium</b> ions onto <b>Yellow</b> River {{sediment}} was {{studied in}} a batch reactor. Equilibrium adsorption of <b>cadmium</b> ions onto <b>Yellow</b> River sed-iment can be well {{described by the}} Langmuir adsorption isotherm. In view of common experimental conditions in the batch reactor, a set of equations for describing variations of both the dissolved heavy metal pollutant concentration and the particulate heavy metal pollutant concentrations (the adsorption con-tent of heavy metal pollutant on unit weight of sediment) with time was for-mulated {{with the use of}} an adsorptive reaction kinetic equation of heavy metal pollutant, mass balance equation and corresponding initial conditions. Furthermore, formulae for calculating the equilibrium dissolved heavy metal concentration and the equilibrium particulate heavy metal concentration (the equilibrium adsorption content of heavy metal pollutant on unit weight of sed-iment) in the batch reactor were obtained. These can be used as tools for further study. It was found that the saturation adsorption content, b, constant of adsorption-desorption rate, k, and coefficient of adsorption rate, k 1 (and coeffi-cient of desorption rate k 2), in the adsorptive reaction kinetic equation of the Langmuir type are independent of the suspended sediment concentration. Adsorption contents of heavy metal pollutants on unit weight of sediment (the suspended particulate heavy metal concentration) decreases with increasing suspended sediment concentration and can be well explained by the law of mass conservation. Adsorption capacity, which is defined as adsorption content of heavy metal pollutant by unit volume of (muddy) water, increases with an increase in either the suspended sediment concentration or initial dissolved heavy metal concentration.

30|$|In {{relation}} to the stability of chromate pigments {{the analysis of the}} two tube colours labelled “Chrome green light” and “Chrome green medium” should be noticed. The name “Chrome green” has typically been used for the mixture of chrome yellow and Prussian blue [20, 25], but in this case the tubes contained a mixture of viridian, zinc <b>yellow,</b> <b>cadmium</b> sulfide and barium sulfate. It seems very likely, that the manufacturer changed the composition of the colour in order to create an alternative to the traditional “Chrome green” based on more durable pigments. Similar examples have been reported by Townsend et al. [26]. In general durability seems to have been an important matter to Danish colour merchants in {{the end of the nineteenth}} century. The tube colours from Vilhelm Pacht were ranked in the price lists (Table  2) as being either completely durable (HH), durable (H) or uncertain (without a letter).|$|R

30|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century artists were aware that emerald green should not be mixed with sulfur-containing {{pigments}} such as <b>yellow</b> <b>cadmium</b> sulfide, as this leads to the formation of brown copper sulfides [23]. Nevertheless, emerald green is also found to degrade in the absence of sulfur-containing pigments leading to transparent discolored brown layers [1]. In this extreme case, the paint containing emerald green is medium rich with a relatively high concentration of monoacids, diacids and resin acids. These acids groups react with the emerald green pigment, forming copper carboxylates, like copper soaps (4 Cu(FA) 2) (FA = fatty acids) and arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3). The degradation mechanism of emerald green has been revealed by analytical imaging studies on paint samples from The Descent of the Cattle in the High Jura Mountains (1836) by Théodore Rousseau in the Mesdag Collection in The Hague, supported by chemical laboratory experiments [1]. The transparent, brown appearance is ascribed to the loss of the emerald green pigments as light reflectors in combination with darkening of the multiple thick medium-rich paint and varnish layers. Energy dispersive X-ray analyses indicate that, not unlike paintings containing realgar and/or orpiment, arsenic degradation products are found throughout a degrading painting containing emerald green in layer interfaces, varnishes and regions surrounding particles containing iron and/or aluminum. However, the chemical speciation of the arsenic-based reaction products in paintings containing emerald green has not yet been done, so the degradation mechanism is still not understood. In this paper we report arsenic (As) K–edge micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) analyses that have been carried out to identify the chemical speciation of the degradation products of emerald green containing arsenic.|$|R
