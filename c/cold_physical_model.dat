40|$|The reuse of {{mathematical}} <b>models</b> of <b>physical</b> phenomena, here called <b>physical</b> <b>models,</b> within simulations is attractive {{because it has}} the potential of improving simulation results while reducing implementation and testing work. In practice, however, it can be complicated to reuse a model that was originally developed for other studies and applications. It becomes even more difficult when multiple stakeholders have different ideas on how to use and extend the <b>physical</b> <b>model.</b> An attractive approach to deal with this problem is to develop and maintain a multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> that can be reused for different purposes. A multi-resolution model is a model that represents a system or phenomenon at different levels of fidelity simultaneously. On the process side, such an approach requires a policy for managing the use, the support and the development of the multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>model.</b> On the more technical side, a multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> requires a model specification that maintains all internal and external relationships while providing interoperability. Focusing on the reusability of <b>physical</b> <b>models,</b> this paper presents and analyzes two examples of multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> from different domains and discusses how they are used in different simulations. The examples concern the modeling and use of (1) a missile model, including its different components, and (2) a signal propagation model in an underwater environment. The examples show the global approach of how multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> can be used. Based on the experiences of modeling and simulation experts and <b>physical</b> <b>modeling</b> experts, this paper presents our guidelines and recommendations on how to facilitate the use of multi resolution <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> in simulations. These guidelines are structured according to the different software development phases, and help to improve the reusability and utility of <b>physical</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

In recent times however its place and importance has diminished somewhat as {{a direct consequence of}} advances made in numerical modelling techniques. This paper re-examines the place of <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> and by means of selected examples demonstrates the benefits of the approach. <b>Physical</b> <b>modelling</b> often provides an indirect representation of the physics under consideration and may often involve scaling and the use of cheaper substitute materials. A question posed that has in some respects contributed to the diminution of <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> is whether the <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> is representative of the physics involved. Related to this question is a new approach to scaled experimentation that has appeared in the recent literature. The new approach is founded on the scaling of space itself and although the idea that space expands and distorts is not new to physics (e. g. cosmology and general relativity) its application to <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> is considered completely novel. The scaling concept enables the physics of processes to be projected into a scaled space and vice versa, thus providing quantification of the validity of any <b>physical</b> <b>model.</b> This aspect fortifies a particular weakness in the <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> approach making its reappraisal particularly timely.

40|$|Designers use various {{representations}} to externalize their ideas, <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> {{being an}} important one. <b>Physical</b> <b>models</b> {{are widely used}} by designers and their use is promoted as an effective design tool by industry and government agencies. However, very {{little is known about}} the cognitive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> in the design process; the available guidelines are conflicting. Some researchers argue for the frequent implementation of <b>physical</b> <b>models,</b> while others observe that the use of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> fixates designers. In light of these conflicts, the research discussed in this dissertation focuses on understanding the cognitive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> and developing guidelines for aiding designers in their implementation. A combination of controlled lab studies and qualitative studies is adopted to achieve said goal. The results from the controlled studies show that <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> supplement designers? erroneous mental models and help them to come up with more ideas satisfying the problem requirements. These studies also demonstrate that design fixation is not inherent in <b>physical</b> <b>modeling,</b> but it is caused by the Sunk Cost Effect. According to Sunk Cost Effect, as designers spend more time building <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> of their initial ideas, they tend to fixate more to the variations of those ideas. A qualitative study on industry-sponsored projects and development cases of award-winning products further supports these results in more realistic situations. Further, the studies reported in this dissertation show that <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> can be effective tools for the mitigation of fixation to undesirable design features in a flawed example; however, these results can also depend upon the experience level of a designer in solving open-ended design problems. With these insights from the series of studies, a set of guidelines and a Model Error Reeducation Method (MERM) are formulated and tested with novice designers. MERM helps designers in identifying critical loads and interface designs they miss in their original designs, before prototyping. The results from the testing of this method show that this method is very useful in avoiding said errors in <b>physical</b> <b>modeling...</b>|$|R
