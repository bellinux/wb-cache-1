5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree <b>child</b> <b>rape</b> and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, a tipster, who {{was later}} {{revealed}} to be Taylor's sister Laurie Galli, contacted Washington Terrace Police officer Marcia Gathercole with information connected to the murder. Taylor's fingerprints were found on a telephone in the King residence and matched to records provided by authorities in Fort Lauderdale. He was arrested at about 9 p.m. on June 28 {{at the home of}} his half-sister/incestous lover Tresa Taylor in Ogden, Utah and charged with first-degree burglary, first-degree <b>child</b> <b>rape,</b> and first-degree murder the next morning. Taylor had arrived from Florida four days before the murder and had been staying with another sister in the same apartment complex.|$|E

Folk beliefs claim the cucumber as their traditional favorite meal.|$|R
5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of <b>child</b> <b>rape,</b> soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E

25|$|On {{the basis}} of Coker, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that Florida capital <b>child</b> <b>rape</b> {{statutes}} were unconstitutional in the Robert L.

25|$|In the 2008 case Kennedy v. Louisiana, {{the court}} also held 5-4 {{that the death penalty}} is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, {{including}} <b>child</b> <b>rape.</b> Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision. Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the 2008 presidential election and was criticized by both major party candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.|$|E
25|$|Coker v. Georgia, , {{held that}} the death penalty for rape of an adult woman was grossly disproportionate and {{excessive}} punishment, and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A few states continued to have <b>child</b> <b>rape</b> statutes that authorized the death penalty. In Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008), the court expanded Coker, ruling {{that the death penalty}} is unconstitutional in all cases that do not involve murder or crimes against the State.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the psychosocial}} effects on women {{as the most}} {{frequent}} victims of wartime <b>rape,</b> <b>children</b> born of <b>rape</b> are faced with distinct social stigmas.

50|$|Namibia has a {{high rate}} of {{domestic}} violence, particularly against women and <b>children.</b> <b>Rape</b> and murder cases are frequent. The number of rape cases reported annually was estimated to be between 700 and 1,600 in 2010, and domestic violence is primarily done by men against women. A report on the period from 2012 to 2015 counted roughly 40,000 assault cases, 2 839 rape cases, 1 138 attempted murders and 734 murders while pointing out {{that a large number of}} cases remain unreported.|$|R

25|$|A November 2009 {{television}} {{survey showed}} that 70% favoured reinstating {{the death penalty for}} {{at least one of the}} following crimes: armed robbery, rape, crimes related to paedophilia, terrorism, adult murder, child murder, <b>child</b> <b>rape,</b> treason, child abuse or kidnapping. However, respondents only favoured capital punishment for adult murder, the polling question asked by other organisations such as Gallup, by small majorities or pluralities: overall, 51% favoured the death penalty for adult murder, while 56% in Wales did, 55% in Scotland, and only 49% in England.|$|E
25|$|This {{case against}} the Wests would {{collapse}} when Anna Marie and her 13-year-old half-sister declined to testify at the court case on 7 June 1993, with the <b>child</b> <b>rape</b> victim expressing her desire {{to return to her}} family, and Anna Marie choosing to withdraw her statement both because of her noting the misery of her younger siblings, and her fear of Rose's vindictiveness. Shortly thereafter, Anna Marie spoke further with DC Savage, further emphasising that her mother Rena and half-sister Charmaine were also missing.|$|E
25|$|She {{pleaded guilty}} and {{was convicted of}} two counts of second-degree <b>child</b> <b>rape.</b> She was sentenced to six months (three of which were suspended) in the county jail and three years of sex {{offender}} treatment. At that time, she was not required to register as a sex offender, and, {{as long as she}} complied with the terms of her plea agreement, she would not be required to serve any additional time in jail. As part of her plea bargain, Letourneau agreed to avoid any further contact with Fualaau.|$|E
25|$|Father Loison {{described}} {{many examples}} of violence, mostly indiscriminate, directed at the civilian population in the region where he resides. The picture that emerges from his testimony is that the contras engage in brutal violation of minimum standards of humanity. He described murders of unarmed civilians, including women and <b>children,</b> <b>rape</b> followed in many instances by torture or murder, and indiscriminate terror designed to coerce the civilian population. His testimony was similar to various reports including the International Human Rights Law Group, Amnesty International, and others.|$|R

50|$|The Rugova {{massacre}} was {{a series}} of killings of Albanians committed by the forces of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the Rugova region on February 16, 1919. The soldiers burned women and <b>children,</b> <b>raped</b> and massacred a total amount of 432 Albanians. The report was collected by two priests in exile who compiled it and handed it to the British Brigadier General George Fraser Philips, head of the British Military Control Commission in Albania and Montenegro, in Shkodra. The survivors fled into the Gjakova Highlands in Albania.|$|R
25|$|Three {{days after}} the case was decided, Dwight Sullivan, a Colonel in the United States Marine Corps Reserve who was the Chief Defense Council for the Office of Military Commissions, noted in his CAAFlog on {{military}} justice that Congress had revised the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 2006 to add <b>child</b> <b>rape</b> {{to the list of}} offenses punishable in the military by death. None of the 10 briefs filed with the Court, and neither the majority nor dissent, mentioned the provision. On July 2, 2008, Linda Greenhouse of The New York Times highlighted Sullivan's post, bringing the issue to national attention.|$|E
25|$|On appeal, Kennedy {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} executing a person solely for <b>child</b> <b>rape,</b> and the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected the challenge {{on the grounds that}} the death penalty was not too harsh for such a heinous offense. The court distinguished the U.S. Supreme Court's plurality decision in Coker v. Georgia (1977), concluding that Cokers rejection of death as punishment for rape of an adult woman did not apply when the victim was a child. Rather, the Louisiana Supreme Court applied a balancing test set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in more recent death penalty cases, Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons, first examining whether there is a national consensus on the punishment and then considering whether the court would find the punishment excessive. The Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that the adoption of similar laws in five other states, coupled with the unique vulnerability of children, satisfied Atkins and Roper.|$|E
