5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and <b>Cape</b> <b>buffalo.</b> Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|Faith et al. 2013 further {{suggested}} that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured grassland habitats. This hypothesis is supported by fossil evidencebluebuck fossils appear in significant numbers {{along with those of}} grassland antelopes. Kerley et al. 2009 {{suggested that}} the bluebuck frequented grasslands and shunned wooded areas and thickets. In a 1976 study of fossils in the Southern Cape, Klein observed that the bluebuck's habitat preferences were {{similar to those of the}} <b>Cape</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Syncerus caffer) and the reedbuck (Redunca).|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest are {{the most}} {{commonly}} taken medium-sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson's gazelles coming close behind. <b>Cape</b> <b>buffalo</b> are rarely attacked {{due to differences in}} habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, <b>cape</b> <b>buffalo,</b> Burchell's zebra, greater kudu and impala are the spotted hyena's most important prey, while giraffe, impala, wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia's Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, the spotted hyena's primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident impala. In Kenya's Masai Mara, 80% of the spotted hyena's prey consists of topi and Thomson's gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant's gazelle, gerenuk, sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya. In west Africa, it is thought that the spotted hyena is primarily a scavenger, but will occasionally attack domestic stock and medium-size antelopes in some areas. In Cameroon, it is common for spotted hyenas to feed on small antelopes like kob, but may also scavenge on reedbuck, kongoni, buffalo, giraffe, African elephant, topi and roan antelope carcasses. Records indicate that spotted hyenas in Malawi feed on medium to large-sized ungulates such as waterbuck and impala. In Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, spotted hyenas primarily prey on wildebeest, followed by buffalo, zebra, impala, giraffe, reedbuck and kongoni. In Uganda, it is thought that the species primarily preys on birds and reptiles, while in Zambia it is primarily a scavenger.|$|E

25|$|The Indian National Scientific Documentation Centre {{states that}} the Jafarabadi buffalo is a hybrid of the African <b>cape</b> <b>buffalo</b> and the Indian water buffalo, the former {{originally}} been brought to British India for slaughtering. The Centre notes this {{to be one of}} the major reasons for the buffalo's poor semen quality. The hybrid buffalos were widely present in Jafarabad, and were hence named as Jafarabadi buffalo. Jafarabadi buffaloes have heavy heads with fairly large, thick, flat horns, which drop on the sides of the neck and go on upwards till the ears.|$|E

Hoofed mammals at the Denver zoo (counter-clockwise from the entrance) include Grevy's zebras, reticulated giraffes, Bactrian and dromedary camels, okapi, Somali wild ass, many species of antelope including bongo and gerenuk as well as <b>Cape</b> <b>buffalo.</b> Denver Zoo is also one of only a few zoos in the world to house a breeding herd of Przewalski's horses. Other species exhibited in the hoofed mammal yards include red kangaroos and emus in an Australian habitat, abyssinian ground hornbills with the gerenuk and secretary birds exhibited with the okapi.|$|E
25|$|Rwanda's {{tourism is}} {{centered}} on the attractions of Volcanoes National Park (PNV) with its six volcanoes and its protected population of mountain gorillas made famous by Dian Fossey. Additionally, tourism is drawn to central Africa's largest protected wetland Akagera National Park, with its populations of hippopotami, <b>cape</b> <b>buffalo,</b> zebras, elephants, elands, and other big game animals. Birdwatching-related tourism has a potential to develop as well, especially in Nyungwe National Park, among the largest uncut forest reserves in Africa. Nyungwe National Park is home to over 300 species of birds. And a vast variety of wild life as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{variation}} in animal {{number of species}} type may vary from season to season as they cross the border with the North Luangwa National Park in Zambia. Typically the reserve has large herds of <b>Cape</b> <b>buffaloes</b> and elephants, and a large variety of antelope including roan, greater kudu, Lichtenstein's hartebeest, eland and impala.|$|R

The reserve provides the excellent habitation for lion and hyena. It is regarded to have largest concentration of bird species feeding themselves in Usangu valley.|$|R
25|$|Hydrostatic shock is {{commonly}} {{considered as a}} factor in the selection of hunting ammunition. Peter Capstick explains that hydrostatic shock may have value for animals up to the size of white-tailed deer, but the ratio of energy transfer to animal weight is an important consideration for larger animals. If the animal’s weight exceeds the bullet’s energy transfer, penetration in an undeviating line to a vital organ is a much more important consideration than energy transfer and hydrostatic shock. Jim Carmichael, in contrast, describes evidence that hydrostatic shock can affect animals as large as <b>Cape</b> <b>Buffalo</b> in the results of a carefully controlled study carried out by veterinarians in a buffalo culling operation.|$|E
25|$|Due to the Anna Karenina principle, {{surprisingly}} few {{animals are}} suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the zebra, antelope, <b>cape</b> <b>buffalo,</b> and African elephant were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The Holocene extinction event eliminated many of the megafauna that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and Diamond argues that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (e.g. the Americas and Australia).|$|E
25|$|Approximately 25,000 large animals, mostly ungulates, {{live in the}} crater. Large {{animals in}} the crater include the black {{rhinoceros}} (Diceros bicornis), the local population of which declined from about 108 in 1964-66 to between 11-14 in 1995, the African buffalo or <b>Cape</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Syncerus caffer), and the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius). There also are many other ungulates: the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) (7,000 estimated in 1994), Grant's zebra (Equus quagga boehmi) (4,000), the common eland (Taurotragus oryx), and Grant's (Nanger granti) and Thomson's gazelles (Eudorcas thomsonii) (3,000). Waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) occur mainly near Lerai Forest. There are no topis (Damaliscus lunatus), oribis (Ourebia oribi), or crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus). Impala (Aepyceros melampus) are absent because the open woodland they prefer does not exist. Giraffe also are absent, possibly {{because of a lack}} of browse species. Tanzanian cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus raineyi), East African wild dog (Lycaon pictus lupinus), and African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus) are rarely seen.|$|E
