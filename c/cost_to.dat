We propose a framework of interaction costs inspired by Norman’s Seven Stages of Action to facilitate study. From 484 papers, we collected 61 interaction-related usability problems reported in 32 user studies and placed them into our framework of seven costs: (1) Decision <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> form goals; (2) System-power <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> form system operations; (3) Multiple input mode <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> form physical sequences; (4) Physical-motion <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> execute sequences; (5) Visual-cluttering <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> perceive state; (6) View-change <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> interpret perception; (7) State-change <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> evaluate interpretation. We also suggested ways to narrow the gulfs of execution (2 – 4) and evaluation (5 – 7) based on collected reports. Our framework suggests a need <b>to</b> consider decision <b>costs</b> (1) as the gulf of goal formation...|$|R

40|$|Cultivated land {{transition}} and its driving mechanism are the hotspots among studies on land use change. In this study, we constructed a framework {{to study the}} driving mechanism of cultivated land transition from the quantitative perspective. Based on the vector data of land use in 1990, 2000 and 2009 of Yantai Proper, Shandong Province China, 11 explanatory variables were chosen from two aspects: the elevation, slope, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> major water area and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> minor water area, which presented physical factors; <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> district center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> town center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> city expansion center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> major roads, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> city roads, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> county roads and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> rural roads, which presented the socio-economic factors. Combined with spatial analysis tools and Logistic regression analysis model, we construct Logistic regression analyses with four objectives that were urban construction land, rural residential land, orchard and other lands. The results show that, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> district center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> town center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> city expansion center and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> city roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into urban construction land. The main explained factors on the transition of cultivated land into rural residential land are slope, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> town center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> county roads and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> rural roads. Slope, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> minor water area, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> town center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> county roads and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> rural roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into orchard land. Elevation, slope, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> major water area and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> minor water area are the main explanatory variables on the transition of cultivated land into other land uses...|$|R

40|$|Designing {{conservation}} areas entails costs that, if considered explicitly, can {{be minimized}} while still achieving conservation targets. Here {{we focus on}} opportunity costs which measure forgone benefits from alternative land uses. Conservation planning studies often use partial estimates of costs, but {{the extent to which}} these result in actual efficiencies has not been demonstrated. Our study partitions land costs into three distinct opportunity <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> smallholder agriculture, soybean agriculture and ranching. We demonstrate that opportunity <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> single stakeholder groups can be inaccurate measures of true opportunity costs and can inadvertently shift conservation <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> affect groups of stakeholders disproportionately. Additionally, we examine how spatial correlations between costs as well as target size affect the performance of opportunity <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> single stakeholder groups as surrogate measures of true opportunity costs. We conclude that planning with opportunity <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> single stakeholder groups can result in <b>cost</b> burdens <b>to</b> other groups that could undermine the long-term success of conservation. Thus, an understanding of the spatial distributions of opportunity costs that are disaggregated to groups of stakeholders is necessary to make informed decisions about priority conservation areas...|$|R

40|$|The worthwhile-to-move {{incremental}} {{principle is}} a mechanism where, at each step, the agent, before moving and after exploration around the current state, compares intermediate advantages and <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> change <b>to</b> advantages and <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> stay. These advantages and <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> change include goal-setting, psychological, cognitive, learning and inertia aspects. Acceptables moves {{are such that}} advantages to move than to stay are higher than some fraction of <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> move than to stay, with, as a result, a limitation of the intermediate sacrifices to reach the goal. When the agent is more goal-oriented and improves enough at each step, the process ends in a permanent routine, a rest point where the agent prefers to stay than to change, in spite of some possible residual frustration to have missed his goal. In case of high local <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> move this approach leads to a cognitive proof of Ekeland epsilon-variational principle.
