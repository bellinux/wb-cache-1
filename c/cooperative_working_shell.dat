40|$|Abstract. I-X Process Panels {{are used}} to support users who are {{carrying}} out processes and responding to events in a <b>cooperative</b> <b>working</b> environment. The panels support the tracking of personal or group issues, the planning and execution of activities and the checking of constraints. Panels can be connected to other panels, and also {{to a range of}} services, agents and other <b>cooperative</b> <b>working</b> support tools to form part of a framework for activity and process support in an organization. The dynamically changing context in which a user operates is reflected in the options presented. Actual usage in a multinational coalition operations setting indicated the value of adopting an “instant messaging ” style of use. An augmented activity-orientated “intelligent messaging ” approach is taken in which artificial intelligence planning technology can be deployed in a natural way. ...|$|R

40|$|Our {{point of}} {{departure}} is {{that the relationship between}} social science, <b>cooperative</b> <b>working</b> and technology is not as much a matter of differences in understanding, as {{it is a matter of}} how to accomplish change. This chapter outlines an approach to design of CSCW where change is addressed in terms of expansion of the work practice. To facilitate the change process as a process of expansion, scenarios are used as springboards. Creation and use of scenarios are supported by a conceptual toolbox. The foundation for this toolbox is an understanding of the design process as abductive thinking consisting of idea generation and systematic reflection, and an understanding of design tools inspired from activity theory. As design processes may involve different communities of practice, we discuss the role of scenarios as boundary objects. Introduction In this paper we shall primarily address the discussions of social science, <b>cooperative</b> <b>working</b> and technology from the point of view of practical [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of community building tools and {{open educational resources}} (OER) affords {{the creation of new}} and innovative learning spaces. However in much of the work on OER the focus has been on providing content, rather than on how tools can be used in conjunction with available content to create a shared space that could improve the impact of such resources. A series of studies taking a subject point of view looked at the prospects for collaborative and <b>cooperative</b> <b>working</b> around OER from the perspectives of teachers and technical experts, considering in particular whether they would become involved in open environments. The studies discussed give an insight into how academics view social tools and techniques and whether they would use open arenas for formal and informal learning. The topic of OER and associated facilitative tools is important and this paper looks beyond content production issues to contribute to the debate on how collaborative and <b>cooperative</b> <b>working</b> can be established around OER...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of clustered star formation in the Rosette Molecular Complex was carried out based on archived data from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey. We presented strong evidence that triggered formation of embedded clusters and stellar aggregates {{took place in the}} <b>working</b> <b>shells</b> of the Rosette Nebula, a spectacular HII region excavated by the dozens of OB stars of the emerging massive cluster NGC 2244. Surprisingly, we have identified, within the confines of NGC 2244, a distinct congregation of young stellar objects showing prominent NIR excess that forms an arc like structure in appearance. Its location right to the south-east of the center of the main cluster and its strange morphology indicate most likely an origin from a former <b>working</b> <b>shell</b> of the HII region. This relic arc and the large, fragmented working surface layer of Rosette with the ambient cloud roughly show a concentric origin in morphology. This implies also a common origin of the clusters or stellar aggregates in association. The formation of massive star clusters was evidenced further {{into the heart of the}} molecular complex, and structured clustering star formation seemed to have taken place toward the south-east edge of the complex...|$|R

This paper examines what is required to exploit traces {{in the context of}} a collaborative working environment. The objective is to propose a model abstracting the exploiting process from a set of collaborative traces, according to a goal and a specific target framework. The example of the SWOT analysis is described to illustrate the approach...|$|R
