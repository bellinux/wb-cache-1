50|$|This {{area was}} {{settled in the}} early nineteenth century, after the United States {{government}} had removed most of the American Indians to west of the Mississippi River. Anglo-Americans settled the area, <b>clearing</b> <b>timber</b> and developing farms.|$|R
50|$|His grandson, John Wilson, {{established}} a shipbuilding business {{at what was}} now known as Port Cygnet. Until {{the end of the}} 1850s, timber was the main source of income as land was <b>cleared.</b> <b>Timber</b> was exported from the area for firewood, house building and fence palings.|$|R
50|$|Also the Volcanic Plateau {{region has}} the largest area of man made forest in the Southern Hemisphere. Nearly all the trees are Pinus radiata which were bought in for trials at Rotorua in 1899 from Kew Gardens,London. The tree, a native of Monterey, California, grew very fast in the poor soils. Mass {{planting}} was initially carried out by prisoners in the 1920s {{and then by the}} unemployed on a large scale during the Great Depression. After World War II scientists from Norway settled in the region and helped develop ways of treating the soft pine to prevent rotting using pressure treatment with chemicals. They also introduced selective breeding methods which was the standard way of improving the trees until tissue culture was introduced in the 1990s. Trees take 25-30 years to reach full height. Most plantations use growth factor (GF) trees to guarantee very high quality (straight and knot-free) timber, however treatment by chemical salts is still required to stop rotting.This is done by either dipping or more usually, pressure treatment. New Zealand has pioneered the use of Radiata timber and plywood in small craft boatbuilding. Untreated <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> or plywood is used that is then encapsulated in epoxy resin after construction. The key reason is the low cost of the wood rather than any inherent properties of the wood which is of moderate weight but fractures easily when bent, when dried to 12% moisture. One of the largest ply factories in New Zealand is located on the Volcanic Plateau at Tokoroa. Although planting by hand is still done on steeper land, most seedlings are now planted with the help of machines.|$|E
30|$|The {{relationship}} between PLI {{and the percentage}} of <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> was reasonably strong, therefore the PLI could be considered to be a good measure of pruned log quality in redwood as it is in radiata pine. The {{relationship between}} log SED and pruned log value was also reasonably strong. Despite the low yield of high-value grades, pruned logs accounted for more value than the unpruned logs. Large DOO values and the presence of epicormic shoots in some lower stems reduced the volume of <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> grades. The PLI scores for the 13 study trees were much lower than those for radiata pine, mainly {{because of a lack of}} strict control over the defect core (early pruning) and regular removal of epicormic shoots. Higher PLI values (and hence value recovery) can be expected from redwood stands grown under strict management practices (regular thinning, pruning and epicormic removal).|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to log SED, {{the effect of}} sweep, defect core size and percentage of heartwood SED were tested for pruned logs. Somewhat unexpectedly, none of these three additional parameters {{had a significant effect}} on pruned log value after log SED was taken into account (Table  6). This lack of effect was considered to be due to poor-quality pruning, which resulted in the absence of logs with PLI greater than 7.6 and a low overall out-turn of high-value <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> grades. Despite the lack of significance of defect core size in the model, value can be gained by pruning redwood trees.|$|E

30|$|Total timber volume (50 logs) was 16.2 m 3, {{valued at}} USD 7, 835 (2008 prices). This {{was less than}} might be {{expected}} in a well-managed stand. The 13 pruned logs accounted for 38 % of the total volume recovered and 50 % the total financial value of the timber. Pruned log quality assessed according to a pruned log index (PLI) was low, due to untimely pruning {{and the presence of}} epicormic shoots. Only 12 % of the timber was graded clear and 32 % of this came from pruned logs. Despite low PLI scores, the relationships between PLI, proportion of <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> and pruned log value were reasonably strong.|$|E
40|$|When {{it comes}} to strengthening, {{structural}} timber engineering has seen polymer composite materials becoming key materials over the last decades. A great {{number of studies have}} already shown {{that the majority of the}} results were promising. Several strengthening systems applied to structural timber or glued-laminated timber beams revealed that the ultimate failure mode remains in tension regardless of the reinforced system. However, the collapse can be controlled and postponed by optimising the strengthening system. It has been shown that strengthening timber on the tension and compression side simultaneously increases the stiffness and moment capacity more than if the reinforcement was only positioned on the tension side. This is mainly due to the ductility of wood in compression which is fully utilised when strengthening is located on both sides. The main objective behind this study is to develop an experimental method to determine the compressive behaviour of small <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> specimens reinforced with CFRP...|$|E
40|$|Conventional brittle {{fracture}} theory (or statistical strength theory) {{has been developed}} {{on the basis of}} the weakest link concept proposed by Pierce, who studied cotton yarns, and Tucker, who studied concrete [1]. Major developments of the theory were made by Weibull [2], who verified his results with tests on many different brittle materials, but apparently not timber. Weibull showed how the strength of a weakest link system can be explained by a cumulative distribution of the exponential type, and how the strength depends on the volume of the test specimen for uniform or varying distributions of stress within the specimen. The first study in which the Weibull {{brittle fracture}} theory was applied to timber was reported by Bohannan [3]. He studied <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> beams and found that for geometrically similar beams the strength was proportional to the depth of the beam to the power 1 / 9, this being the result of a depth effect and a length effect of equal importance. He found that strength was not affected by beam breadth...|$|E

40|$|The native {{tree species}} whitewood, Endospermum medullosum Euphorbiaceae, {{is well known}} as a native forest timber from Vanuatu which can produce large volumes of wood within 15 - 20 years when managed in plantations. Its {{domestication}} is well advanced in the country, where seed can be sourced from first generation seed orchards and where considerable silvicultural expertise has been developed. Although the existing value chain for whitewood is based mainly on trees from native forests, this resource is virtually exhausted {{and there is an}} opportunity to develop strong valueadded uses for plantation-grown trees. The objectives of this research were to elucidate the various components of the whitewood value chain, for both domestic and export markets, to identify impediments {{to the development of a}} whitewood plantation and processing sector, and further identify opportunities for value adding. Interviews were conducted in Vanuatu with 115 respondents from the islands of Santo and Efate to understand the existing value chain and identify value-adding opportunities. The respondents were whitewood growers (one of a larger plantation of 270 ha and 60 owners of smaller woodlots), processors (31) including saw-millers, timber yard owners and furniture makers, and consumers (domestic (21) and overseas (3)). The prices paid for whitewood vary greatly, from as little as $ 20 per m 3 for standing trees to more than $ 5, 393 per m 3 for finished furniture and mouldings. In some cases, whitewood trees are harvested and sawn into rough boards with portable Lucas mills and transported to processing centres in the main towns, specifically Luganville, Santo and Port Vila, Efate. Rough sawn green timber is sold in Vanuatu for $ 380 to $ 490 per m 3 and exported to New Caledonia for processing. The products include dry <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> envelope-treated for $ 639 to $ 659 per m 3, dry <b>clear</b> <b>timber</b> envelope treated for domestic interior use for $ 658 to $ 2, 028 per m 3, and finally dry mouldings and furniture at $ 3, 852 to $ 5, 393 per m 3. Specific challenges that growers and processors need to confront along the value-chain are; the need to distinguish domestic whitewood from treated Pinus radiata products imported into Vanuatu from New Zealand; the creation of efficient methods of transport from logging sites to processing centres; the need to saw and dry boards quickly after tree harvest; the development of wood treatment (impregnation) techniques, preferably with substances not toxic to humans and wildlife; protecting boards from bluestain, which develops quickly on freshly cut trees; utilising sawing technologies that can be employed in isolated rural conditions to produce boards and small pieces for later value-adding; development of viable products from short, knotty pieces; and economical ways of producing high-value products like mouldings...|$|E
