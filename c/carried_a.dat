5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> third less bombload, it proved more {{reliable}} in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it.

The aircraft operated with reserve squadrons until 1953.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo.
