When the AEA Silver Dart was ready for flight testing, the engine {{was removed from the}} Cygnet II, and then returned. Rebuilt again as the Cygnet III with a more {{powerful}} 70hp Gnome Gamma engine, its final flight was on 19 March 1912, at Bras d'Or Lake, Nova Scotia, piloted by John McCurdy. The results were highly unsatisfactory with the Cygnet III only able to lift off the ground for a foot or two, typically considered remaining in ground effect. After a final trial on 17 March, the tetrahedral <b>cell</b> <b>bank</b> failed structurally, leaving the aircraft irreparably damaged.

40|$|AbstractThe {{expansion}} {{of national and}} international research efforts in stem cell research is increasingly paired with the trend of establishing stem <b>cell</b> <b>banks</b> and registries. In jurisdictions crossing the spectrum of restrictive to liberal stem <b>cell</b> policies, <b>banks</b> and registries are emerging as an essential resource for transnational access to quality-controlled and ethically sourced stem cell lines. In this study, we report the preliminary findings of a survey of stem <b>cell</b> <b>banks</b> participating in the International Stem Cell Forum's International Stem <b>Cell</b> <b>Banking</b> Initiative (ISCBI). The questionnaire circulated to all ISCBI members addressed both general issues surrounding research policies (e. g., national policies regulating the permissibility of conducting {{embryonic stem cell research}} (hESCR)) and, more specifically, issues relating to the governance of stem <b>cell</b> <b>banking</b> projects. The results of the questionnaire were complemented by scholarly research conducted by the authors. This article provides an overview of the current international hESC banking landscape (I). For this purpose, the policy and governance approaches adopted in the surveyed stem <b>cell</b> <b>banks</b> at the national level will be analyzed and areas of convergence and variance will be identified (II). It {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper to provide a comprehensive analysis of the wide range of possible governance approaches, policy responses, and their implications. However, we want to provide a starting point for discussion surrounding key questions and challenges as concerns provenance, access, and deposit of hESC lines (III). Finally, while our analysis is focused on research grade hESCs, the lessons to be gleaned from this examination will encourage further thought, analysis, and research into the issues raised in the banking and governance of other sources of stem cell lines (e. g., SCNT, parthenogenesis, iPs) (IV) ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{restrictions}} {{for human}} cell-based therapies have {{been related to}} technological limitations with regards to cellular proliferation capacity (simple culture conditions), maintenance of differentiated phenotype for primary human cell culture and transmission of communicable diseases. Cultured primary fetal cells from one organ donation could possibly meet the exigent and stringent technical aspects for development of therapeutic products. Master and working <b>cell</b> <b>banks</b> from one fetal organ donation (skin) can be developed in {{short periods of time}} and safety tests can be performed at all stages of <b>cell</b> <b>banking.</b> For therapeutic use, fetal cells can be used up to two thirds of their life-span in an out-scaling process and consistency for several biological properties includes protein concentration, gene expression and biological activity. As it is the intention that <b>banked</b> primary fetal <b>cells</b> can profit from the prospected treatment {{of hundreds of thousands of}} patients with only one organ donation, it is imperative to show consistency, tracability and safety of the process including donor tissue selection, <b>cell</b> <b>banking,</b> <b>cell</b> testing and growth of cells in out-scaling for the preparation of whole-cell tissue-engineering products...|$|R
40|$|Delivery {{of human}} stem cells for research, {{clinical}} translation, and commercialization ideally requires stem cell resources developed and maintained according to internationally recognized standards. For example, {{human embryonic stem}} (hES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells should conform to international ethical principles imparted by leading bodies such as the International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR; www. isscr. org), International Stem Cell Forum (ISCF; www. stem-cell-forum. net), and U.

50|$|An amniotic stem <b>cell</b> <b>bank</b> is a {{facility}} that stores stem cells derived from amniotic fluid for future use.

The sample can later be retrieved only by that individual and for the use by such individual or, in many cases, by her or his first-degree blood relatives. In case of amniotic fluid stem cell banking, the mother providing the donation initially has ownership of the stem cells and financial responsibility for its storage. When the child from that pregnancy reaches legal age, the ownership and responsibility for the sample may be transferred.
