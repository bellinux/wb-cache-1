40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} {{of the ability to}} machine glass materials to optical tolerances is highly desirable. The machinability of glass is poor in diamond cutting due to the high hardness and the high brittleness of glass. In order to investigate the effects of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> on the machinability of glass, this paper selected boric acid solution and sodium carbonate solution as <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids,</b> and then scratching tests were carried out.

The effects of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> on <b>cutting</b> force, shear angle, etc. are investigated in the experiments.

The surface integrity of workpieces submitted to grinding process depends on the conditions of cooling produced by <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids,</b> which are used to avoid microstructural damage in the process.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) composites are in demand {{for a variety of}} applications due to their superior properties. Drilling is involved in many CFRP applications. Experiments have been successfully conducted to use rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) for CFRP drilling. These experiments were conducted using either <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> or cold air as coolant. RUM of CFRP composites without <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> can eliminate problems caused by <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids,</b> such as high cost of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> and their disposal, pollution to the environment, and harm to human health. However, dry machining (machining without <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids)</b> also has its limitations, such as burning of machined surface, more friction and adhesion between tool and workpiece, and reduction in tool life. This article presents an experimental study on feasible regions in rotary ultrasonic machining of CFRP using cold air as coolant.

This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for MRO or hobbyist metalcutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used. Fortunately it is also not necessary in those applications, where heavy cuts, aggressive speeds and feeds, and constant, all-day cutting are not vital.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThe {{metal cutting}} process, known as {{conventional}} machining process, utilizes <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> to provide lubrication, cooling and easy chip removal. The {{long-term effects of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> disposal into the environment are becoming increasingly evident. Research has also proven the health hazards on manufacturing workers who come {{in direct contact with}} <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids.</b> The formulation of stringent rules and restrictions on use and disposal of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> has increased the cost associated with <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> use to between 7 % and 17 % of total manufacturing cost. The dry machining process considered in this thesis, using diamond-coated tools for the machining of aluminum eliminates <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> from the <b>cutting</b> process. The improvement in tool life in dry machining and complete elimination of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> from the process are known benefits of the diamond-coated tools. Even though these advantages have been documented, no one to date has considered the environmental impacts of the entire life cycle of either wet or dry machining. In this research, a macro level life cycle analysis (LCA), a systems analysis tool for evaluating environmental impacts over the life span of a product or process, is used to compare environmental performance of the conventional or wet machining process using uncoated carbide tools and the dry machining process using diamond-coated carbide tools at a macro level. A cost analysis of these machining processes is also included here to provide more informed guidelines for the local Wichita aircraft manufacturers and for the manufacturing industry in general.

25|$|The {{official}} {{technique to}} measure oil concentration in <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> samples is manual titration: 100ml of the fluid under test is titrated with a 0.5M HCl solution to an endpoint of pH 4 and {{the volume of}} titrant used to reach the endpoint {{is used to calculate}} the oil concentration. This technique is accurate and not affected by fluid contamination, but needs to be performed by trained personnel in a laboratory environment. A hand-held refractometer is the industrial standard used to determine the mix ratio of water-soluble coolants that estimates oil concentration from the sample refractive index measured in the Brix scale. The refractometer allows for in situ measurements of oil concentration within industrial plants. However, contamination of the sample reduces the accuracy of the measure. Other techniques are used to measure the oil concentration in cutting fluids, such as measure of the fluid viscosity, density, and ultrasound speed. Other test equipment is used to determine such properties as acidity and conductivity.|$|E

[...] Small horizontal bandsaws typically employ a gravity feed alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a hydraulic cylinder that bleeds through an adjustable valve. [...] When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. [...] The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off.
