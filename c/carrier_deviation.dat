This value of PCM data deviation {{has been shown to}} be optimum for both PCM/FM [1] and PCM/FM+FM/FM [2] systems. However, the optimum deviation of the carrier by the FM subcarrier for a PCM/FM+FM/FM system is dependent upon the specific subcarrier type and required subcarrier signal to noise ratio at the receiver output. This paper introduces a simple method to calculate the optimum deviation of the carrier by FM subcarriers for a PCM/FM+FM/FM system. The method developed is used to calculate the optimum value of subcarrier deviation for two sample PCM/FM+FM/FM systems when IRIG constant bandwidth channels are used as FM subcarriers. The calculated optimum values of FM subcarrier deviation of the carrier, subcarrier mod index, are utilized in a companion paper to study the performance of PCM/FM+FM/FM systems [3].

40|$|Abstract—Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a {{statistical}} learning tool developed {{to a more}} complex concept of structural risk minimization (SRM). In this paper, SVM is applied to signal detection in communication systems {{in the presence of}} channel noise in various environments in the form of Rayleigh fading, additive white Gaussian background noise (AWGN), and interference noise generalized as additive color Gaussian noise (ACGN). The structure and performance of SVM in terms of the bit error rate (BER) metric is derived and simulated for these advanced stochastic noise models and the computational complexity of the implementation, in terms of average computational time per bit, is also presented. The performance of SVM is then compared to conventional binary signaling optimal model-based detector driven by binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation. We show that the SVM performance is superior to that of conventional matched filter-, innovation filter-, and Wiener filter-driven detectors, even in the presence of random Doppler <b>carrier</b> <b>deviation,</b> especially for low SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) ranges. For large SNR, the performance of the SVM was {{similar to that of the}} classical detectors. However, the convergence between SVM and maximum likelihood detection occurred at a higher SNR as the noise environment became more hostile.

This problem {{is compounded by the}} fact that in certain instances, especially for spacecraft and special applications, there is still a need for transmitters at many different VHF and lower UHF frequencies between 136 MHz and 1 GHz. Therefore, the optimum RF product line is represented by a modular transmitter system composed of fundamental building blocks which will permit the assembly of transmitters capable of producing from 50 watts at 136 MHz to 1 / 2 -watt at 5500 MHz with minimal variations in the over-all mechanical configuration. This adaptive transmitter system must also be able to provide optional features such as power-to-case ground isolation, modulation-to-power ground isolation, turn-on current limiting, either frequency of phase modulation remote turn-on capabilities, and internal telemetry functions of temperature, RF power, dc voltage. Additional design requirements for such a transmitter system are wideband frequency response and <b>carrier</b> <b>deviation</b> capabilities so that the transmitter may handle real-time video signal for use with television, radar and infra-red transmission systems.

In a {{previous}} paper (1) the authors reported notch noise loading tests of baseband (post-detection) tape recording showing dependency of the notch noise power ratio, NPR, on record level. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to report notch noise loading tests on pre-detection tape recording showing NPR dependence on record level, bias level, and output equalization. Both the baseband and pre-detection recording tests were made with the Hewlett-Packard Model 3950 recorder/reproducer. Generally, the pre-detection NPR were 5 db or more improved over the baseband NPR. The extent of the improvement depends, in part, on the quality of the vco and discriminators utilized for the pre-detection recording as well as the <b>carrier</b> <b>deviation.</b> As the linearity of the vco and discriminator and the phase linearity of the circuits that pass the pre-detection signal are improved, the limiting factor in NPR is the noise added by the reproduce amplifier. Increasing the record level above IRIG standard produces an improvement in the output signal-to-noise ratio, NPRO, of 3 to 5 db using IRIG standard bias. Eliminating the bias and recording at the level which results in maximum output of the fundamental produced up to 8 db improvement in NPRO over IRIG. In the course of the tests it was discovered that if harmonics are present in the recorded pre-detection signal and/or are generated in the record/reproduce process, serious intermodulation can occur unless a low-pass filter ahead of the discriminator is used...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to accurately measure the charge carrier lifetime, a crucial parameter that influences the collection efficiency in organic solar cells. Five transient and small perturbation experimental techniques that measure charge carrier lifetime are applied to a device composed of the polymer PDTSiTTz blended with the fullerene PCBM: time-resolved charge extraction (TRCE), transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), photoinduced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV), transient photovoltage, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The motivation is to perform a comprehensive comparison of several different lifetime measurement techniques on the same device {{in order to assess}} their relative accuracy, applicability to operational devices, and utility in data analysis. The techniques all produce similar charge carrier lifetimes at high charge densities, despite previous suggestions that transient methods are less accurate than small perturbation ones. At lower charge densities an increase in the apparent reaction order is observed. This may be related to surface recombination at the contacts beginning to dominate, or an inhomogeneous charge distribution. A combination of TAS and TRCE appears suitable. TAS enables the investigation of recombination mechanisms at early times since it is not limited by RC (resistance-capacitance product) or charge extraction losses. Conversely, TRCE is useful particularly at low densities when other mechanisms, such as surface recombination, may occur. Five experimental techniques that measure charge carrier lifetime are applied to an organic solar cell and compared. At high charge carrier densities, all the techniques surprisingly provide similar lifetimes.

3000|$|In this article, we {{consider}} the problem of enhanced remote sensing (RS) imaging stated and treated as an ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem with model uncertainties. The problem at hand is to perform high-resolution reconstruction of the power spatial spectrum pattern (SSP) of the wavefield scattered from the extended remotely sensed scene via space-time adaptive processing of finite recordings of the imaging radar/SAR data distorted in a stochastic uncertain measurement channel. The SSP {{is defined as a}} spatial distribution of the power (i.e., the second-order statistics) of the random wavefield backscattered from the remotely sensed scene observed through the integral transform operator [1, 2]. Such an operator is explicitly specified by the employed radar/SAR signal modulation and is traditionally referred to as the signal formation operator (SFO) [2, 3]. The operational uncertainties are attributed to inevitable random signal perturbations in inhomogeneous propagation medium with unknown statistics, possible imperfect radar calibration, and uncontrolled sensor displacements or <b>carrier</b> trajectory <b>deviations</b> in the SAR case. The classical imaging with an array radar or SAR implies application of the method called [...] "matched spatial filtering (MSF)" [...] to process the recorded data signals [2, 3]. A number of approaches had been proposed to design the constrained regularization techniques for improving the resolution in the SSP obtained by ways different from the MSF, e.g., [1 – 9] but without aggregating the minimum risk (MR) descriptive estimation strategies with convex projection regularization. In [7], an approach was proposed to treat the uncertain RS imaging problems that unifies the MR spectral estimation strategy with the worst case statistical performance (WCSP) optimization-based convex regularization resulting in the descriptive experiment design regularization (DEDR) method. Next, the variational analysis (VA) framework has been combined with the DEDR in [2, 9] to satisfy the desirable descriptive properties of the reconstructed RS images, namely: (i) convex optimization-based maximization of spatial resolution balanced with noise suppression, (ii) consistency, (iii) positivity, (iv) continuity and agreement with the data. In this study, we extend the developments of the DEDR and VA techniques originated in [2, 7, 9] by performing the aggregation of the DEDR and VA paradigms and next putting the RS image enhancement/reconstruction tasks into the unified neural network (NN)-adapted computational frame addressed as a unified DEDR-VA-NN method. We have designed a family of such significantly speeded-up DEDR-VA-related algorithms, and performed the simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed high-resolution DEDR-VA-NN-based image enhancement/fusion approach.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we address}} a new {{aggregated}} Hardware/Software (HW/SW) codesign approach to optimization {{of the digital}} signal and image processing techniques as required for enhanced remote sensing (RS) of the environment {{with the use of}} high-resolution array radar and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. At the algorithm-design level, the RS imaging problem is treated as an ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem of reconstruction of the spatial spectrum pattern (SSP) of the backscattered field distributed over the remotely sensed scene via processing the SAR data signals distorted in the uncertain stochastic measurement channel [1 – 6]. The operational scenario uncertainties are attributed to inevitable random signal perturbations in inhomogeneous propagation medium [1, 2, 4], possible imperfect radar/SAR system calibration [1, 3], and SAR <b>carrier</b> trajectory <b>deviations</b> [3, 5, 6]. The unified approach that we address to solve such a problem is based on the recently proposed concept of descriptive experiment design regularization (DEDR) [7, 8]. The general DEDR method constructed in [7, 8] incorporates into the minimum risk (MR) nonparametric estimation strategy [4] the experiment design-motivated constraints of the image identifiably for the discrete-form signal formation operator (SFO) specified by the employed signal modulation format [4 – 6]. On one hand, a considerable advantage of such DEDR paradigm relates to its flexibility in designing the desirable error metrics in the corresponding image representation space via defining different descriptive cost functions [7, 9]. On the other hand, the crucial limitations of the DEDR method relate to the necessity of performing simultaneously the solution-dependent SFO inversion operations and adaptive adjustments of the degrees of freedom of the overall DEDR image enhancement techniques ruled by the employed fixed-point iterative process [8]. For the real-world large-scale RS scenes, such adaptive full-format DEDR-optimal method turns out to be computationally extremely consuming, therefore cannot be recommended as a practical technique realizable in (near) real time [10]. The innovative idea {{of this paper is to}} aggregate the DEDR-optimal fixed-point iterative reconstruction/enhancement procedures developed in the previous studies [7, 8, 10] with the multi-level robustness and convergence enforcing regularization via constructing the proper projections onto convex sets (POCS) in the solution domain. The established POCS-regularized iterative DEDR technique is performed separately along the range and azimuth directions over the scene frame making an optimal use of the range-azimuth sparseness properties of the employed radar/SAR modulation format. Thus, at the SW codesign stage, we address two conceptually innovative propositions that distinguish our approach from the previous studies [7, 10]. First, two possible observation scenarios (instead of one) are unified now under the DEDR paradigm for the HW/SW codesign, namely, (i) regular case without model uncertaintiess and (ii) uncertain scenario with random perturbations in the SFO. Second, the POCS regularization is proposed to be performed in an aggregated multi-level fashion to make the optimal use of the non-trivial RS system model information for constructing the corresponding robustness and convergence enforcing POCS operators. In particular, the positivity and range-azimuth orthogonalization projectors of [10] are aggregated with the point spread function (PSF) sparseness enforcing sliding window projectors acting in parallel over both range and azimuth image frames that set the corresponding PSF pixel values to zeroes outside their specified support regions. Such aggregated POCS regularization drastically speeds up the resulting fixed-point iterative DEDR techniques making them exactly well fitted for the systolic computational implementation form; that is, provides the SW algorithmic base for the further HW codesign level of the problem treatment.|$|R
