40|$|In such territories {{where food}} {{production}} is mostly scattered in several small / medium size or even domestic farms, {{a lot of}} heterogeneous residues are produced yearly, since farmers usually carry out different activities in their properties. The amount and composition of farm residues, therefore, widely change during year, according to the single production process periodically achieved. Coupling high efficiency micro-cogeneration energy units with easy handling biomass conversion equipments, suitable to treat different materials, would provide many important advantages to the farmers and to the community as well, so {{that the increase in}} feedstock flexibility of gasification units is nowadays seen as a further paramount step towards their wide spreading in rural areas and as a real necessity for their utilization at small scale. Two main research topics were thought to be of main concern at this purpose, and they were therefore discussed in this work: the investigation of fuels properties impact on gasification process development and the technical feasibility of small scale gasification units integration with cogeneration systems. According to these two main aspects, the present work was thus divided in two main parts. The first one is focused on the biomass gasification process, that was investigated in its theoretical aspects and then analytically modelled in order to simulate thermo-chemical conversion of different biomass fuels, such as wood (park waste wood and softwood), wheat straw, sewage sludge and refuse derived fuels. The main idea is to correlate the results of reactor design procedures with the physical properties of biomasses and the corresponding working conditions of gasifiers (temperature profile, above all), in order to point out the main differences which prevent the use of the same conversion unit for different materials. At this scope, a gasification kinetic free model was initially developed in Excel sheets, considering different values of air to biomass ratio and the downdraft gasification technology as particular examined application. The differences in syngas production and working conditions (process temperatures, above all) among the considered fuels were tried to be connected to some biomass properties, such elementary composition, ash and water contents. The novelty of this analytical approach was the use of kinetic constants ratio in order to determine oxygen distribution among the different oxidation reactions (regarding volatile matter only) while equilibrium of water gas shift reaction was considered in gasification zone, by which the energy and mass balances involved in the process algorithm were linked together, as well. Moreover, the main advantage of this analytical tool is the easiness by which the input data corresponding to the particular biomass materials can be inserted into the model, so that a rapid evaluation on their own thermo-chemical conversion properties is possible to be obtained, mainly based on their chemical composition A good conformity of the model results with the other literature and experimental data was detected for almost all the considered materials (except for refuse derived fuels, because of their unfitting chemical composition with the model assumptions). Successively, a dimensioning procedure for open core downdraft gasifiers was set up, by the analysis on the fundamental thermo-physical and thermo-chemical mechanisms which are supposed to regulate the main solid conversion steps involved in the gasification process. Gasification units were schematically subdivided in four reaction zones, respectively corresponding to biomass heating, solids drying, pyrolysis and char gasification processes, and the time required for the full development of each of these steps was correlated to the kinetics rates (for pyrolysis and char gasification processes only) and to the heat and mass transfer phenomena from gas to solid phase. On the basis of this analysis and according to the kinetic free model results and biomass physical properties (particles size, above all) it was achieved that for all the considered materials char gasification step is kinetically limited and therefore temperature is the main working parameter controlling this step. Solids drying is mainly regulated by heat transfer from bulk gas to the inner layers of particles and the corresponding time especially depends on particle size. Biomass heating is almost totally achieved by the radiative heat transfer from the hot walls of reactor to the bed of material. For pyrolysis, instead, working temperature, particles size and the same nature of biomass (through its own pyrolysis heat) have all comparable weights on the process development, so that the corresponding time can be differently depending on one of these factors according to the particular fuel is gasified and the particular conditions are established inside the gasifier. The same analysis also led to the estimation of reaction zone volumes for each biomass fuel, so as a comparison among the dimensions of the differently fed gasification units was finally accomplished. Each biomass material showed a different volumes distribution, so that any dimensioned gasification unit {{does not seem to be}} suitable for more than one biomass species. Nevertheless, since reactors diameters were found out quite similar for all the examined materials, it could be envisaged to design a single units for all of them by adopting the largest diameter and by combining together the maximum heights of each reaction zone, as they were calculated for the different biomasses. A total height of gasifier as around 2400 mm would be obtained in this case. Besides, by arranging air injecting nozzles at different levels along the reactor, gasification zone could be properly set up according to the particular material is in turn gasified. Finally, since gasification and pyrolysis times were found to considerably change according to even short temperature variations, it could be also envisaged to regulate air feeding rate for each gasified material (which process temperatures depend on), so as the available reactor volumes would be suitable for the complete development of solid conversion in each case, without even changing fluid dynamics behaviour of the unit as well as air/biomass ratio in noticeable measure. The second part of this work dealt with the gas cleaning systems to be adopted downstream the gasifiers in order to run high efficiency CHP units (i. e. internal engines and micro-turbines). Especially in the case multi–fuel gasifiers are assumed to be used, weightier gas cleaning lines need to be envisaged in order to reach the standard gas quality degree required to fuel cogeneration units. Indeed, as the more heterogeneous feed to the gasification unit, several contaminant species can simultaneously be present in the exit gas stream and, as a consequence, suitable gas cleaning systems have to be designed. In this work, an overall study on gas cleaning lines assessment is carried out. Differently from the other research efforts carried out in the same field, the main scope is to define general arrangements for gas cleaning lines suitable to remove several contaminants from the gas stream, independently on the feedstock material and the energy plant size The gas contaminant species taken into account in this analysis were: particulate, tars, sulphur (in H 2 S form), alkali metals, nitrogen (in NH 3 form) and acid gases (in HCl form). For each of these species, alternative cleaning devices were designed according to three different plant sizes, respectively corresponding with 8 Nm 3 /h, 125 Nm 3 /h and 350 Nm 3 /h gas flows. Their performances were examined on the basis of their optimal working conditions (efficiency, temperature and pressure drops, above all) and their own consumption of energy and materials. Successively, the designed units were combined together in different overall gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>line</b> arrangements, paths, by following some technical constraints which were mainly determined from the same performance analysis on the cleaning units and from the presumable synergic effects by contaminants on the right working of some of them (filters clogging, catalysts deactivation, etc.). One of the main issues to be stated in paths design accomplishment was the tars removal from the gas stream, preventing filters plugging and/or line pipes clogging At this scope, a catalytic tars cracking unit was envisaged as the only solution to be adopted, and, therefore, a catalytic material which is able to work at relatively low temperatures was chosen. Nevertheless, a rapid drop in tars cracking efficiency was also estimated for this same material, so that an high frequency of catalysts regeneration and a consequent relevant air consumption for this operation were calculated in all of the cases. Other difficulties had to be overcome in the abatement of alkali metals, which condense at temperatures lower than tars, but they also need to be removed in the first sections of gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>line</b> in order to avoid corrosion of materials. In this case a dry scrubber technology was envisaged, by using the same fine particles filter units and by choosing for them corrosion resistant materials, like ceramic ones. Besides these two solutions which seem to be unavoidable in gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>line</b> design, high temperature gas cleaning lines were not possible to be achieved for the two larger plant sizes, as well. Indeed, as the use of temperature control devices was precluded in the adopted design procedure, ammonia partial oxidation units (as the only considered methods for the abatement of ammonia at high temperature) were not suitable for the large scale units, because of the high increase of reactors temperature by the exothermic reactions involved in the process. In spite of these limitations, yet, overall arrangements for each considered plant size were finally designed, so that the possibility to clean the gas up to the required standard degree was technically demonstrated, even in the case several contaminants are simultaneously present in the gas stream. Moreover, all the possible paths defined for the different plant sizes were compared each others on the basis of some defined operational parameters, among which total pressure drops, total energy losses, number of units and secondary materials consumption. On the basis of this analysis, dry gas cleaning methods proved preferable to the ones including water scrubber technology in al of the cases, especially because of the high water consumption provided by water scrubber units in ammonia adsorption process. This result is yet connected to the possibility to use activated carbon units for ammonia removal and Nahcolite adsorber for chloride acid. The very high efficiency of this latter material is also remarkable. Finally, as an estimation of the overall energy loss pertaining the gas cleaning process, the total enthalpy losses estimated for the three plant sizes were compared with the respective gas streams energy contents, these latter obtained on the basis of low heating value of gas only. This overall study on gas cleaning systems is thus proposed as an analytical tool by which different gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>line</b> configurations can be evaluated, according to the particular practical application they are adopted for and the size of cogeneration unit they are connected to. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{collaborative}} actions and sustainability in the medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) industry. A lot of attention was given to the MAPs industry actors and foreign direct investments. Undoubtedly, the development trend of MAPs industry is tightly associated with the supply sources of farmers and gatherers. Overproduction of MAPs products including organic and cultivated products is very much damaging the biodiversity, food industry and environment. The overlapping of common mission, vision and objectives of industrial partners and stakeholders are quite crucial to overcome industrial, environmental and quality issues. The market share of MAPs products has become harshly competitive. Governmental bodies also have some sectoral plans for cultivation of products and intervention to the whole sector. ‘Business – academia – society’ relationships were argued in order to highlight to what extent scientific investigations and research projects in the MAPs industry can be effective for structuring network database of the whole farmers and gatherers' information, taking the MAPs industry under the control of State's mechanism (e. g. Ministry of Agriculture) through public sector – private sector – civil society collaborations (i. e. agricultural hybridity). Direct contacts and strong ties of corporations with Ministry of Agriculture may influence more flexibly to draw a direction of the herbs and spices industry in general and MAPs products trading in particular. Local stakeholders’ engagement and agricultural hybridity are likely to strengthen local villagers and gatherers for combating poverty, ensuring more prosperity, cleaner environment and sustainable development, as well as providing mutual benefits and reciprocal strategic interests in frame of universal business ethics. Moreover, setting up long-range partnerships and cooperation with foreign partners as stakeholders and interest groups of the aggregate production and marketing process affect the sustainability of MAPs industry, significantly.

Comprehensive research programmes, including field surveys, have indicated that solids found in sewers, either in suspension or in deposition, cannot be considered as having a unique entity. On the basis of sewerage and sources, a categorization can be made between three broad types of solids: sewer grits, sanitary solids and (runoff-generated) fine material. Although some other categorizations are also possible, it is apparent that each of these three types has very specific physico-chemical characteristics and this has important implications both from the environmental and the operational points of view. The diversity of the types of sewer solids is not infinite (from place to place, sediments will differ only within relatively narrow bands), nonetheless the differences are the main reason why the development of a ''universal'' sewer sediment transport model is a remote prospect. For some elementary processes, such as the movement of non-cohesive grit in drainage conduits, detailed engineering solutions are beginning to emerge. It is also apparent that bed shear stress is a more appropriate parameter than flow velocity for defining erosive or depositional criteria in sewers. There is no doubt that in the future, the various problems of sewer sediments, washout of pollutants during storm overflows, reduction of hydraulic capacity, recurrent costs for <b>cleaning</b> sewerage <b>lines</b> and tanks, will have to be considered intrinsically in all urban drainage applications (design and analysis).

At these conditions sulfidation of CeO{sub 2 } was rapid and complete. Sulfur material balance closure was satisfactory, and, except for the unexpected H{sub 2 }S plateau during the prebreakthrough period, the sulfidation results were as expected. Near {{the end of the}} quarter, the cause of the H{sub 2 }S plateau was tentatively identified as being due to reaction between H{sub 2 } and elemental sulfur deposited downstream of the sorbent {{in the bottom of the}} reactor and in tubing leading to the gas chromatograph. The sulfur deposits occurred during regeneration tests, and chemically <b>cleaning</b> the <b>lines</b> between regeneration and sulfidation coupled with reducing the temperature of the transfer line during sulfidation greatly reduced the H{sub 2 }S plateau. A brief examination of the effect of sulfidation temperature between 700 and 850 {degrees}C showed relatively little temperature effect, although the slope of the active portion of the breakthrough curve was somewhat smaller at 700 {degrees}C, which is consistent with a smaller reaction rate at this temperature...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{different}} processes using wet chemistry {{are necessary for}} a microfabrication <b>line.</b> <b>Cleaning,</b> coating, developing, etching, coating removal, lift-off. In semiconductor fabrication lines these processes are performed in spin coaters, cleaners, etch tools, and others. To fulfil the requirements of homogeneity, cleanliness, low particulate emission, and high throughput, these tools are highly specialised and expensive. Otherwise, for manufacturing microsystem devices a strong demand for less expensive and flexible work stations is expected. Tools commerically available offer an integration of {{only a small number}} of steps in one machine. An important goal is to have a set of processes in one machine instead of two or more. This reduces the capital expenditures, the need for clean room area, the costs for installation, and danger of particulate contamination by handling from step to step. Furthermore, the number of SMIF stations and handlers is reduced. Designing new equipment by us ing modules seems to be necessary. Thereby, machines will be adopted to different applications by changing or omitting the modules relevant or unnecessary for the processes of interest. Customers' demands can be satisfied within a short time and machines already installed can easily be modified for a new application. The design of new equipment is presented. The essential parts are modules which can be interchanged. The advantages of the new design are described...|$|R
40|$|Since farmers {{engage in}} a complex, dynamic process of learning-by-doing, {{evaluating}} economic incentives, and assessing risks in deciding whether to adopt agroforestry systems, a multi-pronged research approach is required for a complete analysis of adoption potential and to develop effective technological and institutional interventions. A case study is presented for using multiple approaches to analyse the potential for reforestation and improving livelihoods of small farmers through the adoption of agroforestry systems in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Campeche, Mexico. Specifically, the results from a participatory research project are combined with revealed preference analysis of a household survey to analyse past adoption decisions and preferences, identify limitations, test and evaluate alternatives, and evaluate methods for risk reduction. The participatory research trials suggest that continuous intercropping and <b>line</b> <b>cleaning</b> are equally effective for tree growth, while continuous cropping during the first years offers the additional advantage of early returns to investments through crop production. Farmer participation in the research process, planning of production systems, and annual evaluations, assisted farmers and researchers in identifying limitations, testing and evaluating alternatives, and improving the viability and sustainability of systems. The revealed preference analysis provides insights as to which households {{are most likely to}} initially adopt agroforestry systems developed through the participatory research trials. In general, households that originated from the Yucatan Peninsula with more education, more experience both in age of the head of household an...|$|R
500|$|Funimation {{separated}} the series into four [...] "seasons", that each compose their own story arc, which {{they refer to}} as [...] "sagas". In North America, 32 DVD compilations have been released by Funimation for the four sagas, with the first released on April 16, 2002, and the last on July 19, 2005. The episodes have been released in both edited and uncut formats. In addition, DVD collection boxes have been released for all four sagas, each containing all the episodes of that particular saga, {{with the exception of}} the Dark Tournament Saga, which was split into two collection boxes. Funimation released season box sets of the anime starting with season one on July 8, 2008 and ending with season four on January 13, 2009. Each set contains four DVDs which have 28 episodes, or one quarter of the whole series. Funimation began releasing the seasons on Blu-ray Disc on May 31, 2011. Cook has stated that the production staff made minor improvements to their recordings, such as redubbing certain <b>lines,</b> <b>cleaning</b> up the dialogue, and removing [...] "arrant anomalies". In Japan, three separate multidisc DVD box sets were released, as well as 28 DVDs totaling all 112 episodes of the series. Japanese home video distributor Bandai Visual began releasing the series on Blu-ray Disc on October 27, 2009, with the first set containing a picture drama set after the end of the series that saw cast members reunite to record new dialogue.|$|R
40|$|Trenchless {{renovation}} {{has been}} in operation since the 1970 ’s in North America and the United Kingdom. However, {{it has not been}} widely accepted due to cost effectiveness concerns. Many Canadian cities are faced with the problem of aging and deteriorating water distribution network due to one or a combination of pipe breaks, leakages, or aesthetic water quality problems, resulting from aging and internal corrosion. Various polymer-based products such as Cured-in Place Pipe (CIPP) lining have been widely employed in structural water main rehabilitation applications. On the other hand, only a few technologies deal with non-structural systems, usually meant to serve as barrier coatings thereby protecting the iron water mains. This thesis presents the results of a laboratory testing program designed to investigate the renewal of potable water mains via the use of polyurea and epoxy-polyurethane lining in two separate locations in Ontario. The effectiveness of using these polymeric linings are investigated, available and new cleaning technologies are discussed, and thereafter properties of the tested liner material are verified. There are two primary objectives for this research. They include 1) evaluation of the lining products, which are installed using new technologies, and 2) development of testing protocol to address construction Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) concerns for the new technologies. Employing a spray-on liner in trenchless technology applications provide several challenges including unknown pipe life, unknown corrosion rate in pipes, and pipe-liner material interaction (in form of bond). This research incorporated some trial sites to gather field data related to the primary objectives described above. The trial site is located at the 3 M Oxford street facility, located in London, Canada. The field installation of liners into pipe sections are put into practical demonstration and samples are tested for as per quality control. Finally, it is concluded that using an effective pipe <b>cleaning</b> method eradicates <b>lining</b> faults and improves adhesion to the host pipe. Also, a strategic QA/QC test protocol is developed...|$|R
