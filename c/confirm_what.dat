25|$|In 1996, it was {{established}} that Victoria suffered from anorexia, it was however not confirmed {{until the next}} year. Already at that time she was getting professional help, but given her public position in Sweden it was getting increasingly difficult to handle the situation. Victoria had planned to study at Uppsala University, but after intense media speculation and public discussion when pictures of an evidently emaciated Victoria in sleeveless dresses at the Order of the Innocence’s ball and the gala dinner for the incoming state visit from Austria surfaced in April 1997, the Royal Court decided to <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> was feared.|$|E
25|$|After condemning some of {{the other}} nations of Europe (who in his opinion fail to live up to Christian ideals), the poet tells of the Portuguese fleet {{reaching}} the Indian city of Calicut. A Muslim named Monçaide greets the fleet and tells the explorers about the lands they have reached. The king, Samorin, hears of the newcomers and summons them. A governor and official of the king, called the Catual, leads the Portuguese to the king, who receives them well. The Catual speaks with Monçaide {{to learn more about the}} new arrivals.

25|$|It {{was officially}} {{confirmed}} on January 22, 2013 that Harvick would be switching teams. Harvick and Childress said the parting was mutual {{and that it}} was time for Harvick to move on. Stewart-Haas Racing did not <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> sponsor or number Harvick would be given. During the official reports it was reported, but not officially told, that Budweiser was interested in staying with Harvick. Kevin Harvick and Stewart-Haas Racing co-owner Tony Stewart gave reports in the Summer of 2013 that Harvick would most likely drive the No. 4. On July 12, 2013, it was confirmed that Harvick would indeed drive the No. 4 but would replace Ryan Newman, who decided to part ways with Stewart-Haas Racing at the end of the season. Harvick retained Budweiser as his primary sponsor for 21 races, with Jimmy John's sponsoring the remaining races for the 2014 season. In October, it was announced that Harvick would also run a partial schedule in the Nationwide Series in 2014, competing in a minimum of 12 races for JR Motorsports.|$|E

Admiral Fisher wanted his board to confirm, refine and implement his ideas of a warship that had both the speed of [...] and 12-inch guns, pointing out that at the Battle of Tsushima, Admiral Togo {{had been able to}} cross the Russians' [...] "T" [...] due to speed.

500|$|The jewelled Sword of Offering, made in 1820, has a gilded leather sheath, a {{blade of}} Damascus steel, and is encrusted with 3,476 {{precious}} stones. GeorgeIV paid almost £6,000 for the sword {{out of his own}} pocket. It remained in personal ownership until 1903 when it was deposited with the Crown Jewels. A monarch is either girded or presented with the sword as the Archbishop says: [...] "With this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity, protect the Holy Church of God, help and defend widows and orphans, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform what is amiss, and <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> is in good order". Afterwards, it is returned to the Keeper of the Jewel House by the abbey in exchange for a token sum of £5, and the sword is borne unsheathed {{for the rest of the}} ceremony.|$|E

NBA commissioner David Stern also believed Lin was not drafted due to discrimination. [...] "I don't know whether he was discriminated against because he was at Harvard. Or because he was Asian," [...] said Stern. Some fans and commentators wrote off his Warriors signing as a publicity stunt. Larry Riley, the team's general manager, denied catering to the Bay Area's large Asian population. He understood that some people would see it that way. [...] "We evaluated him throughout summer league," [...] Riley said. [...] "All that had to happen was for him to <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> we already believed." [...] While the team created a campaign around him, Riley said {{it would not have been}} advisable if Lin was not a basketball player first.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to their}} {{experience}} with bringing Black onto the project, obtaining the voicework of the metal artists were also unexpected but beneficial. This led to some confusion during voice recording sessions; both Lita Ford and Rob Halford had difficulties with lines involving a character named [...] "Lita Halford". Furthermore, both Black and Osbourne frequently injected profanity into their scripted lines during recording sessions. Instead of rerecording these, the development left these in the game, but included the option for a profanity content filter to be enabled by the player to [...] "bleep" [...] out these words and mask such word on screen using the Parents Music Resource Center [...] "Parental Advisory" [...] label, an icon that Schafer considered {{to be part of}} the history of heavy metal. [...] A similar filter exists for gore in the game, preventing any dismemberment and disabling blood in the game. Schafer stated the filters were added to the game in consideration of older players that may not wish to see such aspects, or for parents who opt to play the game with younger children. During development, Schafer stated that while he could not <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> other musicians and bands would be in the game, there would be more than already stated, and that these musicians were [...] "especially conducive to character creation" [...] due to the amount of theatrics used in their concert shows.|$|E

2500|$|Following U.S. Navy {{missions}} in Operation Odyssey Dawn during the 2011 Libyan Revolution, the Royal Australian Air Force decided {{to add the}} Raytheon ATFLIR (forward looking infrared) pod to their order of 12 Growler aircraft.

2500|$|The {{movement}} for intelligent design claims that an intelligent creator {{is responsible for}} the origin of life and of humankind, and rejects evolution. Jewish theologians, organizations, and activists have maintained that intelligent design is not valid science but that it is a religious concept. Although some have expressed support for a theistic interpretation of evolution, they have generally rejected the tenets of the intelligent design movement. To Rabbi Brad Hirschfield, President of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership, intelligent design is [...] "their attempt to <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> they already believe." [...] Jewish organizations in the United States have been steadfast in their opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools, charging that to do so would violate {{the separation of church and}} state.|$|E

2500|$|Penrose and Hameroff {{have argued}} that {{consciousness}} {{is the result of}} quantum gravity effects in microtubules, which they dubbed Orch-OR (orchestrated objective reduction). Max Tegmark, in a paper in Physical Review E, calculated that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the decoherence time by a factor of at least 10,000,000,000. The reception of the paper is summed up by this statement in Tegmark's support: [...] "Physicists outside the fray, such as IBM's John A. Smolin, say the calculations <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> they had suspected all along. 'We're not working with a brain that's near absolute zero. It's reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior'". Tegmark's paper has been widely cited by critics of the Penrose–Hameroff position.|$|E
2500|$|Nader Shah's rule {{abruptly}} {{ended in}} June 1747 {{when he was}} assassinated by his own guards. The guards involved in the assassination did so secretly so as to prevent the Abdalis from coming to their King's rescue.

Despite the danger of being attacked, the Abdali contingent led by Durrani rushed either to save the Shah or to <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> happened.

2500|$|In 1841 Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the {{daughter}} of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) {{were told by}} Ada's mother that her father was also Medora's father. On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: [...] "I am {{not in the least}} astonished. In fact, you merely <b>confirm</b> <b>what</b> I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected." [...] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: [...] "I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was." [...] In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals: first, from a relaxed relationship with men who were not her husband, which led to rumours of affairs—and secondly, her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than £3,000 on the horses during the later 1840s. The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband. She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her. During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.|$|E
