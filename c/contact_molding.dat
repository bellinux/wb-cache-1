In the same period, Roski gained experience of marine construction by producing the full series of Bombardier sailboats. In parallel with the expertise in large-volume manufacturing of composite parts using <b>contact</b> <b>molding</b> technology, Roski diversified by being one of the first North American companies to make large-scale use of liquid resin injection and high-pressure molding. In the 1970s, Roski acquired filament winding technology. In the same period, Roski also produced gas tanks for HDPE molded personal watercraft, using rotational molding. From 1970 to 1985, Roski capitalized on technological breakthroughs, leading to expertise in parts for the marine and ground transportation (truck, bus, subway and train) industries, as well as for recreation, construction and corrosion-resistance applications.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{sandwich}} deck panels with sinusoidal {{honeycomb core}} geometry have {{shown to be}} efficient in both new construction and rehabilitation of highway bridge decks. The sandwich panel consists of top and bottom laminated face sheets bonded to the honeycomb core, which extends vertically between face sheets. This paper {{is focused on the}} study of the buckling capacities of the core components under out-of-plane compression. The facesheet and core are attached by <b>contact</b> <b>molding</b> and are, therefore, not rigidly connected. Thus, this problem can be described as the instability of an FRP core panel with two rotationally restrained loaded edges. An elastic restraint coefficient is introduced to quantify the bonding layer effect between the facesheet and core, and a simple and relatively accurate test method is proposed to obtain the restraint coefficient experimentally. A combined analytical and experimental study of compression is presented. By solving a transcendental equation, the critical compression buckling stresses are obtained, and a simplified expression to predict buckling strength is formulated in terms of the elastic restraint coefficient.

The thermal and mechanical phenomena are then coupled in two directions. The method was applied to analyze stress in a stress frame specimen casting and a cylinder block. The results are more accurate than without consideration of the contact effects on the heat transfer.

Besides, and once the laminate is within the mold, {{the most effective way to}} decrease the gel time is to increase the temperature and the heating rate with regard to the material damaging temperatures. As stated above, the slightly increased mobility of the contamination due to an increased heating rate and temperature is more than leveled by the reduced contact time and thus the reduced gel time.|$|R
