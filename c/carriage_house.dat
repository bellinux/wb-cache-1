5|$|Another of the property's buildings, {{commonly}} called the <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> never {{lived up to}} its popular name. The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles. The southern section of the <b>carriage</b> <b>house</b> was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1912 and features a mansard roof. The building is sheathed in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs as well as a barbed wire history museum.|$|E
5|$|The Ellwood House grounds hold several extant {{outbuildings}} as well: {{the museum}} house, the <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> the water tower, and the Little House.|$|E
5|$|Office of Strategic Influence is {{the first}} album by American {{progressive}} rock band OSI, released by InsideOut Music on February 18, 2003. The album was recorded in June 2002 and mixed in August 2002 at the <b>Carriage</b> <b>House</b> Studios in Stamford, Connecticut.|$|E
50|$|Horse-drawn {{carriages}} {{are much}} less common now than in previous times, creating very little need {{in the modern world}} for true <b>carriage</b> <b>houses.</b> Accordingly, many <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> have been modified to other uses such as secondary suites, guest houses, automobile garages, offices, workshops, retail shops, bars, restaurants, or storage buildings. However, such structures are still often called <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> in deference to their original function and regardless of their current use.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the prestigious}} nature of some large, {{elaborate}} <b>carriage</b> <b>houses,</b> the term [...] "Carriage House" [...] is commonly used {{as part of the}} name of businesses such as antique shops and restaurants. Sometimes these businesses are <b>housed</b> in former <b>carriage</b> <b>houses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, Ballet Hispánico {{purchased}} two <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> {{adjacent to}} the former Claremont Riding Academy building on West 89th Street listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The structures were built to designs by architect Frank A. Rooke in 1892. With architects Buck/Cane, Ballet Hispánico converted the two <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> into the company's headquarters in 1989. [...] A subsequent expansion in 2006 doubled {{the capacity of the}} organization's facilities.|$|R
5|$|Depending {{upon the}} size and {{economic}} well-being of the farm, there might also be a feast hall (oppstue), a house for the retired farmers (føderådstue), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), <b>carriage</b> <b>house</b> (vognskjul), and even distillery (brenneskur). Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities {{they could not afford}} to build houses for.|$|E
5|$|South Lake Avenue facing Washington Park {{consists}} of 23 rowhouses, a modern apartment building, and a converted <b>carriage</b> <b>house.</b> The Elouise Apartments {{were built in}} 1927 in the Classical Revival architecture style and are eight stories tall. 55 South Lake Avenue is in the Art Deco style, while 57 to 87 South Lake, built in 1896–97 is a row of yellow brick facades designed by Albert Fuller.|$|E
5|$|The <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> {{today the}} Ellwood House Museum's Education and Visitors Center, {{was built by}} Perry Ellwood as a multi-car garage. It had a grease pit for {{automobile}} repair work. On the second floor was an apartment for the Ellwood family chauffeur. The building originally had garage doors on both sides so cars could drive in one side {{and out the other}} side of the structure. The original doors are on display inside the Ellwood House Visitors Center.|$|E
50|$|The district's {{buildings}} {{fall into}} three types, representing different eras of local development: two Italianate rowhouses, 11 <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> and two taller structures built for commercial purposes. The rowhouses are the oldest, {{dating to the}} early development of the Upper East Side during the Civil War. The <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> came later, some built {{on the site of}} demolished early rowhouses, with the commercial buildings coming {{near the end of the}} block's development.|$|R
50|$|Many {{homes in}} the {{northern}} section of Bloomingdale retain <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> in the block interiors. Some have been converted to private residences.|$|R

5|$|Arthur Fiacco, a cellist, {{arrived at}} <b>Carriage</b> <b>House</b> first. He {{was dressed in}} formal black and white attire, having {{traveled}} from an afternoon concert. Fiacco {{was surprised to find}} there were no scores written for the musicians to play; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis had shown him. The violinists, Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud, also followed the directions of Francis and Norton. Another cellist, Ann Rorich, credited on the album and single, was sent home; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts.|$|E
5|$|The Beechwood estate also {{contained}} a <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> gatehouse, squash court (no longer extant), and a white-stucco artist's studio named Beech Twig, which {{was home to}} author John Cheever, whose children attended the school on the property. The family rented the house until they moved to Ossining. Descriptions of the building's interior closely match descriptions employed by Cheever in some short stories. Novelist Richard Yates also {{lived in the same}} house as a child, as well as other artists, writers, and composers. The estate's garage is located northeast of the mansion, and is a flat-roof, two-story concrete building dating to the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} barn complex predates the Shepards' {{ownership of}} the property; it was built around 1875 as part of Wright's original estate. The most prominent component is the brick <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> which was designed by McKim, Mead & White. It is made of brick with granite trim and is {{one and a half}} stories high, ten bays wide and three bays deep. It has a steeply pitched slate hip roof with spring eaves and exposed rafters. At the roof's ridge sits an octagonal ventilating element with a bell-cast roof.|$|E
50|$|Architect Edward Vance {{said the}} casino's {{weathered}} wood exterior was originally inspired by historic lumber mills, and later modifications were modeled on photographs of <b>carriage</b> <b>houses.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1901, Gunness {{purchased}} {{a house on}} McClung Road in LaPorte, Indiana. It {{has been reported that}} both the boat and <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> burned to the ground shortly after she acquired the property.|$|R
5|$|The present {{hall was}} built in 1616 by Sir George Booth, who {{received}} {{one of the first}} baronetcies to be created by James I in 1611; it was remodelled by John Norris for his descendant, George, 2nd Earl of Warrington between 1732 and 1740; it was further altered by John Hope {{towards the end of the}} 18th century and again by Joseph Compton Hall between 1905 and 1908. The hall, stables, and the <b>carriage</b> <b>house</b> of Dunham Massey are all Grade I listed buildings, three of six such buildings in Trafford.|$|E
5|$|Matheos, Moore and Portnoy {{recorded}} the album at <b>Carriage</b> <b>House</b> Studios in Stamford, Connecticut from June 2 to June 9, 2002. Songs {{with a strong}} progressive metal influence were mostly written by Matheos, while Moore had greater influence over the vocal-driven tracks. Portnoy made minor arrangement suggestions but did not {{take part in the}} actual writing of the album. The album's recording sessions were the first time Moore and Portnoy collaborated since 1994 in their work in Dream Theater. In 2009, Portnoy recalled that he found the experience of making the record difficult, and that he was frustrated by the lack of collaboration between him and Moore. Differences between Moore and Portnoy led to his return on the follow-up album as a session drummer rather than full-time member.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) {{side of the}} home, near the <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> is a {{miniature}} Stick style house known as Little House. Little House is 13 feet (4 m) by 15 feet (4.6 m) and stands 14 feet (4.3 m) above its concrete foundation. The Little House's roof is an exact replica of the original roof of the Ellwood House. Little House was built in 1892 with assistance from every carpenter in DeKalb; the house was {{to be used as}} a float in a local parade. After the parade Isaac Ellwood's son, Will, bought the house and had it placed on the Ellwood House property in the same location it stands today. The house was used by Will's two daughters and later by Perry Ellwood's children.|$|E
50|$|A livery stable kept {{horses and}} usually {{carriages}} for hire. A range of stables, usually with <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> (remises) and living quarters {{built around a}} yard, court or street, is called a mews.|$|R
50|$|In 1901, Gunness {{purchased}} {{a house on}} McClung Road in LaPorte, Indiana. It {{has been reported that}} both the boat and <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> burned to the ground shortly after she acquired the property.|$|R
50|$|Richard Morris Hunt {{designed}} 166 East 73rd, {{the first}} one, for art collector Henry Marquand in 1883. In 1890 the large stable at 182 {{was built to}} rent stable space to owners {{who did not want}} or could not afford to build their own <b>carriage</b> <b>houses.</b> The other <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> were gradually built in the 1890s, with the last ones completed early in the next century. Among these, Charles Romeyn contributed the neo-Flemish building next to Hunt's in 1899. Shortly after Marquard's death, Hunt's was sold to Joseph Pulitzer, then publisher of the New York World, who lived several blocks to the east at 73rd and Park.|$|R
5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears {{much the same as}} it did when it was newly constructed but for many years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious need of repair and by the 1970s both porches were gone and the only way into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the Visitors Center to the <b>Carriage</b> <b>House,</b> the Museum House served as the visitors center and housed staff offices.|$|E
5|$|The main {{campus of}} Seton Hall University is {{situated}} on 58acres (23ha) of suburban land on South Orange Avenue. It {{is home to}} nine of the 10 schools and colleges of the University. The South Orange Village center is just ½mile (0.8km) west of the main campus. Directly across from the main campus to the northwest are scenic Montrose Park and the Montrose Park Historic District, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Eugene V. Kelly <b>Carriage</b> <b>House,</b> on the campus itself, is also NRHP-listed. The village itself dates back to 1666 preceding the establishment of Seton Hall College. Also {{since the beginning of}} the College, the South Orange Rail Station has served as an integral means to campus commuters. The main campus combines architectural styles including Roman, neo-gothic and modern. The South Orange campus became a gated community during the University’s Modernization Period.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dormitory}} {{on campus}} was Hays Hall. Wade House, <b>Carriage</b> <b>House,</b> and Whitworth House are Victorian homes housing older students. The recently constructed Chestnut Street Housing complex provides {{housing for the}} college's Greek organizations. The Presidents' Row is a cluster of ten buildings {{in the center of}} campus, several of which are dedicated to theme housing. Two sister dormitories, New Residence Hall and Bica-Ross Hall, feature suite-style living arrangements. Mellon Hall and Upperclass Hall house male freshmen. Other dormitories include Alexander Hall, Beau Hall, Marshall Hall, North Hall, and Penn House. The college administration utilizes several buildings, including the Admissions House, the Alumni House, and the President’s House, which are all modified Victorian homes. The U. Grant Miller Library is the modern library; its predecessor, Thompson Hall, is now used for administrative purposes. The Hub, The Commons, and the Rossin Campus Center provide recreational and dining facilities for students. The athletic and intramural teams utilize Cameron Stadium for football and track. The Henry Memorial Center is used for basketball, wrestling, swimming, and volleyball. Other athletic facilities include Brooks Park, Ross Memorial Park and Alexandre Stadium, and the Janet L. Swanson Tennis Courts.|$|E
50|$|In {{succeeding}} years, Robbins {{raised money}} {{to acquire the}} remaining half of the Douglass house, naming it the Museum of African Art. As the collection grew, he purchased adjoining residences, with his museum ultimately including nine townhouses, 16 garages and two <b>carriage</b> <b>houses.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1950, {{the mansion}} became a {{boarding}} house; throughout the next decade, it {{lost much of}} its ornate charm. The construction of Interstate 55 during the 1960s led to the destruction of much of the grounds and one of the <b>carriage</b> <b>houses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Eighteen Hundred Block Park Road, NW is a {{collection}} of ten suburban residences and five <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The houses form an historic district and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.|$|R
25|$|On the grounds, behind Wheatland, stand a privy, a smokehouse, and a <b>carriage</b> <b>house.</b> A stable used {{to stand}} on the {{property}} but was replaced by the <b>carriage</b> <b>house</b> in the late 1880s; an icehouse also no longer exists. The <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> today, houses meeting and reception space.|$|E
25|$|The Lake–Peterson House {{property}} has an extant outbuilding, the <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> {{which is}} also cast in the Gothic Revival style. The Lake-Peterson <b>Carriage</b> <b>House</b> was built {{around the same time}} as the main house. The building features clapboard siding, arched windows and decorative vergeboards. The carriage house's most striking feature is its multi-gabled louvered cupola. Surviving, contemporary outbuildings are unusual. The <b>carriage</b> <b>house,</b> aside from the Lake–Peterson House itself, was identified as architecturally significant by the Illinois Historic Sites Survey in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Originally the <b>Carriage</b> <b>House</b> {{served as}} a stable with horse stalls, a hay loft, and storage for a carriage, but soon became a garage with a service area for a car, and an upstairs {{apartment}} for a chauffeur. The <b>Carriage</b> <b>House</b> also contained the boilers for the complex's heating system. Built between 1903 and 1905, the original structure was demolished in 1962, and rebuilt during the restoration between 2004 and 2007. The <b>Carriage</b> <b>House</b> is {{at the north end}} of the complex, directly north of the Martin House porte-cochere, to the west of the Conservatory.|$|E
50|$|The {{first is}} a three-story brick {{structure}} that houses the club's squash courts. North of it, {{at the corner of}} Dove and Elk, is a two-and-a-half-story wood frame barn. Both were originally used as <b>carriage</b> <b>houses</b> for the late 19th-century mansion that was the original clubhouse.|$|R
