It is shown that in the asymmetric interference case, the optimal sum capacity for the channel can be found by iteratively employing single-user optimizations, and the corresponding single-user problems are solved using modified water-filling algorithms such as directional water-filling and generalized water-filling.

In order to allow {{intermodal transport}} {{to compete in the}} medium distance and high quality market segment, alternative network operations that allow for an intensification of rail services and expansion of geographical coverage are needed. Intermodal liner trains that operate in corridor network designs with intermediate stops between start and end terminals are regularly advocated by intermodal transport researchers as a means to compete with all-road transport on small volumes and short distance markets. Innovative transhipment technologies facilitating fast and efficient transhipments are a necessity for intermodal liner trains since the <b>conventional</b> <b>terminals</b> are not appropriate for intermediate terminals where freight volumes are low and train dwelling times need to be short. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the transhipment unit cost’s effect on the modal shift potential of intermodal liner trains based on fast and efficient transhipments. In a theoretical case study the cost and potential modal share for an intermodal liner train on a corridor in Sweden is analysed. The method is based on modelling a competitive situation between traditional road transport and intermodal road-rail transport. The results confirm that in theory intermodal liner trains can provide competitive services on short and medium transport distances in case transhipment costs are kept low.

Natural gas is transported by pipeline on the shorter distances and as LNG on longer distances. LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) is produced by cooling natural gas to just below its boiling point at - 162 ·C. It is stored and transported in thermally insulated tanks at ambient pressure. Currently the LNG fleet exists of 127 vessels of which the majority have a capacity between 125, 000 m 3 and 135, 000 m 3. The majority of the vessels are project controlled in long-term lease contracts: cuurentlyanother 54 vessels are on order to expand the fleet {{in order to meet}} the expected growth in transport volume. At this moment there are 39 reception terminals, of which 23 are located in Japan the largest importer of LNG, and there are plans for another 25 terminals. The main emerging markets for LNG are the U. S., India and China. In a conventional reception terminal, an LNG carrier is moored to a jetty. When the LNG carrier is offloaded the vapour that is suppressed from the storage tanks is send to the ship.

The various connection methods increase the opportunity for users to access the Internet from public places. They, however, increase the risk of attacks in the real world as well as over the network. For example, in public places, the risk of peep of passwords and the risk of having a device lost or stolen are definitely higher than at home. Therefore new authentication schemes secure even against the above attacks are required. The new schemes should be implemented with low cost over <b>conventional</b> <b>terminals</b> (that are equipped with only keyboards and displays as user interfaces, but no tamper resistant area or no bio-sensors) so that users can use any terminal in the world. Formally, in this dissertation we study remote user authentication under the following scenario. As terminals, we assume conventional ones equipped with only keyboards and displays as user interfaces, but no special devices, such as bio-sensors and tamper resistant area. As adversaries, we assume real world adversaries and network adversaries. The real world ones can peep all the information that is displayed on the terminals and typed to the terminals. They can also steal all the private devices from users. The network adversaries can eavesdrop all the communication between terminals and servers, and also can set up fake servers and then let users connect them.

In Chapter 2, we focus on CRHI (Challenge-Response Human Identification) as a countermeasure against real world adversaries.

40|$|Intermodal road‐rail {{transport}} has {{a medium}} to high market share for large flows over long distances and for seaport hinterland flows, and competes on cost in these markets with road transport. Due {{to the small}} size of this market segment compared to the total transport market the modal shift potential is marginal at best. It is therefore increasingly recognized that the conventional approach to intermodal transport focusing on large flows over long distances may be insufficient to address the persistent problem of a growing modal share of road freight. As a complement to the conventional approach, alternative network operations are needed that allow an intensification of rail services and expansion of geographical coverage. This innovative approach requires fast and efficient transhipment operations, which cannot be achieved by the present <b>conventional</b> <b>terminals</b> since they absorb too much time and money. Hence, technological innovations in the transhipment process will have a major role to play for achieving a modal shift. The raiload technology enables automatic transhipments of standardised loading units below catenaries and thereby makes fast and efficient transhipment operations possible, both for railrail as well as for rail‐road exchange. By that, the technology facilitates the implementation of innovative rail networks. The aim of this research is to analyse how this technological innovation can be integrated in a context of innovative intermodal transport services. The results indicate that fast and efficient transhipment technologies are a prerequisite for intermodal linertrains which can integrate short and medium distance transports in the intermodal system. Linertrains can open business opportunities for operators and cost savings for shippers in a market segment which is dominated by road transport. Furthermore, linertrains can further contribute to reaching policy goals, e. g., lower externalities from freight transport and regional development of far‐off regions. Yet, it is still too early to expect a breakthrough of linertrains. The implementation requires a system innovation but current politics and dominant actors still limit their actions to incremental improvements within the current rail production paradigm and dominant technology based on economies of scale and oppose organisational innovations. However, the fact that the implementation of intermodal linertrains seems to be unrealistic today should not discourage policy makers and stakeholders. System innovations are long‐termprocesses and there are indications that the transition process has started. Continuously increasing freight transport volumes and a significantly increased awareness for sustainable development put the dominating road freight transport paradigm under pressure. As a response, transport politics, transport buyers, and transport operators show an increased interest in intermodal transport. Hence, the current barriers should be seen as challenges to overcome rather than as impediments to progress. To manage the transition towards innovative intermodal transport services and to overcome current barriers, {{there is a need for}} connecting the existing dynamics by applying the technological innovation in the existing large‐scale production system. These niche‐applications do not require major changes of transport and logistics structures and can provide room for technological learning and development which is needed to reduce economic uncertainties and risks involved in technological innovations. A promising approach is a new‐generation large scale hub terminal for seaport hinterland flows, since the raiload technology can contribute to solving existing efficiency and capacity problems in this segment of the transport market...|$|E

The quay wall and terminal yard are raised {{to a level}} well {{above mean sea level}} to assure flood safety. The resulting ‘conventional terminal’ requires large volumes of good quality fill material often dredged from the sea, which is costly. The alternative concept of a ‘polder terminal’ has a terminal yard which lies below the outside water level and is surrounded by a quay wall flood defence structure. This saves large amounts of reclamation investment but introduces a higher damage potential in case of flooding and corresponding flood risk. Important conditions for the feasibility of a polder terminal are low pervious subsoil and high reclamation cost. Further, a polder terminal requires a water storage and drainage system, against additional cost. A risk-based analysis of the optimal quay wall height and polder level is performed, which is an optimization (cost benefit analysis) under two variables. The overtopping failure mechanism proves to be the dominant failure mechanism for flooding. During overtopping the water depth in the polder terminal is larger than on the <b>conventional</b> <b>terminal,</b> resulting in higher damage potential and corresponding flood risk for the polder terminal.

The quay wall and terminal yard are then raised {{to a level}} well {{above mean sea level}} to insure safety against inundation. The resulting ‘conventional terminal’ requires large volumes of good quality fill material often dredged from the sea which is costly. Royal HaskoningDHV developed the concept of a container terminal with a “polder yard”. The yard would lie below the outside water level and be surrounded by a combined quay wall flood defense structure. A water drainage system is required to drain excess water from the polder. This master thesis investigates the technical and economic feasibility. Important conditions for the feasibility of a polder terminal are low conductive (impermeable) subsoil, which limit the amount of seepage water entering the polder, and high reclamation cost. The polder terminal is technically feasible; a conceptual design is made for a case study in Tuas, Singapore. The ‘polder terminal’ could save 10 to 25 % of the total cost (investment and risk) due to the lower reclamation cost. The exact saving depends on the polder depth which is bounded by uplifting failure of the polder yard. The increase in cost due to the risk of inundation and water drainage system is insufficient to counteract the large savings possible.
