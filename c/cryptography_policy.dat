40|$|The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) {{issued on}} 27 March 1997 a {{recommendation}} concerning <b>cryptography</b> <b>policy</b> guidelines {{in an attempt}} to foster international co-operation and harmonization. Information is becoming increasingly valuable in society. Globalization of markets, improvements in information and communication technology and the shift to a knowledge-based economy has, furthermore, created an enormous potential for electronic commerce. Conservative estimates predict electronic commerce will have a turnover of more than US $ 400 billion by 2002. The increasing importance of information and communications has, however, made the information society vulnerable. Cryptography plays an important part in securing transactions in electronic commerce and moreover, in establishing a secure electronic environment in the information society. Fear of privacy infringements and lack of secure methods for electronic transactions has until now been holding electronic commerce back. Cryptographic methods are an essential part in securing electronic commerce. Law enforcement agencies and national security organizations fear, however, that widespread use of strong encryption will impede their work substantially. This thesis analyzes {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} strong encryption and how the balance of the conflicting interests has been dealt with in the OECD <b>Cryptography</b> <b>Policy</b> Guidelines. Moreover, shows the thesis how the OECD <b>Cryptography</b> <b>Policy</b> Guidelines have been implemented and makes suggestions on how the guidelines should be implemented...|$|E
40|$|The formulation, adoption, and {{transformation}} of policy involves {{the interaction of}} actors as they negotiate, accept, and reject proposals. Traditional studies of policy discourse focus on social actors. By studying <b>cryptography</b> <b>policy</b> discourses, I argue that considering both social and technological actors in detail enriches our understanding of policy discourse. The case-based research looks at the various <b>cryptography</b> <b>policy</b> strategies employed by {{the governments of the}} United States of America and the United Kingdom. The research method is qualitative, using hermeneutics to elucidate the various actors’ interpretations. The research aims to understand policy discourse as a contest of principles involving various government actors advocating multiple regulatory mechanisms to maintain their surveillance capabilities, and the reactions of industry actors, non-governmental organisations, parliamentarians, and epistemic communities. I argue that studying socio-technological discourse helps us to understand the complex dynamics involved in regulation and regulatory change. Interests and alignments may be contingent and unstable. As a result, technologies can not be regarded as mere representations of social interests and relationships. By capturing the interpretations and articulations of social and technological actors we may attain {{a better understanding of the}} regulatory landscape for information and communications technologies.

40|$|We {{propose a}} concept for a {{worldwide}} information security infrastructure that protects law-abiding citizens, but not criminals, {{even if the}} latter use it fraudulently (i. e. when not complying with the agreed rules). It {{can be seen as}} a middle course between the inflexible but fraud-resistant KMI-proposal [8] and the flexible but non-fraud-resistant concept used in TIS-CKE [2]. Our concept consists of adding binding data to the latter concept, which will not prevent fraud by criminals but makes it at least detectable by third parties without the need of any secret information. In [19], we depict a worldwide framework in which this concept could present a security tool that is flexible enough to be incorporated in any national <b>cryptography</b> <b>policy,</b> on both the domestic and foreign use of cryptography.

40|$|The {{public debate}} on the {{regulation}} of the Internet and on <b>cryptography</b> <b>policy</b> during the last years has shown a conflict between the authorities' goal of crime prevention and the net users' need for privacy and net security. In this paper, this conflict is examined from an economic point of view. The paper starts with a short description of the different needs and goals of private users and the authorities. Then the state‐of‐the‐art of encryption technology {{and its implications for}} illegal and criminal use of the Internet are discussed. The analytical core follows next; it consists of a game theoretical model of the interaction between the authorities and private users where the degree of regulation of the Internet will be derived. Thereby it is taken into account that private users will react to any state intervention by choosing an appropriate level of Internet use. On this basis, the proposed state interventions will be evaluated. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1999...|$|E

However, there are serious problems when we try to use cryptography in evidence.

40|$|Guidelines for <b>cryptography</b> <b>policy</b> {{would provide}} internationally {{comparable}} {{criteria for the}} encryption of computerised information. Such guidelines – which governments would adopt, and businesses, individuals and law-enforcement officials would apply in safeguarding electronic transactions, communications, and data storage – {{are expected to be}} recommended by the OECD Council in spring 1997. Cryptography is the discipline that embodies the principles, means and methods for the transformation of data in order to hide its content, establish its authenticity, prevent its undetected modification or unauthorised use. Cryptography is therefore an essential component of tomorrow’s Global Information Infrastructure (GII). Cryptographic techniques enable users to protect the privacy of their data (financial or personal records, for example), whether the data are in storage or in transit. Cryptographic techniques also allow users to determine whether someone has altered data – whether, for example, a hacker who has broken into medical records has altered any element of them. They also enable users to determine with confidence the identity of a person or device at a distance, not least by establishing the authenticity of a given document. Cryptography uses a mathematical algorithm to scramble data. Historically, its first use was ‘encryption’, the transformation of data in orde...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{software}} products employing digital {{techniques for}} encryption of data {{are subject to}} export controls in the EU Member States pursuant to Community law and relevant laws in the Member States. These controls are agreed globally {{in the framework of}} the so-called Wassenaar Arrangement. Wassenaar is an informal non-proliferation regime aimed at promoting international stability and responsibility in transfers of strategic (dual-use) products and technology. This thesis covers provisions of Wassenaar, Community export control laws and export control laws of Finland, Sweden, Germany, France and United Kingdom. This thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter discusses the ratio of export control laws and the impact they have on global trade. The ratio is originally defence-related - in general to prevent potential adversaries of participating States from having the same tools, and in particular in the case of cryptographic software to enable signals intelligence efforts. Increasingly as the use of cryptography in a civilian context has mushroomed, export restrictions can have negative effects on civilian trade. Information security solutions may also be took weak because of export restrictions on cryptography. The second chapter covers the OECD's <b>Cryptography</b> <b>Policy,</b> which had a significant effect on its member nations' national cryptography policies and legislation. The OECD is a significant organization,because it acts as a meeting forum for most important industrialized nations. The third chapter covers the Wassenaar Arrangement. The Arrangement is covered from the viewpoint of international law and politics. The Wassenaar control list provisions affecting cryptographic software transfers are also covered in detail. Control lists in the EU and in Member States are usually directly copied from Wassenaar control lists. Controls agreed in its framework set only a minimum level for participating States. However, Wassenaar countries can adopt stricter controls. The fourth chapter covers Community export control law. Export controls are viewed in Community law as falling within the domain of Common Commercial Policy pursuant to Article 133 of the EC Treaty. Therefore the Community has exclusive competence in export matters, save where a national measure is authorized by the Community or falls under foreign or security policy derogations established in Community law. The Member States still have a considerable amount of power in the domain of Common Foreign and Security Policy. They are able to maintain national export controls because export control laws are not fully harmonized. This can also have possible detrimental effects on the functioning of internal market and common export policies. In 1995 the EU adopted Dual-Use Regulation 3381 / 94 /EC, which sets common rules for exports in Member States. Provisions of this regulation receive detailed coverage in this chapter. The fifth chapter covers national legislation and export authorization practices in five different Member States - in Finland, Sweden, Germany, France and in United Kingdom. Export control laws of those Member States are covered when the national laws differ from the uniform approach of the Community's acquis communautaire...|$|E
