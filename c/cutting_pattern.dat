40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} a one-dimensional cutting stock and assortment problem. One {{of the main}} difficulties in formulating and solving these kinds of problems {{is the use of}} the set of <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> as a parameter set in the mathematical model. Since the total number of <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> to be generated may be very huge, both the generation and the use of such a set lead to computational difficulties in solution process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to develop a mathematical model without the use of <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> as model parameters. We propose a new, two-objective linear integer programming model in the form of simultaneous minimization of two contradicting objectives related to the total trim loss amount and the total number of different lengths of stock rolls to be maintained as inventory, in order to fulfill a given set of cutting orders. The model does not require pre-specification of <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns.</b> We suggest a special heuristic algorithm for solving the presented model. The superiority of both the mathematical model and the solution approach is demonstrated on test problems...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} different mathematical approaches to buck-to-order log merchandizing. A new bucking-to-order planning model using mixed integer programming was developed to determine the optimal production from a stand given different market constraints and forest inventory data. Three different approaches: market prices, target <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> and adjusted price list were tested for generating cutting instructions to fulfill the plan created by the new planning model. The three approaches were evaluated in four test stands. The market prices approach simply applied the market prices to each stand. The target <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> approach applied the sample <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> generated from the planning model to the stand. The adjusted price list used a dynamic programming algorithm embedded in a search heuristic to adjust both the prices and small end diameters of log products to achieve the production goals of the planning models. The results showed that developing a buck-to-order plan is important in obtaining good order fulfillment. The target <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> and adjusted price list approaches certainly out performed the market prices approach. This paper shows that these two approaches are capable of achieving excellent order fulfillment. Further development and testing is needed to determine which method is the best at generating cutting instructions for buck-to-order merchandizing...|$|R

In the case of single-curved surface that can be unfolded precisely equi-areal mapping allows one to obtain a <b>cutting</b> <b>pattern</b> for fabric structure without any distortions.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>cutting</b> <b>pattern</b> plays a {{major role}} for the design of {{structural}} membranes, since it influences both their aesthetical appearance and structural behavior. A novel approach towards <b>cutting</b> <b>pattern</b> generation is the so-called Variation of Reference Strategy (VaReS) [1], which minimizes the total potential energy arising from the motion of a planar <b>cutting</b> <b>pattern</b> to its corresponding three-dimensional shape. With non-uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS) being the standard tool for geometry description in CAD, it is only consequent to use these for analysis as well. Isogeometric B-Rep Analysis (IBRA) [2] follows up on this idea and enriches the original Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), which was introduced by Hughes et al. [3], by the possibility of analysing trimmed NURBS geometries. This paper presents <b>cutting</b> <b>pattern</b> generation with the Variation of Reference Strategy in the context of IGA/IBRA. With this approach, the whole design of a membrane structure can be represented by NURBS geometries – including blueprint plans. To use the benefits of IBRA for <b>cutting</b> <b>pattern</b> generation, a NURBS-based membrane-element was developed for the VaReS routine. A developable surface serves as a benchmark example, since its analytical <b>cutting</b> <b>pattern</b> is known. Examples of double-curved geometries show the applicability and benefits of the proposed procedure for real structures...|$|E

40|$|A yukata {{is a type}} of {{traditional}} Japanese kimono. An alignment of its texture pattern is an important factor of the yukata design. There are rules in the texture alignment of the yukata. The rules are comparratively simple. However, the texture alignment is difficult for the designer because the texture alignment should be performed with consideration to the rules and the wearer's taste, Additioanlly, it is necessary for the designer to create the <b>cutting</b> <b>pattern</b> from a limited length of the kimono cloth. Consequently, a design support system for the yukata is required. We have developed the image processing algorithm to simulate the condition of the texture alignment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-stage approach for <b>pattern</b> generation and <b>cutting</b> plan {{determination of the}} one-dimensional cutting stock problem. Calculation {{of the total number}} of patterns that will be cut and generation of the <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> are performed in the first stage. On the other hand, the second stage determines the cutting plan. The proposed approach makes use of two separate integer linear programming models. One of these models is employed by the first stage to generate the <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> through a heuristic procedure with the objective of minimizing trim loss. The <b>cutting</b> <b>patterns</b> obtained from Stage 1 are then fed into the second stage. In this stage, another integer linear programming model is solved to form a cutting plan. The objective of this model is to minimize a generalized total cost function consisting of material inputs, number of setups, labor hours and overdue time; subject to demand requirements, material availability, regular and overtime availability, and due date constraints. The study also demonstrates an implementation of the proposed approach in a coronary stent manufacturer.
