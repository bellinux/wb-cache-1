This is {{the current}} {{spontaneous}} orientation of Soqotran pastoralists as practitioners of the `patching-up' ethic, which privileges a strategy of diversification over intensification.

The cash earned in the modern economic sector is ploughed back into the pastoral domain, which they {{do not intend to}} abandon - while not expecting it to provide more than a subsistence income either.

5000|$|Onyx is a multi-member {{collective}} {{that was}} active in New York City from 1968 through the early 1970s and active intermittently to the present. Its members - Ron Williams, Woody Rainey, Tommy Simpson, Mike Hinge, Bob Buxbaum, Davis Allen, Sheridan Bell and Jack Wells among others—published architectural projects {{in the form of}} offset-printed posters or [...] "broadsheets" [...] that were mailed internationally. The members also went by a number of pseudonyms including Charles Albatross, Okra Plantz, Patrick Redson and Harvey Grapefruit. The poster format allowed the rapid reproduction and easy circulation of their ideas. While the collective distributed their posters through the postal service they also pasted the posters up throughout the streets of the city. There are many connections to the [...] "mail art" [...] phenomenon; the <b>collective</b> <b>claimed</b> affiliation with this artistic practice through the labeling of mailings as MAIL ART and interaction with others practicing this form, including Ant Farm, and Ray Johnson. Characterized by an intricate layering of text and images, the ONYX posters described speculative architectural projects, made allusions to architectural history, explored practices of architectural representation, and commented obscurely on current sociopolitical events.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{excellent}} academic research, {{not only on}} diaspora, but also on postconflict Bosnia and Herzegovina in regards to transitional justice and peacebuilding. However, the factors that play a role vis-à-vis diaspora mobilization and transitional justice have been explored less. Theorizing has been ad hoc. Thus, the guiding question of this thesis is: How do diaspora utilize the political environments in their hostlands when they mobilize towards issues of transitional justice, in what ways and why? I develop a typological theory of diaspora mobilization, focusing on transitional justice claims, to systematize understanding and to develop midrange level explanations. Four types of diaspora mobilization (engaged, involved, reactive, and inactive) are theorized based on three independent variables: citizenship regimes, <b>collective</b> <b>claims,</b> and {{the presence or absence}} of ‘translocalism’ within diaspora communities. In particular, the more open citizenship regimes are, the higher the potential for diaspora mobilization will be. The thesis builds on the idea of translocal communities being an important factor in helping to determine the level of diaspora mobilization, along with the presence of <b>collective</b> <b>claims</b> in relation to transitional justice processes in the post-conflict homeland environment. The study is based on a qualitative research design using a unique two-level comparative lens, focusing on three countries in Europe (Sweden, France, and Germany) as well as four different cities within Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Prijedor, and Srebrenica). The research methods include semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and process tracing with multi-sited fieldwork. Thus, transnational, translocal, host country, and homeland influences are incorporated into analysis. The study provides comparative rigor to research on diaspora mobilization that is particular and rare. It establishes diaspora as an important actor to consider in transitional justice based efforts and provides a new perspective on the idea of translocalism...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{international}} {{responsiveness to}} the rights of victims materialised in 2005 in the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for the Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of international Humanitarian Law (BPGs). Their analysis leads to a nuanced conclusion. On the one hand, the BPGs significantly contribute to strengthening victims' rights, as they adopt a victim-oriented perspective and provide a structured enunciation of their rights. They may inspire the African human rights system and national states in the development of their jurisprudence and policy on remedies. On the other hand, the expert text has been substantially weakened during the intergovernmental consultations. In some aspects, the BPGs even fall short of their intention to uphold international standards. Looking at the instrument through indigenous peoples' eyes unveils some specific deficiencies. Particularly regrettable is the reluctance of states to incorporate provisions concerning collective rights, whereas it is essential for indigenous peoples to be able to file a <b>collective</b> <b>claim</b> and receive reparation collectively. The challenges for the future lie first, in the implementation of the BPGs within national legal systems and second, in a further strengthening of the international norms on victims' rights, preferably by working towards a binding convention on the rights of victims of all human rights violations...|$|R

40|$|This article {{applies the}} global-relational {{conceptual}} frame developed in recent work on urban policy mobilities to heritage, a seemingly local policy area, in Hong Kong. In response to growing public criticism and protests {{in the past}} decade, the Hong Kong government launched a review of its heritage policy and the related institu-tional framework.

The article reviews this exercise, using {{as a case study}} a tertiary education programme that is a key node of heritage policy learning. The article shows that innovation must respond to the territorial specificities of land administration, culture and politics, and thus must be assembled locally—albeit in correspondence with globally circulating models and practices.

40|$|Mainstream structuralist and {{new social}} {{movement}} theoretical approaches to studying social movements in Western sociological traditions fail {{to explain why}} the Sunflower movement fostered solidarity among the Taiwanese while Occupy Central caused public division in Hong Kong. In response, I argue that the successes and failures of both were a function of the consolidation and division of collective identity. Using a qualitative case study, this article analyzes the discursive constructions of collective identity as they intersect with protest spaces, drawing out the events in their protest cycles and identifying the mechanisms within them that constructed and deconstructed collective identity. In doing so, I illustrate three phases of collective identity construction: the creation of <b>collective</b> <b>claims,</b> recruitment strategies, and expressive decision-making. Ultimately, this explicates the movements’ differing outcomes, and how their decline both narrowed and broadened identity in ways that provide a repertoire of ideological narratives usable as recruitment strategies in future mobilizations...|$|E
40|$|Our {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} precariousness as {{experienced in the}} research sector. The article firstly offers a theoretical framework for precariousness, conceptualized as an interweaving and a co-construction of working and existential conditions. We then describe the most salient regulatory aspects of the academic labour market in Italy, in order to contextualize our research findings within the Italian University system. The research was conducted between 2014 and 2015 in two departments situated in the northeast of the country, the first belonging to the STEM field and the second to SSH disciplines. Thirty-two {{interviews were conducted with}} postdoctoral research fellows who, {{at the time of the}} research, worked, or had recently ended their collaboration, within the two departments under study. The section dedicated to the presentation of findings is focused firstly on the issue of invisibility of precarious researchers, declined both in terms of gender differences, and of the different level of recognition of postdocs’ working activities in the STEM compared to the SSH department. Secondly, attention is paid to the status of postdocs, on their complicated positioning between formal and informal work and on their substantial exclusion from social protection. In the concluding section, our contribution put in dialogue the individual experiences analysed within the case study with recent movements developed at the national level by precarious researchers, which focus precisely on a <b>collective</b> <b>claim</b> about the issues of recognition of work and access to welfare...|$|R

30|$|The {{value of}} digital video as a data source and {{research}} tool in educational contexts is widely recognized (see for example Derry et al. 2010). For {{a majority of}} researchers working in classroom contexts, and across {{a wide spectrum of}} theoretical orientations, the use of video and video analysis is a given. The advent of digital video recording, and the development of technologies that allow researchers to quickly and easily capture events on video, and store large volumes of video, has revolutionized the way researchers work. Yet, research articles that directly underscore the value of video approaches in our research context, specifically an examination of students’ communicative resources in science education in culturally and linguistically diverse classrooms, are few-and-far-between. Thus, our goal in the work we present here is to contribute to the research literature that valorizes the use of video analysis in multilingual classroom contexts by drawing across our individual studies to make <b>collective</b> <b>claims</b> about the value of looking beyond the spoken and written to understand students’ meaning-making in science.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this article is to}} review the main {{obstacles}} in competition law enforcement in the European Union and to investigate how the development of collective redress could effectively facilitate enforcement of EU competition law. Arguably, antitrust enforcement remains sub-optimal due to the insufficient deterrent effect of EU antitrust fines and obstacles facing victims of competition law infringements in bringing damages actions. Central to my work, therefore, is the belief that collective actions constitute an attractive vehicle to solve, or at least diminish, the inefficienciesof antitrust enforcement. The paper explores some options as to how to design collective redress mechanisms in order to influence the ability to bring successful <b>collective</b> <b>claims.</b> This would, in turn, consider the advantages of opt-out collective actions in tackling the issues related to low participation rates, lack of funding and sub-optimal deterrence. From this perspective, the article moves on to propose collective actions as a potential remedy to facilitate access to justice, to deal with a wide range of legal and economic issues and to mitigate dysfunctional compensatory mechanism of EU antitrust enforcement...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{attempts to}} scope the multiple and complex relationships between {{measures to protect}} health {{and the protection of}} human rights. The article begins with a discussion of the meaning and current understandings of the notion of ‘public health’, after which it explores how ‘public health’ is framed in various branches of public international law, including international trade law, the law of armed conflict and international environmental law. Subsequently, in light of these developments, it discusses whether the ‘right to health’ {{can be used as a}} <b>collective</b> <b>claim</b> to advance the health of the public, possibly in support of the existing public health clauses under international law. In such cases the protection of public health, and potentially the ‘right to health’, may clash with the interests of international and domestic trade and commerce, intellectual property protection, and the conduct of warfare. Another tension exists where measures to protect the health of the public infringe on the civil and political rights of individuals, including their rights to privacy and freedom of movement, but also their individual right to healthcare. This may occur both within and beyond healthcare settings, for example when it comes to quarantine, (forced) testing, and border restrictions in the interests of public health, but also in the fields of biomedical research and the testing of medicines. The existing limitation clauses under civil and political human rights law provide some guidance as to how such measures should be taken, however there is a need for a better understanding on how to implement these tools...|$|R
