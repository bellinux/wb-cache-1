40|$|This paper {{presents}} a specific kind of failure in ethylene cracking <b>coils</b> <b>coated</b> with anticoking film. It investigates {{a case in}} which the coils made of 35 Cr 45 Ni high temperature alloy failed within two years of operation. The damage occurred due to heavy oxidation in localized regions of the coil resulting in the formation of blisters, which eventually failed by cracking. The mechanism involved was determined by studying the oxidized samples under a scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive system and is attributed to the presence of rare earth metals in the anti-coking film and inherent casting defects in the base alloy. The cerium present in the anti-coking film diffused preferentially to a defect site in the parent alloy thereby resulting in its segregation which further led to embrittlement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|<b>Coil</b> <b>coating</b> is the {{continuous}} and highly automated industrial process for efficiently coating coils of metal.

40|$|ABSTRACT When {{significant}} thoracic vascular anomalies {{occur in}} children, they may present surgical difficulties making operative management undesirable.

Coils of 0. 038 inch packed diameter were fed through the catheter lumen by a flexible guidewire emerging as 3, 5, or 8 mm diameter loose coils. Fifteen of 17 vessels were successfully occluded. No complications or errors in placement of coils occurred. Four of five children clearly benefitted from the procedure. One died in spite of partial occlusion.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the changes in the intraaneurysmal fluid {{pressure}} and parent vessel flow characteristics resulting from packing the aneurysmal sac with hydrogel-coated coils. METHODS: Platinum <b>coils</b> <b>coated</b> with an expansible hydrogel were used to embolize a silicone model of the basilar tip aneurysm. The intraaneurysmal fluid pressure was measured with a NeuroCare Camino Pressure Micro-Probe at various packing ratios.

RESULTS: The intraaneurysmal fluid pressure did not increase when packing the aneurysm with hydrogel-coated platinum coils, even with a coil density up to 93 %. CONCLUSION: Packing the aneurysm with hydrogel-coated coils at a density up to 93 % did not increase the intraaneurysmal fluid pressure.

40|$|With the Strip Hollow Cathode (SHC) {{process a}} new plasma-assisted {{chemical}} vapor deposition (PACVD) process was introduced, which was shown {{to meet the requirements}} of dynamic steel strip coating with plasma polymer films from several monomers, utilizing the hollow cathode effect. The operating pressure is in the upper fine vacuum range; the SHC process therefore does not require an extensive vacuum environment.

50|$|The {{treatment}} uses detachable coils made of platinum {{that are}} {{inserted into the}} aneurysm using the microcatheter.

Success is determined by injecting a contrast dye into parent artery and qualitatively determining if dye is flowing into the aneurysm space during fluoroscopy. If no flow is observed, the procedure is considered completed. In the case of wide-necked aneurysms a stent may be used.|$|R

The immediate post-procedure angiographic control demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion in 21 cases (72. 4 %), near-complete occlusion in seven cases (24. 1 %), whereas in one case (3. 4 %) there was a procedure failure with major perfusion of the sac. Five patients (17. 2 %) experienced thromboembolic complications, including an asymptomatic lacunar stroke of the head of the caudate nucleus, a thalamic infarct following hypotension secondary to pulmonary edema, temporal ischemia secondary to vasospasm and a small right occipital ischemic lesion.
