40|$|The {{debate on}} EMU {{has been very}} {{influenced}} by the traditional theory of optimum <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> (OCAs). The paper shows that this theory is not an ideal yardstick for an assessment of EMU. Its assumptions are not very realistic and its focus on asymmetric real shocks is much too narrow. In addition, observed past real exchange rate changes are not a good predictor of future real shocks in the European Union (EU). In general, the OCA approach is heavily biased towards very small <b>currency</b> <b>areas.</b> Because of these shortcomings the paper develops a monetary approach {{to the theory of}} OCAs. In this concept the choice between a monetary union and independent national <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> is analysed from the perspective of monetary policy efficiency. It can be shown that EMU is superior to national <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> in terms of credibility, the response to asymmetric monetary shocks and the effectiveness of monetary targets and instruments.

40|$|The paper surveys {{old and new}} {{theories}} of optimum <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> by following a unifying "logical" rather than "chronological" approach. The fall of credibility theory as the "new" theory of optimum <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> obliged {{to go back to}} the "old" criteria while focusing, however, also on supply shocks. Moreover, the conclusions reached by the theory of self-fulfilling speculative attacks stress the difference between irrevocably fixed exchange rates and monetary union. As a consequence, I suggest referring to the theory of optimum monetary rather than <b>currency</b> <b>areas.</b> Finally, the difficulty of these criteria to explain the desire of peripheral countries to adhere to a monetary union (as in the case of the EMU), obliges to abandon the static framework. By considering a dynamic approach, it is also possible to interpret political reasons, often deemed to be crucial and considered separately from the economic ones, as referring to the economic, long term, benefits resulting from monetary unification.

500|$|In economics, an optimum <b>currency</b> <b>area,</b> {{or region}} (OCA or OCR), is a {{geographical}} region {{in which it}} would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by Robert Mundell: the stationary expectations model and the international risk sharing model. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro. However, even before {{the creation of the}} single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the late-2000s recession the chances of a state leaving the euro, or the chances that the whole zone would collapse, were considered extremely slim. However the Greek government-debt crisis led to former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on the effectiveness of}} movements in nominal exchange rates in smoothing cyclical imbalances between countries, as explained by the literature on optimal <b>currency</b> <b>areas.</b> We use restrictions from the Mundell-Flemming model (on which the theory of optimal <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> is based) to identify VAR systems that explain the exchange rate movements and the relative output movements of potential members of a European Monetary Union (EMU). We find that the shocks that cause most of the variation in relative output do not seem to result in movements in nominal exchange rates. Moreover, the shocks that explain movements in nominal exchange rates are monetary in nature, rather than real. Such results make it hard to argue that the loss of exchange rate flexibility accompanying EMU would come at a significant cost to macroeconomic stability.
