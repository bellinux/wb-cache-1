5000|$|Three {{weeks before}} the 2016 United States presidential election, Ferguson said in an {{interview}} that it [...] "was over for Donald Trump"; that [...] "Trump had flamed out in all three Presidential debates"; that, [...] "I don't think there can be any last minute surprise to rescue him Trump"; that there was no hope of Donald Trump winning Independent voters and that Trump was [...] "gone as a candidate", adding that [...] "it seems to me clear that she <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be the first female President of the United States. The only question is how bad does his Trump's flaming out affect candidates for the Senate, candidates for the House, further down on the ballot." [...] Trump was elected president and the Republican Party, while losing seats, retained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2012 Morris {{claimed that}} Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to vote for}} Mitt Romney, but that he would still speak in favor of Obama because [...] "his wife is hostage." ...|$|R
50|$|In June and July 1992, {{speculation}} grew {{about who}} <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to pick {{as his running}} mate. Possible candidates included Kerrey, Indiana congressman Lee Hamilton, Missouri congressman Dick Gephardt, Tennessee Senator Al Gore, New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, Florida Senator Bob Graham and Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford. On July 9, 1992, Clinton selected Gore {{as his running mate}} in the State Mansion at Little Rock.|$|R
5000|$|Following the result, after rumors {{fueled by}} a {{misunderstanding}} of an Associated Press report, the campaign dismissed suggestions that <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to concede in the speech following the primaries. In her speech after {{the closing of the}} Montana polls, Clinton said [...] "I will be making no decisions tonight." [...] She invited Americans to write to her on her website to provide input into what her next steps should be.|$|R
500|$|On February 16, 1999, the First Lady's office {{announced}} that she was considering running for the Senate position. [...] Once it <b>was</b> clear <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to run, Lowey stepped aside, although she would be disappointed at the lost opportunity. [...] On July 7, 1999, Clinton formally announced an exploratory committee for the Senate run; the setting was Moynihan's farm in Pindars Corners, in rural Delaware County. Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> less than enthusiastic about her candidacy. The staging of the event was brokered by the Clintons' political consultant Mandy Grunwald. [...] Hillary Clinton embarked upon a [...] "listening tour" [...] of all parts of New York after her entrance into the race. [...] She planned to visit all 62 counties in New York, talking to New Yorkers in small-group settings according {{to the principles of}} retail politics. During the race, she spent considerable time campaigning in traditionally Republican upstate regions. Clinton faced charges of carpetbagging, since she had never resided in the State of New York nor directly participated in state politics prior to her Senate race.|$|R

2500|$|Donald Trump won the election. FiveThirtyEight {{projected}} a {{much higher}} probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other pollsters, a projection which was criticized by Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post as [...] "unskewing" [...] too {{much in favor of}} Trump. And while FiveThirtyEight expressed that [...] "nonetheless, <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> probably <b>going</b> to win, and she could win by a big margin", the forecaster also made a point about the unreliability of poll trackers in some cases, about a considerable number of undecided voters and about the unpredictable outcome in traditional swing states.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the film}} premiered on MTV on August 7, 1999, an {{additional}} deleted scene followed the airing: while visiting the National Archives, Beavis attempts {{to use the}} restroom, but cannot {{because of the lack}} of toilet paper in the stall. Coincidentally, Butt-head is angry because the urinals lack the automatic flushing mechanisms that had amazed him at Yellowstone National Park. After the rest of their tour group finishes looking at the encased Declaration of Independence, Beavis sneaks out, breaks the glass with the U.S. flag pole, and steals it to use as [...] "T.P. for his bunghole." [...] While Archive guards rush to see what happened, Beavis cleans up, and exits the stall with a piece of the Declaration, containing John Hancock's signature, stuck to his shoe. The scene does not appear on the DVD, although it is mentioned on the disc's commentary track. In the track, Judge noted that the scene did not test well. Another alternate scene was done for when Butt-Head meets Chelsea Clinton in her bedroom, which showed her packing up to leave the White House. This alternate scene was created in the event Bill Clinton lost his 1996 re-election bid to Bob Dole. However, by the spring of 1996, Judge ultimately decided to keep the original scene because he felt that it was looking as if <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to win his bid for re-election.|$|R
5000|$|In {{planning}} {{to make her}} speech, the 47-year-old Clinton defied both internal administration pressure and external Chinese pressure to soften her remarks. [...] The U.S. State Department and the National Security Agency both tried to dissuade her {{on the grounds that}} it would irritate the Chinese. While President Bill Clinton had seen the speech in advance, his aides had not, and White House Chief of Staff Thomas McLarty was under the impression that it would not say anything new or controversial. Some human rights campaigners also objected to Clinton speaking in China, fearing it would legitimize that government, and a State Department condition was that Chinese human rights activist Harry Wu be released before she would appear, which he was. Some vocal Catholic groups criticized the gathering as [...] "anti-family" [...] while some ideological conservatives said that <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> clearly <b>going</b> to push a [...] "radical feminist agenda" [...] while there.|$|R

5000|$|In {{an early}} 1996 {{interview}} with a Dallas Morning News Irving, Texas reporter, Alexander explains his inspiration: [...] I was {{with a group of}} kids and we said that if there was ever a president from Arkansas, we'd do a portrait of him. It was just a joke at the time, and years later, I had forgotten about it. But one day, when <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> doing well in the presidential race and it looked like he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to win, the memory just popped back in my mind. It was eerie, but inspirations are like that.|$|R

While <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> hurt by these issues, the damage seemed to bottom out several weeks before the New Hampshire primary. While Tsongas was the actual winner in terms of votes received and delegates won, Clinton advisor James Carville tagged Clinton with the label [...] "the Comeback Kid" [...] and claimed that Clinton's campaign was back on track. While ostensibly the front-runner, Tsongas was already considered by many to <b>be</b> behind <b>Clinton</b> after just one primary.|$|R
