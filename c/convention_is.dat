5000|$|<b>Conventions</b> <b>are</b> {{often thought}} of as [...] "unwritten" [...] but {{sometimes}} <b>conventions</b> <b>are</b> recorded in writing e.g. the Cabinet Manual, the Ministerial Code.

5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many times}} it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual <b>convention</b> <b>is</b> to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This <b>convention</b> <b>is</b> not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E

Originating in California, United States, during the mid-1980s, there are now over 40 annual furry conventions worldwide, mostly in North America and Europe. The largest furry <b>convention</b> <b>is</b> Anthrocon which is held each year in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, {{in the sense that the}} <b>convention</b> <b>is</b> established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades in the Holy Land are {{traditionally}} counted as nine distinct campaigns, numbered from the First Crusade of 1095–99 to the Ninth Crusade of 1271–72.

The Fifth and Sixth Crusades led by FrederickII may be considered a single campaign, as can the Eighth Crusade and Ninth Crusade led by LouisIX.|$|E

5|$|While it {{has become}} {{normative}} to record {{the death of the}} Queen as occurring in 1603, following English calendar reform in the 1750s, at the time England observed New Year's Day on 25 March, commonly known as Lady Day. Thus Elizabeth died {{on the last day of}} the year 1602 in the old calendar.

5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative <b>convention</b> <b>is</b> widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E
5|$|Protestantism is {{the largest}} Christian {{religious}} grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist <b>Convention</b> <b>is</b> the largest individual Protestant denomination. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas and, in part, in the English Catholic Proprietary of Maryland, It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has {{the highest percentage of}} Catholics with 40 percent of the total population. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion {{of the majority of the}} population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.|$|E
