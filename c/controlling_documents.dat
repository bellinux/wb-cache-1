40|$|The ISO {{standard}} ISO/IEC 17799 /SS- 627799 - 2 is a {{guidance for}} organizations {{to realize their}} information security goals. In spite of this standard, studies show flaws regarding information security in organizations. In particular flaws regarding overall view, knowledge and clear roles and responsibilities have been observed. The ISIT (Information Security Integrated Three level) model and its guidelines, developed in this thesis, help organizations to identify the required processes and procedures {{as well as the}} logical process flow. The thesis is based on theoretical studies and a case study within a multinational company. The results of the case study show great lacks in defining roles and assigning responsibilities, but also in overall view and knowledge regarding processes and the process flow. The thesis develops a model to facilitate an organization’s initiation of the ISO standard and to help solving the identified flaws. The ISIT model is based on the ISO standard, but expands the PDCA model and integrates it with the <b>controlling</b> <b>documents</b> related to information security management. The expansion of the PDCA model gives a clearer flow, where all the processes related to a management system are included. This enables clarity and faster overall view regarding the information security organization. The integration of the <b>controlling</b> <b>documents</b> means that the processes can be divided into procedures at different levels of the organization. This provides a possible solution to the definition of roles and to the assignment of responsibilities. Guidelines on the identification of processes and roles can not be found in the ISO standard. Therefor the ISIT model should be used as a complement to the ISO standard and will help organizations to reach their information security goals...|$|E

The gas flow was halted and the well was stabilized at 10 : 22 hours on the 29 th of November 2004. On the 29 th of November 2004, the PSA appointed an investigation group which has identified non-conformities and improvement areas. These can be categorized as follows: • Lack of compliance with governing / <b>controlling</b> <b>documents</b> • Inadequate understanding and implementation of risk assessments • Inadequate management involvement and violation of well barrier requirements Many of the non-conformities identified are in resemblance with results from a Smarter together research project.

40|$|During {{the past}} six months since the Second Helios Joint Working Group Meeting held 27 - 30 April 1970 at Goddard Space Flight Center, the TDS Sub-Group {{supported}} the Helios Project Office and the other Sub-Groups in the timely disposition of action items and the dissemination of information pertinent to the development of interface documentation. Of particular importance during this time period was the Project's decision to incorporate a single-channel telemetry system design aboard the spacecraft. The TDS Sub-Group participated actively in the process that led to this decision. Still under active study with TDS participation is the pending Project Office decision regarding the incorporation of a ranging capability within the telecommunications design. The TDS Sub-Group assisted the Mission Analysis and Operations Sub-Group in establishment of a study effort concerning the Near-Earth Sequence of Events from launch to launch plus 8 hours. This study, which will provide valuable data for the spacecraft telecommunications design, will include participation by the Experiment, Launch Vehicle, Spacecraft, as well as the TDS and MA&O Sub-Groups. Also during the past 6 -month period, the TDS, in conjunction with the Spacecraft Sub-Group, initiated activity to develop the Helios Spacecraft/TDS Compatibility Test Plans and Procedures. Activity concerning the foregoing interface discussions has been {{and will continue to be}} based upon the "TDS Estimated Capabilities Document for the Helios Missions" (613 - 1), and the "DSN/Flight Project Interface Design Handbook" (810 - 5). These will continue to be considered TDS <b>controlling</b> <b>documents</b> until specific Helios Project/TDS interface documentation is generated and signed off by the respective parties.

40|$|Whether {{large or}} small, {{companies}} can take certain {{steps to ensure}} reliable shot peening specifications for the gears they process. Learn how in this first of a two-part article. I By Mark Lawerenz, lmants Ekis S hot peening is widely recognized as proven, cost-effective process to enhance the fatigue characteristics of metal parts and eliminate the problems of stress-corrosion cracking. Forming and texturizing are added benefits. Though shot peening is widely used today, the means of specifying process parameters and <b>controlling</b> <b>documents</b> for process control are not widely understood. Many design and materials engineers continue {{to ask questions about}} shot size, intensity and blueprint specification to assure a high quality and repeatable shot peening process. Many existing internal company specifications are adequate, but many are not because they have not been updated to coincide with the improvements in shot peening technology over the past years. Companies considering creation of an in-house specification for gears or interested in revising an existing specification should consult a knowledgeable shot peening authority. Forsmallercompanies and those that lessfrequently specify theshot peening process, good specifications that {{can be used as a}} refer-ence are readily available. Two of these are Military Standard MILS- 131 65 - 8 and AMS 2430. Shot peening is an effective tool for combating fatigue and stress-corrosion cracking, as well as assisting in forming and shape correction. By definition, shot peening is the bombardment of the surface of a material by small spherical media (the shot) to produce a thin layer of high magnitude residual (or self) compressive stress. This residual or self stress is introduced into a material prior to any actual applications of loads to a component. The magnitude and depth of these compressive stresses are predictable. As shown in Figure 1, 5 the maximum compressive stress usually occurs at some distance below the peened surface, which is represented by the top horizontal line...|$|E

40|$|Human {{activity}} generates {{waste water}} {{that must be}} treated {{before returning to the}} receiving environment. WWTP are designed and operated to remove contaminants present in the wastewater so that the impact on the receiving environment is permitted; however, WWTPs, like any industrial activity or production process also generate some environmental impacts. There is the need to minimize these impacts both existing plants and possible extensions of plants with new technologies for purification stricter limits. The life cycle analysis is a widely accepted method of evaluation and interpretation of the environmental impacts of a process or product. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Manlleu WWTP through life cycle analysis (LCA), which is a methodology that takes into account the use of materials, energy and discharges into the environment during the construction stages, transportation, operation and dismantling. The life cycle stages considered in the study were the construction and operation of the WWTP. The environmental impact during the operation phase of a WWTP is due to energy consumption, use of chemicals, emissions to air and water and sludge production. Also taken into account the use of materials for the construction of the plant and has been ruled out include the dismantling process. For the construction phase, we have analyzed the consumption of building materials from the budgets of the civil works and the operation phase inputs (energy, chemicals [...] .) and outputs (water, sludge, emissions [...] . to the atmosphere) system. The functional unit chosen for the study was the volume of treated water for 20 years. Inventory data during the operation phase are taken from different operation <b>controlling</b> <b>documents</b> of the WWTP 2014. Finally, it was considered that the WWTP has a lifespan of 20 years. For evaluation of the inventory life cycle analysis it was used SimaPro® software and the impact categories analyzed were: Climate Change, Ozone Depletion, Eutrophication Freshwater, Marine Eutrophication, Human Toxicity, Metal Depletion and Fossil Depletion. The results obtained from the inventory show that the operational phase of the plant has more impact than the construction phase in almost all categories studied. The separate analysis of each stage of the plant indicates that the secondary treatment and pre-treatment are those with a greater impact due to increased consumption of chemicals and high energy consumption. This study shows that to achieve a lower impact on the water purification process more efficient technologies, opt for chemicals with low environmental impact and reduce the environmental burden of energy consumption in the process need to appl...|$|E
