5000|$|SmartKeys was {{developed}} by Siemens in the mid-1990s and introduced by Mercedes-Benz in 1997 to replace the infrared security system introduced in 1989. Daimler-Benz filed the first patents for SmartKey on February 28, 1997 in German patent offices, with multifunction switchblade key variants following on May 17, 1997. The device entailed a plastic key {{to be used in}} place of the traditional metal key. Electronics that <b>control</b> <b>locking</b> systems and the ignitions made it possible to replace the traditional key with a sophisticated computerized [...] "Key". It is considered a step up from remote keyless entry. The SmartKey adopts the remote control buttons from keyless entry, and incorporates them into the SmartKey fob.|$|E
5000|$|The NWZ-S543/B Walkman has a {{considerably}} larger screen than its predecessors. It has a 2" [...] or a 2.4" [...] QVGA LCD display. A slightly bigger chassis allows two speakers to be accommodated at {{either side of}} the screen. It measures 44 mm by 97 mm by 8 mm and because of the dimensions it is a little unfriendly for the pocket. Below the screen, Sony has built its trademark circular control pad which has a standard four-way directional button surrounding a central play/pause key. This is flanked by two additional buttons, back (home) and option (power). The NWZ-S543/B Walkman is made mostly of plastic but has a shiny metallic topcoat, which gives it a sleek look. At the sides are buttons for the volume <b>control,</b> <b>locking</b> the controls and toggling between headphones and speakers. The headphone jack and the USB port are located at the bottom most side. Starting with the 3rd generation models (S630/S730), all S Series players had the so-called [...] "Mickey Mouse" [...] look, because of the specific positioning of the main buttons.|$|E

40|$|The {{communication}} latency {{presents a}} major challenge to achieving high responsiveness for Internet-based cooperative editing systems. In this paper, we propose conflict <b>control</b> <b>locking</b> (post-locking) schemes for conflict resolution in real-time object-based cooperative graphics editors. With these schemes, no locking request is needed before applying an editing operation to an object, instead, a lock will automatically be generated by the system ifa conflict occurs. Lock ownership assigning rules ure devised for the schemes. With a spec$c post-locking approach, algorithms and implementation techniques, such as, lock synchronisation detection, voting, and group intention realisation, are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|A {{safe and}} {{deadlock}} free lock policy is introduced, called pre-analysis locking. Pre-analysis locking {{is based on}} an efficient geometric algorithm which inserts lock and unlock operations into the transactions. Pre-analysis locking is the first safe and deadlock free general locking policy which is not a variant of two-phase locking. It is an approach con-ceptually different from policies following the two-phase locking principle. In general, none of pre-analysis lock-ing and two-phase locking dominates the other: there exist cases in which pre-analysis locking allows for more concur-rency than any two-phase locking policy, but there are also cases in which a two-phase locking policy allows for more concurrency than pre-analysis locking.

40|$|Now a day, {{in company}} there is need of {{privilege}} level access[2] and concurrency control[1]. It plays {{very important role}} for an any organization. The concept of privilege level access is mainly used for providing the permission to an employees of the organization. So, by using this concept it can be cleared that which user of the company is having which kind of permission to perform certain operation on the confidential data of the company. The second term is the concurrency control which provide accurate data at the receiver site. Concurrency control[1] doesn't allow multiple accessing of the confidential data of the company. It doesn't allow to perform multiple operation (i. e. read or write or delete) on a single file simultaneously.

40|$|Much {{work has}} been done in the last decade in the related areas of {{object-oriented}} programming languages and object-oriented databases. Researchers from both areas now seem to be working toward a common end, that of an object management system, or OMS. An OMS is constructed similarly to an OODB but provides a general purpose concurrent object-oriented programming language as well, complementing the OODB query facilities. In this paper, we will define several different types of object systems (object servers, persistent OOPL's, OODB's and OMS's) in terms of their interfaces and capabilities from the viewpoint of how these support the requirements of cooperative information systems. We will examine the distinguishing features and general architecture of systems of each type in the light of a general model of OMS architecture. Copyright 1992 Steven S. Popovich and Gail E.

40|$|For a {{data sharing}} {{database}} system, substantial coordination cost is incurred {{to cope with}} the global (distributed) locking needed by these systems. Lock covering is a way to permit component systems to perform private (local) locking. Two forms of covering locks are discussed, together with intention locks, needed to prevent covering violations. Intention locks give permission for lower level locking to be used, but require that this locking be global. The protocol between local lock manager and its principals is defined to permit information needed for local locking to be conveyed. Principals are notified when lock demotion may change local locks to global ones. New lock modes are defined that provide exclusion without being covering locks. These locks facilitate database cache management and private logical locking, permitting exclusion with high concurrency, and providing improved concurrency vs overhead trade-offs.

TIMESTAMP-BASED ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO PROTECT DISTRIBUTED DATABASE FROM INCONSISTENCIES DURING CONCURRENT ACCESS. IN SUCH ALGORITHMS, TRANSACTIONS MAY REACH A PARTICULAR SITE OUT OF THE ORDEROF THEIR TIMESTAMPS, DUE TO UNEXPECTED NETWORK DELAYS. THIS CAUSES CONFLICTS WHICH THE DISTRIBUTED CONCURRENCY CONTROL MECHANISM HAS TO COPE WITH. WE EXHIBIT AN ANALYTICAL SOLUTION, WHICH HAS BEEN TESTED WITH EXTENSIVE SIMULATION. THE ACCURACY SEEMS TO BE VERY HIGH. WE ASSUME PERFECT AND ALSO IMPERFECT CLOCKS FOR SYNCHRONIZATION AND QUANTIFY THE WAY IN WHICH LOCAL CLOCK INACCURACIES AFFECT THE PHENOMENON OF TRANSACTION CONFLICTS.

40|$|DE 10164644 C UPAB: 20030630 NOVELTY - Signal {{amplitude}} modulation occurring between data and clock signal (lambda Data, lambda CR) {{in the data}} signal (lambda Data), is selected as a criterion for the unsynchronized mode in which the data frequency (fData) is not equal to clock frequency (fCR). The modulation frequency (fMod) is optically detected and electronically evaluated. This represents the difference frequency between the data- and clock frequencies (fData, fCR) with fMod = fData - fCR. As a control signal (S) to achieve of the synchronized mode characterized by satisfaction of the condition fMod = 0, the clock frequency fCR is varied as necessary. ADVANTAGE - The method for monitoring {{and control of the}} synchronization function in a pulse source, provides for purely optical clock recovery. No costly high frequency electronics are used. This is remains true at very high frequencies in ultra-fast optical telecommunications networks, where it is no longer feasible to use high frequency electronics to <b>control</b> <b>locking.</b> The method is simple and relatively insensitive to interference...|$|E
