5000|$|After the TCMP audits, the IRS {{focused on}} {{two groups of}} taxpayers: those with just a small change in the balance due, and those with a large (over $400) change in the balance due. Taxpayers were further {{partitioned}} into [...] "nonbusiness" [...] and [...] "business" [...] groups and each group was divided into five classes based on total positive income. Using line items from the auditor's <b>checksheet,</b> discriminant analysis, and a scoring mechanism, each return was awarded a score, known as a [...] "Z-score". Higher Z-scores were associated by IRS personnel with {{a higher risk of}} tax evasion. However, the Discriminant Index Function (DIF) system did not provide examiners with specific problematic variables or reasons for the high score and so each filing had to be manually examined by an auditor.|$|E

40|$|A risk {{assessment}} {{model has been}} developed {{in the form of}} a <b>checksheet</b> using a risk ranking system to assess the fire risk of buildings in terms of life safety. This involves a simple points system which assigns scores to various hazard and protection features of a building. These scores are then manipulated using addition and multiplication to arrive at an overall risk score for the building. The final value which represents the risk of the building is obtained using the definition of risk where risk is equal to the product of the likelihood of a fire occurring and its consequences. The proposed model which focuses on risk in terms of life safety can be extended to include property protection, environmental impact and social impact. It was found that the influences that human behaviour has on the fire risk within a building are significant and very difficult to quantify...|$|E

40|$|Two cruise-based nature-oriented tour operations, CruiseWest, {{operating}} {{along the}} Inside Passage of Alaska, and Lindblad Special Expeditions, {{operating in the}} Galapagos Islands, provided {{the data for this}} case study of nature-based guiding associated with the cruise industry. Both companies are leaders in the nature-based tourism industry, both offer upmarket weeklong cruise-based tours guided by both on-board expedition leaders and shore-based guides, and both operate relatively small ship-based ecotourism experiences to destinations known to be popular with tourists who want to view close-up and interact with wildlife. One-week excursions with each of the companies, in June 2000 (Alaska) and September 2000 (Galapagos), provided the case study material for the research. Using methods that were piloted as part of a previous research project, guides were systematically observed with the assistance of a standardised observation <b>checksheet,</b> and passengers completed a self-completed questionnaire {{on the final day of}} their one-week tour. In the end, data were collected on 12 guides (shore-based excursions) and 2 expedition leaders. Questionnaires were completed by 55 of the 68 adult passengers on-board the Spirit of Alaska (CruiseWest), and 21 of the 26 adult passengers on-board the Polaris (Lindblad).

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. The problem of classifying vegetation is discussed in relation to three general objectives: (1) inventorying existing vegetation types for conservation purposes, (2) providing a framework for biological field studies and local management, and (3) understanding plant and community distribution and dynamics in relation to the environment. It is shown that the map scale which is used imposes a set of constraints on the method of classification. Several different map scales are discussed in terms of these limitations. A number of well known structural and floristic classifying schemes are reviewed including a new scheme of world ecosystems. The IBP/CT (Conservation of Terrestrial Ecosystems) <b>checksheet</b> survey is evaluated in the light of these methods. The conclusion is made that Fosberg's structural scheme, which was adopted for the check-sheet survey, provided only a first approximation to the ultimate objective of inventorying existing vegetation types for conservation purposes. A recommendation for a next step is made, which involves a scheme of hierarchical mapping of world ecosystems. It is anticipated that this activity will be carried out under the UNESCO Man-and-the-Biosphere (MAB) Project No. 8 (Conservation of Natural Areas and of the Genetic Materials they contain) ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate one aspect of audiovisuals in the lives of young children. The central question addressed in this study was: How do audiovisuals compare to the story hour approach in encouraging young children's interest in books? This question was broken down into the following sub-questions. (1) Does the presentation of a book produced either as a slidetape program, or a television program, or in a story hour, affect the interest of three- and four-year-old children in total books available to them within the research setting, as measured by their spontaneously taking books from their shelves and looking at them or requesting that they be read to them? (2) Does the presentation of a book produced as a slide-tape program, television program, or in a story hour, affect the interest of three- and four-year-old children in the specific book produced and presented, as measured by the criterion given in number " 1 " above? (3) Does the presentation of a book produced as a slide-tape program, television program, or in a story hour, affect the interest of three- and four-year-old children in books other than the specific book produced and presented?Using an experimental design, the three treatments, slide-tape, television (videotape), and story hour were randomly assigned to three groups of three- and four-year-old children enrolled in the Early Childhood Research Laboratory at Northern Illinois University, Department of Curriculum and Instruction, College of Education. A fourth group was used as a control and received no treatment. Each group was comprised of ten children. A time sampling checklist was designed on which was recorded the children's use of books. Book use was divided into three categories: use of the presented book, use of other books, and the combined use of total available books. Data were gathered for the study over an eight-month period. Data were collected two days per week, 25 minutes per day over a four-week period for each group. For the three experimental groups, the treatment intervened between the second and third day of data recording. The study was approved as "not at risk" to the children by the review committee for use of human subjects in research. The raw data on the <b>checksheets</b> were converted to means of book usage for each group for each day. Mean book usage was computed in three categories, use of total books available in the research setting, use of the book used in the three treatments, use of books other than the treatment book. The means of the four groups were compared using an analysis of variance. Significance of these analyses was established at the. 05 level at minimum. Means were compared for the four groups for the two pretests and for each of the six posttests, and of the sum of the posttests. The findings of the study indicated there were no significant differences in the means of the sums of the posttests of the three experimental groups in any of the three categories of book use: (1) total books available, (2) the presented book, or (3) other books. The research findings of this study do not warrant the rejection of any of the null hypotheses. The conclusion is: there is no significant difference in the interest of three- and four-year-old children in books whether or not they are presented with a story hour, television or slide-tape production. No treatment had a significant effect...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 This study {{involved}} {{the development and}} implementation of a model for providing structured on-the-job training (SOJT) in a healthcare foodservice operation. The model was developed to provide a structured method for conducting SOJT Events, the process when an incumbent employee trainer teaches another employee to perform his/her job. The model was composed of four components, each serving to support the Event. An SOJT Event Process established a series of steps to follow when conducting SOJT. A Training Manual and Training <b>Checksheet</b> were Support Documents used to assure the consistency of each Event and to document standard procedures. Trainers were prepared to conduct Events during the Trainer Preparation Workshop. Finally, the last component was the SOJT Event Performance Support System, a set of guidelines devised to create the support network necessary for Events to be carried out in the work setting. The model was implemented as each Trainer was scheduled to conduct two SOJT Events over a three month period. It was tested by measuring Trainee knowledge, performance and assessment of the SOJT Events. Other employees, who had been trained with unstructured training in the past served as control groups. Subjective observations of the applicability and acceptability of the model among employees were also noted. The model was successful in producing knowledge gains among Trainees. Trainees who were recipients of SOJT assigned higher assessment scores to SOJT than control group employees assigned to unstructured on-the job training. There was no difference in performance among employees trained using structured or unstructured on-the-job training. Employees that were directly involved in the SOJT Events were positive about supporting the model. Modifications for the model and the components are suggested. It was concluded that the model components that were developed and the use of a consultant with experience in training and instructional design are necessary for implementation of structured on-the-job training in foodservice operations...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if a personality type or personality type characteristic that-was statistically different from the general population could be found for high school dropouts who perceived school dissatisfaction as the reason for dropping out of school. Data were collected from each gender group and analyzed by gender group. Dropouts registering to take the general equivalency test through one of three cooperating programs in Clark County, Ohio, were contacted to participate in the study. Individuals were determined to have dropped out of school because of perceived school dissatisfaction by means of their responses on a <b>checksheet</b> of reasons for dropping out of school. The list was culled from the review of literature. Dropouts Identified as "dissatisfied" were then given the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Form G. A total of 262 dropouts were contacted before the sample size of fifty males and fifty females was reached. Four null hypotheses were generated for the study. Analysis of data using a binomial distribution resulted in a refection of the four hypotheses at a. 01 level of significance. Results of the analysis demonstrated the Introvert-Sensing-Thinking-Perceiving (ISTP) personality type for males and the Introvert-Sensing-Feeling-Perceiving (ISFP) personality type for females from the sample were statistically different from the general population. The Sensing (S) personality type characteristic for both gender groups in the sample was statistically different from the general population. Major conclusions were: 1) Males with an ISTP personality type and who are dissatisfied with school have a greater possibility of dropping out of school than males with other personality types; 2) Females with an ISFP personality type and who are dissatisfied with school have a greater possibility of dropping out of school than females with other personality types; and 3) Males and females determined to have the Sensing (S) personality type characteristic and who are dissatisfied with school are at a greater risk of dropping out of school than others displaying the Intuition CI) characteristic.

40|$|Basic writers {{often require}} {{different}} courses than traditional Freshman Composition 1 students {{to succeed in}} college. Ball State University's basic writing program offers a two-semester sequence that provides students with additional time and attention, thereby addressing these students' special needs. The program encourages students {{to see themselves as}} academic writers and as part of the academic community. This study examined the degree of presence of academic voice in students' writing as measured at four intervals during the program's initial year. A 2 x 4 analysis of variance measured change in academic voice for female and male students, using the Academic Voice <b>Checksheet.</b> In addition, students' levels of confidence was measured using the Daly-Miller Writing Apprehension Test (W. A. T.) and correlated to the presence of academic voice using the Pearson product-moment correlation. Findings are presented in an analysis of the study group as a whole and in an analysis of six individual students' work. Those students' profiles were examined for overall academic voice, discrete features of academic voice, the W. A. T. overall scores, and specific questions dealing with student confidence. The analysis revealed that a change in the degree of presence of academic voice occured during the two-semester sequence. However, male and female students were seen to have the same basic profile, thereby suggesting no difference according to sex of student, challenging current gender theory. A comparison of the initial measurement and the final measurement indicated a positive change in a majority of academic voice scores. A correlation between the academic voice score and a decrease in students' writing apprehension was found in the final measurements. Five percent of students' W. A. T. score may be explained by the academic voice measurement. In the study group, 65 percent of the students showed a decrease in W. A. T. scores between the two measurements, indicating a positive lessening of writing apprehension. This study suggests that the basic writing sequence at Ball State University is providing an environment that facilitates students' use of academic voice and lessens their writing apprehension. Both factors enhance students' opportunities for academic success. Department of EnglishThesis (Ph. D. ...|$|E
