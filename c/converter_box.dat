To help U.S. consumers through the conversion, Congress established a federally sponsored DTV <b>Converter</b> <b>Box</b> Coupon Program for two free converters per household.|$|E
25|$|Research In Motion Limited {{was founded}} in March 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin. At the time, Lazaridis was an {{engineering}} student at the University of Waterloo while Fregin was an engineering student at the University of Windsor. In 1988, RIM became the first wireless data technology developer in North America and the first company outside Scandinavia to develop connectivity products for Mobitex wireless packet-switched data communications networks. In 1990, RIM introduced the DigiSync Film KeyKode Reader. In 1991, RIM introduced the first Mobitex protocol converter. In 1992, RIM introduced the first Mobitex point-of-sale solution, a protocol <b>converter</b> <b>box</b> that interfaced with existing point-of-sale terminal equipment to enable wireless communication. In 1993, RIM introduced the RIMGate, the first general purpose Mobitex X.25 gateway. In the same year, RIM launched Ericsson Mobidem AT and Intel wireless modem containing RIM modem firmware. In 1994, RIM introduced the first Mobitex mobile point-of-sale terminal. In the same year, RIM received the Emmy Award for Technical Innovation and the KPMG High Technology Award. In 1995, RIM introduced Freedom, the first Type II PCMCIA radio modem for Mobitex.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP to HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to plug into the PSP GO's port. Instead of component RCA plugs, the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a D-sub 9 cable that screws into the <b>converter</b> <b>box,</b> which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user to toggle between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without any need to use the television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|E
2500|$|HBO {{subscribers}} generally pay for {{an extra}} tier of service that includes other cable- and satellite-exclusive channels even before paying for the channel itself (though HBO often prices all of its channels together in a single package). However, a law imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires that cable providers allow subscribers to get just [...] "limited" [...] basic cable (a base programming tier that includes local, and in some areas, out-of-market broadcast stations and public, educational, and government access channels) and premium services such as HBO, without subscribing to expanded service (Comcast is the only major provider to have purposefully offered the network {{in such a manner}} utilizing this law, as it offered a bundled cable/Internet package that included limited basic service and HBO from October 2013 to July 2014, or January of the latter year in some markets). Cable providers can require the use of a <b>converter</b> <b>box</b> – usually digital – in order to receive HBO.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, CyberBunker, an {{internet}} provider named after its former headquarters in a surplus NATO bunker in the Netherlands that [...] "offers anonymous hosting of anything except child porn and anything related to terrorism" [...] {{was added to}} the Spamhaus blacklist used by email providers to weed out spam. Shortly afterwards, beginning on March 18, Spamhaus was the target of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack exploiting a long-known vulnerability in the Domain Name System (DNS) which permits origination of massive quantities of messages at devices owned by others using IP address spoofing. Devices exploited in the attack may be as simple as a cable <b>converter</b> <b>box</b> connected to the internet. The attack was of a previously unreported scale (peaking at 300 gigabits per second; an average large-scale attack might reach 50 Gbit/s, and the largest previous publicly reported attack was 100 Gbit/s) was launched against Spamhaus's DNS servers; [...] the effects of the attack had lasted for over a week. Steve Linford, chief executive for Spamhaus, said that they had withstood the attack, using the assistance of other internet companies such as Google to absorb the excess traffic. Linford also claimed that the attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world, who had chosen to remain anonymous to avoid similar attacks on their own infrastructure. Spamhaus also hired Cloudflare, a DDoS mitigation company, to assist them by distributing their internet services across Cloudflare's worldwide network, after which the focus of the attack was redirected to the companies that provide Cloudflare's network connections.|$|E
