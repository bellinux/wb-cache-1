30|$|Because LOH-affecting {{factors are}} highly diverse, {{diagnosing}} LOH is difficult. Most studies on LOH {{have focused on}} identifying the relationships between LOH and other diseases.

40|$|Background The use of {{electronic}} records in healthcare is increasing. To avoid errors, {{it is essential}} that the data displays used by these systems are usable: efficient, effective and satisfying. A wide variety of display techniques are <b>used</b> to present <b>clinical</b> data, but the best methods to assess the usability of these techniques have not been determined. This systematic review will answer the question: What methods are employed to assess the usability {{of electronic}} visualisations of patient data <b>for</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>use?</b> The results of this systematic review will then be used to inform best assessment and design practice. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, OpenGrey, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched for original studies related to the usability of electronic information visualisations of patient data <b>for</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>use.</b> Reference lists of eligible studies and relevant reviews will be explored to identify further eligible studies. Discussion This systematic review will identify methods used to assess the usability of electronic information visualisations of patient data <b>for</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>use.</b> We will summarise the similarities and differences between the methods found. Our results will inform best practice when developing new user interfaces to display electronic patient data <b>for</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>use...</b>|$|R
