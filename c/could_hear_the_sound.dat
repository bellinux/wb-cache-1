2500|$|Blocked by the National Assembly, Louis-Napoleon {{decided to}} take a {{different}} route. in public he blamed Thiers and the Assembly for restricting the right to vote and for refusing to alter the Constitution for a second term, and secretly brought loyal army forces to Paris. Early in the morning of 2 December 1851, in {{what became known as the}} December 1851 coup d'état, the army took up positions in key positions in Paris, and at six a.m. the commissioner of police, Hubault, appeared at his residence at Place Saint-Georges and placed him under arrest. [...] "But don't you know the law?" [...] Thiers protested. [...] "Do you know that you're violating the Constitution?" [...] Hubault replied, [...] "I do not have the mission of discussing this with you, and moreover you have more knowledge than me." [...] A carriage took Thiers to Mazas Prison. From his jail cell he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of gunfire as the soldiers loyal to Louis-Napoleon secured the city. On 9 December, he was transported to the German border and sent into exile.|$|E
2500|$|Through the maquis {{caused the}} Germans much difficulty, the guerrillas tended not to fare well in {{sustained}} combat. The SOE agent André Hue who was leading a maquis band in Brittany later recalled about the Battle of Saint Marcel as the firefight on 18 June 1944 at a farmhouse outside Saint Marcel {{he was using}} as his base: [...] "Now every weapon that the enemy possessed was {{brought to bear on}} our front line in a cacophony of shots and explosions which could not drown an even more sinister noise: the occasional crack of a single bullet. A man within feet of me slumped to the ground with blood spurting two feet into the air from the side of his neck [...] [...] [...] We had anticipated an infantry assault-possibly backed up with light armour-but snipers, a threat we had not met before, were difficult to counter. Within minutes of the first casualty, another seven of our men lay dying within the farm complex: all had been shot from long range." [...] As the snipers continued to cut down his men while he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of panzers coming up in the distance, Hue ordered his men to retreat into the woods under the cover of darkness while using his radio to call in a RAF airstrike that disorganised the Germans enough to make escape possible. Summarizing up the Battle of Saint Marcel, Hue wrote: [...] "The majority of the younger men had never been in battle, and seeing their friends' brains and guts oozing on to the grass and mud made them sick in the head and stomach. Just as terrifying to the young Frenchmen was the sight of those who were wounded and who yet had to die without help. I was not surprised that so many had enough. I was perhaps astonished that the number of defectors were so low".|$|E
60|$|Stopping and {{listening}} again, they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of oars, from two directions.|$|E
5000|$|Final Question in Miss Earth 2004: [...] "On a quiet night, you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> {{of nature}} talking to you. What {{do you think}} is its message and {{what would you like to}} tell it back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{long silence}} followed, {{in which they}} <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of wood-chopping, and that Sandy Bar was already astir for the coming day. Then Scott slowly and with {{difficulty}} turned his face to York, and said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|The boys {{moved slowly}} around in <b>the</b> dark. They <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of several horses feeding and the barking of the dogs. Then, quite unexpectedly, came the {{cracking}} of a board, a yell of alarm from Nat Poole, and a loud splash.|$|R
60|$|In the {{distance}} they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of hammering {{on the other}} side of the wall. Francis moved his head in that direction.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} the sentry {{reported}} that he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of many feet in the darkness, with the occasional snapping as of dry twigs.|$|E
60|$|They all listened, and {{now there}} was no doubt about it. From inside the room they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a man, half singing, half moaning.|$|E
50|$|As {{the armies}} moved into {{position}} {{about five miles}} from the walls, {{on the night of}} 13 August, they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of heavy artillery and machine-gun fire from within the city. They feared they had arrived one day too late to rescue their countrymen.|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} minutes after {{he reached the}} edge of the swamp before <b>the</b> boy <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> which <b>the</b> quick ears of the hound had detected. Then he heard a faint {{splashing}} noise, and a minute or two later two figures were seen wading through the water.|$|R
60|$|Cautiously we ascended. We <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of {{conversation}} {{coming from the}} room above, but the hall still was unlighted, nor was any one in sight as we gained {{the top of the}} runway. Together we threaded the long hall and reached the balcony overlooking the courtyard, without being detected.|$|R
60|$|There {{was still}} no reply, yet it was certain now {{that the end of}} his search was at hand. Distinctly he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a man breathing.|$|E
60|$|At {{last they}} <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of his horse's feet upon the rocks, and with girlish impulse Lee raised a musical cry--an {{invitation}} {{as well as}} a joyous signal.|$|E
60|$|The two men {{held their}} breath, keeping {{well in the}} shadow of the orange grove. They had reached the road, and in the {{distance}} they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of approaching voices.|$|E
50|$|The {{area around}} the forests where the massacres were taking place was {{surrounded}} with police and paramilitary groups in order both to prevent any victims from escaping and also to preclude access to any potential witnesses from the outside. Despite these arrangements, the local Polish and Kashubian populace was able to observe the numerous transports going to <b>the</b> forests and <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of gunfire.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the rebel}} {{group on the}} border, in Feces, had {{remained}} in its position, until they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of gunfire coming from Chaves. They crossed the border and managed to raise the royalist flag over the customs house. The small detachment of regular troops had meanwhile moved south {{to take up a}} better position. This group of rebels, nevertheless, never made it past the border.|$|R
60|$|It {{was after}} he had been sitting on the wood-pile long enough to {{understand}} why this property had been given him, reading first the deed, and then looking toward the wood-lot, where he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of activity, that he entered the house, where both his old and his new partners were discussing, as they had ever since the work had begun, the probabilities of finding oil.|$|R
60|$|But Mary Erskine did not answer. Mary Bell <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the spinning-wheel in the house, and she {{wondered}} why the spinner could not hear her, when she called so loud.|$|E
60|$|I was silent, {{and then}} we both started apart. Behind us we <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of {{footsteps}} rapidly approaching, soft quick footsteps, muffled and almost noiseless upon the spongy turf. We stood still.|$|E
60|$|He {{said the}} latter words through his shut teeth. For {{a space of}} perhaps {{a couple of minutes}} there was silence, and I could fancy that I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of our hearts beating.|$|E
60|$|The men {{strained}} at {{the oars}} {{and the boat}} sprang forward at every stroke. They <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> moaning <b>sound</b> growing louder and louder.|$|R
60|$|They {{went out}} of the Cobhurst gateway, but along the moonlighted highway they saw no {{approaching}} spot, nor <b>could</b> they <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of wheels.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed into}} a smaller room, and Graham <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> faintly <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of <b>the</b> telephone. In {{a minute or}} two his host returned.|$|R
60|$|Between us and {{the mouth}} of the gulley rose, or rather sank, a sheer precipice that was {{apparently}} three or four hundred feet in depth, and at its foot we <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of water.|$|E
60|$|With a Turkish good-night the men rowed on, and {{the singer}} forward at once began another song. For {{a quarter of}} an hour they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the oars growing fainter and fainter, then it ceased.|$|E
60|$|And {{through all}} her {{thoughts}} passed the rider who even now was thundering over the green sward {{on his way}} to her. In her fancy at first, and later in her ears, she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of his sweeping gallop.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Seguida {{group was}} founded {{by a group of}} New York musicians whose ancestry was of Puerto Rican heritage. They were brought up in the urban South Bronx barrios where musical influences were a mixed bag. In these barrios, it wasn’t unusual to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of James Brown and Funkadelic coming from one apartment, while in another <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of Larry Harlow, Eddie Palmieri and Ray Barretto and still in another apartment you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of <b>the</b> Beatles, Cream, Motown, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin.|$|R
5|$|RAF Handforth was a {{large and}} {{important}} storage facility that contributed directly to the war effort. The site stretched from the centre of Handforth village, through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford. The industrial estate Adlington Park in Woodford/Poynton was a dispersed site of RAF Handforth. Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged, but its villagers knew {{the extent of the}} war, mainly due to the large and visible presence of <b>the</b> RAF and <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of air-raids on Manchester.|$|R
60|$|As {{he hurried}} along with Bull, he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> above <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of <b>the</b> musketry the sharp {{crack of the}} field-guns from the {{opposite}} side of the river.|$|R
60|$|This {{time they}} <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of an engine beating {{away in the}} boat-house {{on the other side}} of the Hall. Through the closely-drawn curtains, too, they could see faint fingers of light from the house on the sea.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more they}} crossed the stone hall and entered the room into which they had first been shown. On the {{threshold}} Peter stopped short and listened. It {{seemed to him that}} from somewhere upstairs he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a woman's sobs. He turned to Bernadine.|$|E
60|$|When he {{recovered}} his breath, {{he began to}} calculate his chances. The bush overhead seemed very thick, and he resolved to shelter there for a time. Occasionally he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of voices close by, and was sure that the Ashantis were in force there.|$|E
50|$|The {{potential}} for railroad development across the Rancho Santa Margarita also captured Forster’s imagination. In 1880, the California Southern Railroad, in close {{cooperation with the}} Santa Fe, began laying a line from National City to San Bernardino, which would be an eventual fink with the Topeka road. North of Oceanside, the tracks turned east and followed the Santa Margarita River across Forster’s ranch. Early in 1882, from his home near <b>the</b> river, he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of track being laid, but did not {{live to see the}} line’s completion.|$|R
60|$|Standing {{perfectly}} quiet, <b>the</b> friends <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> pattering <b>sound</b> made by <b>the</b> wolves' feet {{upon the}} fallen leaves; but the moon had sunk now, {{and they were}} unable to make out their figures.|$|R
60|$|Seated {{where he}} <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{slightest}} <b>sound</b> from <b>the</b> outside, he reflected upon all {{the dangers of}} the situation, and reproached himself for having led the boys and the engineer into such peril.|$|R
