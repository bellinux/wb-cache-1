5|$|In 1838 {{there was}} a new {{currency}} crisis, and the peso papel was devalued by 34%, and in 1839 when the peso papel lost 66% of its value. It was again devalued by 95% in 1845, and by 40% in 1851. The Alsina years, which coincided with the secession of Buenos Aires, saw an extremely poor economic performance. Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces of the <b>Confederation</b> caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket. Similarly, the <b>Confederation</b> faced harsh economic conditions. Urquiza, president of the <b>Confederation,</b> issued the 'law of differential rights', benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the <b>Confederation</b> and but not with Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The 1815–16 Congress of Vienna {{led to the}} {{creation}} of the German <b>Confederation,</b> a loose union of all remaining German states after the Napoleonic Wars. The <b>Confederation</b> was created as a replacement for the now-extinct Holy Roman Empire, with Francis I of Austria—the last Holy Roman Emperor—as its president. The <b>confederation</b> did not have a flag of its own, although the black-red-gold tricolour is sometimes mistakenly attributed to it.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1830s and early 1840s, Rosas faced {{a series of}} major threats to his power. The Unitarians found an ally in Andrés de Santa Cruz, the ruler of the Peru–Bolivian <b>Confederation.</b> Rosas {{declared}} war against the Peru–Bolivian <b>Confederation</b> on 19 March 1837, joining the War of the <b>Confederation</b> between Chile and Peru–Bolivia. The Rosista army played a minor role in the conflict, {{which resulted in the}} overthrow of Santa Cruz and the dissolution of the Peru–Bolivian <b>Confederation.</b> On 28 March 1838, France declared a blockade of the Port of Buenos Aires, eager to extend its influence over the region. Unable to confront the French, Rosas increased internal repression to forestall potential uprisings against his regime.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, many of its dukes and princes {{joined the}} <b>Confederation</b> of the Rhine, a <b>confederation</b> of Napoleonic client states. These states {{preferred}} to use their own flags.

5|$|Although it had {{abandoned}} the cause of Poniatowski's reforms, the Familia did not receive the support it expected from the Russians, who continued to press for the dissidents' rights. Meanwhile, some factions now rallied {{under the banner of}} the Bar <b>Confederation,</b> aimed against the dissidents, Poniatowski and the Russians. After an unsuccessful attempt to find allies in Western Europe (France, England and Austria), Poniatowski and the Familia {{had no choice but to}} rely more heavily on the Russian Empire, which treated Poland as a protectorate. In the War of the Bar <b>Confederation</b> (1768–1772), Poniatowski supported the Russian army's repression of the Bar <b>Confederation.</b> In 1770, the Council of the Bar <b>Confederation</b> proclaimed him dethroned. The following year, he was kidnapped by Bar Confederate sympathizers and briefly held prisoner outside of Warsaw, but managed to escape. Faced with the weakness of Poland and continuing chaos, Austria, Russia and Prussia decided to intervene militarily, in exchange for significant territorial concessions from the Commonwealth – a decision they made without consulting Poniatowski or other Polish parties.|$|E

5|$|As {{the results}} of the binding {{referendum}} were to join Canada, Newfoundland began to negotiate with Canada to enter into <b>Confederation.</b> After negotiations were completed, the British Government received the terms and the British North America Act 1949 was subsequently passed by the British Parliament and given Royal Assent. Newfoundland officially joined Canada at midnight, March 31, 1949.

5|$|Following several {{constitutional}} conferences, the Constitution Act officially proclaimed Canadian <b>Confederation</b> on July 1, 1867, initially {{with four}} provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory {{to form the}} Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion {{and the creation of}} the province of Manitoba in July 1870.

5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the <b>Confederation</b> sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the <b>Confederation</b> was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not {{to wait until the}} larger kingdoms' attention turned to him.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, {{many of the}} proprietors {{pulled out of the}} real estate market and voluntarily sold their property to the government so that sale to the land's occupiers could be facilitated. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian <b>Confederation.</b> One of the terms of the Island joining the <b>Confederation</b> was the sale of the estates of land to their occupiers. The agreement to join the <b>Confederation</b> contained a clause outlining the possibility that the federal government of Canada could provide a grant of up to CA$800,000 to the provincial government to facilitate the purchase of the land from the proprietors. In 1875, through 'The Commissioners Appointed Under The Provisions of The Land Purchase Act, 1875' all of the outstanding proprietor-owned land was compulsorily purchased by the provincial government, at rates decided by a 'Commission of Enquiry'.|$|E

5|$|King Stanisław August's {{acquiescence}} to the Russian intervention encountered some opposition. On February 29, 1768, several magnatesincluding Józef Pułaski and {{his young}} son Kazimierz Pułaski (Casimir Pulaski)vowing to oppose Russian influence, declared Stanisław August a lackey of Russia and Catherine, and formed a <b>confederation</b> at the town of Bar. The Bar <b>Confederation</b> focused on limiting the influence of foreigners in Commonwealth affairs, and being pro-Catholic was generally opposed to religious tolerance. It began a civil war to overthrow the King, but its irregular forces were overwhelmed by Russian intervention in 1772.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{wished to}} secure the Colony of British Columbia. There was {{interest}} in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt {{that would have to}} be assumed should it join <b>Confederation.</b> Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined <b>Confederation</b> in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since <b>Confederation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Even {{though the}} CONCACAF Gold Cup is held every two years, prior to 2013, only {{the winners of}} the Gold Cup that was held two years before the FIFA <b>Confederations</b> Cup {{qualified}} as CONCACAF's representative. For example, Mexico won the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup and qualified for the 2013 FIFA <b>Confederations</b> Cup. This had resulted in CONCACAF teams using weaker rosters in the Gold Cup that was held on the same year as the <b>Confederations</b> Cup, as the result of this tournament having no bearing on qualification for the <b>Confederations</b> Cup and many teams were also involved in qualifying for the FIFA World Cup during that year.|$|R
