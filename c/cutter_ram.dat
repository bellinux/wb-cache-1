25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1877, Grant was the host ship for United States Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman's three week tour of lighthouses, life saving and Coast Survey services. Also on board was Webb C. Hayes, who was then serving as {{secretary}} for his father, President Rutherford B. Hayes. During this tour, the <b>cutter</b> <b>rammed</b> and sank the schooner Dom Pedro off Boon Island, with no loss of life.|$|R
50|$|A {{metalworking}} shaper {{is somewhat}} analogous to a metalworking planer, with the <b>cutter</b> riding a <b>ram</b> that moves {{relative to a}} stationary workpiece, rather than the workpiece moving beneath the <b>cutter.</b> The <b>ram</b> is typically actuated by a mechanical crank inside the column, though hydraulically actuated shapers are increasingly used. Adding axes of motion to a shaper can yield helical toolpaths, as also done in helical planing.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, {{the rest}} of the team uses the {{captured}} Japanese cutter to sail straight into the lagoon. Malzone and Hayes dive to the sunken sub, but when the crew of a Japanese salvage boat opens fire on the <b>cutter,</b> Davayo <b>rams</b> the boat in a suicide attack. After setting their explosive charges, Malzone and Hayes are guided back to Carey's sub by Sherman (possessor of the [...] "finest pair of lungs in the Navy"), just as a fleet of American dive bombers arrive to finish off the Japanese vessels in the lagoon.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic rescue tools, {{also known}} as the Jaws of Life, are used by {{emergency}} rescue personnel to assist vehicle extrication of crash victims, as well as other rescues from small spaces. These tools include <b>cutters,</b> spreaders, and <b>rams.</b> Such devices were first used in 1963 as a tool to free race car drivers from their vehicles after crashes.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for the coming Allied landings, the Germans mined the Wouri estuary. They sunk 10 or 12 steamships and mine planters in the rivermouth of the Wouri, to prevent landings at Douala. On 11 September the 710-ton gunboat HMS Dwarf attempted to enter the rivermouth but was damaged by German artillery fire and retreated. On 15 September {{an attempt was made}} to blow up the Dwarf with a launch full of explosives, but failed. On 16 September, the German customs <b>cutter</b> Nachtigal <b>rammed</b> the Dwarf; an ensuing explosion sank the Nachtigal, killing 36 of her crew. Another attempt to sink the Dwarf took place when two German launches used spar torpedoes to sink the ship but failed. Other encounters between British and German light craft occurred throughout mid-September.|$|R
5000|$|A {{floating}} workshop for American and other Allied destroyers, Prairie was “mother ship” to {{a squadron of}} destroyers at Argentia, the Atlantic terminus of the transatlantic convoy route. A fire from , secured astern of Prairie, spread to the tender 29 May 1942 and caused extensive damage. After repairing at Boston, Prairie returned to Argentia. On 22 February 1943, U.S. Coast Guard <b>cutter</b> [...] was <b>rammed</b> during an engagement with a German submarine; complete overhaul was provided by Prairie, and Campbell sailed to the United States 27 May.|$|R
50|$|On 6 October 1785, Pyllades {{stationed}} a <b>cutter</b> off the <b>Ram</b> Head to interceptany smuggling {{boats that}} might attempt to land. When she discovered a small cutter lying-to, and several boats near the unknown vessel, Pylladess boat rowed alongside. At this point, the smugglers fired a swivel that killed one of Pylladess men, and escaped. The Crown offered a pardon to anyone (other {{than the actual}} perpetrator himself) {{to any of the}} smugglers that provided information that would result in the arrest of the perpetrator and the other smugglers. The Crown also offered a reward of ₤100 to the same end.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{accident}} scene, a ground connection {{is used to}} prevent electric shocks from overhead lines (see an emergency ground connection in [...] The accident scene is isolated, and police or fire brigade controls the traffic. The accident scene is surveyed, {{and in the case}} of several injured persons, a triage process or other recognition of patients’ states is done. The most critically injured patients get more, faster, and better quality attention and treatment. In the case of a patient underneath a tram, lifting bags or hydraulic jacks brought by fire brigades can be used to elevate the tram and release the patient (see lifting points in [...] and a tow car lifting a tram in [...] A crane can be used to lift a tram, too, or an overturned tram. If a patient is trapped inside crushed structures, various kinds of extrication tools, like hydraulic spreaders, <b>rams,</b> <b>cutters,</b> and circular saws can be used. In some cases, it is also possible to drive the tram backwards, but in most cases this would only cause more injuries to the victim. While cutting, lifting or turning an overturned tram or vehicle, structures often have to be stabilized to avoid the movement of the vehicle, to prevent the risk of movements of suspension, and to avoid falling of lifted vehicles on the patient or the members of the rescue crew.|$|R
