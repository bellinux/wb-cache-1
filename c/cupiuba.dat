40|$|An {{important}} forest research {{challenge in}} the Amazonian is finding forms of reforesting degraded areas {{with the use of}} a larger number of native species and identify tropical species commercially attractive adapted to clear-cut areas. This work had as objectives to evaluate the initial growth in diameter and height of six native Amazonian species in a preliminary species trial. The data were obtained from measures of 72 trees 9 years after planting. The selected species for this study were <b>cupiúba</b> (Goupia glabra), cumaru (Dipterix odorata), andiroba (Carapa guianensis), brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), pará-pará (Jacaranda copaia) and tatajuba (Bagassa guianensis). The cumulative growth curves for diameter and height was obtained by the Chapman – Richards function. In spite of the low age of the stands, it was obtained good fit to the function for the studied species. Pará-pará (Jacaranda copaia), presented best diameter and height growth in all the ages. The diameter mean annual increment analysis showed that, except for the <b>cupiúba</b> (Goupia glabra),  can be expected  increments larger than  2 cm, by appropiate spacings and thinning. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} MC on longitudinal, radial, and {{tangential}} ultrasonic wave velocity {{and on the}} respective terms of the stiffness matrix were examined for Brazilian pine (Araucaria angustifolia) and <b>cupiúba</b> (Goupia glabra). The ultrasonic wave velocity tended to increase with a decrease in MC, {{and the effect of}} MC on the ultrasonic wave velocity below the FSP was greater than above. Below the FSP, the stiffness terms tended to decrease with increasing MC, but above the FSP, they increased with increasing MC because of the influence of water on the bulk density. This result may be corrected by using the effective density above FSP, which depends on the mobility of free water and differs for the two species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The study {{aimed to}} assess the food {{accessibility}} and consumption among families in the <b>Cupiúba</b> rural settlement, {{in the city of}} Castanhal, Pará, Brazil. It was found that the access to food is worrying and indicated that most families are in food insecurity conditions. Moreover, income and food safety level were associated. The consumption of the settler families comprises mainly high-energy, low-nutrient content foods, characterized by the low intake of fruits and vegetables and the introduction of processed foods with high energy density and sugar-added beverages, although the traditional dietary habits (rice and beans) are still present. This configures a diet at risk for important nutritional deficits, obesity, and many non-communicable chronic diseases...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the great}} {{variability}} of its mechanical properties, the rational use of lumber for structural purposes is directly conditioned to its grading. There are several techniques available for grading structural lumber. The most relevant one is the transverse vibration technique which obtained reliable results in non-destructive evaluation of lumber. The purpose of this work is to present the bases for the mechanical grading of lumber {{and the results of}} the calibration test of the frst transverse vibration equipment developed in Brazil. In this research 30 beams of <b>cupiúba</b> (Goupia glabra) with nominal dimensions of 5 cm X 10 cm X 300 cm, were used. The tests were accomplished at the Wood and Timber Structures Laboratory (LaMEM) of the University of São Paulo (USP). The results showed a strong correlation between the elasticity modulus measured by the static bending test and the one obtained with the transverse vibration equipment, showing the high reliability of the vibration method for the grading of structural lumber. A determination coeffcient (R²) of 0. 896 was obtained with the Brazilian equipment, showing that it can be used in the grading of lumber...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{urbanization}} {{in rural areas}} grows throughout the world. In the Brazilian Amazon, the occurrence of this expansion process allows for increased economic performance of farms due to land use intensification and diversification of production in peri-urban settlements. The objective of the research was to evaluate the economic performance of farms, pondering the prospects of farmers as {{to stay in the}} Settlement Project <b>Cupiúba.</b> We sampled 30 % of the settlers of settlement project, which corresponds to 65 farms to survey data by applying semi-structured questionnaire. The data refer to various aspects of the characteristics of establishments, including family data, economic data, agricultural practices, hand labor, marketing, basic infrastructure and assets acquired. Data analysis was performed by comparing the average ANOVA - single factor analysis and correlation between variables with simple correlations. In the economic and financial aspects were investigated income-generating activities in agriculture and non-agricultural establishment. Based on the results analyzed, it appears that the establishments if enable the agricultural income while the chiefs are young, and the receipt of retirement when they are in old age. The viability of agriculture is through the sale of plant products. The intensification as showed no clear effects on income and diversification showed effect depending on the valuation method. Establishments have economic viability and the vast majority is above the level of simple reproduction (LSP), regarded as the minimum income needed to reproduce the means of production unit and remunerate family labor over time...|$|E
40|$|A esp?cie Goupia glabra Aublet (Goupiaceae), denominada popularmente como cupi?ba, ? utilizada na {{medicina}} popular contra diversas doen?as. Suas cascas s?o utilizadas como analg?sico dent?rio, como verm?fugo, no tratamento de mal?ria, catapora e eczema. As folhas s?o utilizadas contra s?filis, doen?as oculares, enxaqueca, var?ola e como cicatrizante. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo quantificar compostos fen?licos e avaliar as atividades antioxidante, inibidora de acetilcolinesterase, toxicidade em Artemia salina, antitumoral e antimicrobiana de extratos de folhas, galhos finos e galhos grossos de cupi?ba. O material seco foi triturado e submetido ? extra??o em aparelho de Soxhlet com solventes de polaridade crescente (Hexano, AcOEt e MeOH). A prospec??o fitoqu?mica foi realizada para diferentes classes de metab?litos, sendo observados resultados positivos para ester?is em todos os extratos, triterpen?ides e algumas classes de flavon?ides nos extratos obtidos em acetato de etila e metanol. O fracionamento do extrato em hexano de folhas (EHF) resultou no isolamento de uma mistura de ?-sitosterol e estigmasterol. Do extrato em AcOEt de folhas (EAF) foi isolado o catecol, um fenol simples de distribui??o restrita na natureza. O conte?do de fen?licos totais dos extratos foi determinado utilizando o reagente de Folin-Ciocalteau e o resultado foi expresso em equivalentes de ?cido g?lico (EAG). A atividade antioxidante foi avaliada atrav?s da capacidade seq?estrante do radical est?vel 2, 2 -difenil- 1 -picrilhidrazil (DPPH), utilizando quercetina como padr?o externo, expressos como valores de Concentra??o eficiente (CE 50). Foi observada uma correla??o positiva entre os fen?licos totais e a CE 50, ou seja, quanto maior a quantidade de fen?licos, menor a CE 50. O extrato em AcOEt das folhas (EAF) foi o que apresentou maior potencial antioxidante [CE 50 = 9, 76 ? 0, 42 ?g/mL (cubeta) e CE 50 = 19, 87 ? 0, 31 ?g/mL (microplaca) ]. A toxicidade dos extratos foi verificada atrav?s de bioensaios com microcrust?ceo A. salina e expressa em % de mortalidade das larvas. A an?lise qualitativa da atividade anticolinesterase foi realizada de acordo com o m?todo de Ellman (modificado), com resultados negativos para inibi??o da enzima acetilcolinesterase. A atividade antitumoral foi avaliada contra quatro linhagens de c?lulas (leucemia, mama, c?lon e glioblastoma) utilizando m?todo de an?lise colorim?trica baseada na convers?o do sal 3 -(4, 5 -dimetil- 2 -tiazol) - 2, 5 -difenil- 2 -H-brometo de tetrazonium (MTT) em azul de formazam segundo o m?todo de Mossman. Os melhores resultados foram observados para os extratos obtidos em AcOEt, principalmente para c?lulas HCT- 8 (c?lon) que variaram de 58, 35 a 77, 12 %. O extrato obtido em AcOEt dos galhos grossos (EAGg) apresentou valor de CI 50 = 13, 73 ?g/mL para a linhagem HL- 60 (leucemia). Esse extrato foi fracionado e a fra??o EAGg 5 apresentou percentual de inibi??o de crescimento celular de 85, 37 e 101, 37 % para as linhagens SF- 295 (glioblastoma) e MDAMB- 435 (mama), respectivamente. A avalia??o da atividade antimicrobiana foi realizada pelo m?todo da concentra??o inibit?ria m?nima (MIC) que foi determinada pela t?cnica da microdilui??o em caldo M?eller-Hinton para bact?rias (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli e Pseudomonas aeruginosa) e em meio l?quido Sabouraud para fungos (Candida albicans, C. tropicalis e C. parapsilosis). Todos os extratos demonstraram algum grau de atividade bacteriana e fungicida, com destaque para os extratos obtidos em AcOEt que apresentaram inibi??o moderada de crescimento microbiano. Para avaliar o efeito dos extratos no crescimento dos protozo?rios foi realizado estudo {{in vitro}} com formas promastigotas de Leishmania amazonensis e epimastigotas de Trypanosoma cruzi. O extrato EAGg mostrou atividade antiproliferativa, tanto contra L. amazonensis quanto para T. cruzi, com valores de IC 50 de 86 e 40 ?g/mL, respectivamente. A significativa atividade antioxidante, antitumoral e antimicrobiana observada nos extratos de cupi?ba destaca seu elevado potencial para a obten??o de produtos biotecnol?gicos. The species Goupia glabra Aublet (Goupiaceae), {{popularly known as}} cupi?ba is used in popular medicine against several diseases. Their barks are used as dental analgesic, as a vermifuge, to treat malaria, chickenpox and eczema. The leaves are used against syphilis, ocular disorders, migraine, smallpox and as healing. This study aimed to quantify the phenolic compounds and evaluate the antioxidant, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, brine shrimp toxicity, antitumor and antimicrobial activities of extracts of leaves, thin and thick branches of cupi?ba. The dry material was crushed and subjected to Soxhlet extraction using solvents in increasing order of polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol). The phytochemical screening was performed for different classes of metabolites, observed positive results for sterols in all extracts and terpenoids and some classes of flavonoids in the extracts obtained in ethyl acetate and methanol. The fractionation of the hexane extract of leaves (EHF) resulted in the isolation of a mixture composed by ?-sitosterol and stigmasterol. From ethyl acetate extract of leaves (EAF) was isolated catechol, a simple phenol with restricted distribution in nature. The total phenolic content of extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau {{and the result was}} expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The antioxidant activity was assessed by the ability of capturing the stable radical 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), using quercetin as external standard, expressed as value of the effective concentration (EC 50). We observed a positive correlation between total phenolics and EC 50, ie as greater the amount of phenolics smaller is the EC 50. The ethyl acetate extract of the leaves (EAF) presented the highest antioxidant potential [EC 50 = 9. 76 ? 0. 42 ?g/mL (quartz cuvette) and EC 50 = 19. 87 ? 0. 31 ?g/mL (microplate) ]. The toxicity of the extracts was verified by bioassays with microcrustacea A. salina and expressed in percentual mortality of nauplius. Qualitative analysis of anticholinesterase activity was performed according to the method of Ellman (modified), presenting negative results. The antitumor activity was evaluated against four cell lines (leukemia, breast, colon and glioblastoma) using colorimetric analysis method based on conversion of salt 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazole) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 -H-tetrazonium bromide (MTT) into blue formazam by the method of Mossman. The best results were observed for the ethyl acetate extracts, especially for cells HCT- 8 (colon) that ranged from 58. 35 to 77. 12 %. The ethyl acetate extract obtained from thick branches (EAGg) showed values of IC 50 = 13. 73 ?g/mL for strain HL- 60 (leukemia). This extract was fractionated and the fraction EAGg 5 showed the percentage of cell growth inhibition of 85. 37 and 101. 37 % for the lines SF- 295 (glioblastoma) and MDAMB- 435 (breast), respectively. The antimicrobial activity was conducted using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) that was determined by microdilution in Mueller-Hinton broth for bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and in liquid Sabouraud for fungi (Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis). All extracts showed some degree of bacterial and fungicidal activity, especially the ethyl acetate extracts which showed moderate inhibition of microbial growth. The effect of extracts on growth of protozoa in vitro study was evaluated with promastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis and epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi. EAGg extract showed antiproliferative activity against both L. amazonensis and T. cruzi, with IC 50 values of 86 and 40 ?g/mL, respectively.
