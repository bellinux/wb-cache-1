60|$|The weirdness of visions lies {{in their}} sudden appearance, in their {{vividness}} while present, {{and in their}} sudden departure. An incident in the Zoological Gardens {{struck me as a}} helpful simile. I happened to walk to the seal-pond at a moment when a sheen rested on the unbroken surface of the water. After waiting a while I became suddenly aware of the head of a seal, black, conspicuous, [12] and motionless, just as though it had always been there, at a spot on which my eye had rested a moment previously and seen nothing. Again, after a while my eye wandered, and on its returning to the spot the seal was gone. The water had closed in silence over its head without leaving a ripple, and the sheen {{on the surface of the}} pond was as unbroken as when I first reached it. Where did the seal come from, and whither did it go? This could easily have been answered if the glare had not obstructed the view of the movements of the animal under water. As it was, a solitary link in a continuous <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> stood isolated from all the rest. So it is with the visions; a single stage in a series of mental processes emerges into the domain of consciousness. All that precedes and follows lies outside of it, and its character can only be inferred. We see in a general way that a condition of the presentation of visions lies in the over-sensitiveness of certain tracks or domains of brain action and the under-sensitiveness of others, certain stages in a mental process being represented very vividly in consciousness while the other stages are unfelt; also that individualism is changed to dividualism.|$|E

40|$|The {{legal system}} {{undergoes}} again a deep process of transformation {{that may be}} attributed to the emergence of the "society of networks". The earlier transformations {{that took place in the}} "society of organisations" were centred around the organisation as a kind of "big individual" that was and still is able to aggregate and manage long <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> as opposed to the individual subject whose action was rule oriented and followed established patterns of experience. The "society of organisations" was characterised by the rise of all kinds of social norms (standards), organised generation of knowledge, and practices of “balancing” that the multiplication <b>of</b> long <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> have made necessary. The "society of networks" leads to more complex processes of knowledge generation and tends to create new "quasi-subjects" that follow mobile project-like patterns of cooperation. They are focused on "high knowledge" that is involved in permanent processes of self-transformation. The emergence of "data driven technologies" that do not follow stable trajectories is paradigmatic. It is a challenge for the legal system if what the new loosely aggregated quasi-subjects of the "society of networks" do is "surfing fluid reality" (Bahrami/Evans). This evolution finds its repercussion in new challenges for the regulatory state and also for contracting practices in private law.

Exposition during act one explains actions that precede the opening scene, and generates the audience's sympathy for the hero (or heroes) over their rival (or rivals). The plot moves forward in a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> that use minor reversals of fortune to create suspense.

5000|$|The Equilibres {{photographs}} (1984-1987), {{a series}} of images of household objects and studio detritus arranged to form tenuously-balanced assemblages, developed into the artists' celebrated film The Way Things Go (1986-1987). The resulting film enlists an assortment of objects, including tyres and chairs, as components in a domino-like chain reaction lasting thirty minutes. Using such common industrial objects, Fischli and Weiss created a continuous <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and reactions involving balloons deflating, tires rolling, liquids draining, candles melting, balls dropping, fuses burning, wheels spinning, and much more. The film’s humour lies in the deliberate misuse of these objects, as they are co-opted into performing roles outside their normal function. Reminiscent of the physical comedy of silent films starring Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, here the actors are steaming-kettles mounted on roller-skates, rotating dustbin bags, rickety stepladders set in motion, buckets, tyres, bottles and planks.|$|E
