40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study of creep crack growth in a fracture mechanics specimen. The material properties used {{are representative of}} a <b>carbon-manganese</b> <b>steel</b> at 360 oC and the constitutive behaviour of the steel is described by a power law creep model. A damage-based approach is used to predict the crack propagation rate in a compact tension specimen and the data are correlated against an independently determined C * parameter. Elastic-creep and elastic-plastic-creep analyses are performed using two different crack growth criteria to predict crack extension under plane stress and plane strain conditions. The plane strain crack growth rate predicted from the numerical analysis {{is found to be}} less conservative than the plane strain upper bound of an existing ductility exhaustion model, for values of C * within the limits of the present creep crack growth testing standards. At low values of C * the predicted plane stress and plane strain crack growth rates differ by a factor between 5 and 30 depending on the creep ductility of the material. However, at higher loads and C * values, the plane strain crack growth rates, predicted using an elastic-plastic-creep material response, approach those for plane stress. These results are consistent with experimental data for the material and suggest that purely elastic-creep modelling is unrealistic for the <b>carbon-manganese</b> <b>steel</b> as plastic strains are significant at relevant loading levels...|$|E

As cooling rate enhances, the ferritic grain become finer, when cooling rate is up to 30 ˚C/s, a little bainite appears. With the increasing of cooling rate the dimension of ferrite decreases. Under the experimental deformation conditions, ferritic grain refinement gets weak when the cooling rate is {{greater than or equal}} to 20 ˚C/s.

All the microstructures were composed of three constituents: partitioned martensite, laths of retained austenite and MA islands.

Good compromise between yield strength (similar to 1200 MPa) and uniform elongation (similar to 11 %) was found in the case of 400 degrees C partitioning for 300 s due to the enhanced mechanical stability of retained austenite.

A modified NSW model (NSW-MOD) is presented in which the effect of the damage angle at the crack tip is considered in order to predict this difference.

An extension to this study, as the use of a microalloyed Fe- 30 % Ni-Nb alloy in which the strain induced precipitation mechanism was studied directly. The work has shown that precipitation can occur at a much finer scale and higher number density than hitherto considered, but that pipe diffusion leads to rapid coarsening. The implications of this for model development are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} work {{was to determine the}} role of non-metallic inclusions in the process of hydrogen stepwise cracking (SWC). Additionally, the influence of inclusions upon the notch ductility of hydrogen charged (HC) and uncharged (UN) tensile specimens was examined. To obtain a basis for experiment a series of low <b>carbon-manganese</b> <b>steels</b> were prepared by induction melting. In order to produce variations in the composition, morphology, volume fraction, size and distribution of the inclusions the steel chemistry was adjusted prior to casting by additions of deoxidiser and Ca-Si injection. Sections of each ingot were hot rolled. Metallography, image analysis, mechanical tests and hydrogen SWC tests were then carried out. The volume fraction, morphology, and shape of inclusions influenced the tensile ductility of the steels. Marked anisotropy was found in the steels containing type II MnS inclusions at all rolling temperatures, whereas the fully Ca treated steel was isotropic. It was found that several inclusion parameters (projected length PL, mean free distance MFD, nearest-neighbour distance NND) correlated with fracture strain. An increase in inclusion volume fraction and/or the dimension of inclusions on a plane parallel to the plane of fracture led to a decrease in fracture strain. The inclusion parameters did not correlate with the fracture strains for the HC tensile specimens. However, large or clusters of inclusions acted as the principal sites for crack initiation. `Fisheyes' or areas of `flat' fracture were often found on these fracture surfaces. The criteria for SWC initiation was found to be either large inclusions or clusters of inclusions. As the PL of inclusions increased the probability of large SWCs occurring increased. SWC initiation at inclusions was believed to occur at a critical concentration of hydrogen. Factors which assisted the concentration of hydrogen at inclusions were discussed. None of the proposed mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement could be identified as the single cause of SWC...|$|R
40|$|Superduplex {{stainless}} steels have superior mechanical and corrosion properties compared to austenitic {{stainless steels}} such as the grade 300 series. This {{is a result of}} a microstructure consisting of roughly equal percentages of austenite (y) and ferrite (a) and negligible inclusion content. As a result, super duplex stainless steels are increasingly being used in the offshore oil and gas industries. It is also envisaged that they will find application in the emergent renewable energy sector in areas such as offshore wind, wave and tidal electricity / hydrogen generation. Corrosion fatigue (CF) conditions are expected in such applications. Of critical concern are weld joints where inherent sub critical surface/embedded flaws diminish crack initiation resistance enhancing the probability of subsequent crack propagation. The current research investigates the CF crack propagation performance of weld metals produced by two welding techniques. Since sub sea components are always cathodically protected, this condition was simulated in the CF tests. In addition, high positive potentials were simulated, as this condition is possible in the absence of cathodic protection. One weldment was completed using the expensive and relatively slow gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding method. The other weldment was achieved using the GTA method for the root pass and subsequently filled using the cheap and relatively quick shielded metal arc (SMA) welding method. The resultant crack propagation life was derived from the crack propagation tests by means of a numerical model. Fatigue life of the weld metals (assuming negligible residual stress influence) is similar to standard design curves for class D, carbon and <b>carbon-manganese</b> structural <b>steel</b> butt welds. Thresholds for the onset of crack growth in Zeron 100 base and weld metals are similar and were shown by means of the numerical model to correspond with the endurance limit specified in the standard design curve. Cathodic over protection is much more deleterious than high positive potentials above a critical stress level for Zeron 100 base and weld metals leading to an increase in crack propagation rates on average by a factor of 4. 3 over rates in air. The GTA root/SMA fill weld metal performs equally well as the GTA root/GTA fill weld. Therefore, a potential economic saving is evident. Finally, a new model for hydrogen assisted subcritical brittle crack propagation in ferrite is proposed...|$|R
