40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether consolidated {{earnings are}} managed {{to a greater}} extent than parent-only earnings or vice versa in an attempt to exceed the threshold in Japanese firms. The analysis reveals that earnings management to avoid earnings decreases is more pronounced in parent-only earnings for the period 1980 - 1999. Further, it reveals that the management of parent-only earnings has been less pervasive following the introduction of the new <b>consolidated</b> <b>reporting</b> system in March 2000. In addition, this paper provides evidence suggesting that earnings management in consolidated earnings increased after March 2000. These results indicate that the new <b>consolidated</b> <b>reporting</b> system and principles might affect the earnings management behaviors of Japanese firm managers. ...|$|R
