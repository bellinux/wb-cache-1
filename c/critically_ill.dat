5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.|$|E
5|$|Registered nurse (RN) – Nurses can be {{involved}} in ambulance work dependent on the jurisdiction, and as with doctors, this is mostly as air-medical rescuers often {{in conjunction with a}} technician or paramedic. They may bring different skills to the care of the patient, especially those who may be <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> or injured in locations that do not enjoy close proximity to a high level of definitive care such as trauma, cardiac, or stroke centers.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of cTnI {{in adult}} cardiomyocytes {{is estimated to}} be ~3.2 days and there is a pool of unassembled cardiac TnI in the cytoplasm. Cardiac TnI is exclusively expressed in the myocardium and is thus a highly specific diagnostic marker for cardiac muscle injuries, and cTnI has been universally used as indicator for myocardial infarction. An increased level of serum cTnI also independently predicts poor prognosis of <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients in the absence of acute coronary syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{wanted to}} join the war effort in August 1914 as a {{despatch}} rider, but his <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> mother managed {{to persuade him to}} stay at home and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, aged 42, Allingham enlisted with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). He became formally rated as an Air Mechanic Second Class on 21 September 1915, and was posted to Chingford before completing his training at Sheerness, Kent. His RNAS serial number was RNAS F8317.|$|E
5|$|For instance, a 2008 {{study of}} medical systems in Zambia {{published}} by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients. Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen, with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind. Furthermore, only 29 intensive care beds were available {{in all of the}} hospitals surveyed, and these were only found in major hospitals. This implies that the majority of <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients are receiving care in general hospital wards.|$|E
5|$|Murali (Kalyan Kumar) goes {{abroad to}} pursue higher studies in medicine. During his tenure overseas, his girlfriend Seetha (Devika) is forced {{by her parents}} to marry another person. Devastated upon hearing the news, Murali swears a vow of lifelong celibacy and devotes himself to save people {{suffering}} from cancer. A few years later, Venu (R. Muthuraman) happens to be <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> with cancer {{and has to be}} operated upon. The treatment for Venu progresses well until Murali meets Venu's wife, who is revealed to be Seetha. When Seetha learns that the doctor treating Venu is Murali, whom she had left, she becomes upset.|$|E
5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients for evacuation, and a number of these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
5|$|Liz (Tina Fey) invites her neighbor, Dr. Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), {{on their}} first date, accidentally {{scheduling}} it for Valentine's Day. At the suggestion of her boss, Jack (Alec Baldwin), Liz decides to have the date at her home. Many things go wrong during the date, including Liz exposing her breast and Drew seeing Liz on the toilet. The date gets worse when Drew's ex-wife drops off their daughter (Allie Trimm) at Liz's apartment. Later, Drew gets news that his mother (Marylouise Burke) is <b>critically</b> <b>ill.</b> The two visit her {{at the hospital and}} after Drew steps out, Liz is left alone with her. She tells Liz she is in fact not Drew's mother, but instead his grandmother, and that his sister (Laila Robins) is really his birth mother. Following the passing of his grandmother, Liz and Drew still decide to move forward in their relationship, and Liz telling Drew everything his grandmother told her.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
5|$|Willkie's {{condition}} only worsened as {{the weeks}} went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was <b>critically</b> <b>ill.</b> The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E

25|$|In August 2016 {{she became}} <b>critically</b> <b>ill.</b> Due to her great age, it was {{considered}} risky for Ranthambore's rangers and staff to treat and aid her as the medications needed could be harmful or fatal.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Prince Gong was {{appointed}} as zongling again, but he became <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> {{by the end}} of April. Empress Dowager Cixi visited him thrice during this period of time. He eventually {{died at the age of}} 67 (by East Asian age reckoning) in May.|$|E
25|$|When Sun Quan became <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> between 250 and 252, {{he regretted}} his {{decision}} to depose Sun He and thought of restoring Sun He as Crown Prince. However, Sun Luban (孫魯班), Sun Jun, Sun Hong (孫弘) and others strongly objected to it, so he dismissed the idea.|$|E
25|$|When a {{positive}} result is detected, the infant must {{be referred to}} a pediatric endocrinologist to confirm or disprove the diagnosis. Since most infants with salt-wasting CAH become <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> by 2 weeks of age, the evaluation must be done rapidly despite the high false positive rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicology}} of {{the treatment}} has recently been reviewed by Ustundag et al. and its risk management is discussed by Christian R.

25|$|Also in 2008, Barnes {{became the}} face of the Intensive Care Appeal, a major {{fund-raising}} event held annually in Australia and New Zealand for the Intensive Care Foundation. The goal of the Appeal is to create awareness and raise funds for <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients in intensive-care units.|$|E
25|$|The {{cardiovascular}} collapse {{theory is}} a prevalent modern explanation {{and suggests that}} Jesus died of profound shock. According to this theory, the scourging, the beatings, and the fixing to the cross would have left Jesus dehydrated, weak, and <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> and that this would have led to cardiovascular collapse.|$|E
25|$|Finally, a shock phase {{can develop}} as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining. This {{can result in}} shock and {{metabolic}} acidosis with dehydration, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and confusion. Patients who progress to this phase are often <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> and require intensive care.|$|E
25|$|This {{government}} mandated care {{places a}} cost burden on medical providers, as <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients lacking financial resources must be treated. Medical providers compensate for this cost by passing costs {{on to other}} parts of the medical system by increasing prices for other patients and through collection of government subsidies.|$|E
25|$|Critical illness-related {{corticosteroid}} insufficiency (CIRCI) {{is a form}} of {{adrenal insufficiency}} in <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients who have blood corticosteroid levels which are inadequate for the severe stress response they experience. Combined with decreased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and tissue response to corticosteroids, this adrenal insufficiency constitutes a negative prognostic factor for intensive care patients.|$|E
25|$|As Shi Yi became <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> {{towards the}} end of his life, he said that he wanted to have a very simple funeral, to be buried in a coffin of simple design, and to be dressed in the clothes he {{normally}} wore. He died in an unknown year at the age of 81 (by East Asian age reckoning).|$|E
25|$|Even in {{uncertain}} times, {{the possibility}} of a marriage between Mademoiselle and the Prince of Condé arose when Claire Clémence became <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> with erysipelas. Mademoiselle considered the proposal, as she would still have maintained her rank {{as one of the most}} important females at court, and her father had a good relationship with Condé. These plans failed, however, when Claire Clémence recovered.|$|E
25|$|On 3 August 2005, the BBC {{reported}} that she was <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> at King's College Hospital in London. She appeared to have suffered from balance problems {{as a result of}} her radiotherapy. According to her husband, she had fallen over on 30 July 2005, receiving head injuries and never regaining consciousness. Her living will, in which she had asked not to be resuscitated, was honoured.|$|E
25|$|Physicians are {{leaders of}} medical {{retrieval}} teams in many western countries, {{where they may}} assist with the transport of a <b>critically</b> <b>ill,</b> injured, or special needs patient to a tertiary care hospital, particularly when longer transport times are involved. In these cases the physician's role is extended to ensure {{the highest level of}} care is provided throughout the transport and diagnosis of serious medical conditions.|$|E
25|$|CIRCI can be {{suspected}} {{in patients}} with low blood pressure despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressor drugs. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines advocate intravenous hydrocortisone only in adults with septic shock and refractory hypotension. The exact definition of this condition, {{the best ways to}} test for corticoid insufficiency in <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients, and the therapeutic use of (usually low doses) of corticosteroids remains a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|In acalculous cholecystitis, no {{stone is}} in the biliary ducts. It {{accounts}} for 5–10% of all cases of cholecystitis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Acalculous cholecystitis is typically seen in people who are hospitalized and <b>critically</b> <b>ill.</b> Males {{are more likely to}} develop acute cholecystitis following surgery in the absence of trauma. It is associated with many causes including vasculitis, chemotherapy, major trauma or burns.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Israeli {{physician}} Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to {{a patient}} <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of leprosy. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours {{and was able to}} get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.|$|E
25|$|In 1850, {{when the}} Daoguang Emperor became <b>critically</b> <b>ill,</b> he summoned Zaiquan (載銓), Zaiyuan, Duanhua, Sengge Rinchen, Mujangga, He Rulin (何汝霖), Chen Fu'en (陳孚恩) and Ji Zhichang (季芝昌) to Shende Hall (慎德堂) in the Old Summer Palace, where he {{revealed}} {{to them a}} secret edict he wrote previously. According to the edict, the Fourth Prince, Yizhu, would become the new emperor while Yixin, the Sixth Prince, would be made a qinwang (first-rank prince). He died on the same day.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl in {{injectable}} formulation {{is commonly}} used for analgesia and {{as a component of}} balanced sedation and general anaesthesia in small animal patients. Its potency and short duration of action make it particularly useful in <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients. In addition, it tends to cause less vomiting and regurgitation than other pure-opioid agonists (morphine, hydromorphone) when given as a continuous post-operative infusion. As with other pure opioids, fentanyl can be associated with dysphoria in both dogs and cats.|$|E
25|$|A month later, on May 7, Fawcett was {{reported}} as being <b>critically</b> <b>ill,</b> with Ryan O'Neal {{quoted as saying}} she now spends her days at home, on an IV and often asleep. The Los Angeles Times reported {{that she was in}} the last stages of terminal cancer and had the chance to see her son Redmond in April 2009, although he was shackled and under supervision because he was then incarcerated. Her 91-year-old father, James, flew out to Los Angeles to visit.|$|E
25|$|No {{study has}} {{definitively}} demonstrated improved outcome in <b>critically</b> <b>ill</b> patients managed with PA catheters. Given that the PA catheter is a monitoring tool {{and not a}} therapy {{in and of itself}} this is not entirely surprising. Justification for its continued use rests on a large body of clinical experience, disadvantages of other cardiac output monitoring systems, its ability to accurately measure pulmonary artery pressure, and the potential to use the catheter as a direct conduit for drug administration into the pulmonary artery.|$|E
