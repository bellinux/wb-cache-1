This article is open access. Melatonin has anticarcinogenic properties in experimental models. We undertook a case-cohort study of 928 Icelandic men without prostate cancer (PCa) nested within the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) -Reykjavik cohort to investigate the prospective association between first morning-void urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT 6 <b>s)</b> <b>levels</b> and the subsequent risk for PCa, under the hypothesis that men with lower aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> have an increased risk for advanced PCa. We used weighted Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between first morning-void aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> and PCa risk, adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 111 men were diagnosed with incident PCa, including 24 with advanced disease. Men who reported sleep problems at baseline had lower morning aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> compared with those who reported no sleep problems.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Whether high factor (F) VIII and low free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> are {{risk factors}} for {{arterial}} thrombosis is unclarified. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a post-hoc analysis of a single-centre retrospective family cohort, we determined if these two proteins could {{increase the risk of}} arterial thrombosis. In total, 1399 relatives were analysed. RESULTS: Annual incidence in relatives with high FVIII levels was 0. 29 % (95 %CI, 0. 22 - 0. 38) compared to 0. 13 % (95 %CI, 0. 09 - 0. 19) in relatives with normal FVIII levels. In relatives with low free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels,</b> this risk was 0. 26 % (95 %CI, 0. 16 - 0. 40), compared to 0. 14 % (95 %CI, 0. 10 - 0. 20) in relatives with normal free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels.</b> Mean FVIII levels adjusted for age and sex were 11 IU/dL, 18 IU/dL, and 21 IU/dL higher in relatives with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity as compared to relatives without these arterial thrombotic risk factors. Moreover, a dose response relation between increasing FVIII and body mass index was found. None of these associations were shown for free protein S. CONCLUSIONS: High FVIII and low free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> seemed to be mild {{risk factors for}} arterial thrombosis. High FVIII levels were particularly observed in relatives with traditional arterial thrombotic risk factors. Free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> were not influenced by these thrombotic risk factors.

40|$|In {{addition}} to productivity levels, living standards, {{as measured by}} GDP per capita, are determined by both average hours worked per person employed and the share of employment in the total population employed. In this article, Pierre Fortin from the University of Quebec at Montreal examines differences in annual work hours on a per capita basis between the United States and Canada. He finds that in 2001 average hours worked was lower in Canada (91 per cent of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>level),</b> while the employment/total population ratio was actually higher in Canada (103 per cent of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>level).</b> With output per hour in Canada 90 per cent of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>level,</b> the overall effect of these three variables was to produce a level of GDP per capita in Canada that was 85 per cent of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>level.</b> He also finds that Ontario in 2001 had enjoyed {{a higher level of}} GDP per capita than Quebec (86 per cent versus 77 per cent of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>level)</b> because of its greater average hours worked and higher employment/total population ratio, offset by a slightly lower productivity level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased {{circulating}} cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> {{have been}} linked to increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. However, whether cathepsin S is a modifiable risk factor is unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of a prudent diet on plasma cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> in healthy individuals. FINDINGS: Explorative analyses of a randomized study were performed in 88 normal to slightly overweight and hyperlipidemic men and women (aged 25 to 65) that were randomly assigned to ad libitum prudent diet, i. e. healthy Nordic diet (ND) or a control group (habitual Western diet) for 6  weeks. Whereas all foods in the ND were provided, the control group was advised to consume their habitual diet throughout the study. The ND was in line with dietary recommendations, e. g. low in saturated fats, sugars and salt, but high in plant-based foods rich in fibre and unsaturated fats. The ND significantly decreased cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> (from 20. 1 (+/- 4. 0 SD) to 19. 7  μg/L (+/- 4. 3 SD)) compared with control group (from 18. 2 (+/- 2. 9 SD) to 19. 1  μg/L (+/- 3. 8 SD)). This difference remained after adjusting for sex and change in insulin sensitivity (P[*]=[*] 0. 03), and near significant after adjusting for baseline cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> (P[*]=[*] 0. 06), but not for change in weight or LDL-C. Changes in cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> were directly correlated with change in LDL-C. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a habitual control diet, a provided ad libitum healthy Nordic diet decreased cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> in healthy individuals, possibly mediated by weight loss or lowered LDL-C. These differences between groups in cathepsin S were however not robust and therefore need further investigation...|$|R
