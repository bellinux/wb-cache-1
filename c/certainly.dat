5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they <b>certainly</b> are but true as natural history they as <b>certainly</b> are not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.|$|E
5|$|Alfred's Tower is a {{monument}} to the genius of English landscape, many of whose loveliest haunts it commands, and to a man who <b>certainly</b> deserves to be remembered as among the great benefactors of the English scene. - Christopher Hussey, Country Life, 11 June 1938.|$|E
5|$|Almost <b>certainly</b> {{a native}} of Angus, {{he appears to be}} a {{descendant}} of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William I of Scotland, through an illegitimate son whom Earl David settled in the area around Brechin.|$|E
5|$|At some point, {{possibly}} {{around this}} time, Montagu was killed; he was <b>certainly</b> dead before his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,' {{and in the}} thick of the fighting, rather than in the rout that later followed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{parties of}} the College of Cardinals were of almost an equal size. The party of Aymeric had 19 members, while that of his opponents 24, but {{the party of the}} Chancellor was <b>certainly</b> better organized.|$|E
5|$|<b>Certainly,</b> by the Roman period, Thinis {{had been}} supplanted as capital of its nome by Ptolemais, perhaps even {{as early as}} that city's {{foundation}} by Ptolemy I.|$|E
5|$|David {{was born}} on a date unknown in 1084 in Scotland. He was {{probably}} the eighth son of King Malcolm III, and <b>certainly</b> the sixth and youngest born by Malcolm's second wife, Margaret of Wessex. He was the grandson of the ill-fated King Duncan I.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae is {{a unique}} object, with no very close analogues {{currently}} known in any galaxy. Therefore, its future evolution is highly uncertain, but almost <b>certainly</b> involves further mass loss and an eventual supernova.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{very successful}} in providing a framework for accurate models which describe {{an impressive array of}} physical phenomena. On the other hand, there are many interesting open questions, and in particular, the theory as a whole is almost <b>certainly</b> incomplete.|$|E
5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the class of 1965, which also included Guy Chamberlain, Paddy Driscoll, Dan Fortmann, Otto Graham, Sid Luckman, and Bob Waterfield. He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm <b>certainly</b> glad to have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great honor to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will <b>certainly</b> bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E
5|$|I <b>certainly</b> don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history {{starting}} with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... <b>Certainly</b> something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
5|$|In 830, Ecgberht led a {{successful}} expedition against the Welsh, almost <b>certainly</b> {{with the intent}} of extending West Saxon influence into the Welsh lands previously within the Mercian orbit. This marked the high point of Ecgberht's influence.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating the instruments used, {{and the problem of}} spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost <b>certainly</b> present.|$|E
5|$|Monday, 16 August 1819, {{was a hot}} summer's day, with a {{cloudless}} blue sky. The fine weather almost <b>certainly</b> {{increased the}} size of the crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.|$|E
5|$|Of Thomas Quiney's fate {{the records}} show little. It is speculated {{that he may}} have died in 1662 or 1663 when the parish burial records are incomplete. He <b>certainly</b> had a nephew in London, who by this time held the lease to The Cage.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman {{artillery}} was <b>certainly</b> {{introduced by}} Sultan Mehmed I, the first contemporary record which mention the Ottoman cannons is dated back to 1424, it {{is related to}} the defending of Antalya.|$|E
5|$|Romanus {{died before}} 627, {{probably}} about 625. He {{drowned in the}} Mediterranean Sea off Italy while {{on a mission to}} Rome for Justus. Presumably this happened before Justus' death in 627. He was <b>certainly</b> dead by 633, when Paulinus of York became bishop at Rochester after fleeing Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess <b>certainly</b> began a long American {{tradition}} of romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, {{who was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, {{but it can be}} criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.|$|E
5|$|The bust of Nefertiti is {{believed}} to have been crafted about 1345BC by the sculptor Thutmose. The bust does not have any inscriptions, but can be <b>certainly</b> identified as Nefertiti by the characteristic crown, which she wears in other surviving (and clearly labelled) depictions, for example the 'house altar'.|$|E
5|$|The club's record home {{attendance}} is 23,002, for an FA Cup match against QPR on 10 January 1948, a record which will almost <b>certainly</b> never be broken unless the club relocates {{to a larger}} ground, given that Priestfield Stadium's current capacity is approximately half that figure.|$|E
5|$|The college survived {{until it}} {{disappeared}} or was dissolved, <b>certainly</b> before 1361–1362, and probably {{as early as}} 1246 or even 1212 (as mentioned above).|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they <b>certainly</b> cannot be attributed to an attempt to match {{the lay of the}} river bed. The differences however could point to the repeated use of differently-sized falsework structures {{in the construction of the}} barrel vaults (see animation below).|$|E
5|$|Though opened, {{this initial}} road was almost impassable, and <b>certainly</b> dangerous. Despite this, it quickly gained notoriety for its breathtaking scenery and {{seemingly}} limitless {{hunting and fishing}} potential.|$|E
5|$|While not as {{well known}} as Mortification, fellow Australian band, Vomitorial Corpulence was widely known as the first Christian grindcore band. The band had minor success but <b>certainly</b> helped the Extreme metal side of Christian metal.|$|E
25|$|Though Jaspers was <b>certainly</b> {{indebted to}} Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, he also owes much to more {{traditional}} philosophers, especially Kant and Plato. Walter Kaufmann argues in From Shakespeare to Existentialism that, though Jaspers was <b>certainly</b> indebted to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, he was closest to Kant's philosophy.|$|E
25|$|L: Well, Mr. President, {{that is your}} decision, <b>certainly.</b> I cannot {{advise you}} {{one way or the}} other. But as I've said, if I can ever be of any {{assistance}} in looking after your security, I would <b>certainly</b> do so.|$|E
25|$|To his Companions, a Complaint of Slanders, viii. (<b>certainly</b> spurious).|$|E
25|$|Recycling of some raw {{materials}} would almost <b>certainly</b> be necessary.|$|E
25|$|Because Manet {{was almost}} <b>certainly</b> not left-handed, the {{painting}} is a mirror image.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} {{system was}} published perhaps {{as early as}} 801 but <b>certainly</b> by the year 952.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts <b>certainly</b> {{began in}} the early 12th century, however {{information}} on them remains very scarce.|$|E
25|$|This {{battle was}} almost <b>certainly</b> the {{first use of}} carpet bombing against a {{military}} target.|$|E
25|$|Snorri's {{source for}} this {{information}} was almost <b>certainly</b> Grímnismál, where the following strophes are found.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth of Hungary {{was almost}} <b>certainly</b> the {{inspiration}} for the character Elizabeth in Richard Wagner's opera Tannhauser.|$|E
25|$|Tlatilco archaeological {{evidence}} reveal the social development of that culture, {{prior to the}} Teotihuacan, Toltec, Chichimeca, and <b>certainly</b> the Aztec.|$|E
25|$|The task is <b>certainly</b> not easy, {{but it is}} {{no longer}} a {{question}} of shirking it, given the current situation.|$|E
