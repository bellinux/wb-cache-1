5|$|Ascetic {{practices}} (tapas), <b>concentration</b> <b>and</b> bodily postures used by Vedic {{priests to}} conduct yajna (sacrifice), {{might have been}} precursors to yoga. Vratya, a group of ascetics mentioned in the Atharvaveda, emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic asanas. Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the keśin, and vratyas. Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas (texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the Atharvaveda. Nasadiya Sukta of the Rig Veda suggests {{the presence of an}} early contemplative tradition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, both {{mountain}} detachments had completed mobilisation and <b>concentration,</b> <b>and</b> were in position. Detachment Lika was at its mobilisation centre, but the turn-out of men for its infantry component was low. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was completing its concentration. A large proportion of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was moving from its mobilisation centres to its concentration areas. Across the 7th Army, around 80 percent of troops had answered the mobilisation order, but only 45 to 50 percent of vehicles and animals were available.|$|E

He underwent a heart bypass in 1996 and survived a pulmonary embolism the following year.|$|E
40|$|Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) and total {{dissolved}} amino acids (TDAA) were measured in high (Chukchi Sea) and low (Beaufort Sea) productivity {{regions of the}} western Arctic Ocean to investigate the composition and bioavailability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). <b>Concentrations</b> <b>and</b> DOC-normalized yields of TDAA in Chukchi surface waters were relatively high, indicating an accumulation of bioavailable DOM. High <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> yields of TDAA were also observed in the upper halocline of slope and basin waters, indicating off-shelf transport of bioavailable DOM from the Chukchi Sea. In contrast, <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> yields of TDAA in Beaufort surface waters were relatively low, indicting DOM was of limited bioavailability. <b>Concentrations</b> <b>and</b> yields of TDAA in the upper halocline of slope and basin waters were also low, suggesting the Beaufort {{is not a major}} source of bioavailable DOM to slope and basin waters. In shelf waters of both systems, elevated <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> yields of TDAA were often observed in waters with higher chlorophyll <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> productivity. Surface <b>concentrations</b> of DOC were similar (p > 0. 05) in the two systems despite the contrasting productivity, but <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> yields of TDAA were significantly higher (p < 0. 0001) in the Chukchi than in the Beaufort. Unlike bulk DOC, TDAA <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> yields reflect ecosystem productivity in the western Arctic. The occurrence of elevated bioavailable DOM concentrations in the Chukchi Sea implies an uncoupling between the biological production and utilization of DOM and has important implications for sustaining heterotrophic microbial growth and diversity in oligotrophic waters of the central Arctic basins...|$|R

5|$|Generally, {{exposure}} to ambient Mn air concentrations {{in excess of}} 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn <b>concentration</b> <b>and</b> attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The <b>concentration</b> <b>and</b> amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{requirements}} for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient mass to sustain it.

5|$|Samarium salts stimulate metabolism, but it {{is unclear}} whether this is the effect of {{samarium}} or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50µg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8µg/L being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable <b>concentration</b> <b>and</b> therefore is normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.|$|E

40|$|Alpha 1 -acid {{glycoprotein}} (AAG) <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> propranolol binding {{were investigated}} in the serum of elderly hospitalized patients with acute illness, and healthy elderly and young subjects. Significantly greater AAG <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> reduced unbound propranolol fraction {{were observed in}} the elderly with acute disease compared to the elderly controls. The greatest changes (up to five-fold) occurred with cancer, with lesser changes associated with myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease, acute infection, heart failure, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and cerebrovascular accident. Various miscellaneous conditions were also associated with high AAG <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> enhanced propranolol binding. The healthy elderly had higher AAG <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> lower unbound propranolol fractions than the healthy young group. Overall there was a highly significant correlation between the propranolol binding ratio (bound/free) and the serum AAG concentration. These {{results suggest that the}} elderly population may be particularly susceptible to changes in AAG <b>concentrations,</b> <b>and</b> that during acute illness interpretation of serum concentrations of drugs which bind mainly to AAG, may require knowledge of their free fractions...|$|R

5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the <b>concentration</b> <b>and</b> ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol <b>concentration</b> <b>and</b> the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Living Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus {{micro-organisms}} {{have been}} found in Lake Vostok's deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species. This suggests the presence of a deep biosphere utilizing a geothermal system of the bedrock encircling the subglacial lake. There is optimism that microbial life in the lake may be possible despite high pressure, constant cold, low nutrient input, potentially high oxygen <b>concentration</b> <b>and</b> an absence of sunlight. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may also harbor lakes or oceans below a thick crust of ice. Any confirmation of life in Lake Vostok could strengthen the prospect for the presence of life on icy moons.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high <b>concentration,</b> <b>and</b> is normally used only for preparation.
