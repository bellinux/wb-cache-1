40|$|Building in of <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> {{is a broad}} term in {{the civil}} {{engineering}} that we come up against at every turn. In this thesis, we are only describing <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> for building info the roads. Road construction is considered {{as one of the}} more challenging and complex projects where it is necessary to pay {{a lot of attention to}} choosing the suitable materials, methods of building in and proper <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> that meet the project requirements. We must be aware of the fact that the right selection and correct building of <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> represent basic conditions for safe driving on the roads. In the thesis, we are describing specific <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> for building as well as the right methods of construction. In addition to that, the construction is shown with videos. For the majority of the <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> manufacturers already provide adequate documentation in written form or in the form of short video clips. The aim of my thesis is to collect and publish documentation for building in the <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> on the internet and therefore unable updating the material collected by the users of the website. Due to the fact that the video clips are recorded at building sites in different circumstances, it is understandable that all the works are not going according to provisions prescribed by the manufacturers. A Slovenian saying goes: “We learn from our mistakes. ” As a result of this thesis, we have introduced certain errors that commonly occur while building in the elements. I hope that my work will contribute to the right building in of <b>construction</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

50|$|Business {{simulation}} games, {{also known}} as economic simulation games or tycoon games, are games {{that focus on the}} management of economic processes, usually {{in the form of a}} business. Pure business simulations have been described as construction and management simulations without a <b>construction</b> <b>element,</b> and can thus be called management simulations. Indeed, micromanagement is often emphasized in these kinds of games. They are essentially numeric, but try to hold the player's attention by using creative graphics. The interest in these games lies in accurate simulation of real-world events using algorithms, as well as the close tying of players' actions to expected or plausible consequences and outcomes. An important facet of economic simulations is the emergence of artificial systems, gameplay and structures.|$|E

50|$|The {{engineering}} {{study of}} every reinforced concrete construction, {{whether it is}} a building, a bridge, a bearing wall or other structure, predicts the positioning of steel rebars at specific positions in the volume of concrete (predicted concrete cover of steel reinforcement bars). This cover typically varies between 10 and 100 mm. The statics of every concrete construction are designed {{in such a way that}} steel and concrete properties are combined in order to achieve the maximum possible strength for the particular construction (e.g. anti-earthquake protection) as well as to prevent the long-term corrosion of steel that would weaken the construction. Rebar spacers secure the correct position of steel, thus assisting in the practical application of the theoretical specifications of concrete construction. The cover of the steel of a particular <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> (for example in a concrete slab or a beam) should be generally uniform within the element.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, {{a modernist}} {{industrial}} movement, Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) {{had been created}} in Munich in 1907 by Hermann Muthesius, a prominent architectural commentator. Its goal was to bring together designers and industrialists, to turn out well-designed, high quality products, {{and in the process}} to invent a new type of architecture. The organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms, but quickly expanded. The architects include Peter Behrens, Theodor Fischer (who served as its first president), Josef Hoffmann and Richard Riemerschmid. In 1909 Behrens designed one of the earliest and most influential industrial buildings in the modernist style, the AEG turbine factory, a functional monument of steel and concrete. In 1911-1913, Adolf Meyer and Walter Gropius, who had both worked for Behrens, built another revolutionary industrial plant, the Fagus factory in Alfeld an der Leine, a building without ornament where every <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> was on display. The Werkbund organized a major exposition of modernist design in Cologne just {{a few weeks before the}} outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

40|$|Abstract. The {{technologies}} for low-quantity production of sheet metal components and parts are applied mostly for thin single metal sheets. However, such technologies {{could also be}} applied as an additional procedure in multi-layer <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> production. Such individually produced construction elements must correspond to required standards, which are usually applied in serial production. Due to the immense testing work expected by custom-made production, {{it is reasonable to}} develop a methodology that would be capable of predicting the required results of an individually designed and produced construction block quickly, effectively and with minimal costs. In this investigation, a method of predicting the load capacity behavior of individual construction elements performed by incremental forming as an additional technology in multi-layer <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> production is presented. Special attention is dedicated to the definition of finite element model of a standardized four-point bending test and its correlation to real experimental results...|$|E
