5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began {{to adapt to the}} changed economic situation. The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply. Labourers could <b>charge</b> <b>more</b> for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|If the {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} two interacting bodies {{is affected by the}} presence of one another, covalent interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed. Ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency. Conversely, covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial ionic character. The circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be understood using Fajans' rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most ionic character will have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with a high <b>charge.</b> <b>More</b> generally HSAB theory can be applied, whereby the compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation. This difference in electronegativities means that the charge separation, and resulting dipole moment, is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess electrons on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).|$|E

25|$|The bank {{offered the}} first {{debentures}} in Canadian banking history on May 29, 1967. The Bank Act of 1967 {{ushered in a}} period of enormous change on the Canadian financial scene. For the first time, banks were permitted to <b>charge</b> <b>more</b> than six-percent interest on loans, encouraging a new emphasis on personal and specialized consumer loans. More significantly, banks could now make mortgage loans on real estate and the mortgage loan portfolio quickly gained enormous significance.|$|E

This was driven by a greater use of specialist doctors, who charge 3-6 times more in the U.S. than in peer countries.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of trained}} {{military}} {{was one of}} the most pressing difficulties of the revolutionary government in Buenos Aires. Besides the Patricios Regiment and other corps formed during the British invasions, the only troops with some experience were the Blandengues, lancers militia recruited to patrol the borders of the territories still controlled by indigenous people (mapuche and ranquel). Until 1812, with the arrival of veterans from the Napoleonic Wars, that would join as officers, the army was basically a militia. Most of the commanders were civilians or junior officers, put in <b>charge</b> <b>more</b> for their political leanings, status in society or charisma than for their military capacity.|$|E

25|$|Paley changed broadcasting's {{business}} model {{not only by}} developing successful and lucrative broadcast programming but also by viewing the advertisers (sponsors) as the most significant element of the broadcasting equation. Paley provided network programming to affiliate stations at a nominal cost, thereby ensuring the widest possible distribution for both the programming and the advertising. The advertisers then became the network's primary clients and, because of the wider distribution brought by the growing network, Paley was able to <b>charge</b> <b>more</b> for the ad time. Affiliates were required to carry programming offered by the network {{for part of the}} broadcast day, receiving a portion of the network's fees from advertising revenue. At other times in the broadcast day, affiliates were free to offer local programming and sell advertising time locally.|$|E
25|$|CBS alienated and {{confused}} fans with its sporadic treatment of regular season telecasts. With {{a sense of}} true continuity destroyed, fans eventually figured {{that they could not}} count on the network to satisfy their needs (thus, poor ratings were a result). CBS televised about 16 regular season Saturday afternoon games (not counting back-up telecasts) which was 14 less than what NBC televised during the previous contract. According to Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, the reason for the reduction in regular season telecasts was in order for teams to sell them locally {{in order to make a}} direct profit. CBS used the strategy of broadcasting only a select amount of games in order to build a demand in response to supposedly sagging ratings. In theory, the limited regular season package would require the network to sell less advertising during the year so it can <b>charge</b> <b>more</b> for its postseason events.|$|E

40|$|The pricing {{of health}} {{products}} {{in the developing world}} has become a center of controversy among policymakers, with important implications for the efficient targeting of social programs more generally. A key issue in this debate is whether higher purchase prices lead to more intensive product use and, therefore, greater health benefits. We present results from an experiment in Lusaka, Zambia, designed to test whether <b>charging</b> <b>more</b> for a home water purification solution results in more use of the product. Our methodology separates the screening effect of prices (<b>charging</b> <b>more</b> changes the mix of buyers) from the causal effect of prices (<b>charging</b> <b>more</b> stimulates greater use for a given buyer). We find that higher prices screen out less intensive users of the product. High prices do not cause greater product use than low prices for a given buyer, but {{there is some evidence that}} the act of paying increases use. Our estimates imply that positive prices may be optimal even if maximizing use is the sole objective...|$|R

500|$|Industry {{was slow}} to take hold, and by {{the second half of}} the 18th century, Cogglesford Mill was the only working corn mill in the town. An old mill at the {{junction}} of Westgate and Castle Causeway supplied hemp to the growing rope-making business of the Foster and Hill families. As local historian Simon Pawley wrote, [...] "in many respects, things had changed little [...] since the survey of 1692", with few of the buildings or infrastructure being improved. Major changes to agriculture and industry took place in the last decade of that century. From the Middle Ages, Sleaford was surrounded by three open fields: North, West and Sleaford Fields. At the enclosure of the open fields in 1794 more than 90% of the 1,096acres of open land was owned by Lord Bristol. Despite the costs of fencing and re-organising the fields, the system was easier to farm, and cottages were built closer to fields, while the landowner could <b>charge</b> <b>more</b> rent owing to the increased profitability of the land; those who lost out were the cottagers, who could no longer keep a few animals grazing on the common land at no cost. The process allowed the land boundaries and pathways to be tidied up; Drove Lane, which ran to Rauceby, was shifted north and straightened.|$|E
