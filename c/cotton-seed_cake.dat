40|$|Some organic {{amendments}} were ’screened for toxicity to the infective {{stages of}} the reniform (Rotylenchulus reniformis) and citrus (Tylenchulus semipenetrans) nematodes. Pigeon droppings, poul,try droppings and <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>cake</b> were highly toxic, while rice straw, sheep dung and horse dung were low in toxicity. The effectiveness of tested materials deteriorated after a ten-dày decomposition period. Chemical analysis revealed that acetic, propionic and butyric were the dominant low molecular weight fatty acids, while isovaleric and valeric volatile fatty acids were lower in amounts and even absent from some amendments. Phenols were present in organic amendments, especially higher in the plant-origin forms. GLC showed that hydrogen,. hydrogen sulfide and methane evolved from tested materials a t different levels. In toxicological studies, the three dominant fatty acids, phenol and fermented gasses appeared nematotoxic. The LD,, values of acetic, propionic and butyric acids for reniform nematode were 135, 520 and 270 ppm, respec-tively; and 120, 200 and 64 ppm on citrus nematode, respectively. The LD,, obtained with phenol on the infecting ’ stages of reniform and citrus nematodes was 150 and 120 ppm, respectively. Lethal gasses from pigeon droppings, poultry droppings and the nematicide DBCP were lethal to immature females of R. reniformis, but were not toxic from sheep dung, horse dung, rice straw and <b>Cotton-seed</b> <b>cake.</b> The organic compounds found in these fertilizers and amendments {{may account for the}} nematicidal activity displayed by tested organic amendments...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel {{production}} from <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>cake</b> (CSC) and the pretreatment {{of the remaining}} biomass for dark fermentative hydrogen production was investigated. The direct conversion to biodiesel with alkali free fatty acids neutralization pretreatment and alkali transesterification resulted in a biodiesel with high esters content and physicochemical properties fulfilling the EN-standards. Blends of cotton-seed oil methyl esters (CME) and diesel showed an improvement in lubricity and cetane number. Moreover, CME showed good compatibility with commercial biodiesel additives. On the basis of conversion of the remaining CSC to sugars fermentable towards hydrogen, the optimal conditions included removal of the oil of CSC and pretreatment at 10 % NaOH (w/w dry matter). The extreme thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus showed good hydrogen production, 84 – 112 % of the control, from NaOH-pretreated CSC and low hydrogen production, 15 – 20 % of the control, from the oil-rich and not chemically pretreated CSC, and from Ca(OH) 2 -pretreated CSC...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{conception}} of argument structure developed in Hale and Keyser (1993, 1995) sets {{a limit on}} the range of syntactic configurations which can be posited for the double-object construction headed by verbs of the type represented in (1) : (1) (a) She gave her daughter a book. (b) He sent her a telegram. (c) I feed my horse <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>cake.</b> (d) I wrote my love a letter. However, while the range of syntactic structures which might be assigned to these sentences is limited, {{it is by no}} means obvious what the correct structure is, or even if there is in fact just one. Be this as it may, we will assume here that the the double-object construction is subject to the same constraints as lexical argument structures in general. Using x to symbolize a lexical head, y a complement, and z a specifier (required to complete a "lexical predication"), the structures projected by basic lexical elements (heads) are defined in terms of just two relations [...] -Head-Complement, and Specifier-Head...|$|E

30|$|Pressed seed cakes, spent earth, and {{agricultural}} wastes from biodiesel crops are also residues from the biodiesel production. Pressed seed cakes are the seed biomass leftover from oil extraction. This solid residue is normally {{used as an}} organic amendment, animal feed, or is composted (Varanda et al. 2011). Recently, seed cakes have been evaluated for hydrogen generation. Lopes et al. 2015 used dark fermentation to produce hydrogen from pretreated and untreated jatropha seed cake. The highest specific bio-hydrogen yield (68.2  mL H 2 /g VS) was achieved using 2.5  g VS of untreated jatropha seed cake; however, the largest cumulative concentration was achieved with 10 g VS (Lopes et al. 2015). Likewise, Panagiotopoulos et al. (2013) evaluated dark fermentation of <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>cake.</b> Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus produced significantly higher hydrogen yield (84 – 112  %) than the control. However, hydrogen was only generated when the <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>cake</b> was pretreated with NaOH (10  %) (Panagiotopoulos et al. 2013). In a different approach, seed cakes {{have been used in}} solid-state fermentation to produce edible fungus and enzymes (Veerabhadrappa et al. 2014; da Luz et al. 2013). da Luz et al. (2013) described the production of the edible fungus Pleurotus ostreatus from jatropha seed cake; this fungal strain degraded the antinutritional factors in the jatropha seed cake (da Luz et al. 2013). Similarly, Veerabhadrappa et al. (2014) reported proteases and lipases from Aspergillus versicolor CJS- 98 in the solid-state fermentation of jatropha seed cake. The fermentation of jatropha seed cake with medium supplementation (maltose and peptone 2  %), 40  % moisture, and 25  °C produced maximum amount of proteases (3366  U/g) and lipases (1288  U/g) and removed jatropha seed cake anti-nutrients (Veerabhadrappa et al. 2014). Pressed seed cakes {{and agricultural}} wastes from biodiesel crops have also been studied for activated carbon production (Foo and Hameed 2009; Nunes et al. 2009). Activated carbons from biofuel solid residues are produced via thermochemical conversion, in a two-step process: first, the removal of residual oil and second, the thermochemical activation using temperatures between 600 and 800  °C under constant N 2 flow (Nunes et al. 2009). From the biofuel agricultural residues, it is possible to produce low-cost activated carbons with wide superficial area and good uptake capacity; however, {{more research is needed to}} develop an activated carbon which can be applied in water purification or wastewater treatments (Foo and Hameed 2009).|$|E
