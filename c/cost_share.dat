Increase in patient medication <b>cost</b> <b>share</b> {{was found to be}} associated with low adherence to medication. The United States is among the countries with the highest prices of prescription drugs which is one of factors leading to the high healthcare costs. This is mainly attributed to the government's lack of ability to negotiate lower prices with monopolies in the pharmaceutical industry especially with the brand name drugs. In order to manage the medication costs, many patients on long term therapies fail to fill their prescription or skip or reduce doses. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2015, approximately three quarters (73%) of the public think the drug prices are unreasonable and blame pharmaceutical companies for setting prices so high. In the same report, half of the public reported that they are taking prescription drugs and “quarter (25%) of those currently taking prescription medicine report they or a family member have not filled a prescription in the past 12 months due to cost, and 18 percent report cutting pills in half or skipping doses”. In comparison to Canada, only 8% of adults reported to have skipped their doses or not filling their prescriptions due to the cost of their prescribed medications.|$|E

40|$|Under a contract, {{agents are}} not only held to honor the {{allocation}} as prescribed by a <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanism but also a full description of allocated units and costs once production falls short. For agents leaving the <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> problem by taking their demanded units and prepaying the corresponding bill, a contract allows for a reformulation of the <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> problem to serve the remaining agents. Consistency requires invariance of <b>cost</b> <b>shares</b> relative to any such reduced <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> problem.

40|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>Sharing</b> or {{matching}} is {{the funding}} or costs contributed or allocated to a sponsored project or program not {{borne by the}} sponsor. <b>Cost</b> <b>sharing</b> can be required by law, regulation or administrative decision of a Federal agency or other sponsor. <b>Cost</b> <b>sharing</b> requirements vary by sponsor and between grants from the same sponsor. Funding agencies believe that <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> reflects: a grantee’s interest in or commitment to the sponsored research or, the potential benefits derived by the grantee beyond the reimbursable costs on the grant. Generally, <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> is applicable to grants and cooperative agreements but not usually to contracts on the Federal level. This is because grants and cooperative agreements represent financial assistance rather than the acquisition {{of goods and services}} required by contracts.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} <b>sharing</b> the <b>cost</b> {{of a common}} {{infrastructure}} among a set of strategic and cooperating players {{has been the subject}} of intensive research in recent years. However, most of these studies consider cooperative <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games in an offline setting, i. e., the mechanism knows all players and their respective input data in advance. In this paper, we consider cooperative <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games in an online setting: Upon the arrival of a new player, the mechanism has to take instantaneous and irreversible decisions without any knowledge about players that arrive in the future. We propose an online model for general demand <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games and give a complete characterization of both weakly group-strategyproof and group-strategyproof online <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanisms for this model. Moreover, we present a simple method to derive incremental online <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanisms from online algorithms such that the competitive ratio is preserved. Based on our general results, we develop online <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanisms for several binary demand and general demand <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games. ...|$|R
