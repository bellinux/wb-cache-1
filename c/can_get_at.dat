500|$|Leslie and Ron visit Chris' apartment, where Leslie discovers a woman's razor and a pink {{swimming}} cap in the bathroom. [...] Upon hearing this, Ann {{decides to}} drive up to Indianapolis to confront Chris. To Ron's horror, Charles Mulligan's has been shut down by the health department, so Chris invites everyone back to his place for food. To Ron's further horror, Chris prepares vegetarian dishes, and Ron nearly passes out {{as he had been}} starving himself with the expectation of eating at Mulligan's. At the launch party, Tom approaches Dennis, who insults [...] "Tommy Fresh" [...] and quickly dismisses Tom. Ben cheers him up and tells him not to give up on his dreams, admitting that he considers Tom his friend. Ben is happy when it is apparent that the parks department feels the same way. Andy and April, who are both broke, hold a contest to see how much free stuff they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>at</b> the party, earning $218 by posing as staff and accepting tips. However, they both feel guilty and give the money to the bartender.|$|E
500|$|Most schools {{operated}} {{with the}} goal of providing students with the vocational training and social skills required to obtain employment and integrate into Canadian society after graduation. In actuality, these goals were poorly and inconsistently achieved. Many graduates were unable to land a job due to poor educational training. Returning home was equally challenging due to an unfamiliarity with their culture and, in some cases, an inability to communicate with family members using their traditional language. Instead of intellectual achievement and advancement, it was often physical appearance and dress, like that of middle class, urban teenagers, or the promotion of a Christian ethic, that was used as a sign of successful assimilation. There was no indication that school attendees achieved greater financial success {{than those who did not}} go to school. As the father of a pupil who attended Battleford Industrial School, in Saskatchewan, for five years explained: [...] "he cannot read, speak or write English, nearly all his time having been devoted to herding and caring for cattle instead of learning a trade or being otherwise educated. Such employment he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>at</b> home." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna has {{received}} acclaim {{as a role}} model for businesswomen in her industry, [...] "achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry", and generating over $1.2billion in sales within the first decade of her career. Professor Colin Barrow from Cranfield School of Management described Madonna as [...] "America's smartest businesswoman... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself." [...] London Business School academics called her a [...] "dynamic entrepreneur" [...] worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. Morton wrote that [...] "Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless—somebody who won't stop until she gets what she wants—and that's something you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>at</b> the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But that hardly mattered to her." [...] Hazel Blackmore and Rafael Fernández de Castro in the book ¿Qué es Estados Unidos? from the Fondo de Cultura Económica, noted: [...] "Madonna has been undoubtedly the most important woman in the history of popular music and a great businesswoman in herself; creating fashion, breaking taboos and provoking controversies." [...] According to Forbes, Madonna is the wealthiest woman in the music business.|$|E

2500|$|Imperial {{and provincial}} {{government}} bureaucracies attempted to Germanise the state's national minorities situated near {{the borders of}} the empire: the Danes in the North, the Francophones in the West and Poles in the East. As minister president of Prussia and as imperial chancellor, Bismarck [...] "sorted people into their linguistic [...] ‘tribes’", however, he pursued a policy of hostility in particular toward the Poles, which was an expedient rooted in Prussian history. [...] "He never had a Pole among his peasants" [...] working the Bismarckian estates; it was the educated Polish bourgeoisie and revolutionaries he denounced from personal experience, and [...] "because of them he disliked intellectuals in politics." [...] Bismarck’s antagonism is revealed in a private letter to his sister in 1861: [...] "Hammer the Poles until they despair of living [...] I have all the sympathy in the world for their situation, but if we want to exist {{we have no choice but}} to wipe them out: wolves are only what God made them, but we shoot them all the same when we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>at</b> them." [...] Later that year, the public Bismarck modified his belligerence and wrote to Prussia’s foreign minister: [...] "Every success of the Polish national movement is a defeat for Prussia, we cannot carry on the fight against this element according to the rules of civil justice, but only in accordance with the rules of war." [...] With Polish nationalism the ever-present menace, Bismarck preferred expulsion rather than Germanisation.|$|E
