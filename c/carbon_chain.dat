5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The <b>carbon</b> <b>chain,</b> typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
25|$|A {{double bond}} may exhibit {{one of two}} {{possible}} configurations: trans or cis. In trans configuration, the <b>carbon</b> <b>chain</b> extends from {{opposite sides of the}} double bond, whereas, in cis configuration, the <b>carbon</b> <b>chain</b> extends from {{the same side of the}} double bond. The trans molecule is a straighter molecule. The cis molecule is bent.|$|E

30|$|Additionally, {{the detail}} {{transport}} mechanism of 10 -carbon chain of fatty acids was still debatable. Shorter <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> of fatty acids are transported by diffusion; however, longer <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> could be transported by either freely or by mediation of some protein (Hettema and Tabak 2000).

25|$|Solvent: Hydroxyl groups (-OH), {{found in}} alcohols, are polar and {{therefore}} hydrophilic (water loving) but their <b>carbon</b> <b>chain</b> portion is non-polar which make them hydrophobic. The molecule increasingly becomes overall more nonpolar and therefore less soluble in the polar water as the <b>carbon</b> <b>chain</b> becomes longer. Methanol has the shortest <b>carbon</b> <b>chain</b> of all alcohols (one carbon atom) followed by ethanol (two carbon atoms.) Alcohols have applications in industry and science as reagents or solvents. Because of its relatively low toxicity {{compared with other}} alcohols and ability to dissolve non-polar substances, ethanol {{can be used as}} a solvent in medical drugs, perfumes, and vegetable essences such as vanilla. In organic synthesis, alcohols serve as versatile intermediates.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} X-ray {{photoelectron}} (XPS) and valence band (VB) spectroscopy measurements of surfactant-free silver nanoparticles and silver/linear <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> (Ag@LCC) structures prepared by pulse laser ablation (PLA) in water. Our measurements demonstrate significant oxidation {{only on the}} surfaces of the silver nanoparticles with many covalent carbon-silver bonds but only negligible traces of carbon-oxygen bonds. Theoretical modeling also provides evidence {{of the formation of}} robust carbon-silver bonds between linear <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> and pure and partially oxidized silver surfaces. A comparison of theoretical and experimental electronic structures also provides evidence of the presence of non-oxidized linear <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> on silver surfaces. To evaluate the chemical stability, we investigated the energetics of the physical adsorption of oxidative species (water and oxygen) and found that this adsorption is much preferrable on oxidized or pristine silver surfaces than the adsorption of linear <b>carbon</b> <b>chains,</b> which makes the initial step in the oxidation of LCC energetically unfavorable.

40|$|Linear {{chains of}} about 10 - 13 carbon atoms were {{predicted}} {{to be the}} most favorable phase on different metal surfaces prior to graphene nucleation. However, unlike the graphene that widely studied both theoretically and experimentally, <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> on metal surfaces were not directly studied by STM yet. Here we fill in the gap and report on STM experiments of linear <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> synthesized on Ni(111) through on-surface coupling of dehydrogenated propene molecules. Identification of chains was supported with DFT calculations and the proposed models consist of 12 carbon atoms, possibly covered by hydrogen atoms. Heating to 580 K leads to dramatic decrease of <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> and new phase appearance - graphene nucleus coexisted with nickel carbide. After flash annealing to 773 K (temperature of graphene synthesis), a small number of chains were presented on the Ni(111) surface, together with graphene islands and nickel carbide.

25|$|The polymer of methyl acrylate, PMA or poly(methyl acrylate), {{is similar}} to poly(methyl methacrylate), except {{for the lack of}} methyl groups on the {{backbone}} <b>carbon</b> <b>chain.</b> PMA is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than PMMA because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{hydroxyl}} group makes the alcohol molecule polar. Those groups can form hydrogen bonds {{to one another}} and to other compounds (except in certain large molecules where the hydroxyl is protected by steric hindrance of adjacent groups). This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as protic solvents. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and the tendency of the <b>carbon</b> <b>chain</b> to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water because the {{hydroxyl group}} wins out over the short <b>carbon</b> <b>chain.</b> Butanol, with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons such as pentanol and higher are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance. All simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents.|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} that a Raman {{scattering}} (RS) peak around 1870 cm− 1 was produced by the annealing of the X-ray irradiated film of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) at 450 oC. The intensity of 1870 -cm− 1 peak showed a maximum at the probe energy of 2. 3 eV for the RS spectroscopy with various probe lasers. Both the peak position and the probe-energy dependence were almost identical {{to those of the}} one-dimensional <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> previously reported in multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Consequently, we concluded that the 1870 -cm− 1 peak found in the present study is attributed to <b>carbon</b> <b>chains.</b> The formation of <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> by the annealing at temperature lower than 500 oC is firstly reported by the present study.

By DFT calculations, we further extend those findings to sp <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> end-capped by other organic structures.

50|$|Most {{hydrocarbon}} plants are not trees, however, so this technique of tapping {{the tree is}} no longer feasible. Instead of tapping thetree, the hydrocarbons are extracted using various organic solvents. This process is especially useful with single-cell algae, suchas Botryococcus braunii. This algae has two forms, both of which live in brackish water. The first form is a red algae thatproduces odd-numbered <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> roughly 25-31 atoms inlength. These <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> usually do not possess {{a large number of}} double bonds. Thesecond type of Botryococcus braunii is green and produces even-numbered <b>carbon</b> <b>chains</b> that are between 34 and 38 carbons long, withmany double bonds present.

25|$|Acyclic {{aliphatic}} aldehydes {{are named}} as derivatives {{of the longest}} <b>carbon</b> <b>chain</b> containing the aldehyde group.

25|$|Ether {{molecules}} cannot form {{hydrogen bonds}} with each other, resulting in relatively low boiling points {{compared to those}} of the analogous alcohols.

25|$|Ethanol is a volatile, colorless liquid {{that has}} a slight odor. It burns with a {{smokeless}} blue flame that is not always visible in normal light.
