5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the <b>city-state</b> conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the <b>city-state</b> to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E

The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation.|$|R

2500|$|Traditionally, the Yoruba people viewed {{themselves}} as the inhabitants of a united empire, {{in contrast to the}} situation today, in which [...] "Yoruba" [...] is the cultural-linguistic designation for speakers of a language in the Niger–Congo family. The name comes from a Hausa word to refer to the Oyo Empire. The first Yoruba state was Ile-Ife, said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first oni Oduduwa. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different <b>city-states</b> of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba obas, or kings. Yoruba <b>city-states</b> were usually governed by an oba and a iwarefa, a council of chiefs who advised the oba. by the 18th century, the Yoruba <b>city-states</b> formed a loose confederation, with the Oni of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual <b>city-states</b> became more powerful with their obas assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the Oni of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the <b>city-states.</b>|$|R

Sogdian was also prominent in the oasis <b>city-state</b> of Turfan in the Tarim Basin region of Northwest China (in modern Xinjiang). Judging by the Sogdian Bugut inscription of Mongolia written c. 581, the Sogdian language was also an official language of the Turkic Khaganate established by the Gokturks.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the <b>city-state</b> of Athens. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only inasmuch as it provided a source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E

5|$|The protagonist is Rush Sykes, an 18-year-old Mitra {{boy from}} a {{peaceful}} island. His 14-year-old sister, Irina, is kidnapped {{at the start}} of the game, and finding her is Rush's impetus for leaving the island. He meets and joins David Nassau, the 19-year-old Mitra ruler of the <b>city-state</b> of Athlum, and his four generals: the 41-year-old Mitra Emma Honeywell, the 24-year-old Yama Blocter, the 55-year-old Qsiti Pagus and the 200-year-old Sovani Torgal. These characters can be joined by more than a hundred of other characters, many of whom are found through quests, while others can be hired at guilds. Every character has their own name and skillset, though the main characters have special additional skills. The main villain is the Conqueror, a Mitra who during the course of the game attacks many city-states of the world with his army. He is assisted in regard, first in secret and then openly, by Wilfred Hermeien, an adult Mitra who is both the leader of the <b>city-state</b> of Nagapur with the ruling council of all of the city-states and Wagram, a powerful Mitra sorcerer.|$|E

However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek <b>city-state</b> of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed {{to cut off the}} Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.|$|E

Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further adding to the already obvious economic decline.|$|E

5|$|Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed {{autonomy}} and {{was attached to}} the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek <b>city-state</b> model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a Roman colonia during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the Byzantines and later empires. Its destruction by the Timurids in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under French Mandatory rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of Tadmur, and the ancient site became available for excavations.|$|E

Mendelssohn was the second of four children; his older sister Fanny also displayed exceptional and precocious musical talent.|$|E
50|$|The {{revenge of}} the Persians was {{postponed}} 10 years by internal conflicts in the Persian Empire, until Darius's son Xerxes returned to Greece in 480 BC with a staggeringly large army (modern estimates suggest between 150,000-250,000 men). Many Greeks <b>city-states,</b> having had plenty of warning of the forthcoming invasion, formed an anti-Persian league; though as before, other <b>city-states</b> remained neutral or allied with Persia.
