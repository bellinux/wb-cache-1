5|$|The bombing {{campaign}} was ended on June 10, 1999, {{on the order}} of Secretary General of NATO Javier Solana after Milošević complied with conditions the international community had set and Yugoslav forces began to withdraw from Kosovo. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 was adopted that same day, placing Kosovo under United Nations administration and authorizing a Kosovo peacekeeping force. NATO suffered no combat deaths, although two crew members died in an Apache helicopter crash. A F-117A was downed near the village of Budjanovici. The bombing resulted in an estimated 495 <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> and 820 wounded, as reported to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia estimated that the number of civilians killed is higher than 2,000 and that more than 5,000 have been wounded. Human Rights Watch estimates the number of <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> due to NATO bombings as somewhere between 488 and 527.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union lost around 27 {{million people}} during the war, {{including}} 8.7 million military and 19 million <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths.</b> The largest portion of military dead were 5.7 million ethnic Russians, followed by 1.3 million ethnic Ukrainians.

5|$|Soviet {{civilian}} {{populations in}} the occupied areas were severely persecuted and endured the treacherous conditions of the Eastern Front, which spawned atrocities such as the siege of Leningrad (when more than 1.2 million civilians died). Thousands of peasant villages across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were annihilated by German troops. During the occupation the Leningrad, Pskov and Novgorod region lost {{about a quarter of}} its population. An estimated one-quarter of Soviet <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> {{at the hands of the}} Nazis and their allies (five million Russians, three million Ukrainians and 1.5 million Belarusians) were racially motivated. In 1995 the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> in the occupied USSR, including Jews, at the hands of the Germans totaled 13.7 million dead (20 percent of the population of 68 million). The figure includes 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals; 2.2 million deaths of persons deported to Germany as forced labour, and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths. An estimated three million people also died of starvation in unoccupied territory. The losses occurred within the 1946–1991 borders of the USSR, and include territories annexed in 1939–40. The deaths of 8.2 million Soviet civilians, including Jews, were documented by the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} depots {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks {{was one of those}} attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths.</b> Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after World War I, Britain {{expanded}} Singapore Naval Base at Sembawang on Singapore's north coast {{as part of}} plans to deter Japanese expansionism in the region (the Singapore strategy).

The Commonwealth forces allocated to Malaya and Singapore were swiftly defeated in the months after the outbreak of the Pacific War, however, and the island was surrendered to the Japanese on 15February 1942. Singapore was bombed by Japanese aircraft {{on a number of occasions}} during the Battle of Malaya and subsequent fighting on the island itself; these raids caused many <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sources {{disagree}} {{on the number of}} Bosnian Croat and HV casualties. Their number is variously reported as 160 or 177 killed. The Bosnian Serbs and the JNA sustained losses of 85 killed and 154 taken prisoner of war. The JNA also captured 23 Bosnian Croat TO troops. The figures are reported to include 19 <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> on each side. Even though the Serbian media initially reported that the villages of Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan had been torched and razed to the ground, the information proved to be incorrect—the settlements sustained relatively minor damage. Conversely, Croat- or Bosniak-inhabited villages were looted and torched. Zlosela suffered extensive damage—the village school was the only structure with a roof left in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{civilian}} casualties in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed156 in 24 instances of war crimes and another 47 as victims of murderduring the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The Croatian Helsinki Committee disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period. When submitted as evidence, their report {{was rejected by the}} ICTY due to unsourced statements and double entries contained within. Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing. ICTY prosecutors set the number of <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> at 324. Croatian government officials estimate that 42 Croatian civilians were killed during the operation.|$|E
5|$|According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County Court {{ordered that}} a warrant be issued for Vasiljković's arrest. The {{offences}} listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war crime against the civilian population. The latter {{are related to}} {{his role in the}} attack on Glina which caused <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not get a fair trial there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljković was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43-day search for him by the police. Subsequently, Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision.|$|E

5|$|Although the Doolittle Raid caused little damage, it had {{important}} ramifications. The attack raised morale in the United States and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle, {{was seen}} as a hero. The weak state of the country's air defenses greatly embarrassed the Japanese military leadership, and four fighter groups were transferred from the Pacific to defend the home islands. In an attempt to prevent further naval raids, the IJN launched an offensive in the Pacific Ocean which ended in defeat during the Battle of Midway. The Japanese Army also conducted the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign to capture the airfields in central China at which the Doolittle Raiders had intended to land. This offensive achieved its objectives and resulted in the deaths of 250,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians; many of these <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> were due to war crimes. The destruction of the airfields and heavy casualties badly damaged China's war effort. The IJA also began developing fire balloons capable of carrying incendiary and anti-personnel bombs from Japan to the continental United States.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also known}} that Abir {{had been forced to}} put down rebellions of the Yamongo, Boonde, Bofongi, Lilangi, Bokenda, Pukaonga and Kailangi peoples {{around the turn of the}} century and that five Abir sentries had been killed near Bongandanga in 1901 and 1902. The Boangi and Likeli peoples were {{forcibly}} resettled closer to the post at Bosow and in 1903 Abir troops intervened to stop the emigration of the Lika people and villagers near Samba. To stop small scale emigration Abir instigated a permit system for people wishing to visit another village. At the Momponi post the Abir agent led a punitive expedition against the Seketulu tribe which resulted in 400 <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> with hundreds captured and put in prison, where a further 100 died. When the Nsongo Mboyo tribe attempted to emigrate 1,000 were captured and sent to a forced labour camp. The Likongo, Lianja, Nkole, Yan a-Yanju, Nongo-Ingoli, and Lofoma people all successfully fled toward Tshuapa. Despite this chaos Abir managed to increase its exports for 1903 to 951 tons recording the second highest profits in its history. However, this partial recovery did not last long and soon profits were falling once more.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{took part}} in a conference on 22 August 1939 where Hitler {{underlined}} to his commanders the need for the physical destruction of Poland as a nation. After the war, he would state in his memoirs that he did not recognise {{at the time of this}} meeting that Hitler was going to pursue a policy of extermination against the Poles. He did become aware of the policy later on, as he and other Wehrmacht generals received reports on the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, the Schutzstaffel (SS) death squads tasked with following the army into Poland to kill intellectuals and other civilians. These squads were also assigned to round up Jews and others for relocation to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps. Manstein later faced three charges of war crimes relating to Jewish and <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> in the sectors under his control, and the mistreatment and deaths of prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|Several senior German {{military}} officials were tried and convicted for {{their involvement in}} the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg trials and the subsequent Nuremberg trials. The massacre {{had a profound effect}} on the course of the war in Yugoslavia. It exacerbated tensions between the two guerrilla movements, the communist-led Partisans and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, and convinced Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović that further attacks against the Germans would only result in more Serb <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths.</b> The Germans soon found mass executions of Serbs to be ineffectual and counterproductive, as they tended to drive the population into the arms of insurgents. The ratio of 100executions for one soldier killed and 50executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. The massacre is commemorated by the October in Kragujevac Memorial Park and the co-located 21stOctober Museum, and has been the subject of several poems and feature films. The day the massacre took place is commemorated annually in Serbia as the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The HV and {{the special}} police {{suffered}} 174211 killed or missing, while the ARSK had 560 soldiers killed. Four UN peacekeepers were also killed. The HV captured 4,000 prisoners of war. The number of Serb <b>civilian</b> <b>deaths</b> is disputedCroatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing. During and after the offensive, 150,000–200,000 Serbs—or nearly the entire Serb population of the area formerly held by the ARSK—fled {{and a variety of}} crimes were committed against the remaining civilians there. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later tried three Croatian generals charged with war crimes and partaking in a joint criminal enterprise designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia, although all three were ultimately acquitted and the tribunal refuted charges of a criminal enterprise. In 2010, Serbia sued Croatia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that the offensive constituted a genocide. In 2015, the court ruled that it was not genocidal, and it affirmed that the Serb population fled {{as a direct result of}} the offensive, although Croatia did not have the specific intent to displace the country's Serb minority, nor was it found that ethnic cleansing or civilian targeting took place. However, it was found that crimes against civilians had been committed by Croatian forces. , the Croatian judiciary has convicted 2,380 persons for various crimes committed during Operation Storm.|$|E
