50|$|Up to now, it {{has been}} almost {{impossible}} to foresee the temperature distribution along the cable route, so that the maximum applicable current load was usually set as a compromise between understanding of operation conditions and risk minimization. The availability of industrial distributed temperature sensing (DTS) systems that measure in real time temperatures all along the cable {{is a first step}} in monitoring the transmission system capacity. This monitoring solution is based on using passive optical fibers as temperature sensors, either integrated directly inside a high voltage cable or mounted externally on the cable insulation. A solution for overhead lines is also available. In this case the optical fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire of overhead transmission lines (OPPC). The integrated Dynamic Cable Rating (DCR) or also called Real Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) solution enables not only to continuously monitor the temperature of a high voltage <b>cable</b> <b>circuit</b> in real time, but to safely utilize the existing network capacity to its maximum.

40|$|The {{cable system}} monitor (CSM) has been {{designed}} to provide grid system managers with real-time computation of the load-carrying capacity of selected <b>cable</b> <b>circuits</b> on the system. Historically, the main interconnected grid system in England and Wales had a few very simple individual cable monitors mainly in the north of England. A more sophisticated model was more recently developed on the Bramley-Didcot 1 and 2 circuits in southern England as these circuits imposed a serious constraint on the system. The results from this model were encouraging as the ratings produced on-line consistently gave thermal ratings 20 % in excess of the necessarily pessimistic ratings derived from off-line calculations.

As a result it was decided to develop a national scheme capable of taking all the identified circuits, plus future requirements, make improvements to the model and take advantage of advancements in technology.
