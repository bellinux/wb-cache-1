40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the availability of credit and its cost to US agriculture. A dynamic dual cost function is employed {{to investigate}} and compute credit demand elasticities for operating and term credit and {{their relationship with the}} demand of other inputs. This allows for the analysis and interpretation of the input elasticities, specifically the interest rate elasticities. These elasticities are then incorporated into the model that aims to test the effectiveness of the counter cyclical lending role of the Farm Credit System (FCS) relative to the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Banking</b> (<b>CB)</b> system in the US over the past 80 years. We estimate demand elasticities for each of the five cornbelt states including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio as well as their aggregate average and find that credit demand elasticities are nearly elastic, for both operating and term credit. This implies that farmers are sensitive to changes in interest rates. This sensitivity is observed in the cross elasticities measures of variable and quasi-fixed assets including farm land. We also investigate the demand/supply relationship between FCS loans and those of the CB sector. We incorporate the interest expense elasticities described above to show how farmers sensitivity to interest rates affects farm lending. We find that in periods during which elasticity is rising, the quantity of FCS loans increases relative to the commercial sector. We find other evidence of counter cyclical demand between the two sectors including periods of economic distress (GDP falls) which see an increase in FCS loans, and a rise in treasury yields which favors commercial banks...|$|E

Whereas, the share of <b>Commercial</b> <b>Banks</b> (<b>CBs)</b> increased and their share stood at 74 per cent in 2008 – 09, this is mainly because of the advent of financial sector reforms under economic liberalization.

Access to finance is cited as one of factors hampering economic growth and poverty alleviation. Microfinance is seen {{as one of the}} effective tools that can address poverty alleviation by engaging the poor in sustainable economic activities. Microfinance services have existed in Namibia since the late 1990 s, yet they have not attained growth. The main providers of microfinance services consist mainly of Micro-lenders, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOS), Public Financial Institutions (PFI) and to a less extent <b>Commercial</b> <b>Banks</b> (<b>CB).</b> This research report aimed to study and identify the problems that impact on the growth of microfinance finance institutions (MFIs) in Namibia. The findings of this study revealed that lack of regulatory and policy framework, lack of capital and high operational costs were the main problem areas hampering the growth of MFIs in Namibia. The study made recommendations which are aimed at enhancing the growth of microfinance institutions...|$|R
40|$|Check {{processing}} {{institutions are}} being forced to downsize their workforce to cut cost and improve the efficiency of their operations as a result of continued growth of electronic payments, a consequence of the increasing popularity of debit/credit cards and use of online banking. For these institutions, these events are making more urgent the decision of how to staff a check-clearing house to trade off efficiency and the expected costs associated with the risks of delayed checks, which include fraud and float costs. In this paper, we discuss how a team of executives at a major <b>commercial</b> <b>bank</b> (<b>CB)</b> and Carnegie Mellon University students and faculty engaged in conducting a model-based study of the CB check-clearing operations. This project culminated {{in the development of a}} simulation optimization model to systematically analyze the nature of the highlighted risk efficiency trade-off at CB. The firm used the model recommendations to obtain operations downsizing guidelines for its senior managers during the implementation of a strategic workforce reduction program at their check-clearing house. The managerial insights from the team analysis, and the specific model-based recommendations, enabled CB executives to balance risk and efficiency while planning the reduction of their check-processing workforce. check processing, workforce sizing, worker cross-training, cost of risk, simulation optimization, math-programming-based lower bound, empirical research...|$|R

40|$|In {{the era of}} {{financial}} sector reforms, sustainability, viability and operational efficiency of rural financial institutions (RFIs) are the major issues {{that need to be}} taken cognizance of in ensuring effective rural credit delivery system. However, the major problems plaguing the efficiency of rural credit delivery system are the mounting overdue 1 and Non Performing Assets (NPAs) 2 of RFIs. The overdue problem of different entities of rural credit delivery structure is reported to be an all-pervasive phenomenon that cuts across these different agencies (Puhazhendi and Jayaraman, 1999). Among various RFIs, though <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> (<b>CBs),</b> Regional Rural <b>Banks</b> (RRBs) and Cooperatives are the major sources of credit for the agricultural sector at the village level, cooperatives alone account for 45 per cent share in the rural credit flow for agriculture and 31 per cent in rural deposits in terms of network, coverage and outreach (Gulati and Bathla, 2002). Co-operatives, therefore, enjoy major share in rural credit delivery. The reform process in cooperatives have taken much longer time to start because of the need for generating a consensus among the various State Governments which govern and control cooperative credit institutions and the need to balance the interests of many diversified groups which control, operate and guide the cooperatives. Despite these limitations, a few major reforms...|$|R
40|$|Credit {{is a major}} input in {{the making}} of investments, the {{availability}} of which affects the level of development in sectors of nation’s economy across all countries of the world. However, the continued increase in loan default with low corresponding recovery of same has reached a worrisome dimension globally. The huge credit losses arising largely from unrecovered defaulted mortgages have attracted the attention of practitioners and academia which has led to serious empirical researches. However, it is pertinent to note that much more attention has been given to loan default than the recovery of defaulted mortgage loans. The current paper attempts to investigate the determinants of recovery of defaulted mortgage loans in Nigerian lending industry. Data on three thousand, one hundred and ninety seven (3, 197) defaulted mortgages from 1999 - 2011 were gathered from the databases of some selected <b>Commercial</b> <b>Banks</b> (<b>CB)</b> and Primary Mortgage Institutions (PMIs) in Nigeria. Using Logistics Regression Model (LRM), the result reveals that growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), borrower status, borrower’s history of default, year of borrower, business relationship with bank, loan supervision, age of collateral and location of real estate collaterals are significantly positive determinants of loan recovery. It was also found that inflation growth rate, interest growth rates, priority of collateral and collateral revaluation are significantly but inversely related to loan recovery, while such factors as loan-to-value (LTV), loan size and loa...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{evaluate}} and measure the effect of financial liberalization (FL) on bank risk exposure. We pursue these questions by assessing the changes in market-based asset values and risk exposure measures for <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> (<b>CB)</b> before and during a FL program. We {{do this for a}} sample of three countries: Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand. We use a model based on the options pricing theory. We obtain estimates of the first and second moment of bank returns using an asset pricing model in which these two moments are a linear projection of a set of conditioning variables. This model was estimated using a GMM statistical procedure. Then we perform regressions explaining the evolution of bank risk measure around the FL event. The analysis and statistical test indicate that risk exposure of banks increases following a FL program, and this as a result of macroeconomic policy as well as changes in management controlled variables. This is so even for banks operating in countries that have undertaken very cautious FL processes such as Thailand and Malaysia. The results tend to support the proposition that moral hazard and bank risk taking may increase following FL. The results also suggest that banking crisis that often have followed FL may be more due to the behavior of banks managers than previously reported in the FL literature. ...|$|R
