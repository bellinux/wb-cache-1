40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{strategy}} to decode <b>color</b> <b>codes,</b> {{which is based on}} the projection of the error onto three surface codes. This provides a method to transform every decoding algorithm of surface codes into a decoding algorithm of <b>color</b> <b>codes.</b> Applying this idea to a family of hexagonal <b>color</b> <b>codes,</b> with the perfect matching decoding algorithm for the three corresponding surface codes, we find a phase error threshold of approximately 8. 7 %. Finally, our approach enables us to establish a general lower bound on the error threshold of a family of <b>color</b> <b>codes</b> depending on the threshold of the three corresponding surface codes.

40|$|In {{a recent}} work, Bombin, Duclos-Cianci, and Poulin showed that every local {{translationally}} invariant 2 D topological stabilizer code is locally {{equivalent to a}} finite number of copies of Kitaev's toric code. For 2 D <b>color</b> <b>codes,</b> Delfosse relaxed the constraint on translation invariance and mapped a 2 D <b>color</b> <b>code</b> onto three surface codes. In this paper, we propose an alternate map based on linear algebra. We show that any 2 D <b>color</b> <b>code</b> can be mapped onto exactly two copies of a related surface code. The surface code in our map is induced by the <b>color</b> <b>code</b> and easily derived from the <b>color</b> <b>code.</b> Furthermore, our map does not require any ancilla qubits for the surface codes.

40|$|The {{entanglement}} {{properties of}} a class of topological stabilizer states, the so called topological <b>color</b> <b>codes</b> defined on a two-dimensional lattice or 2 -colex, are calculated. The topological entropy is {{used to measure the}} entanglement of different bipartitions of the 2 -colex. The dependency of the ground state degeneracy on the genus of the surface shows that the <b>color</b> <b>code</b> can support a topological order, and the contribution of the color in its structure makes it interesting to compare with the Kitaev’s toric code. While a qubit is maximally entangled with rest of the system, two qubits are no longer entangled showing that the <b>color</b> <b>code</b> is genuinely multipartite entangled. For a convex region, it is found that entanglement entropy depends only on the degrees of freedom living on the boundary of two subsystems. The boundary scaling of entropy is supplemented with a topological subleading term which for a <b>color</b> <b>code</b> defined on a compact surface is twice than the toric code. From the entanglement entropy we construct a set of bipartitions in which the diverging term arising from the boundary term is washed out, and the remaining non-vanishing term will have a topological nature.
