40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{is an integral}} concept for achieving quality of limits, interdependence, fundamentals and equity. Virtual reality means existing or resulting in essence or effect though not in actual fact, form, or name. Machine design is always interesting for most people, it is also {{becoming more and more}} popular now a days. Showing the performance of a machine design during the design phase is possible to do using 3 D Max and ANSYS software. <b>Car</b> <b>lifting</b> equipment is a device to <b>lift</b> a <b>car</b> for several workshop purposes as replace oil, fix car&# 65533;s break, overhaul engine, periodical maintenance and many others. Conventional <b>car</b> <b>lifting</b> equipment design needs a lot of cost, time, and materials because it needs doing the real test to understand the performance of the <b>car</b> <b>lifting</b> equipment design. The primary target of this research is to search and decide which mechanism is the most suitable for this machine and also the virtual reality to show its performance during the design phase. In this research, sustainable product development using virtual reality with 3 D Max and ANSYS software is used rather than conventional design. The goal of this research is to show the performance of the machine during the design phase using 3 D Max and ANSYS software. Finally, <b>car</b> <b>lifting</b> equipment has been designed in this research using 3 D Max and ANSYS software as a solution of sustainable product development. Designing <b>car</b> <b>lifting</b> equipment using 3 D Max and ANSYS virtual reality software can reduce materials, cost and time of product development. Virtual reality using 3 D Max and ANSYS software is a sustainable technology for sustainable product development in the <b>car</b> <b>lifting</b> equipment design...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{there is}} a lack of {{assistance}} in automobile usage for the older people of our society. In an attempt to combat this problem, this thesis designs and builds a working conceptual model of a handicapped <b>car</b> <b>lifting</b> seat. An initial cost analysis is performed, an apparatus is designed, all necessary materials are gathered, an apparatus is constructed, and the device is tested. The result was the successful completion of a device that successfully assists in the lifting of up to a 300 lb. person out of their car. With some further development, this handicapped <b>car</b> <b>lifting</b> seat could hopefully be used in real life. by Sean A. Schoenmakers. Thesis (S. B.)

In the following years, he dominated the competitions in 1980, 1981, and 1982, winning all by an exceptionally large margin. He was the first man to win the WSM title three times and remains one of only two men ever to win it three times in a row.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{evaluation}} report listed some problems {{that might have}} occurred. The construction of certain facilities, particularly the skiing venues, to be located totally or partially in the Tatra National Park, {{could have been a}} big challenge due to its special international ecological status. The most problematic issue was using Kasprowy Wierch as a downhill, super-G, and giant slalom slope. The snowmaking facilities, cable <b>car,</b> <b>lift</b> and spectator capacities were considered insufficient and access to the stadium was non-existent. The proposed men’s downhill course was not approved by International Ski Federation. There were objections among non-governmental organisations, the scientific and intellectuals community to the proposed venues placed in the Biosphere Reserve.|$|E

50|$|The Nationwide Series {{kicked off}} the 2013 season at Daytona International Speedway in the DRIVE4COPD 300. Following a big crash with 14 laps to go that {{resulted}} in a red flag, Regan Smith took the lead, attempting to take his second consecutive win. On the final lap, Smith attempted to block a pass attempt by Brad Keselowski and got turned into the outside wall, causing a big crash behind. Stewart drove to the inside and won his seventh career Daytona Nationwide race. However, the win was overshadowed by the last lap crash. Kyle Larson, who was collected into the crash, had his <b>car</b> <b>lift</b> off the ground and slamm into the safety fence. The car's engine and front wheels landed in the grandstands, injuring 33 fans (all of whom survived).|$|E
5000|$|Situated {{near the}} massive {{peaks of the}} Aiguilles Rouges and most notably the Aiguille du Midi, Chamonix {{is one of the}} oldest ski resorts in France. The north side of the summit of Mont Blanc, and {{therefore}} the summit itself are part of the village of Chamonix. To the south side, the situation is different depending on the country. Italy considers that the border passes through the top. France considers that the boundary runs along the rocky Tournette under the summit cap, placing it entirely in French territory. The south side was in France, assigned to the commune of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains sharing the summit with its neighbor Chamonix. It is this situation [...] "for France," [...] which is found on the French IGN maps. The Chamonix commune is popular with skiers and mountain enthusiasts, and via the cable <b>car</b> <b>lift</b> to the Aiguille du Midi it is possible to access the off-piste (backcountry) ski run of the Vallée Blanche. With an area of 245 km2, Chamonix is the fourth largest commune in area in mainland France.|$|E
