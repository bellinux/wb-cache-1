5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E

5|$|Insect {{attributes}} {{are sometimes}} mimicked in architecture, {{as at the}} Eastgate Centre, Harare, which uses passive cooling, storing heat {{in the morning and}} releasing it in the warm parts of the day. The target of this piece of biomimicry is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E

5|$|Natural ice {{was put to}} many uses. The ice trade enabled its {{widespread}} use in medicine in attempts to treat diseases and to alleviate their symptoms, as well as making tropical hospitals more bearable. In Calcutta, for example, part of each ice shipment was specially reserved in the city's ice house {{for the use of}} the local doctors. By the middle of the 19th century, the British Royal Navy was using imported ice to <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> interiors of its ships' gun turrets. In 1864, and after several attempts, salmon eggs were finally shipped successfully from Britain to Australia, using natural ice to keep them chilled on route, enabling the creation of the Tasmanian salmon fishery industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently <b>cool,</b> <b>the</b> mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E

5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they <b>cool,</b> <b>the</b> atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> potassium metal.|$|E

5|$|In early 2004, Cena {{participated in}} the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, {{making it to the}} final six before being {{eliminated}} by Big Show. Chris Benoit was the eventual winner of the match. The Royal Rumble elimination led to a feud with Big Show. At No Way Out, Cena faced Big Show and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match to earn a WWE Championship match, with Angle beating Cena by submission. Cena won his first singles championship in WWE, the United States Championship from Big Show at WrestleMania XX after delivering an F-U for the pinfall victory. The reign ended almost four months after successful title defences against the likes of Rene Dupree, Rob Van Dam and Booker T, when he was stripped of the title on the July 8 episode of SmackDown! by Angle after he accidentally knocked him over, thus attacking an official. Cena won the championship back defeating Booker T in a best of five series that culminated at No Mercy, only to drop it to the débuting Carlito Caribbean <b>Cool</b> <b>the</b> following week on SmackDown!. After the loss to Carlito, the duo began a feud, which resulted in Cena allegedly being stabbed in the kidney while at a Boston-area nightclub by Carlito's bodyguard, Jesús. This worked injury was used to keep Cena out of action for a month while Cena was filming The Marine. Immediately on his return in November, Cena won the United States Championship back from Carlito. Cena later successfully defended the championship against Jesus at Armageddon in a street fight match.|$|E
5|$|The second chapter, Metamorphosis, {{focuses on}} the {{evolutionary}} origins of humans around 5 million years ago in equatorial Africa. Wade suggests that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived in forests. Some of them, due to a global climate change between 5 and 10 million years ago, left the shrinking forests and moved to open woodland, and this new ecological niche {{gave rise to the}} human lineage. A change in food availability led to an adaptation for the ability to eat meat, and this nutrition facilitated the evolution of a larger brain. The knuckle-walking of the common ancestor gave way to bipedalism, which is more efficient over longer distances. A larger brain in combination with freed-up hands culminated in the evolution of Homo habilis and the first use of tools around 2.5 million years ago, and the more humanlike and larger brained Homo ergaster about 1.7 million years ago. The adaptations of H.ergaster to hot, dry climates included an external nose to condense air and minimise water loss, and the loss of body hair to allow sweating to <b>cool</b> <b>the</b> body and larger brain. Wade writes that a mutation in the melanocortin receptor gene created an advantageous darkening of the pale, hairless skin. The close descendants of H.ergaster, Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis, migrated out of Africa and to Asia (around 1 to 1.66 million years ago) and Europe (around 500,000 years ago), respectively. In Europe, the glacial conditions around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago pressured H.heidelbergensis to evolve into Neanderthals.|$|E
