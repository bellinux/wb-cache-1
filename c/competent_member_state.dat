However, {{they do not have}} direct legal power to implement regulations (Busuioc 2013), but usually must rely on fostering their reputation and image among <b>competent</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> authorities, businesses, professionals, consumer groups and the media to gain authority. As Gehring and Krapohl (2007, 28) argue, agencies ‘Operate in highly politicized environments {{and the extent to which}} they manage to establish themselves as credible regulators will often be dependent on the manner in which they manage their relations with, and competing expectations from, the multiple political actors within their environment’.

40|$|La Serie “Policy Briefs” dell’Osservatorio discute in maniera sintetica e policy-oriented i temi di maggiore attualità nel dibattito italiano ed europeo, offrendo un contributo di idee e spunti ai decisori politici e alla comunità degli esperti. Tra i Briefs recentemente pubblicati possono essere menzionati i seguenti: The EU {{external}} policy on migration and asylum: What role for Italy in shaping its future? (A. V. Palm, May 2017); Critical {{aspects of the}} Hungarian Law on asylum seekers’ detention (E. Andriolo, June 2017); Welfare Tourism within the EU: Filling the Perception Gap (D. Pedrali, July 2017). Focusing on the certified shortcomings of the Dublin system and on the recent debate fuelled by the May 2016 proposal of the European Commission (where minimum policy changes to the current Dublin Regulation have been foreseen), the Brief urges the Italian Government to take a proactive stance (not limited to propose the deletion of the irregular entry criterion, or {{to complain about the}} fault of solidarity from other <b>Member</b> <b>States)</b> and advocates the need to make significant changes towards an effective and reasonable system of allocation of asylum seekers. To make these changes possible, a ‘genuine link approach’ between the asylum seeker and the <b>competent</b> EU <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> is suggested, able to substitute the irregular entry criterion and – in the same time – to address the main concerns of many <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and of other relevant stakeholders. A centralized system for registering all the applications and the attribution of relevant shares according to a reference key would be the first steps in this direction, followed by an assessment of the asylum seeker that takes into account the pivotal importance of the possible relationship(s) of the concerned person with a suitable <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> (or more) through objectively verifiable connections such as family links (in a broader sense than the current one), language, professional and educational ties, private sponsorship and so on. The MS declared competent would fill its annual share of asylum seekers with applicants who are – at least in part – likely to raise less problems as far as financial costs and social integration are concerned and can contribute to the local economy. The whole procedure would be more balanced and less conflictual, while the drivers for secondary movements will be reduced to a large extent. In order to prevent a possible overburden on some <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> (which are usually preferred by asylum seekers as host country), some corrective and compensatory tools are proposed. The recognition of a limited degree of free circulation for economic purposes, to the benefit of the recognized refugee, is suggested too...|$|R
40|$|According to {{language}} socialization theory, language learning {{does not occur}} in isolation but is intimately related {{to the process of}} becoming a <b>competent</b> <b>member</b> of the target language society (Ochs & Schieffelin, 1984). To become <b>competent</b> <b>members</b> of society, language learners must learn, among other things, how to display their knowledge appropriately, using epistemic markers (evidentials) effectively. In this paper, the importance of epistemic markers in language socialization is discussed {{from the perspective of the}} second language classroom, the broader goal of the study being to more fully understand what second language learners must acquire in order to become <b>competent</b> <b>members</b> of the target language community. Through analysis of a conversation among Japanese teachers outside the classroom, this paper investigates the linguistic resources for constituting epistemic stance in Japanese. Like English, Japanese evidentiality can be marked with adverbials and idiomatic phrases. In addition, Japanese is rich in sentence-final particles which directly index interactive contexts. The function of epistemic markers in Japanese discourse is investigated, focusing on how epistemic markers, such as sentence-final particles, adverbials, and hedges function to reduce speaker responsibility...|$|R

5000|$|Because of property's social importance, {{either for}} {{personal}} consumption and use or for mass production, compulsory purchase laws {{have met with}} human rights challenges. One concern is that since the 1980s privatisations, many compulsory purchase powers {{can be used for}} the benefit of private corporations whose incentives may diverge from the public interest. For example, the Water Resources Act 1991 continues to allow government bodies to order compulsory purchases of people's property, although profits go to the private shareholders of UK water companies. In R (Sainsbury's Supermarkets Ltd) v Wolverhampton CC the Supreme Court held that Wolverhampton City Council acted for an improper purpose when it took into account a promise by Tesco to redevelop another site, in determining whether to make a compulsory purchase order over a site possessed by Sainsbury's. Lord Walker stressed that [...] "powers of compulsory acquisition, especially in a [...] "private to private" [...] acquisition, amounts to a serious invasion of the current owner's proprietary rights." [...] Nevertheless compulsory purchase orders have frequently been used to acquire land that is passed back to a private owner, including in Alliance Spring Ltd v First Secretary where homes in Islington were purchased to build the Emirates stadium for Arsenal Football Club. By contrast, in James v United Kingdom Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster, the inherited owner of most of Mayfair and Belgravia, contended that leaseholders' right to buy had violated their right to property in ECHR Protocol 1, article 1. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, which allowed tenants to purchase properties from their private landlords, was within a <b>member</b> <b>state's</b> margin of appreciation. It was <b>competent</b> for a <b>member</b> <b>state</b> to regulate property rights in the public interest.|$|R

We further rule out some alternative explanations, such as the decrease in Mao's own competence (e. g., health) and ideological changes, and find support for the dictator's stakes hypothesis.
