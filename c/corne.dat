25|$|In the {{meantime}} the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. Fort de la <b>Corne</b> {{was built in}} 1753, by Louis de la <b>Corne,</b> Chevalier de la <b>Corne</b> {{just east of the}} Saskatchewan River Forks in what is today the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.|$|E

25|$|The Cretaceous period 145-66 {{million years}} ago was a period for active {{kimberlite}} volcanism in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The Fort à la <b>Corne</b> kimberlite field in central Saskatchewan formed 104to 95{{million years ago}} during the Early Cretaceous. Unlike most kimberlite fields on Earth, the Fort à la <b>Corne</b> kimberlite field formed during more than one eruptive event. Its kimberlites {{are among the most}} complete examples on Earth, preserving kimberlite pipes and maar volcanoes. The Northern Alberta kimberlite province consists of three kimberlite fields known as the Birch Mountains, Buffalo Head Hills and the Mountain Lake cluster. The Birch Mountains kimberlite field consists of eight kimberlite pipes known as Phoenix, Dragon, Xena, Legend and Valkyrie, dating approximately 75million years old. The Buffalo Head Hills kimberlite field was dominated by explosive kimberlite volcanism from 88million years ago to 81million years ago, forming maars. Kimberlites of the Buffalo Head Hills field are similar to those associated with the Fort à la <b>Corne</b> kimberlite field in central Saskatchewan. The kimberlite pipes of the Mountain Lake cluster were formed during a similar timespan with the Birch Mountains field 77million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Rewe Skew Bridge, Rewe, Devon by William Froude (Bristol and Exeter Railway, 1844), one of {{possibly}} {{only two}} examples in Britain of the <b>corne</b> de vache method of brick construction pioneered by Froude, the other being at Cowley Bridge Junction {{on the same}} line.|$|E
25|$|The <b>corne</b> de vache {{approach}} {{tends to}} result in a structure that is almost as strong as one built to the logarithmic pattern and considerably stronger than one built to the helicoidal pattern but, again, the extra complexity has meant that the method has not seen widespread adoption, especially since the simpler helicoidal structure can be built much stronger if a segmental design is chosen, rather than a full-centred one.|$|E
50|$|The 2006 was {{a disappointing}} one for Port Adelaide, {{and one which}} {{frustrated}} <b>Cornes</b> in particular. The season never really took off, and with <b>Cornes</b> now being a senior player, he was moved into the midfield to help the younger players. This move paid off as he dominated matches, which was a huge positive for the Power in an otherwise disappointing campaign. <b>Cornes</b> won the Showdown Medal in round 21.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, <b>Cornes</b> {{was a key}} midfielder and has {{a largely}} {{impressive}} season. <b>Cornes</b> finished the 2007 season with 643 disposals, and led the competition in kicks, {{and went into the}} Brownlow medal count as one of the favourites. The great form of <b>Cornes</b> in midfield was crucial to the side making the AFL Grand Final, which was a huge surprise to most, including <b>Cornes.</b> Despite not expecting to have a good season, when they did make the Grand Final the belief appeared to be strong but they were unable to win their second flag, going down to Geelong by a record 119 points ...|$|R

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Mallet and Gary Teichmann, one of South Africa's most successful team captains ever (with 36 wins), began to sour and Teichman was controversially {{excluded from the}} 1999 Rugby World Cup squad. Mallet looked for a new captain, first turning to <b>Corné</b> Krige then Rassie Erasmus, Joost van der Westhuizen and André Vos for a solution. In the end, despite the internal instability in the squad, the Springboks managed four consecutive wins and were finally knocked out of the championship in the semi-final by eventual winners Australia. Despite his team's relatively mediocre results of 8 wins and 5 losses in 1999, the Springboks still managed to break more records, beating Italy 101–0 and England in the quarter-final 44–21, with Jannie de Beer kicking a world-record five drop goals in that game.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bitterness}} against Port Adelaide {{for their}} AFL entry bid was {{summed up by}} Glenelg coach Graham <b>Cornes</b> in his post-match speech to the Port players when after congratulating them on their efforts criticised the club for ending the good days of football in the state. <b>Cornes</b> was then hastily ushered out amongst jeers and singing from Port players and officials.

500|$|Gonzalo's {{description}} of his ideal society (2.1.148–157, 160–165) thematically and verbally echoes Montaigne's essay Of the Canibales, translated into English in a version published by John Florio in 1603. Montaigne praises {{the society of the}} Caribbean natives: [...] "It is a nation... that hath no kinde of traffike, no knowledge of Letters, no intelligence of numbers, no name of magistrate, nor of politike superioritie; no use of service, of riches, or of poverty; no contracts, no successions, no dividences, no occupation but idle; no respect of kinred, but common, no apparrell but natural, no manuring of lands, no use of wine, <b>corne,</b> or mettle. The very words that import lying, falsehood, treason, dissimulation, covetousnes, envie, detraction, and pardon, were never heard of amongst them." [...] In addition, much of Prospero's renunciative speech (5.1.33–57) echoes a speech by Medea in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses.|$|E
