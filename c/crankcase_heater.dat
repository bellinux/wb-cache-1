5000|$|A <b>crankcase</b> <b>heater</b> is an {{electrical}} component in a compressor in an air-conditioning system, heat pump system, or chiller system. The <b>crankcase</b> <b>heater</b> is normally {{on all the}} time, even when the unit is not running, though temperature sensors and set points may turn it off when not needed. A crankcase heater's sole purpose is to prevent refrigerant migration and mixing with crankcase oil when the unit is off, and to prevent condensation of refrigerant in the crankcase of a compressor. The <b>crankcase</b> <b>heater</b> keeps refrigerant at a temperature higher than the coldest part of the system. A <b>crankcase</b> <b>heater</b> generally has the same electrical symbol as a resistor because it converts electricity directly into heat via electrical resistance. The resistance in the heater coil determines the heat it produces when voltage is applied.|$|E
50|$|While {{the system}} is running, there is enough heat being {{generated}} by the compressor running to prevent refrigerant migration from occurring. Refrigerant vapor always migrates to the coldest {{part of the system}} (the compressor). The refrigerant migrates to the compressor crankcase where it is attracted to the compressor oil. This refrigerant vapor condenses and returns to a liquid in the off cycle. On the next start of the compressor, the oil is in a watery state and washes the bearings out, which leads to locked-up, frozen or totally burnt-out compressors. The temperature is sensed at the compressor, indoor coil, and outdoors. The sensed temperatures are compared and if the compressor temperature is not a specified amount higher than the lower of the other two sensed temperatures, then the <b>crankcase</b> <b>heater</b> is energized. When the compressor temperature rises to or is a specified amount above the lower of the other two temperatures, the <b>crankcase</b> <b>heater</b> is de-energized.|$|E
50|$|Some air {{conditioning}} equipment manufacturers install <b>crankcase</b> <b>heaters</b> either in the compressor (insertion type), or mount them externally {{around the base of}} the compressor (bellyband type). The two wires of the heater are wired directly to the input side of the contact from the main power supply, and power is always supplied to the heater. Caution should be used since the heater can become very hot and cause second degree burns as well as cause electrical danger due to live circuits.|$|R
