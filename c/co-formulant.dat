40|$|Cells of {{biocontrol}} {{bacteria can}} colonise spaces occupied by plant pathogens by using {{different types of}} motility. In spite of the ecological importance of motility, few information {{is available on the}} motility of Lysobacter capsici. We discover that in the biocontrol bacterium L. capsici AZ 78 (AZ 78) motility is medium-dependent, in fact it developed dendrite-like colonies when grown on jellified pea broth (PB), while no cell movement was recorded in the media commonly used in motility assays. The application of AZ 78 combined with PB increased its biocontrol activity against Plasmopara viticola under greenhouse conditions. We demonstrated that a quantity of PB equal to that present on grapevine leaves after the treatment is sufficient to determine the AZ 78 cell motility. To identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the medium-dependent motility, the genome of AZ 78 was mined for genes responsible for the flagellum and type IV pilus (T 4 P) biogenesis. The subsequent gene expression analysis revealed that genes encoding structural components and regulatory factors of T 4 P were upregulated in AZ 78 cells grown on medium containing PB, as compared with the other tested media. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first hint regarding the cell motility in a L. capsici biocontrol strain. Furthermore, these results pave the way to the possible role of pea compounds as <b>co-formulant,</b> to improve the biocontrol efficacy of AZ 78...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of a dry powder <b>co-formulant,</b> kaolin, to improve the control of storage beetles by the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, isolate IMI 389521, was investigated. The response of Oryzaephilus surinamensis adults to the fungus when applied to wheat at 1 × 1010 conidia per kg with and without kaolin at 1. 74 g per kg wheat was assessed. Addition of kaolin increased control from 46 % to 88 % at day 7 and from 81 % to 99 % at day 14 post-treatment. Following this the dose response of O. surinamensis and Tribolium confusum to both kaolin and the fungus was investigated. Synergistic effects were evident against O. surinamensis at ≥ 0. 96 g of kaolin per kg of wheat when combined with the fungus at all concentrations tested. For T. confusum, adult mortality did not exceed 55 %, however, the larvae were extremely susceptible with almost complete suppression of adult emergence at the lowest fungal rate tested even without the addition of kaolin. Finally, the dose response of Sitophilus granarius to the fungus at 15 and 25 °C, with and without kaolin at 1 g per kg of wheat, was examined. Improvements in efficacy were achieved by including kaolin at every fungal rate tested and by increasing the temperature. Kaolin by itself was not effective, only when combined with the fungus was an effect observed, indicating that kaolin was having a synergistic effect on the fungus...|$|E
40|$|The {{focal point}} of this project is mixture effects caused by pesticides, and in {{particular}} mixture effects of mixtures in which pesticide adjuvants (co-formulants) is a part. As a first step, the project examines how the current European (EU) pesticide legislation and the consequent ecological risk assessment applied in the Nordic approval-zone relate to mixture effects of mixtures where co-formulants is a part. It is concluded that the ecological risk assessment performed during the approval of pesticide formulations in accordance to the relevant legislation, to a wide extent does {{take into account the}} contribution of co-formulants to the toxicity of pesticide formulations. Requirements of ecotoxicological examination of mandatory tank mixes (i. e. mixtures of pesticides formulations or the addition of pesticide adjuvants, according to the label required for optimum effect) are also included in the legislation. However, there are no test requirements for mixtures of pesticide formulations applied to the field, solely {{in order to reduce the}} number of applications (i. e. non-mandatory tank mixtures), or to mixtures of pesticide formulations generated by sequential field application. Since there are no tests requirements for non-mandatory tank mixtures, which is the most frequently used application method of pesticides, or for sequential mixtures, there is good reason to believe that there occurs mixture effects that are not taken into account, neither in the current European pesticides legislation nor in the Nordic ecological risk assessment. Hence, it was suggested that inclusion of risk assessment of these non-mandatory mixtures could improve the European pesticides legislation. In addition to the legislative and regulatory analysis, the toxic mixture effects of the active ingredient of the widely used RoundUp herbicde, glyphosate, and the <b>co-formulant,</b> POEA, to the ordinary yellow onion, Allium cepa, was examined in a root growth inhibition assay and by applying the use of a "fixed-ratio" study design. The experiment is performed in five mixture ratios (1 : 0, 1 : 0. 2, 1 : 0. 6, 1 : 1. 9, and 0 : 1 (glyphosate: POEA concentration ratio)). Mixture effects were assessed in relation to the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models. The observed mixing effects were characterized as being Bliss antagonistic, both at high (EC 50 -level) and low (EC 10 -level) concentrations and Loewe additive at high concentrations and weak Loewe antagonistic at low concentrations. It was found that CA, despite the fact that glyphosate and POEA has a fundamentally different toxic mode of action, would be a useful prediction model to assess the mixture effects of glyphosate and POEA and probably also other mixtures of active substances and co-formulants...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{formulations}} contain declared {{active ingredients}} and <b>co-formulants</b> presented as inert and confidential compounds. We tested the endocrine disruption of <b>co-formulants</b> in six glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), the most used pesticides worldwide. All <b>co-formulants</b> and formulations were comparably cytotoxic {{well below the}} agricultural dilution of 1 % (18 – 2000 times for <b>co-formulants,</b> 8 – 141 times for formulations), and not the declared active ingredient glyphosate (G) alone. The endocrine-disrupting effects of all these compounds were measured on aromatase activity, a key enzyme {{in the balance of}} sex hormones, below the toxicity threshold. Aromatase activity was decreased both by the <b>co-formulants</b> alone (polyethoxylated tallow amine—POEA and alkyl polyglucoside—APG) and by the formulations, from concentrations 800 times lower than the agricultural dilutions; while G exerted an effect only at 1 / 3 of the agricultural dilution. It was demonstrated {{for the first time that}} endocrine disruption by GBH could not only be due to the declared active ingredient but also to <b>co-formulants.</b> These results could explain numerous in vivo results with GBHs not seen with G alone; moreover, they challenge the relevance of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) value for GBHs exposures, currently calculated from toxicity tests of the declared active ingredient alone...|$|R
30|$|CA and IA both {{link the}} {{toxicity}} of individual components (active ingredients, substances of concern, <b>co-formulants)</b> {{to the overall}} toxicity of the biocidal product. The major advantage of such methods is their easy adaptability to different exposure situations, e.g. when the chemical composition of a biocidal product changes. They substantially decrease the biotest demands of new biocidal products if they use known active ingredients and/or <b>co-formulants.</b> Similar to the direct testing of a biocidal product for its long-term effects, also the modeling of long-term effects in the environment depends on a sound and complete definition of the underlying exposure scenario.|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to emphasize {{that in the case}} of glyphosate, the vast majority of registrant-conducted animal studies, and all the chronic studies, have dosed animals with technical glyphosate. Hence, the key toxicological parameters embedded in EPA and other regulatory, human-health risk assessments reflect risks stemming from exposure to glyphosate technical in the absence of <b>co-formulants.</b>|$|R
30|$|The data {{generated}} by such research and biomonitoring will be valuable for regulators and GBH registrants in two ways. First, {{it will help}} guide future changes in <b>co-formulants</b> to limit use of those known to increase risks through one or more mechanisms. Second, these data will help sharpen worker-risk assessments and identify under what conditions, and for what uses, additional worker-safety precautions and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are warranted.|$|R
30|$|This is {{inappropriate}} for three reasons: (1) formulated GBHs {{account for all}} commercial uses and human exposures (no herbicide products contain just glyphosate), (2) regulators are aware that the <b>co-formulants</b> in GBHs markedly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and possibly the toxicity, of the glyphosate in formulated GBHs [1 – 3]; and (3) multiple studies report that formulated GBHs are more toxic than glyphosate technical (see Table  3 for references and accompanying discussion).|$|R
50|$|When {{discussing}} biocides {{a distinction}} {{should be made}} between the biocidal active substance and the biocidal product. The biocidal active substances are mostly chemical compounds, but can also be microorganisms (e.g. bacteria). Biocidal products contain one or more biocidal active substances and may contain other non-active <b>co-formulants</b> that ensure the effectiveness {{as well as the}} desired pH, viscosity, colour, odour, etc. of the final product. Biocidal products are available on the market for use by professional and/or non-professional consumers.|$|R
30|$|Taking full {{account of}} {{differences}} in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of technical or “pure” glyphosate, in contrast to formulated, glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) poses many challenges for regulators, scientists, and glyphosate manufacturers. According to the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA), the purity of glyphosate technical in its evaluation and risk assessment ranges between 95 % and 98.3 % glyphosate [2]. Impurities including N-nitroso-glyphosate and formaldehyde make up no more than 1.1 % of technical glyphosate [2]. Formulated GBHs, on the other hand, typically contain between 2 and 60 % glyphosate and a fraction of 1 % to 25 % adjuvants, surfactants, and other <b>co-formulants.</b>|$|R
30|$|The EU Council and Parliament {{recently}} {{agreed on}} a new regulation that will implement a new EU-wide, harmonized system for the authorization for biocidal products. Such products are in most cases multi-component mixtures {{of one or more}} active substances plus a range of <b>co-formulants</b> that serve different purposes, e.g. as stabilizers or preservatives. They are only allowed on the European market if their intended use does not lead to unacceptable risks for the environment. Consequently, the assessment of possible combination effects is a critically important step during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of biocidal products. However, no specific guidance is at hand on how combination effects should be accounted for during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of biocidal products.|$|R
40|$|Bio-pesticides are {{considered}} as low-risk compounds, a belief mainly {{based on their}} natural origin rather than on experimental evidence. Thus {{there is a need}} to explore the ecotoxicity of bio-pesticides and mostly their impact on soil microbes which is largely unknown. The effect of Quillajia saponaria plant extract (QLAgri (R)) and Paecilomyces lilacinus strain 251 (PL 251, BIOACT (R)) on the microbial community was investigated comparatively to the synthetic nematicides oxamyl and fluensulfone. Particular attention was given to potential effects on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). No effect of QLAgri (R), oxamyl and fluensulfone on the soil microbial community and AOB/AOA was observed. In contrast BIOACT (R) stimulated the growth of copiotrophic Gram negative bacteria and fungi as determined by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis. Terminal restriction fragments length polymorphism (TRFLP) and qPCR analysis of the amoA gene showed a significant time-dependent inhibitory effect of BIOACT (R) on the abundance of AOB/AOA up to 20 days post application. Further qPCR analysis indicated that PL 251 did not proliferate in soil. These results suggested the establishment of complex interactions between BIOACT (R) and AOB/AOA which were further explored. In a follow-up study BIOACT (R) and its <b>co-formulants,</b> glucose (78 %) and skimmed milk powder (6 %), both induced a transient inhibitory effect on potential nitrification and abundance of AOB/AOA, whereas no effect was seen when PL 251 spores were used. Overall, our data suggest that the transient effect of BIOACT (R) on nitrifiers was the result of a competitive exclusion by copiotrophic microorganisms feeding on <b>co-formulants</b> rather than a direct toxicity effect.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} therefore to develop a formulation of conidia of T. asperellum with the aim of improving its efficacy. The formulations developed were oily dispersions. It was a combination of solvents consisting of groundnut oil or palm oil with structural agents and emulsifying-dispersing agents. Emulsification tests were carried out and the stability of the emulsions evaluated. The evaluation of the effect of <b>co-formulants</b> on the growth of conidia of T. asperellum was done by reading the optical densities of the formulated samples on multi-plates using a plate reader. The test on detached cocoa pods was done by treating the cocoa pods with selected formulations at 1. 107 conidia/ml and inoculation of the treated cocoa pods was done 24 hours later with zoospores of P. megakarya at 1. 105 zoospores/ml. The growth of necrosis on the fruits was measured daily. The screening of <b>co-formulants</b> and emulsification tests ended up with the selection of two formulations. The first composed of conidia of T. asperellum, groundnut oil, Tensiofix NTM® and Tensiofix 869 ®. The second differed from the first by utilisation of palm oil as the solvent. These formulations proved stable when diluted in water with 1 % and 0. 5 % of sedimentation respectively after 24 hours. The viability test of the conidia indicated that the different formulations selected did not have a fungitoxic effect. The test on detached cocoa pods showed an improved efficacy of T. asperellum to control the disease. The growth rates of necrosis were 6. 29 mm/day, 7. 25 mm/day and 31. 6 mm/day for treatment with formulation 1, pure conidia and control treated with water respectively. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
30|$|The {{reasons why}} the {{glyphosate}} in GBHs is more toxic than {{the same amount of}} glyphosate technical are generally agreed upon. Most of the surfactants used in the formulation of GBHs are designed to accelerate the movement of glyphosate across plant surface membranes and also foster the movement of glyphosate into mammalian cells [31, 35]. Many <b>co-formulants</b> are more toxic than technical glyphosate [31, 36] and synergistic activity may occur in some exposure scenarios with certain formulations. Accordingly, differential toxicity arises from variable combinations of the innate toxicity of the surfactant(s) in a GBH compared to technical glyphosate, the impact of the surfactant(s) on the movement of glyphosate through human skin and into cells, and possible synergistic impacts [30,  37 – 39].|$|R
30|$|The {{scientific}} {{debate over}} the genotoxicity and oncogenic potential of GBHs is ongoing. While both the EPA and EFSA consider the glyphosate database to be essentially complete relative to current testing requirements, critical knowledge and data gaps persist in three areas: (1) well-designed 2 -year feeding studies in mice and rats fed formulated GBHs; (2) data on occupational exposures and risk under a diversity of scenarios, including atypical but recurrent handling and application scenarios that lead to markedly elevated exposures; and (3) modern, rigorous data on the rate of skin penetration of the glyphosate and <b>co-formulants</b> in GBHs, in contrast to rates of penetration from studies conducted using technical glyphosate. Ideally, to build confidence in study results, each of the above sets of studies should be undertaken both by registrants in accord with testing guidance from regulators, and by scientists not affiliated with, or funded by pesticide registrants or their allied organizations.|$|R
40|$|A large {{variety of}} <b>co-formulants</b> {{are added to}} {{commercial}} pesticide formulations to enhance their biological effectiveness, but their impacts on the behaviour of active substances are largely unknown {{due to lack of}} regulatory measures concerning their use. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the impacts of <b>co-formulants</b> on pesticide sorption and leaching through soil. Leaching and sorption experiments were carried out using technical grade and commercial formulations of four different pesticides at various intervals from application in two soils from the Blackwood and Bishampton associations. The effects of formulation, residence time and soil type on the leaching behaviour of pesticides were all found to be highly statistically significant (p< 0. 001). Both solubility of the active substance and the type of formulation also influenced the effect of formulation on leaching behaviour of pesticides. The relative difference in mass leached between formulated and technical material of low solubility pesticides was less than that for pesticides with greater water solubility. Greater leaching losses of pesticide were observed from an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation compared to suspension concentrate (SC) formulation for the fungicide azoxystrobin. Results from sorption and desorption experiments on propyzamide in the two soils showed that the batch-equilibrium method is not suitable to study the effect of formulation on pesticide sorption. Rather it is important to use a centrifugation technique under natural moisture conditions to characterise these interactions. The effect of formulation on sorption of propyzamide was highly significant (p< 0. 001) in sandy loam soil, but there was no effect of formulation in the sandy silt loam soil when characterised by a centrifugation technique. Results suggested that any effect of formulation on pesticide sorption was not sufficient to explain fully the effect of formulation on leaching behaviour. Two-site and three-site sorption models were applied and fitted the sorption phase of the experiment well. However, the models failed to describe the observed desorption behaviour of propyzamide. These results highlight gaps in the existing knowledge about the formulation effects on pesticide sorption and leaching through soil and suggest that these effects should be considered during the risk assessment of environmental fate and behaviour of pesticides. ...|$|R
3000|$|Biocidal {{products}} are usually multi-component mixtures {{of one or}} more active substances plus a range of <b>co-formulants</b> that serve different purposes, as stabilizers, coloring agents, emulsifiers, solvents, diluents, etc. Additionally, metabolites and degradation products might be formed during and after use of a biocidal product. The overall ecotoxicity of a biocidal product might hence be significantly different from that of each individual ingredient(s) and therefore needs to be assessed during the product authorization phase. In fact, article 19 (2) of the BPR states that “the evaluation […] shall take into account the following factors: […] cumulative effects, synergistic effects.” [...] "Cumulative effects" [...] {{in the context of the}} BPR relate to effects from the same compound, emitted from different products, while [...] "synergistic effects" [...] relate to the joint action of different chemicals from one product. This is further elaborated in Annex VI (common principles for the evaluation of biocidal products) which states that the risks associated with the relevant individual components of the biocidal product shall be assessed, taking into account cumulative and synergistic effects.|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} of the field study {{was to assess the}} “specific effects of thiamethoxam”. For this purpose, the active ingredient only was used for seed dressing and not a commercial product. Commercial products typically contain various <b>co-formulants</b> to protect the active ingredient from degradation, to promote uptake by the plant (e.g. surfactants, emulsifiers) and to increase effectiveness (for example by adding piperonyl butoxide). Hence, commercial products have higher biological activity and toxicity than the active ingredient alone [3]. Furthermore, commercial neonicotinoid products can also contain fungicides which further increase toxicity and efficacy of the active ingredient. For example, the acute toxicity (LD 50, 24  h) of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid increased a 1000 -fold when co-administered with a DMI fungicide [4]. For these reasons, the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) recommended the usage of commercial products when conducting field trials [5]. Hence, the data obtained by Pilling using the active ingredient solely do not reflect a commercial situation in the field and consequently do not allow general conclusions about the impact of thiamethoxam products on bee health in the field.|$|R

Matrices such as beeswax and beebread were very little analysed despite their capacities for long-term pesticide storage. Moreover, bioavailability and transfer between in-hive matrices were poorly understood and explored. Many pesticides were studied but interactions between molecules or with other stressors were lacking. Sampling methods, targeted matrices and units of measure should have been, to some extent, standardised between publications to ease comparison and cross checking. Data on honey bee exposure to pesticides would have also benefit from the use of commercial formulations in experiments instead of active ingredients, with a special assessment of <b>co-formulants</b> (quantitative exposure and effects). Finally, the air matrix within the colony must be explored in order to complete current knowledge on honey bee pesticide exposure...|$|R
50|$|Biocidal {{products}} are often composed of mixtures {{of one or}} more active substances together with <b>co-formulants</b> such as stabilisers, preservatives and colouring agents. Since these substances may act together to produce a combination effect, an assessment of the risk from each of these substances alone may underestimate the real risk from the product as a whole. Several concepts are available for predicting the effect of a mixture on the basis of known toxicities and concentrations of the single components. Approaches for mixture toxicity assessments for regulatory purposes typically advocate assumptions of additive effects;. This means that each substance in the mixture is assumed to contribute to a mixture effect in direct proportion to its concentration and potency. In a strict sense, the assumption is thereby that all substances act by the same mode or mechanism of action. Compared to other available assumptions, this concentration addition model (or dose addition model) can be used with commonly available (eco)toxicity data and effect data together with estimates of e.g. LC50, EC50, PNEC, AEL. Furthermore, assumptions of additive effects from any given mixture are generally considered as a more precautionary approach compared to other available predictive concepts.|$|R
30|$|The {{environmental}} risk assessment of plant protection products (PPP) in the European Union (EU) relates to the individual active substances [1]. Depending {{on the outcome of}} the EU risk assessment, an active substance (a.s.) may be included in the positive list (the Annex I of the directive 91 / 414 /EEC). Only PPP containing a.s. included in this Annex I can be authorized {{at the level of the}} member states. This principle is retained in the new EU regulation 1107 / 2009 [2], which repeals directive 91 / 414 /EEC and shall apply from June 2011. The new regulation applies not only to PPP and their a.s., but also to other substances contained in commercial PPP, namely safeners, synergists, <b>co-formulants,</b> and adjuvants [2]. The four last component groups are hereafter designated additives. PPP generally represent a mixture of at least one a.s. combined with a number of different formulation additives [3]. The application of a specific PPP does therefore typically result in a potential exposure of non-target organisms to a mixture of chemicals. In addition to formulation additives, PPP can contain two or more active substances. These so-called combination products thereby constitute the specific case of mixtures of pesticidal a.s. that are deliberately released into the environment.|$|R
30|$|Effect of {{pesticides}} on the terrestrial life phase (Carsten Brühl, University of Koblenz-Landau Several amphibian species like the fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) or the common spadefoot (Pelobates fuscus) inhabit the agricultural landscape during their summer activity period, resulting in possible terrestrial exposure [2]. Owing to {{the biology of}} the species, {{it is to be}} expected that dermal exposure is the major route of exposure [17, 18]. The skin of amphibians has a unique structure and function that is not comparable to that of mammals. Since it is considerably more permeable, amphibians are more vulnerable to PPPs than other terrestrial vertebrates. The susceptibility of terrestrial amphibians has not yet been described to any great extent, although some studies have shown that PPPs at environmentally relevant concentrations can be toxic for terrestrial life stages of amphibians [19]. Postmetamorphic juvenile European common frogs were directly sprayed with different PPPs in a laboratory study. The mortality of the animals in the case of all seven PPP formulations investigated (4 fungicides, 2 herbicides and 1 insecticide) was high, reaching 100  % at field application rates and 40  % at 10  % field application rate, despite the fact that products and application quantities authorised in Germany and Switzerland have been tested [19]. The authors have noted that in addition to the active substance, <b>co-formulants</b> can also decisively influence the toxicity of PPPs to amphibians.|$|R
30|$|A {{review on}} the {{predictive}} power of CA for pesticide mixtures concluded that {{in less than}} 5 % of the published studies the experimental toxicity exceeded the predictions {{by a factor of}} 2 or more[23]. A recent reanalysis of data available to the German Federal Environment Agency evaluated the predictive power of CA for commercial pesticide products and {{came to the conclusion that}} in 50 % of the cases CA predicted the experimental toxicity correctly within a factor of 2, while in 50 % of the investigated products significant deviations of up to a factor of 800 in one situation were observed[24]. These studies do not allow estimating an IF, as it is unclear to which extent each of the factors listed above (stochaistic uncertainty, interactions, incomplete consideration of all components present) was responsible for the overall deviations between CA-predictions and observations. But as the general chance of underestimating the risk by more than a factor of 2 seems to be low for the majority of cases, an IF of 2 currently seems sufficiently protective. However, it should be pointed out, that empirical evidence on the joint effects of <b>co-formulants</b> and active ingredients of biocidal products is scarce, and more empirical evidence is urgently needed. Consequently, if available evidence is at hand, the IF might have to be set to a value greater than 2, or the IF could be decreased down to 1 for a specific product if sufficient evidence is provided (see Figure 1).|$|R

The presence of intact paraben esters in human body tissues has now been confirmed by independent measurements in human urine, and the ability of parabens to penetrate human skin intact without breakdown by esterases and to be absorbed systemically has been demonstrated through studies not only in vitro but also in vivo using healthy human subjects. Using a wide variety of assay systems in vitro and in vivo, the oestrogen agonist properties of parabens together with their common metabolite (p-hydroxybenzoic acid) have been extensively documented, and, in addition, the parabens have now also been shown to possess androgen antagonist activity, to act as inhibitors of sulfotransferase enzymes and to possess genotoxic activity. With the continued use of parabens in the majority of bodycare cosmetics, there is a need to carry out detailed evaluation of the potential for parabens, together with other oestrogenic and genotoxic <b>co-formulants</b> of bodycare cosmetics, to increase female breast cancer incidence, to interfere with male reproductive functions and to influence development of malignant melanoma which has also recently been shown to be influenced by oestrogenic stimulation.

Product approval is governed differently in these two sectors in the European Union (EU), and the occurrence of veterinary drug (VD) and pesticide residues indicated by contamination notification cases in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the EU also show characteristic differences. While the initial high numbers of VD residues reported in 2002 were successfully suppressed to less than 100 cases annually by 2006 and on, the number of notification cases for pesticide residues showed a gradual increase from a low (approximately 50 cases annually) initial level until 2005 to more than 250 cases annually after 2009, with a halt occurring only in 2016. Main notifiers of VD residues include Germany, Belgium, the UK, and Italy (63, 59, 42, and 31 notifications announced, respectively), and main consigning countries of non-compliances are Vietnam, India, China, and Brazil (88, 50, 34, and 23 notifications, respectively).

However, numerous studies have shown additive, synergistic, or antagonistic side effects between the active ingredients and their additives in formulated products; moreover, toxicity has been evidenced for various additives. Therefore, toxicological evaluation of surfactants and other additives is essential for proper environmental risk assessment of formulations used in agriculture including animal husbandry and plant protection...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Food Safety Authority, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues {{developed}} an opinion on the science to support {{the development of a}} risk assessment scheme of plant (crop) protection products on non-target terrestrial plants (NTTPs). This scientific opinion is largely a literature review on the most up-to-date knowledge of factors influencing phytotoxicity testing and risk assessment of NTTPs. Specific protection goals (SPGs) were defined for off-field, in-field and endangered species. SPGs are closely linked to ecosystem services and functions, and include maintaining provision of water regulation, food web support, aesthetic values, genetic resources and biodiversity. Gaps were identified in standard guidelines currently used in lower tier testing (tier I/II). In these guidelines, tests are conducted at the seedling/juvenile stage using mostly annual crops, and effects are recorded at the juvenile/vegetative stage under greenhouse conditions with plants grown individually or in monoculture. Endpoints measured do not include the overall effect on the whole life cycle (germinating seeds, seedling, juvenile stages, flowering, and seed production and germinability). It is also noted that it is unknown whether the following groups of organisms are covered by the plant risk assessment as it is carried out now: ferns, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, horsetails, lichens or woody species. In terms of exposure, droplet drift is considered {{to be the most important}} factor for off-field emissions to non-target areas. Models are available to calculate loadings from spray drift. Higher tier assessment is not required if the risk based on the tier II level can be managed by risk mitigation measures. When required, higher tier tests should be conducted under more realistic conditions. They may include additional laboratory/greenhouse tests (e. g. to measure reproductive endpoints or species interactions), microcosms or field experiments with experimentally or already established species. Other issues were considered, including exposure to mixtures, adjuvants, <b>co-formulants</b> and metabolites.

Pesticides {{were selected to}} give a gradient of solubility in water between 7 and 93 mg L- 1, comprising azoxystrobin (emulsifiable concentrate, EC, and suspension concentrate, SC), cyproconazole (SC), propyzamide (SC) and triadimenol (EC). Columns of sandy loam soil were leached with 6 pore volumes of 0. 01 M CaCl 2 either 1 or 7 days after treatment. Separate experiments evaluated leaching of triadimenol to full breakthrough following addition of 18 pore volumes of 0. 01 M CaCl 2. The mass of pesticide leached from columns treated with commercial formulation was significantly larger than that from columns treated with technical material for all compounds studied and for both leaching intervals (two-sided t-tests, p< 0. 001). This difference was conserved when triadimenol was leached to full breakthrough with 79 ± 1. 2 and 61 ± 3. 1 % of applied triadimenol leached from columns treated with formulated and technical material, respectively. There were highly significant effects of formulation for all pesticides (two-way ANOVA, p< 0. 001), whereas leaching interval was only significant for azoxystrobin EC formulation and cyproconazole (p < 0. 001 and 0. 021, respectively) with greater leaching when irrigation commenced 1 day after treatment. Leaching of azoxystrobin increased in the order technical material (6. 0 % of applied pesticide) < SC formulation (8. 5 - 9. 1 % of applied) < EC formulation (15. 8 - 21. 0 % of applied). The relative difference between leaching of formulated and technical pesticide increased with pesticide solubility in water, increasing from a factor of 1. 4 for the SC formulation of azoystrobin to 4. 3 for the SC formulation of triadimenol. Experimental systems differ markedly from field conditions (small columns with intense irrigation). Nevertheless, results indicate the need to consider further the influence of <b>co-formulants</b> in pesticide formulations on behaviour of the active ingredient in soil...|$|R
