Syphacia (Syphacia) helidonensis n. sp. from Pseudomys gracilicaudatus (Gould 1845) can be distinguished from all other species by a suite of characters including an oval-shaped cephalic plate, elongated laterally with dorso-ventral <b>constriction</b> <b>at</b> the level of laterally placed amphids and cephalic papillae, lateral but not cervical alae, and {{a single pair of}} postanal papillae. Syphacia (Syphacia) boodjamullaensis n. sp. from Zyzomys argurus (Thomas, 1889) also has an oval-shaped cephalic plate, elongated laterally with dorso-ventral <b>constriction</b> <b>at</b> the level of laterally placed amphids and cephalic papillae, a single pair of postanal papillae, neither cervical nor lateral alae, and spicule 77 µm long.

40|$|Glottal stops are {{conveyed}} by an abrupt <b>constriction</b> <b>at</b> {{the level of}} the glottis. Tracheoesophageal (TE) speakers are known to have poor control over the new voice source (neoglottis), and this might influence the production of 'glottal' stops. This study investigated how TE speakers realized 'glottal' stops in abutting words that end and begin with the same vowel. Ten phoneticians rated seven TE speakers' attempts to convey 'glottal' stops less favourably than two laryngeal control speakers' 'glottal' stops. Acoustic analyses showed that TE speakers relied on more gradual changes, but in 25 % of realizations, a <b>constriction</b> <b>at</b> the neoglottis, similar to the constriction found in normal speakers, was produced. It was concluded that control over the neoglottis might be greater than is generally assumed.

5000|$|The four-toed {{salamander}} can {{be recognized by}} its white underbelly sprinkled with black dots. Its back varies from orange-brownish to red-brownish; its flanks are grayish. The body and the limbs are elongated. The snout is short, and the eyes are prominent. The tail color is usually brighter than the back, and you can observe a <b>constriction</b> <b>at</b> the body/tail junction. The posterior limbs have four toes (hence its name), a good identification criterion but hard {{to use in the}} field. This species rarely exceeds 10 cm in length. The sexes are alike except for the shape of the head. Males have elongated and almost square snouts, whereas the females' snouts are short and round. The juveniles show a tail shorter than the body.The {{four-toed salamander}} can be easily mistaken for the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus) in the wild.

40|$|During {{symmetric}} division cells undergo large <b>constriction</b> deformations <b>at</b> {{a stable}} midcell site. Using a variational approach, we investigate the mechanical route for symmetric constriction by computing the bending energy of deformed vesicles with rotational symmetry. Forces required for constriction are explicitly computed at constant area and constant volume, {{and their values}} {{are found to be}} determined by cell size and bending modulus. For cell-sized vesicles, considering typical bending modulus of [Formula: see text], we calculate constriction forces in the range [Formula: see text]. The instability of symmetrical constriction is shown and quantified with a characteristic coefficient of the order of [Formula: see text], thus evidencing that cells need a robust mechanism to stabilize <b>constriction</b> <b>at</b> midcell...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of conditions resulting in bobbed phenotypes on nucleolar RNA synthesis {{and the formation}} of <b>constrictions</b> <b>at</b> nucleolus organizers was examined in larval tissues of Droso-phila melanogaster. By means of [3 H]uridine incorporation and autoradiographic analysis, a mutation at the bobbed locus was shown to limit the rate of nucleolar RNA synthesis in salivary glands of XO larvae. The formation of <b>constrictions</b> <b>at</b> the organizer sites of a 4 -nucleolus-organizer stock was monitored in dividing neuroblast cells stained with acridine orange. Loss of the ribosomal cistrons had been reported by other workers when such stocks were maintained for several generations. In the first generation in our work, <b>constrictions</b> were visible <b>at</b> only 2 of the 4 nucleolus organizers. This situation persisted until the fifth generation, when con-strictions appeared at all 4 of the organizer sites. An increase in the rate of nucleolar RNA synthesis in the salivary glands was temporally correlated with the appearance of the extra constrictions. We interpret these observations to mean that 2 of the organizers of the 4 -nucleolus-organizer stock were caused to function through the loss of ribosomal RNA cistrons; thus the functional status of an organizer would appear to be subject to control...|$|R
