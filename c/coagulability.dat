50|$|The {{mechanism}} behind RVT is {{no different}} from other types of blood clots {{in other parts of the}} body. Rudolf Virchow, was the first to describe the physiological mechanism behind venous thrombosis (blood clots) using three related factors, known as Virchow's Triad; damage to the blood vessel (endothelial damage), decrease in blood flow (stasis) and increased <b>coagulability</b> of the blood (thrombophilia or hypercoagulability). it is possible for one of these factors alone to cause a blood clot, but in most cases, a combination or all of these factors induce the formation of a blood clot. Decreased urine output or renal function may be the only observable symptoms caused by a blood clot renal vein. Other less common causes include hypercoagulable state, invasion by renal cell cancer, renal transplantation, behcet syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or blunt trauma to the back or abdomen.|$|E
50|$|The {{cholesterol}} thus esterified with abnormal {{fatty acids}} is less easily eliminated and so leads to atheroma. Phospholipids containing abnormal fatty acids are also less easily eliminated {{and so are}} retained in the plasma and increase the <b>coagulability</b> of blood, thereby contributing to coronary and cerebral thrombosis. The deficiency of normal phospholipids in the epidermis and gut makes their structure faulty and so may contribute to seborrhoeic eczema and peptic ulcer. Similarly, deficiency of normal phospholipids or the presence of abnormal phospholipids in the nervous system leads to defective structure, including demyelination, which would cause multiple sclerosis and possibly mental illness. Deficiency of EFAs may increase susceptibility to X-ray and chemical carcinogens, the former {{in conjunction with the}} latter leading to leukaemia and the latter to carcinoma of the bronchus and to the predominance of carcinoma of the stomach in males, the male requirement for EFAs being about five times that of the female.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} {{batroxobin}} from different species are slightly different. There {{will be an}} overview of two different snakes, Bothrops atrox and Bothrops moojeni. When injected with batroxobin there will be major symptoms affecting the hemostatic system. Batroxobin from Bothrops atrox mediates the formation of fibrin I. This then renders the blood more prone to coagulation. An overdose will lead to excessive blood-clotting, which can result in bleeding due to damage to blood vessels or even thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The clots can also cause secondary organ damage, such as renal damage or intracerebral hemorrhage. If the dose is high enough this will eventually lead to death. In the case of batroxobin from the Bothrops moojeni also formation of fibrin I is mediated, however {{there is also a}} release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). This results in a rapid degradation of fibrin I and a lowered fibrinogen concentration. Which leads to a reduction of blood viscosity and blood <b>coagulability.</b> The blood is thinner and there is an increased tendency to bleed and to leak blood. Hypovolemic shock could occur. This shock can cause organs to stop working and eventually lead to death.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{values that}} {{represent}} clot formation {{are determined by}} this test: the reaction time (R value), the K value, the angle and the maximum amplitude (MA). The R value represents the time until the first evidence of a clot is detected. The K value is the time {{from the end of}} R until the clot reaches 20mm and this represents the speed of clot formation. The angle is the tangent of the curve made as the K is reached and offers similar information to K. The MA is a reflection of clot strength. A mathematical formula determined by the manufacturer can be used to determine a Coagulation Index (CI) (or overall assessment of <b>coagulability)</b> which takes into account the relative contribution of each of these 4 values into 1 equation.The G-value is a log-derivation of the MA and is meant to also represent the clot strength using dynes/sec as its units. There are some studies which suggest that an elevated G-value is associated with a hypercoagulable state and therefore increases the risk for venous thromboembolic disease. However, there are no studies dosing of prophylactic heparin products based on the G-value. TEG also measures clot lysis which is reported as both the estimated percent lysis (EPL) and the percentage of clot which has actually lysed after 30 minutes (LY 30,%). Although a normal EPL can be as high as 15% and a normal LY 30 can be has high as 8%, some studies in the trauma population suggest that a LY30 greater than 3% is associated with risk of hemorrhage.|$|E

40|$|The blood {{coagulation}} {{system of}} 66 consecutive patients undergoing consecutive liver transplantations was monitored by thrombelastograph and analytic coagulation profile. A poor preoperative coagulation state, decrease {{in levels of}} coagulation factors, progressive fibrinolysis, and whole blood clot lysis were observed during the preanhepatic and anhepatic stages of surgery. A further general decrease in coagulation factors and platelets, activation of fibrinolysis, and abrupt decrease in levels of factors V and VIII occurred before and with reperfusion of the homograft.

In the treatment of Heyde’s syndrome using TAVI, when coagulation dysfunction not detected by common testing methods continues during the acute postoperative phase, the risk of hemorrhagic complications is increased {{and the use of}} oral antiplatelet agents is difficult.

Adult Sprague Dawley rats were anesthetized and subjected to a cardiac arrest and resuscitation (A/R) protocol. During the study, arterial blood gases, heart rate, and blood pressure were monitored prior to cardiac arrest (PRE) and for two hours following resuscitation. Blood samples were taken at PRE, R 60 and R 120 to assess whole blood <b>coagulability</b> using thromboelastography (TEG). Twenty six A/R experiments were conducted. Five animals could not be resuscitated and two others did not survive the two hour recovery period. For the survivors, most (13 / 19) demonstrated a significant increase in <b>coagulability</b> (Coagulation Index, CI) during recovery.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{undertook}} {{this study}} to determine whether changes in blood <b>coagulability</b> associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease are due to contact with the atherosclerotic arterial wall or passage through distal ischemic tissue. METHODS: Thirty patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease undergoing angiography participated in the study. Ankle-brachial pressure index was recorded before intervention. Blood samples taken from the aorta, common femoral artery, and common femoral vein were analyzed at thromboelastography. Angiograms were scored for stenotic disease by a radiologist blinded to the other results. RESULTS: When femoral artery samples were compared with aortic samples there was a decrease in reaction time (R; P <. 05), an increase in maximum amplitude (MA; P <. 05), {{and an increase in}} coagulation index (CI; P <. 002), indicating an increase in <b>coagulability</b> as blood flowed down the iliac segment. These changes also correlated (DeltaR, r = 0. 442, P <. 05; DeltaMA, r = 0. 379, P <. 05; DeltaCI, r = 0. 429, P <. 05) with the severity of disease in the ipsilateral iliac segment. Significant differences in R (P <. 05), angle (P <. 05), MA (P <. 005), and CI (P <. 001) between common femoral arterial and venous samples confirmed that venous samples were more coagulable in this group of patients. This difference in Thromboelastography parameters across the arteriovenous segment correlated inversely with the degree of ischemia (represented by ankle-brachial pressure index; DeltaCI, r = - 0. 427, P <. 05; DeltaMA, r = - 0. 370, P <. 05) in the puncture side limb. CONCLUSION: Passage of blood down an atherosclerotic artery leads to an increase in <b>coagulability</b> proportional to the degree of stenosis in that vessel. Passage of blood through ischemic tissue may also contribute to increased <b>coagulability</b> in peripheral arterial occlusive disease...|$|E

Although the hypercoagulability {{may contribute to the}} thrombogenesis, it has not been fully investigated {{due to a lack of}} a sensitive evaluation modality. Recently a novel dielectric blood coagulometry (DBCM) was invented for evaluating the <b>coagulability</b> by measuring the temporal change in whole blood dielectric permittivity. We evaluated the utility of the DBCM for identifying the <b>coagulability.</b> For fundamental experiments, 133 citrated blood samples were drawn from subjects with or without heparin administration. A DBCM analysis was performed to find the adequate coagulation index, and to delineate its measurement range by adding recombinant human tissue factor (TF) or heparin. Then the <b>coagulability</b> was assessed by DBCM and conventional coagulation assays in 84 subjects without AF, who were divided into 3 groups by their CHADS 2 score. Another 17 patients who received warfarin were also assessed by DBCM to evaluate the effect of anticoagulants. We calculated the derivative of the dielectric permittivity change after recalcification, and extracted the end of acceleration time (EAT) as a novel index. The EAT showed a dose-dependent shortening with the addition of serial dilutions of TF (× 10 - 2 to × 10 - 4), and a dose-dependent prolongation with the addition of heparin (0. 05 to 0. 15 U/ml). The EAT was significantly shorter in the higher CHADS 2 score group (19. 8 ± 4. 8, 18. 6 ± 3. 1, and 16. 3 ± 2. 7 min in the CHADS 2 = 0, 1, and ≥ 2 groups, respectively, p = 0. 0065 by ANOVA).

We {{evaluated}} <b>coagulability</b> {{as determined}} by platelet-dependent thrombin generation in hypercholesterolemic patients before and after treatment with pravastatin and in hypertriglyceridemic patients to investigate the usefulness of <b>coagulability</b> as an index of atherosclerosis and to determine the importance of treating hyperlipidemia. Background. An understanding {{of the interaction between}} platelets and the plasma coagulation system is important for clarifying the mechanism of the procoagulant process. Methods. We assessed <b>coagulability</b> in 58 patients with hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol level ≥ 220 mg/dl, age 56. 5 ± 1. 5 years [mean ± SEM]), 37 patients with hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride level ≥ 200 mg/dl, age 59. 5 ± 1. 7 years), 13 patients with hypercholesterolemia plus hypertriglyceridemia (age 51. 4 ± 3. 1 years) and 75 normal subjects (age 52. 2 ± 1. 7 years). We also studied platelet-dependent thrombin generation in patients with hypercholesterolemia before and after treatment with pravastatin. Calcium chloride was added to 0. 5 ml of platelet-rich plasma (150 × 109 /liter) to initiate coagulation. Ten microliters of the sample was transferred into 90 μl of 3. 8 % sodium citrate at 10 -min intervals for 30 min. A chromogenic substrate, S- 2238, was added to each sample, and absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 405 nm to determine thrombin generation. Results. Platelet-dependent thrombin generation was increased in patients with hypercholesterolemia and patients with hypercholesterolemia plus hypertriglyceridemia (p < 0. 01) compared with patients with hypertriglyceridemia and control subjects.

Background. It is important to investigate the interaction of platelets and the coagulation factors to clarify the processes of the coagulation system in detail. Methods. Platelet-rich plasma (150 × 109 /liter), 0. 5 ml, was prepared, and 40 mmol/liter of calcium chloride was added to initiate clotting, S- 2238 was added to each sample in a microtiter plate every 10 min, and the absorbance of the released color product at 2 min was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 405 nm using a microtiter plate reader as thrombin generation. We measured the platelet-dependent thrombin generation in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus grouped according to glycemic control. Results. Platelet-dependent thrombin generation at 30 min after calcium chloride addition was significantly higher in 23 patients with poorly glycemic-controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy (hemoglobin [Hb] A 1 c⩾ 9. 0 %) than in 46 healthy normal subjects (448 ± 75 vs. 165 ± 28 mU/min, p < 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} three polyspecific antivenoms for bites by pit vipers. DESIGN: Randomised double blind comparative trial of three antivenoms. SETTING: Shell, Pastaza, southeastern Ecuador. PARTICIPANTS: 210 patients with incoagulable blood were recruited from 221 consecutive patients admitted with snake bite between January 1997 and December 2001. INTERVENTION: One of three antivenoms manufactured in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, chosen for their preclinical potency against Ecuadorian venoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Permanent restoration of blood <b>coagulability</b> after 6 and 24 hours. RESULTS: The snakes responsible for the bites were identified in 187 cases: 109 patients (58 %) were bitten by Bothrops atrox, 68 (36 %) by B bilineatus, and 10 (5 %) by B taeniatus, B brazili, or Lachesis muta. Eighty seven patients (41 %) received Colombian antivenom, 82 (39 %) received Brazilian antivenom, but only 41 (20 %) received Ecuadorian antivenom because the supply was exhausted. Two patients died, and 10 developed local necrosis. All antivenoms achieved the primary end point of permanently restoring blood <b>coagulability</b> by 6 or 24 hours {{after the start of}} treatment in > 40 % of patients. Colombian antivenom, however, was the most effective after initial doses of 20 ml (two vials), < 70 ml, and any initial dose at both 6 and 24 hours. An initial dose of 20 ml of Colombian antivenom permanently restored blood <b>coagulability</b> in 64 % (46 / 72) of patients after 6 hours (P = 0. 054 compared with the other two antivenoms) and an initial dose of < 70 ml was effective at 6 hours (65 %, P = 0. 045) and 24 hours (99 %, P = 0. 06). Early anaphylactoid reactions were common (53 %, 73 %, and 19 %, respectively, for Brazilian, Colombian, and Ecuadorian antivenoms, P < 0. 0001) but only three reactions were severe and none was fatal.
