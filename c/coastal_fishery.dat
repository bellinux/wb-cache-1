40|$|Extract] Although the <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> of the Pacific Island {{countries}} and territories (PICTs) differ considerably from the industrial tuna fisheries of the region (Chapter 8), the importance of <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> cannot be overstated. Throughout the tropical Pacific, <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> contribute significantly to the food security, livelihoods, and culture of both rural communities and urban populations. In the majority of PICTs, fish consumption by coastal communities exceeds 50 kg per person per year, and is > 90 kg per person per year in six PICTs. In comparison, average global fish consumption per person is 16 – 18 kg per year. Not surprisingly, therefore, <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> in the tropical Pacific are based mainly on subsistence activities to provide fish and invertebrates for household food. Nevertheless, an average of 47...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the status}} of <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> was {{examined}} based on the catch and number of fishing vessels of <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> in Korea. Comparing the status on <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> of the East Sea, Yellow Sea and South Sea in Korea, scientific evidence was made for <b>fisheries</b> management on <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> based on characteristics of each sea area.

In order of catch by <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries,</b> gillnet (36. 7 %) was the primary <b>fishery,</b> followed by <b>coastal</b> complex (24. 7 %), stow net (18. 3 %), trap (12. 9 %), lift net (3. 9 %), purse seine (3. 0 %) and beam trawl (0. 4 %) fisheries.

40|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> and {{sea cage}} {{aquaculture}} coexist along the coastal zone, {{and it has}} been suggested that wild fish feed on excess feed around farms. If this occurs, the condition of wild fish can increase and their lipid profile can become modified. However, the influence of fishfarming on <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> has not been described in detail. Four targeted species of different trophic gilds, Sardinella aurita, Caranx rhonchus, Mullus barbatus, and Pomatomus saltatrix were studied and the lipid profiles of individuals captured by <b>coastal</b> <b>fisheries</b> and around fish farms were compared. Results show that fish captured at farms showed increased levels of total lipids and/or the terrestrial fatty acids contained in feed pellets.

40|$|A <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> brings high {{productivity}} and economic profit while supporting cultural norms.

Despite their different historical backgrounds, the two regions have lost most of the oyster resource due mainly to 1) failure of environmental management, 2) environmental degradation and 3) resistance of the fishing communities to necessary changes in fishing methods and aquaculture. Based on these lessons, I propose that a <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> management plan should include environmental management, development of government-initiated aquaculture, understanding cultural backgrounds, and cooperation among science, industry and politics as essential factors...|$|E
40|$|Research PaperIn {{the last}} three decades <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> has created employment, {{provided}} a supply of good quality animal protein for Thai people. The fishery resources of Thailand are treated as common property, anyone can take benefit from these resources. They are, therefore, heavily exploited by fishers who employ various types of fishing gear. Arising from the development of Thai <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> and the increasing in number of coastal fishers, two severe problems, i. e., the fishery resources depletion problem and the conflicts among fishers problem now exist. So far, the management of <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> is centralized. The Department of Fisheries (DOF) is the sole agency in managing <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> and all of the management measures has established by the DOF without consulting with the fishers or other stakeholders. Thus, the DOF is hardly to get a satisfy success in <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> resources conservation and management. Therefore, in order to achieve the sustainable development of <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery,</b> a new approach of management should be considered. In late 1993, with the financial support of the Asian Productivity Organization (APO), Prof. Tadashi Yamamoto is invited to Thailand for providing technical assistances on community-based fishery management, fishing right and decentralization management to DOF officials and instructors of the Faculty of Fisheries. In early 1994, the DOF set up several committees for establishing a decentralize management. Owing to the reshuffle of the DOF Director General and the economic crisis of the country, the progress of the development is very limited although the present Constitution is clearly mentioned that the government has to manage the natural resources and environment through decentralization. In late 2003, with political reason, the DOF is pushed by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Co-operatives to develop fishery co-management and fishing rights system for <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery.</b> Then, several committees again have been established and each committee has his own assignment. Many instructors from universities and stakeholders are invited {{to be a member of}} committees. To support the decentralization approach, a Provincial Fishery Management Committee is established in every coastal province with the mandate of managing the fishery in provincial fishing ground. The members of provincial committee include small-scale fishers, commercial fishers, chairman of Tumbon (Sub-district) Administrative Organization (TAO), instructor from universities, researcher from DOF and other stakeholders. Instructors and researchers act as technical advisor only and they will not engage in committee voting. At present, Thai Fisheries Cooperatives are not active in fishery management due to the constraints on legal framework and fisheries cooperatives management. To develop the decentralization management in Thailand may require time and considerable cost because there are many problems to be solved. This is the great challenges to everybody concern...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to explore the present {{situation}} of the coastal small-scale fishery in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka and to bring an overall picture of the coastal small-scale fishery. To attain this, a strength, weakness, opportunity and threat matrix was formulated. The study also point out the main bottlenecks of sustainable fishery development. Finally the study recommends {{ways to improve the}} present situation. The study used case study research methodology. The study involved interviews with thirty nine Northern fishermen. The primary data were collected using a questionnaire. The secondary data were retrieved from internet sources. Once the data were collected, they were edited, coded and summarized. Microsoft Excel was then used to analyze the data. Data were then presented by way of tables and figures. The first objective was to explore present situation of the <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> of the Northern Province. The findings revealed the situation in terms of marine resources, fishing methods, fishing communities and fishery production trend. The second objective sought to formulate a SWOT matrix and to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the Northern <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> for sustainable development. The study showed that the <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> of the Northern Province is characterized by range of SWOT elements. Strengths include the potential new marine resources, effective policy implementation tools in place, established markets and infrastructure and strong local ecological knowledge. Weaknesses include the lack of reliable data and declining catches, strong dependency on middlemen, large post harvest losses and lack of extension services. The locally growing demand for fish and organizational supports represent opportunities. Finally, this study showed that intrusion of Indian fishermen, IUU fishing by the Northern fishermen, prolonged ethnic conflict and climate change are the threats for the sustainable development of the <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> of Sri Lanka. The third and fourth objectives sought to uncover the main bottlenecks of sustainable fishery development and to recommend ways to improve the present situation for the sustainable development of the <b>coastal</b> <b>fishery</b> respectively...|$|E
