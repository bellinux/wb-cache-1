40|$|The "angle " {{we have in}} mind is a gnomon, a planar {{region that}} has the general shape of a <b>carpenter</b> f <b>s</b> <b>square.</b> At the time of Pythagoras, a <b>carpenter</b> f <b>s</b> <b>square</b> was in fact called a gnomon. The term came from Babylonia, where it {{originally}} referred to the vertically placed bar that cast the shadow on a sundial. The ancient Greeks also inherited {{a large body of}} algebra from the Babylonians, which they proceeded to recast into geometric terms. The gnomon became a recurrent figure in the Greek geometric algebra. There are several reasons why Babylonian algebra was not adopted as it was, principally the discovery of irrationals: an irrational was acceptable to the Greeks as a length but not as a number. A secondary reason but, nevertheless, one of significance, was the Greek "delight in the tangible and visible " [2], In this note we shall attempt to make the numbers F ± = 1, F 2 ~ 1 » F 3 = 2, [...] . in the Fibonacci sequence "tangible and visible " by representing each Fm with a gnomon. These figures will enable us geometrically to derive or interpret many of the standard identities for the Fibonacci numbers. The ideas work equally well for the Lucas numbers and other generalized Fibonacci number sequences. The gnomons we shall associate with the Fibonacci numbers are depicted in Figure 1. The angular shape that represents the mth Fibonacci number will be called the Fm-gnomon. In particular, "observe " the FQ = 0 -gnomon! F, m F 3 rxi F...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of our work on H∞-optimal control problems. In two previous articles a controller degree bound was established for problems in which both P 12 (s) and P 21 (<b>s)</b> are <b>square</b> (problems of the first kind). Here we switch our attention to problems of the second kind. We allow P 12 (s) to have more rows than columns (with P 21 (<b>s)</b> <b>square),</b> or alternatively, we allow P 12 (s) to have more columns than rows (with P 12 (<b>s)</b> <b>square).</b> Our main result shows that the degree bound derived previously for problems of the first kind carries over to problems of the second kind without change. Our analysis suggests a number of modifications which are easily made to currently available computer programs. Test calculations (for problems of the second kind) show that these improvements result in a marked reduction in computation time and also enhance the numerical robustness of the software...|$|R
