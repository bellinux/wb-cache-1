5|$|At {{the time}} Johnson {{submitted}} the <b>contributory</b> negligence defense, {{he had not}} yet been able to speak to Polehinke himself. By the time newspapers reported on the court documents, Johnson said he had already told Royse, who criticized the statements, that he would withdraw the argument. Prior to his employment by Comair, Polehinke worked for Gulfstream International as a captain.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the revolt}} {{inspired}} social reforms. In 1898 two measures of social legislation were {{passed by the}} minister of the treasury of Di Rudini’s cabinet, Luigi Luzzatti. The industrial workmen’s compensation scheme from 1883 was made obligatory with the employer bearing all costs; and a voluntary fund for <b>contributory</b> disability and old age pensions was created.|$|E
5|$|The speech {{itself has}} since been praised for its use of {{political}} rhetoric, and is considered a landmark moment in {{the independence of the}} Congo. It has also been cited as a <b>contributory</b> factor to the subsequent Congo Crisis and in Lumumba's murder in 1961. Since its deliverance, the speech has been widely reprinted and has been depicted in paintings and film.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} end-of-life care, Brady died of restrictive {{pulmonary disease}} in Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017. On 21 September 2017, the inquest {{found that he}} {{died of natural causes}} and his hunger strike had not been a <b>contributory</b> factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not a cause for concern. Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} <b>contributory</b> {{factor in}} schizophrenia, {{potentially}} causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Stein's {{body was}} {{returned}} to Glasgow, where his funeral took place on 13 September 1985. In later years {{it was revealed that}} it was not a heart attack, but rather pulmonary oedema (fluid in the lungs) as a result of heart disease that caused Stein's death. Stein had stopped taking the diuretic medication prescribed for this in the days leading up to the game, which has been suggested as a <b>contributory</b> factor to his eventual collapse.|$|E
5|$|As Zahir {{consolidated}} {{his power}} and reduced external threats to his rule in the 1760s, his sons aspired for more influence and ultimately fought against their father and each other {{in order to secure}} their place as Zahir's successor. Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a <b>contributory</b> role to his downfall in 1775. Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged his power.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the action, Venerable was towed off the shoreline and back to Gibraltar for repairs, while the remainder of the British squadron restored the British blockade of the French and Spanish ships in Cadiz, returning the situation to that in place before the battle. This British victory, coming so soon after Saumarez's defeat in Algeciras harbour, did much to restore parity in the region and the heavy casualties inflicted on the Spanish were to contribute to a weakening of the Franco-Spanish alliance which was a <b>contributory</b> factor in the signing of Treaty of Amiens, which brought the war to a temporary halt early the following year. In France, despite the heavy Spanish losses, the battle was celebrated as a victory, with Troude widely praised and promoted for the defence of his ship.|$|E
5|$|Locusts {{have formed}} plagues since prehistory. The Ancient Egyptians carved {{them on their}} tombs and the insects are {{mentioned}} in the Iliad, the Bible and the Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and been a <b>contributory</b> cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control {{are based on the}} use of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} <b>contributory</b> cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E
5|$|Shein's army {{retreated to}} its main camp, {{which was in}} turn {{surrounded}} by Commonwealth forces in mid-October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry {{had been sent to}} disrupt the Russian rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian camp as responsible for their inaction and ineffectiveness (Jasienica blames the Russian warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries). The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a <b>contributory</b> factor, with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homes. Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{expansion of}} Birmingham {{city has been}} a large <b>contributory</b> factor to Worcestershire's fluid boundary changes and associated housing issues. Balsall Heath was followed into Birmingham by Quinton Urban District in November 1909, and then by both the Rural District of Yardley and {{the greater part of}} the Urban District of King's Norton and Northfield. These latter transfers into the city were as part of the Greater Birmingham Act on 9 November 1911, which saw a considerable expansion of the city into its surrounding districts. As a consequence of the transfer to Birmingham; these areas (and Balsall Heath) were regarded as part of Warwickshire, though Birmingham's status as a 'county borough' ensured these areas were not administered by Warwickshire County Council.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a <b>contributory</b> cause.|$|E
5|$|Applewood Farm is a {{farmstead}} in Ledyard, Connecticut, United States. Constructed in 1826 by Russel Gallup, {{the farmhouse}} was built with a colonial center chimney design with Federal style details {{that has been}} modernized to the early 20th century without significantly changing the floor plan. Named after the apple orchards planted by Russel Gallup, Applewood Farm developed significantly under the ownership of Everett Gallup, the last {{member of the family}} to own the property. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen and a 40-acre parcel was sold off in November 1984. After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 1987, the property included five <b>contributory</b> structures, the farmhouse, corn crib, barn, silo and chicken coop. The property also has one non-contributing structure, a machinery shed from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{were formed}} in 2005 {{by a group}} of Manchester United {{supporters}} following the club's controversial takeover by Malcolm Glazer which led to hundreds of supporters defecting from the club. Without a stadium of their own they agreed to use Bury's Gigg Lane stadium, but the agreement continued at the cost of approximately £5,000 per match. Within a year, the fan-owned club set aspirations to build its own 7,000 to 10,000 capacity stadium as close to Manchester city centre as possible by 2012 and consequently entered into negotiations with New East Manchester and Manchester City Council to develop their plans. Despite attendances averaging over 2,000 in their first few seasons, the fact that the club did not have access to a stadium of its own on its match days was a <b>contributory</b> factor in the club's financial loss for three years (£42,267 in 2007, £40,669 in 2008 and £9,663 in 2009).|$|E
5|$|In 677 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was {{expelled}} from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria. Another <b>contributory</b> factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of Æthelthryth's entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her the veil, the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. Æthelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues {{that they had been}} part of the queen's dower lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover. The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{arrival of}} aggressive new enemies– Turks {{in the east}} and Normans in the west– was another <b>contributory</b> factor. In 1040, the Normans, originally landless mercenaries from northern parts of Europe in search of plunder, began attacking Byzantine strongholds in southern Italy. In order to deal with them, a mixed force of mercenaries and conscripts under the formidable George Maniakes was sent to Italy in 1042. Maniakes and his army conducted a brutally successful campaign, but before it could be concluded he was recalled to Constantinople. Angered by a series of outrages against his wife and property by one of his rivals, he was proclaimed emperor by his troops, and led them across the Adriatic to victory against a loyalist army. However, a mortal wound led to his death shortly afterwards. With opposition thus absent in the Balkans, the Normans were able to complete the expulsion of the Byzantines from Italy by 1071.|$|E

25|$|Redgrave v Hurd raises another question, about <b>contributory</b> {{negligence}} {{under the}} Law Reform (<b>Contributory</b> Negligence) Act 1945. In the case, Mr Redgrave's mistake {{was referred to}} as innocent misrepresentation, though it is very arguable that it was at least negligent. Was it negligent of Mr Hurd to not check the papers as well? Had Mr Redgrave been fraudulent, it is clear that any negligence on Mr Hurd's part could not affect his right to compensation. However damages for negligent misrepresentation and damages under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) can.|$|E
25|$|<b>Contributory</b> {{negligence}} is a mitigatory defence, whereby a claimant's damages {{are reduced}} {{in accordance with}} the percentage of contribution made by the claimant to the loss or damage suffered. Thus, in evaluating a collision between two vehicles, for example, if the wronged driver were not wearing a seatbelt, he would most likely be contributorily negligent. The court will then quantify the damages for the actual loss or damage sustained, and then reduce the amount paid to the claimant by 20%. <b>Contributory</b> negligence can also function as a full defence, when it is assessed at 100%, as in Jayes v IMI Kynoch.|$|E
