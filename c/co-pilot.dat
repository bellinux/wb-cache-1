5|$|On 10 June 1990, British Airways Flight 5390, a BAC One-Eleven flight between Birmingham and Málaga, {{suffered}} a windscreen blowout {{due to the}} fitting of incorrect bolts the previous day. The Captain, Tim Lancaster, suffered major injuries after being partially blown out of the aircraft, but the <b>co-pilot</b> landed the plane safely at Southampton Airport.

40|$|This chapter aims to {{introduce}} {{and discuss the}} concept of <b>co-piloting</b> applied to the specific context of automobile driver assistance. For {{the past few years}} we have seen a massive inflow of embedded information devices (at the forefront of which are the navigational aid systems), as well as the emergence of technologies for the partial automation of driving (such as automatic speed regulators). All these evolutions makes the development of integrated <b>co-piloting</b> devices necessary, and that is able to harmoniously cooperate with the driver and can adapt their aid according to the driving context...|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and <b>co-pilot</b> had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E

Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet called a TX-204 Target Carrying Aircraft that docks with Fireflash in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings to board the hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.|$|E
5|$|In July 1950, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam as a deterrent to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, and possible future use in Korea. They were loaded with Mark 4 nuclear bombs, but without the fissile cores. Travis was one of twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 Superfortress 44-87651 when it commenced take off from Fairfield-Suisun at 2200 on 5 August 1950.
