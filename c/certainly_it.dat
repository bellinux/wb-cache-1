5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less <b>certainly,</b> <b>it</b> has been argued that Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. <b>Certainly</b> <b>it</b> was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>it</b> is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E

5|$|Maslama then disappears {{from the}} sources and re-emerges in 725, shortly after Yazid's {{death and the}} {{accession}} of Hisham, who sent Maslama to replace al-Djarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami in the Caucasus front against the Khazars. Initially, however, Maslama was mostly active in the Byzantine front, and {{the war against the}} Khazars was delegated to al-Harith ibn Amr al-Ta'i. In winter 725, Maslama led an expedition against Asia Minor from Melitene, which culminated in the sack of Caesarea on 13 January 726. Along with the capture of Gangra by Abdallah al-Battal in 727, {{this was one of the}} major successes of Arab arms against the Byzantines in the 720s. A few months later, he also led the otherwise unremarkable northern summer expedition into Byzantine territory. In 727–728, his attention was diverted by Khazar attacks which reached deep into Azerbaijan. Although Maslama was able to drive them back and recover control of the Darial Pass, his 728 campaign across the Caucasus was difficult, bloody and indecisive. Maslama's troops were reportedly engaged in up to thirty or forty days of constant fighting in miserable weather, and although he claimed victory in a battle over the Khazar khagan himself, the expedition did not achieve any results, and came close to being defeated. <b>Certainly</b> <b>it</b> did little to stop Khazar attacks south of the Caucasus, which resumed in 729. Maslama was removed from office in the same year, and replaced by al-Djarrah. He is then recorded by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor as having been responsible for the sack of the fortress of Charsianon in late 730, but Arab sources credit Mu'awiya ibn Hisham for this act.|$|E

25|$|We have {{no doubt}} that if the Legislature of this State should {{undertake}} to proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution.

25|$|He {{subsequently}} {{qualified as}} a pilot in June 1911, after 19 lessons. On March 12, 1912, he enlisted in the French military and received his military pilot's license at Avord, France, in January 1913. Although only a corporal, {{he was one of}} France's most experienced military pilots. He originally flew reconnaissance and night-time bombing missions while assigned to fly prewar Bleriots with Escadrille (squadron) BL30. The night flying missions were some of the first ever, and his experience probably accounted for this assignment. <b>Certainly</b> <b>it</b> saved his life, when on October 30, 1914, his engine was destroyed by a direct hit from 77mm cannon fire.

The favour of the emperor procured him the countenance of some of the worst creatures at the imperial courtamong them of the notorious Crispinus, and probably (<b>certainly</b> <b>it</b> is thrilling to consider) of Paris, the supposed author of Juvenal's exile, for whose monument Martial afterwards wrote a eulogistic epitaph. The two books, numbered by editors xiii. and xiv., and known by the names of Xenia and Apophoretainscriptions in two lines each for presentswere published at the Saturnalia of 84. In 86 he bore for the world the first two of the twelve books on which his pendulous and sterling reputation rests.|$|E

[...] This suggests the presence of General Claude Jacques Lecourbe 's Corps, including the forces of generals Laval, Molitor, Jardon, and VanDamme. [...] This is also confirmed in an extract of Moreau's dispatch to the French Minister of War, published in the London Chronicle, 10 June 1800. [...] "The 6th chasseurs, 13th cavalry, 4th hussars and 11th chasseurs distinguished themselves in this affair. [...] The rest of the division, and that of LeClere, passed rapidly the Danube...

The image of gays retaliating against police, {{after so many years}} of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, [...] "stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals". Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, [...] "Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. <b>Certainly</b> <b>it</b> was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale." [...] David Carter, in his article [...] "What made Stonewall different", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.|$|E

[...] He was introduced to the Empress Maria Theresa in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At age60, he retired to Durham, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. [...] Boruwłaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. Boruwłaski remarked [...] "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but <b>certainly</b> <b>it</b> be another body". He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruwłaski. Lambert enquired after Boruwłaski's wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied [...] "No, she is dead, and I am not very sorry, for when I affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment." ...|$|E
