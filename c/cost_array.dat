40|$|A new {{bounding}} {{procedure for}} the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is described which extends the Hungarian method for the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) to QAPs, {{operating on the}} four dimensional <b>cost</b> <b>array</b> of the QAP objective function. The QAP is iteratively transformed {{in a series of}} equivalent QAPs leading to an increasing sequence of lower bounds for the original problem. To this end, two classes of operations which transform the four dimensional <b>cost</b> <b>array</b> are defined. These have the property that the values of the transformed objective function Z' are the corresponding values of the old objective function Z, shifted by some amount C. In the case that all entries of the transformed <b>cost</b> <b>array</b> are non-negative, then C is a lower bound for the initial QAP. If, moreover, there exists a feasible solution U to the QAP, such that its value in the transformed problem is zero, then C is the optimal value of Z and U is an optimal solution for the original QAP. The transformations are iteratively applied until no significant increase in constant C as above is found, resulting in the so called Dual Procedure (DP). Several strategies are listed for appropriately determining C, or equivalently, transforming the <b>cost</b> <b>array.</b> The goal is the modification of the elements in the <b>cost</b> <b>array</b> so as to obtain new equivalent problems which bring the QAP closer to solution. In some cases the QAP is actually solved, though solution is not guaranteed. The close relationship between the DP and the Linear Programming formulation of Adams and Johnson is presented. The DP attempts to solve Adams and Johnsons CLP, a continuous relaxation of a linearization of the QAP. This explains why the DP produces bounds close to the optimum values for CLP calculated by Johnson in her dissertation and by [...] ...|$|E

40|$|When {{restricted}} to <b>cost</b> <b>arrays</b> possessing the sum Monge property, many combinatorial optimization problems with sum objective functions become significantly easier to solve. (An array A = fa[i; j]g possesses the sum Monge property if {{for all i}} ! k and j ! `, a[i; j] + a[k; `] a[i; `] + a[k; j].) Examples include the usual sum-objective-function versions of the assignment problem, the transportation problem, the traveling-salesman problem, and several shortest-path problems. Furthermore, the more general algebraic assignment and transportation problems, which are formulated {{in terms of an}} ordered commutative semigroup (H;;), are similarly easier to solve given <b>cost</b> <b>arrays</b> possessing the corresponding algebraic Monge property, which requires that for all i ! k and j ! `, a[i; j] a[k; `] a[i; `] a[k; j]. In this paper, we show that Monge-array results for two sum-of-edge-costs shortest-path problems can likewise be extended to a general algebraic setting, provided the problems' ordered commutative semigroup (H;;) satisfies one additional restriction. Specifically, we require that for all a; b; c 2 H, a OE b implies c a OE c b. In addition to this general result, we also show how our algorithms can be modified to solve certain bottleneck shortest-path problems, even though the ordered commutative semigroup (!; max;) naturally associated with bottleneck problems does not satisfy our additional restriction. The bottleneck shortest-path problems we can solve are those with <b>cost</b> <b>arrays</b> possessing what we call the strict bottleneck Monge property, which requires that for all i ! k and j ! `, either maxfa[i; j]; a[k; `]g ! maxfa[i; `]; a[k; j]g or both maxfa[i; j]; a[k; `]g = maxfa[i; `]; a[k; j]g and minfa[i; j]; a[k; `]g minfa[i; `]; a[k; j]g.

40|$|AbstractIn 1963, Hoffman gave {{necessary}} and sufficient {{conditions under which}} a family of O(mn) -time greedy algorithms solves the classical two-dimensional transportation problem with m sources and n sinks. One member of this family, an algorithm based on the “northwest corner rule”, is of particular interest, as its running time is easily reduced to O(m + n). When restricted to this algorithm, Hoffman's result can be expressed as follows: the northwest-corner-rule greedy algorithm solves the two-dimensional transportation problem for all source and supply vectors {{if and only if}} the problem's <b>cost</b> <b>array</b> C = {c[i,j]} possesses {{what is known as the}} (two-dimensional) Monge property, which requires c[i 1,j 1] + c[i 2,j 2] ⩽ c[i 1,j 2] + c[i 2,j 1] for i 1 < i 2 and j 1 < j 2. This paper generalizes this last result to a higher dimensional variant of the transportation problem. We show that the natural extension of the northwest-corner-rule greedy algorithm solves an instance of the d-dimensional transportation problem if and only if the problem's <b>cost</b> <b>array</b> possesses a d-dimensional Monge property recently proposed by Aggarwal and Park in the context of their study of monotone arrays.
