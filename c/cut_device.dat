40|$|Objective: To outline {{treatment}} guidelines {{according to}} level of penile trauma for penile incarceration by metal devices. Method: A post- 1950 (hand-held powered cutting tool era) Medline search was performed. Cases {{were divided into}} four groups: string techniques and variants with and without aspiration of blood from the glans; aspiration techniques; cutting devices; and surgical techniques. Trauma grade (according to Bhat et al., 1991), site time (incarceration time), removal technique, removal time, anesthesia and recovery time were assessed. Results: The string technique and variants were used for grades 1 – 3. They had short removal (30 – 120 min), site (3 – 72 h) and recovery (1 – 24 h) times. Occasional glans decompressive with blood aspiration was required. Anesthesias included none (wrapping without glans aspiration), i. m. morphine and general (glans aspiration). Pure aspiration techniques used multiple needle punctures for grades 2 – 3. Aspiration cases had short site times (8 – 14 h), but required a spinal or general anesthesia. <b>Cutting</b> <b>device</b> cases (grades 1 – 5) required general anesthesia, had a short removal times (45 – 90 min), but long site (7 h– 30 days) and recovery (2 – 66 days) times. Surgical degloving was utilized mainly for grade 5 cases, required spinal or general anesthesia, had short site (2 – 30 days), but long recovery (9 – 28 days). Conclusions: The string, wrapping, aspiration techniques and cutting devices are suited for grades 1 – 3. Cutting requires a shield to avoid blade trauma and water-cooling to prevent thermal injury.

Measurements with a <b>cut</b> tree-weighing <b>device</b> combined with a method to measure throughfall and drip gave a maximum evaporation rate of 0. 3 +/- 0. 06 mm/h or 3. 3 +/- 0. 06 mm/ 24 hours from a 6 -m-high spruce. Calculations of evaporation with a combination equation and different ways to calculate the aerodynamic resistance and the evaporation from a snow-intercepted canopy during melt and sleet events showed that the most important factors for calculating the evaporation were the relative humidity, the aerodynamic resistance, the wind speed, and the intercepted mass. Less important factors were the energy to melt the intercepted snow, the method for calculating reduction in evaporation caused by a partly snow-covered canopy, accuracy in measurement of wind speed, air temperature, and net radiation.
