40|$|Purpose - This {{case study}} seeks to {{illustrate}} {{the way in which}} carbon emissions are given calculative agency. We contribute to sociology of quantification with a specific focus on the performativity of the carbon number as it was introduced to the organisation's <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> <b>accounts.</b> In following an intangible gas to a physical amount and then to a dollar value, we used categories from the sociology of quantification (Espeland and Stevens, 2008) to explore the persuasive attributes of the newly created number and the way it changed the work of actors, including the way they reacted and viewed authority. Design/methodology/approach – An empirical case study in a large Australian water utility drawing on insights from the sociology of calculation. Findings - We present empirics on the calculative appeal of the carbon emissions number, how it came into being and its performative (or reactive) effects. The number disciplined behaviour and acted like a boundary object, while at the same time, enrolled allies through its aesthetic appeal in management accounting system designs. In framing our empirics, we were able to highlight how the carbon number became a visible actor in the newly emergent and evolving carbon market. Research limitations/implications – This paper provides an empirical framing that continues the project of writing the sociology of calculation into accounting. Originality/value – This study contributes to the sociology of quantification in accounting with an empirical framing device to reveal the representational work of a number and how it expands as it becomes implicated in broader networks of calculation.

40|$|Purpose – This article proposes an {{evaluation}} of <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> that <b>accounts</b> for not only the initial assets, but also any potential growth options. Design/methodology/approach – Using a piecewise linear approximation, a robust valuation technique is demonstrated for analyzing <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities containing expansion options in a finite time horizon. Findings – This process not only recognizes the option-like characteristics of the initial investment opportunity, but also recognizes the option-creating characteristics of the investment. This analysis shows {{that the value of}} capacity expansion options created by the initial investment has different dynamic characteristics from the assets in place. Although the growth options do not appear in the early investment premium, its impact on the investment decision is embedded in the investment threshold. When the time to expiration is short and the cost to delaying the assets in place is low, this analysis suggests that the initial investment decision might be made by ignoring the growth options. Originality/value – This real option methodology provides a continuous solution to the optimal investment threshold and is a viable alternative to the traditional finite difference approach. <b>Capital,</b> <b>Capital</b> growth, <b>Investments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Valuation {{research}} establishes {{growth in}} net operating assets (ΔNOA) {{as a primary}} predictor of future profitability. The negative relation between ΔNOA and future profitability, after controlling for current profitability, is researched extensively {{in the context of}} earnings quality, <b>capital</b> <b>investment,</b> <b>accounting</b> conservatism, earnings management, and the accrual anomaly. However, this study shows that while ΔNOA is negatively related to future profitability from 1967 to 1995, it is positively related to future profitability from 1996 to 2010. The negative effects of ΔNOA on future profitability (e. g., diminishing returns on investment, accruals overstatement, and excess capitalization) continue to exist, although they are now dominated by the positive implications of ΔNOA for future profitability. The positive relation between ΔNOA and future profitability grows stronger over time for reasons including increasing intangible intensity, increased volatility of economic activities, increased accounting conservatism, accounting principles shifting toward a balance sheet/fair value approach, changing characteristics of public firms, and the increasing importance of real options. The change in the future profitability-ΔNOA relation has important implications, particularly for the accrual anomaly. The prevailing explanation for the anomaly is that an increase (decrease) in NOA predicts a decrease (increase) in profitability and investors fail to fully appreciate this negative relation. However, if this hypothesis is true, the anomaly should no longer exist. I examine the anomaly over an extended time period, including more recent years, and provide evidence that the anomaly is still present. To explain the persistence of the anomaly over time, I conjecture and show that the market reaction to ΔNOA and the future profitability implications of ΔNOA diverge throughout the sample period. Specifically, investors are always over optimistic about the future profitability implications of the growth, i. e., {{in the first half of}} the sample (1967 - 1988), investors do not fully react to the negative effects of growth on profitability, and in the second half (1989 - 2010), they appear to over-emphasize the positive implications of ΔNOA for future profitability. The anomaly weakens during periods when investors' reaction to ΔNOA aligns with the profitability implications of ΔNOA...|$|R

We construct a model of firms'' FDI decisions, broadly in Dunning''s "eclectic theory" framework, using "real options" to emphasize economic uncertainty and country risk. Numerical results of the model take the form of "quality statistics" that uncover the underlying dynamics hidden in the aggregate data that is responsible for the low performance of recent empirical studies. We find that increasing levels of capital controls reduce the life-span of FDI investments at each level of country risk and foreign investors'' willingness towards risk sharing increases. We reveal a significant interaction between capital control and country risk, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between these and the volatility and volume statistics. We estimate a standard cross-sectional model that provides strong support for our theoretical findings.

Already at the firm level the amount of intangible investment exceeds that of tangible investment, and taking it into account changes our understanding of many key measures : for example the adjusted value added of the business sector is nearly ten per cent higher than the unadjusted one. R&D is roughly one-third of business sector intangible investment, but the share of software and in-house programming is almost as large. Investments in relation to advertising and marketing are also quite sizable. Categories of intangible investments are interrelated : for example internal R&D is not only related to external purchases of R&D inputs but also to employee training, software investment and programming, as well as advertising and marketing.
