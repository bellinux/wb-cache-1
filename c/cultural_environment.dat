5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The {{full extent of}} the original gospel is unknown; according to a list of canonical and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic <b>cultural</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{received}} a formal education at Diocletian's court, {{where he learned}} Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy. The <b>cultural</b> <b>environment</b> in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city. Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held {{as something of a}} hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius's best behavior. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served in a variety of tribunates; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296AD, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297AD) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–299AD). By late 305AD, he had become a tribune of the first order, a tribunus ordinis primi.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original <b>cultural</b> <b>environment.</b> They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how the number of {{cultural}} remains, the area of the final felling site and the forest owner’s knowledge, attitude and behavior related to the consideration taken to <b>cultural</b> <b>environments.</b> The study was built upon results from the HK-inventory as well as qualitative interviews with seven forest owners.   The results indicated that the risk of negative impact increased when two or more cultural remains were located at the felling site. Felling sites where two or more cultural remains had been affected and where at least one of these remains was affected negatively, were also larger than those sites where adequate consideration had been taken. Furthermore, the forest owner’s knowledge and attitude could have an effect on his or her behavior in regards to cultural consideration.   Larger felling sites that affect two or more cultural remains should be extra monitored before and during felling procedures to ensure adequate consideration towards <b>cultural</b> <b>environments</b> located at the site. Forest owners can probably have an influence on consideration but need more knowledge about different types of <b>cultural</b> <b>environments</b> and how to act to achieve adequate consideration towards <b>cultural</b> <b>environments</b> in general...|$|R

They also copied their administrative system from the Samanids.

25|$|Synesthetes {{are very}} likely to {{participate}} in creative activities.

Synesthesia may also give a memory advantage. In one study conducted by Julia Simner of the University of Edinburgh it was found that spatial sequence synesthetes have a built-in and automatic mnemonic reference. So the nonsynesthete will need to create a mnemonic device to remember a sequence (like dates in a diary), but the synesthete can simply reference their spatial visualizations.|$|E
