Kidney injury may occur due to the effects of the hemolytic reaction (pigment nephropathy). The severity of the transfusion reaction is depended upon amount of donor's antigen transfused, nature of the donor's antigens, the nature and the amount of recipient antibodies.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether an IgM-positive <b>crossmatch</b> adversely affects {{the results of}} heart transplantation, we conducted a retrospective study of 125 orthotopic heart transplant recipients. A direct donor-recipient <b>crossmatch</b> was performed retrospectively on sera from all patients by the standard National Institutes of Health (NIH) method and the antihuman globulin (AHG) procedure. The patients were then divided into 3 groups as follows. Group 1 comprised 110 patients with a negative NIH and AHG <b>crossmatch</b> (control group). Group 2 comprised 5 patients with a positive NIH <b>crossmatch</b> and a negative AHG <b>crossmatch.</b> Group 3 comprised 10 patients with positive NIH and AHG <b>crossmatches.</b> All positive <b>crossmatches</b> in group 3 patients converted to negative after treatment of sera with dithioerythritol, indicating that the initial result was due to IgM antibodies. All patients received standard immunosuppressive treatment. An IgM-positive <b>crossmatch</b> {{did not affect the}} number or severity of rejection episodes among the 3 groups, nor did it {{have an effect on the}} incidence of infection. Whereas coronary artery disease was detected by angiography in 16 of 110 patients (14. 6 %) in group 1 and in 1 of 10 patients (10 %) in group 3 (P = NS), no patient in group 2 was affected. Actuarial survival at 1 and 2 years post-transplant was significantly better for patients with an IgM-positive <b>crossmatch</b> (group 2) (100 % survival at 2 years) than for patients with a negative <b>crossmatch</b> (group 1) (73 % at 1 year and 71 % at 2 years, P < 0. 05). Based on our study, the effect of an IgM-positive <b>crossmatch</b> on survival is difficult to interpret because of the small sample size. An IgM-positive <b>crossmatch,</b> however;did not appear to have a deleterious effect on survival. It may be that the IgM antibody has an immunoregulatory role.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{determined}} {{the impact of}} a positive cytotoxic <b>crossmatch</b> on the outcome of liver transplantation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Liver allografts rarely undergo hyperacute rejection, but transplants performed across a positive cytotoxic <b>crossmatch</b> tend to follow a different clinical course, with higher intraoperative blood use, postoperative graft dysfunction, and, in some cases, graft loss. How this affects overall graft survival has not been determined. METHODS: The authors provide a retrospective analysis of 1520 liver transplants performed between November 1989 and December 1993, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. All cases had a cytotoxic <b>crossmatch</b> using serum pretreated with dithiothreitol. RESULTS: There were 1390 negative <b>crossmatch</b> and 130 positive <b>crossmatch</b> cases. There was no difference in overall graft survival, although early survival rates were lower in the positive <b>crossmatch</b> group, with the maximum difference at 6 months: 0. 76 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 74 - 0. 78) for a negative <b>crossmatch</b> versus 0. 68 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 61 - 0. 77) for a positive <b>crossmatch.</b> These differences become negligible by the 2 -year mark. Using stepwise logistic regression, the authors identified seven variables independently associated with outcome: 1) donor age, 2) donor gender, 3) prior liver transplant, 4) medical urgency status, 5) ischemia time, 6) indication for transplantation, and 7) primary immunosuppressant. CONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxic <b>crossmatch</b> is not statistically associated with overall graft survival after liver transplantation. However, early failure rates are higher in the positive <b>crossmatch</b> cases, a difference that disappears by the second year...|$|R

Data describing the most sensitive <b>crossmatch</b> modality for crossmatch-negative kidney transplants were drawn from the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network Registry. Within the cohort transplanted in 1999 - 2005, we identified patient and transplant characteristics predictive of each testing modality by multivariate logistic regression. We assessed associations of <b>crossmatch</b> modality with rejection risk by logistic regression and with graft survival by Cox&#x 2032;s hazards analysis. Among 230, 995 transplants, use of flow cytometry with T-and B-lymphocytes (T&B FC) increased progressively in 1987 - 2005. Among the recent transplants performed in 1999 - 2005 (n= 64, 320), negative T&B FC <b>crossmatch</b> was associated with 15 &#x 0025; lower relative risk of first-year acute rejection (adjusted HR 0. 85, 95 &#x 0025; CI 0. 80 - 0. 89) compared to negative T-antihuman-globulin and B-National Institutes of Health/Wash (T AHG &B) <b>crossmatch.</b> Five-year graft survival after transplant with negative T&B FC (82. 6 &#x 0025;) was modestly better than after negative T AHG &B (81. 4 &#x 0025;, P= 0. 008) or T AHG <b>crossmatch</b> (81. 1 &#x 0025;, P 0. 0001), but on adjusted analysis was significantly different only among recipients from deceased donors and patients aged > 60 years.

We selected cut-off values for pretransplant flow cytometric <b>crossmatching</b> (FCXM) based on the correlation of retrospective results with the occurrence of antibody-mediated rejection. The impact on long-term renal graft survival of prospective FCXM was determined by comparing graft survival between patients crossmatched with complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) only with those prospectively crossmatched with both CDC and FCXM.

We present a case report of a 59 -year-old man, who received a blood group identical living unrelated kidney graft. This was his second kidney transplantation. Pretransplant T-cell <b>crossmatch</b> resulted negative. B-cell <b>crossmatch,</b> which is not considered a strict contraindication for transplantation, resulted positive. During surgery no abnormalities occurred. Four hours after the transplantation diuresis suddenly decreased. In an immediately performed relaparotomy the transplanted kidney showed signs of hyperacute rejection {{and had to be}} removed. Pathological examination was consistent with hyperacute rejection. Depositions of IgM or IgG antibodies were not present in pathologic evaluation of the rejected kidney, suggesting that no irregular endothelial specific antibodies had been involved in the rejection. We recommend examining more closely recipients of second allografts, considering not only a positive T-cell <b>crossmatch</b> but also a positive B-cell <b>crossmatch</b> as exclusion criteria for transplantation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of donor-specific alloantibodies (DSAs) against the MICA antigen results in {{high risk for}} antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of a transplanted kidney, especially in pa-tients receiving a re-transplant. We describe the incidence of acute C 4 d+ AMR in a patient who had received a first kidney transplant with a zero HLA antigen mismatch. Retrospective analysis of post-transplant T and B cell <b>crossmatches</b> were negative, but {{a high level of}} MICA alloantibody was detected in sera collected both before and after transplant. The DSA against the first allograft mismatched MICA* 018 was in the recipient. Flow cytometry and cy-totoxicity tests with five samples of freshly isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells demonstrated the alloantibody nature of patient’s MICA-DSA. Prior to the second transplant, a MICA virtual <b>crossmatch</b> and T and B cell <b>crossmatches</b> were used to identify a suitable donor. The patient received a second kidney transplant, and allograft was functioning well at one-year follow-up. Our study indicates that MICA virtual <b>crossmatch</b> is important in selection of a kidney donor if the recipient has been sensitized with MICA antigens...|$|R
