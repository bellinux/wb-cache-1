5000|$|In 1990, DC {{started over}} with a new Who's Who series titled Who's Who in the DC Universe (16 loose-leaf issues with binders sold separately, cover dated August 1990 to February 1992). This book was not as {{comprehensive}} as the previous Who's Who (for example, there was no entry for the Atom, even though his character was undergoing {{major changes in the}} <b>comic</b> <b>Suicide</b> Squad), and some of the entries took on a less serious tone. One instance is an entry for Guy Gardner, which is written from the character's perspective. Another instance is a blank entry for Death, which has all the usual information headings crossed out and blue marker scrawl stating simply [...] "Someday you'll meet her. You can find out for yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Using {{the end of}} the New 52 {{initiative}} as a launching point, DC Comics {{began the}} next relaunch of its entire line of titles called DC Rebirth in June 2016. Harley Quinn vol. 3, #1 was the debut bimonthly relaunch of Harley Quinn's comic book title.

2500|$|... {{here are}} two {{seemingly}} explicit references to Offenbach's La Périchole, for both Carboy's <b>comic</b> attempt at <b>suicide</b> and {{the efforts of the}} chorus to revive the swooning nobleman have their parallels in the Offenbach work. [...] The particular point of this imitation seems to lie in the fact that La Périchole was at that time sharing the bill with Sullivan's own Trial by Jury at a theatre not too distant from the St James', and the audience at The Zoo might reasonably be expected to know this." ...|$|R

5000|$|Interestingly, Canardo has died, {{at least}} seemingly, several times. Most of these {{happen in the}} comics written for À Suivre. In the first incident, Canardo {{is about to be}} lynched by an angry crowd when he falls in a pit filled with urine, where he {{supposedly}} drowns. In the next comic, he is alive and well. Later, he is shot to death after being tricked by Clara. Canardo jokingly refers to this incident in the next comic, claiming that the [...] "blood" [...] was actually tomato sauce. In the last short <b>comic,</b> Canardo commits <b>suicide,</b> although this presumably happens chronologically after all other adventures. In the album La Fille qui rêvait d'horizon (1999), Canardo's Cadillac collides with Rasputin's motorbike, causing an explosion that is implied to have killed both Canardo and Rasputin.|$|R
