25|$|Silk's {{absorbency}} {{makes it}} <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> {{in warm weather}} and while active. Its low conductivity keeps warm air close to the skin during cold weather. It is often used for clothing such as shirts, ties, blouses, formal dresses, high fashion clothes, lining, lingerie, pajamas, robes, dress suits, sun dresses and Eastern folk costumes. For practical use, silk is excellent as clothing that protects from many biting insects that would ordinarily pierce clothing, such as mosquitoes and horseflies. Silk's attractive lustre and drape makes it suitable for many furnishing applications. It is used for upholstery, wall coverings, window treatments (if blended with another fiber), rugs, bedding and wall hangings. While on the decline now, due to artificial fibers, silk has had many industrial and commercial uses, such as in parachutes, bicycle tires, comforter filling and artillery gunpowder bags.|$|E

Heat, humidity and air movements are very important for these clothes because these parameters effect the thermophysiological comfort properties of clothes. These clothes must allow the passage of water vapour from the body of the garment <b>to</b> feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> <b>wearer.</b> In this study, moisture management properties of different blends of wool/polyester fabrics {{which are used}} in winter military clothes were examined with MMT test device. For this aim, wetting time, absorption rate, spreading speed, accumulative one way transfer index and overall moisture management capacity of fabrics, which have different wool/polyester blend ratio and weave pattern, were investigated.

25|$|Leather is {{a natural}} product with special {{characteristics}} that make it <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear,</b> and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it {{is a natural}} product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit snugly) will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on {{certain parts of the}} palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the hinge joints of the wearer's hands, including the interphalangeal articulations of hand, metacarpophalangeal joints, intercarpal articulations, and wrists.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{returning}} monsters, the Ice Warriors were not heavily redesigned. Gatiss insisted upon keeping {{the fundamentals of}} the original and Moffat explained that the original design was not well-known enough to put a new spin on it, and so Skaldak's shell is just a [...] "super-version of the original". Of the original design, Millennium FX's Neill Gorton said, [...] "My problem with the old ones is they had Lego hands and weird, spindly arms but a bulky body and these strange saddlebag hips, almost feminine. They had fur sticking out everywhere. So all of that together didn't suggest [...] "ice warriors." [...] They should be much beefier and stronger. We gave it more of a bodybuilder physique, changed the hands and styled the body {{to make it look}} more like armour-plating, even though it's reptilian." [...] The costume was made of flexible urethane rubber instead of the fibreglass like the original, as it would damage less easily and be more <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear.</b> The costume was made to specially fit Spencer Wilding. Though only some of the Skaldak's real appearance was shown on-screen, Gorton stated that they created a full animatronic body.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason the}} patiala dress is {{preferred}} {{by most of}} the women of Punjab and other regions of Northern India is its comfort and durability in summers. Since the patiala salwar is very loose and stitched with pleats it is a very <b>comfortable</b> outfit <b>to</b> <b>wear.</b> Its distinguishing characteristic is folds of cloth stitched together that meet at the bottom. Patiala salwars require double the length of material to get stitched, which is generally four meters in length. The fall of the pleats of the Patiala Salwar is such that it gives a beautiful draping effect. The pleats are stitched on the top to a belt.|$|R

50|$|There {{are various}} types and styles of yoga pants in {{addition}} to the traditional. The flared yoga pants are also commonly used as dancewear allowing it to stretch and for the ease of movement it affords. They also typically have combinations of stretchy fabric blends offered by lycra spandex and nylon giving the pants a rich and silky appearance and feel when worn. Crop-fitted yoga pants lie above the ankle (similar to capri pants), and are oftentimes utilized for a more flattering, versatile, and dressier look during warmer times of the year. They are used commonly as casual wear, activewear, for making errands, lounging, or as clubwear on a night out. The flared yoga pants are often paired with flip-flops, running shoes, flats, or Ugg boots, worn along with hoodies, shawls, cardigans or wraps paired with a tank top or shirt tucked underneath. Due to their high elasticity, yoga pants are <b>comfortable</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> for many purposes. They were originally created for practicing yoga, but have become popular as everday mainstream clothing item in classrooms, gymnasiums, restaurants, shopping malls, and nightclubs.|$|R

2500|$|Technically the 1796 heavy cavalry sword was a backsword, {{that is a}} sword with a {{straight}} blade with one cutting edge and the opposite edge of the blade (the [...] "back") thickened {{for most of its}} length to give added strength. The blade was [...] in length, with a single broad fuller each side. The grip was of ribbed wood, or wood bound with cord to resemble the same, and covered in leather. The iron backpiece of the grip had ears which were riveted through the tang of the blade to give the hilt and blade a very secure connection. The hilt combined a disc guard pierced with 2 semicircular and 6 oval (never circular) holes, with single knucklebow and two slim [...] long langets (projections from the guard, which gripped the throat of the scabbard) extending {{from the front of the}} guard. The langets were often removed and the left side of the guard ground away so as to reduce wear to uniforms.

2500|$|Nunivaarmiut Cup'ig bird {{skin and}} feather parkas are alpacurrlugar (murre skin and feather parka) made from Uria aalge skin with {{feathers}}, cigurat atkut (guillemot skin and feather parka) made from Cepphus columba skin with feathers, alpacurrlugar (auklet skin and feather parka) {{made from the}} white part of the Aethia cristatella skin with feathers, qilangar (puffin skin and feather parka) made from Fratercula corniculata skin with feathers, aarraangiarat (oldsquaw skin and feather parka) made from Clangula hyemalis skin with feathers, metrar (eider skin and feather parka) made from Somateria mollissima skin with feathers, tengaurtet (kittiwake skin and feather parka) made from Rissa tridactyla skin with feathers (used as camouflage for sliding over the ice to sneak up on game). In the Nunivak, seabirds, particularly murres, nest in numbers, the natives paying annual visits to the nesting grounds to secure skins of puffins, murres and others for clothing. The bird skins most commonly used for clothing were those of the cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), common or Pacific eider (Somateria mollissima), king eider (Somateria mollissima), Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri), common murre (Uria aalge), horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata). Cormorant and eider were considered more valuable and gave more prestige to the owner. Bird skin parkas are light and <b>comfortable</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> but tear easily. Such parkas were usually reversible, worn with the feathers next to the body in winter with a cloth garment over the parka to cover the rough, yet fragile, skin side. At night the parka was turned and slept in or used as a blanket with the feathers on the outside. Bird skin parkas were shaped like those made of animal skin, {{but because of the}} great thickness of the feathers and the general bulk, they did not have fur strips, beading, and other decoration. Cuffs and bottom borders tended to be plain except on murre parkas. Tufted puffin skins were counted and sold in [...] "knots" [...] or bundles of six. Thirty-four skins were necessary for a man's parka and 28 for a woman's. The common puffin is smaller, so six knots and four extra skins were required for a man's parka, five knots and four extra for a woman's. Puffins are found only along the cliffs near Nash Harbor, and residents of Mekoryuk had to trade for them with those living in the settlement there. Sufficient puffins for a parka could be obtained in exchange for one bearded seal skin. Parkas made of cormorant skins were worn only by women. The skins of these birds are larger than those of murres and puffins. When murre skins were prepared for parka use, they were roughly square in shape and included the breast and the sides. Two narrow black backs were sewn together to form the crown of the hood.|$|E

5000|$|An Oxygen Breathing Apparatus (OBA) is a rebreather. It is used {{primarily}} in firefighting. Its oxygen {{is generated by}} chemicals contained in the green canister, which is inserted {{at the base of}} the breathing device. The canister uses potassium superoxide as both a CO2 scrubber and an O2 generator. A sodium chlorate candle in the base generates additional oxygen when first beginning use as the canister has to achieve a high internal temperature before it will start generating oxygen on its own. It is the circulation of exhaled air through the canister that starts the chemical process, usually taking less than 5 minutes, the normal burn time of the [...] "candle" [...] and the mask will initially fill with a light, harmless smoke. The extreme heat of the chemical reaction requires the use of thick leather gloves for handling spent canisters. The bags along either side of the chest unit cool the air mixture before inhalation and is a surprisingly effective system, with the air being quite cool when entering the face mask. There is a 60-minute timer at the top of the chest unit which, during the fighting of a casuality, is set for only 45 minutes. This would give the user a 15-minute window to evacuate to a safe atmosphere.

40|$|Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) of the cerebellum {{is emerging as}} a novel non-invasive tool to modulate {{the activity of the}} cerebellar circuitry. In a single blinded study, we applied anodal tDCS (atDCS) of the cerebellum to assess its effects on brain entropy and brain rhythms during self-paced sequential finger movements in a group of healthy volunteers. Although wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) systems cannot compete with traditional clinical/laboratory set-ups in terms of accuracy and channel density, they have now reached a sufficient maturity to envision daily life applications. Therefore, the EEG was recorded with a <b>comfortable</b> and easy <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> 14 channels wireless helmet (Epoc headset; electrode location was based on the 10 – 20 system). Cerebellar neurostimulation modified brain rhythmicity with a decrease in the delta band (electrode F 3 and T 8, p < 0. 05). By contrast, our study did not show any significant change in entropy ratios and laterality coefficients (LC) after atDCS of the cerebellum in the 14 channels. The cerebellum is heavily connected with the cerebral cortex including the frontal lobes and parietal lobes via the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. We propose that the effects of anodal stimulation of the cerebellar cortex upon cerebral cortical rhythms are mediated by this key-pathway. Additional studies using high-density EEG recordings and behavioral correlates are now required to confirm our findings, especially given the limited coverage of Epoc headset...|$|R
