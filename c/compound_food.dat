40|$|Shrimp ponds {{integrated}} with mangroves intercept leaf litter which {{may contribute to}} the bioenergetics of shrimps. Since fatty acids (FAs) determine the nutritive value of shrimp food, we analyzed and compared the FA profiles of post-larvae (PL) of Penaeus monodon fed with decomposing litter of Rhizophora mucronata, the associated biofilm, or a nutritionally optimized <b>compound</b> <b>food.</b> Three nutritionally important stages of decomposition (1, 5, and 10 wk) were tested. FA levels of PL {{at the start of the}} experiment were used as controls. As litter decomposed, saturated FAs decreased, whereas monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) increased. PUFA concentrations were higher in biofilm than in the litter. PL fed with litter and biofilm food had higher MUFAs, arachidonic acid (ARA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) compared to PL fed with a <b>compound</b> <b>food.</b> However, PL fed with <b>compound</b> <b>food</b> had higher linoleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). PL fed with 5 wk decomposed litter and its biofilm had a high concentration of bacterial odd carbon chain FAs. FAs in shrimp tissue reflected the FA profiles of the food sources in all treatments, with biofilm and <b>compound</b> <b>food</b> showing a better match. We conclude that (1) mangrove biofilm is a potential source of essential FAs to PL, especially providing ARA, EPA, and DHA; (2) biofilm on mangrove leaf litter may upgrade the nutritional value of PL for their consumers, including humans; and (3) efforts should be made to promote periphytic biofilms in integrated mangrove-shrimp culture practices...|$|E

The feeding experiments started after the yolk sac of the larvae was absorbed (initial mean weight = 2. 03 ± 0. 38 mg).

Two experiments were carried out based on the sameprotocol with three treatments: clear waterwith experimental diet (CW), biofloc with experimental diet (BF) and biofloc unfed (BU). Shrimp survivalwas significantly higher in biofloc rearing than in CW rearing. The contribution of the biofloc to shrimp diet was estimated through measurement of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in shrimp and food sources. Different isotopic compositions between feeds were obtained by feeding natural productivitywith a mixture rich in fish meal and the shrimpswith a pellet containing a high level of soy protein concentrate. Using a two source one-isotope mixing model, we found that the natural productivity of the biofloc systemcontributed to shrimp growth at a level of 39. 8 % and 36. 9 %, for C and N, respectively. The natural food consumed by the shrimps reared in the biofloc system resulted in higher gene expression (mRNA transcript abundance) and activities of two digestive enzymes in their digestive gland: α-amylase and trypsin. The growth of shrimp biomass reared in biofloc was, on average, 4. 4 times that of those grown in clear water.

The visceral organs and the flesh were washed and carefully separated. Meat samples were used for proximate and sensory properties analysis. The meat samples were properly cooked without adding spices,using the same methods and same cooking materials. Sensory assessment was done by a panel of 10 members. The panelists were all in a state of good health and in the same age bracket The results show that all snails showed a steady growth with age and {{there was a significant difference}} (p< 0. 05) in weight gain among those snails fed artificial food and those fed the natural food.
