50|$|According to Brandt, “Literacy ability, <b>corporate</b> <b>profitability,</b> and {{national}} productivity have all become entangled.” The {{first chapter of}} Deborah Brandt’s Literacy in American Lives emphasizes how changing economic conditions and regional restructuring affected the opportunities people had for learning to read and write. Brandt discusses the lives of two women who acquired literacy in a farming family economy during different eras to illustrate many of these important points. Both women graduated high school but the one from 1903, Martha Day, became a journalist while the woman from 1971, Barbara Hunt, became a cashier at a local grocery store. This occupational contrast illustrates how the value of “farming family” literacy abilities decreased significantly and the standards for literacy in American society rose rapidly during that period. It also highlights the effect of changing social and cultural factors. Martha Day was from an era where many children were raised on farms but Barbara Hunt was not. Thus, Day was able to transition more smoothly into a different lifestyle and occupation because her upbringing was more common in society at that time than in Hunt’s. Finally, the accounts of the two women demonstrate the dynamic state of literacy sponsorship in America. In the early twentieth century, when Day was searching for an occupation after high school, the popular press was emerging as a major sponsor of literacy so {{she was able to}} acquire a position as a journalist, which further facilitated the growth of her literacy skills. However, by {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, the influence of the popular press in literacy sponsorship was diminishing so the same opportunities were not available to Barbara Hunt when she was searching for an occupation after graduating high school. Thus, in using these two literacy history narratives, Brandt illustrates how the value of basic literacy skills, the identities and influences of economic sponsors, and job opportunities available to those with a high school education changed drastically during the 1900s.|$|E
