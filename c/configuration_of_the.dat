The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E

5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although {{they may have}} tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the test programme, Senior Prom was {{cancelled}} in 1982; reportedly one reason for the cancellation of the project was that the size and <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senior Prom aircraft rendered it incapable of being carried in internal weapons bays such as that on the B-1 bomber; the AGM-129 ACM, a competing design to Senior Prom for the cruise missile requirement, had a more slender airframe with retractable wings, which rendered it capable of internal carriage; it began flight testing shortly {{after the end of the}} Senior Prom programme.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Circuit de Monaco, {{with its}} low average speed and {{abundance}} of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip {{nature of the}} public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce {{the maximum amount of}} downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work better on the circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E

However, O.sydandersoni differs from the other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters.

5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters {{will be in the}} traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.|$|E
