40|$|One {{immature}} {{was observed}} at Sutherland Reservoir, Lincoln County, on 17 December (myself) and 19 December (myself and Dorothy J. Rosche), 1992. I saw this bird {{a few hours after}} Silcock and Dinsmore discovered it on 17 Dec. [See article on p. 88. ] It flew {{by the end of the}} pier at close distances (as close as 20 feet) for hours on both days of observation. It sometimes landed momentarily on small pieces of ice as it picked up morsels floating in the water. It was a small gull and much more dainty than the nearby Bonaparte 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls. It had a very small, rounded head and a very short, stubby, blackish bill. I believe it was a first-year bird molting into second-year plumage. The obviously wedge-shaped tail possessed well-worn tips. The only thing left of the dark tail band was a dark spot or two. The dark wing band of the immature was reduced to a short, dark bar on the inner wing, more noticeable on one side of the bird than the other (and very visible when the bird perched). The dark black <b>collar</b> <b>marking</b> was just beginning to appear, a small, darkish line being the only thing visible on each side of the head at this time.

6000|$|That {{afternoon}} Ethel put on {{her pretty}} sateen and her witching little white hat, with two natural dog-roses pinned on one side, and went pleased and proud up to the vicarage. The Reverend John Creedy was there, not in full clerical costume, but arrayed in tennis flannels, with only a loose white tie beneath his flap <b>collar</b> to <b>mark</b> his newly acquired spiritual dignity. He was a comely looking negro enough, full-blooded, but not too broad-faced nor painfully African in type; {{and when he was}} playing tennis his athletic quick limbs and his really handsome build took away greatly from the general impression of an inferior race. His voice was of the ordinary Oxford type, open, pleasant, and refined, with a certain easy-going air of natural gentility, hardly marred by just the faintest tinge of the thick negro blur in the broad vowels. When he talked to Ethel--and the vicar's wife took good care that they should talk together a great deal--his conversation was of a sort that she seldom heard at Walton Magna. It was full of London and Oxford, of boat-races at Iffley and cricket matches at Lord's; of people and books whose very names Ethel had never heard--one of them was a Mr. Mill, she thought, and another a Mr. Aristotle--but which she felt vaguely to be one step higher in the intellectual scale than her own level. Then his friends, to whom he alluded casually, not like one who airs his grand acquaintances, were such very distinguished people. There was a real live lord, apparently, at the same college with him, and he spoke of a young baronet whose estate lay close by, as plain [...] "Harrington of Christchurch," [...] without any [...] "Sir Arthur"--a thing which even the vicar himself would hardly have ventured to do. She knew that he was learned, too; {{as a matter of fact}} he had taken a fair second class in Greats at Oxford; and he could talk delightfully of poetry and novels. To say the truth, John Creedy, in spite of his black face, dazzled poor Ethel, for he was more of a scholar and a gentleman than anybody with whom she had ever before had the chance of conversing on equal terms.|$|R

40|$|The Eastern Population (EP) of tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) {{winters in}} the eastern United States and breeds from the North Slope of Alaska to {{the eastern side of}} Hudson Bay in Canada. EP swans were marked on the {{wintering}} grounds in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia in order to study movements, habitat use, survival, and population structure. Swans were marked with individually coded neck collars (n= 1, 471), USFWS leg-bands (n= 3, 504), and satellite-tracked radio transmitters (n= 43) from February 1997 ?March 2002. Location information was collected from February 1997 ?March 2003 via ground observers, recapture, recovery of dead birds, or satellite location. Satellite-tracked EP tundra swans spent approximately 7 months each year on breeding or wintering grounds, and about 5 months of each year in migration. Significant time spent in migration highlights the importance of migratory habitats to this population. No sub-populations were identifiable based on the exclusive use of migratory pathways, Bird Conservation Regions, wintering grounds, or breeding grounds. Movement rates between states on the wintering grounds (Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) ranged from 0. 00 to 0. 46, but were rarely different from 0. 25 (P< 0. 05), which suggested that exchange between states caused significant mixing of the population within and between years. Indirect survival rates of marked adult swans ranged 66 ? 84 % depending on analytical method or marker type, but were statistically similar (95 % confidence intervals overlapped). Use of neck <b>collars</b> in operational <b>marking</b> program is not recommended for future studies due to the cost and difficulty of collecting representative data. To investigate the necessity of annual survival rate estimates, I used data from operational monitoring programs (Mid-Winter Index [MWI], winter ground Production Survey, number of hunting permits, retrieved swan harvest) to develop a model of EP tundra swan dynamics. The model provided reasonable and precise predictions of population size, harvest, and survival. The model can help to predict and understand the effects of harvest on population size. Analyses did not detect density-dependence in recruitment and suggested that a population size goal of at least 80, 000 swans can be sustained at current or slightly decreased levels of harvest. U.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{summarize}} {{accomplishments of the}} Canada Lynx Ecology in the Great Lakes Region project. We carried out initial work in the Superior National Forest to address 4 major questions about this Canada lynx population: distribution, abundance, persistence, and habitat requirements. In the first 8 months of this project we have captured and deployed radiotelemetry collars on 8 Canada lynx. Each animal was relocated approximately weekly after being collared. Of the 8 Canada lynx that have been collared, 2 have died. Two of the collars deployed on Canada lynx were GPS <b>collars.</b> This <b>marked</b> {{the first time ever}} that a GPS collar was deployed on Canada lynx. We downloaded the locations from one of these GPS collars when one of the collared animals was recaptured on December 30 th, 2003 after wearing the GPS collar for 3 weeks. The importance of GPS collar data for understanding movements and habitat use of Canada lynx should not be underestimated. In addition to the telemetry research, we have also conducted the first year of surveys for the major prey species of Canada lynx: snowshoe hare and red squirrel. Permanent pellet plots were established throughout the SNF for snowshoe hare. Plots were distributed based on stratified random, systematic, and selective site selection strategies. We established new plots to estimate red squirrel abundance in an area of known high lynx density, and also utilized an existing long-term data set for red squirrel abundance from SNF. Another year of surveys following the National Lynx Survey protocol was completed, and a snow-track survey for Canada lynx and other mesocarnivores was completed on the National Lynx Survey grid. There were also many opportunities to disseminate information on Canada lynx to the biological community and to the general public. More than 10 presentations on lynx biology were given by project personnel. Project personnel assisted in planning, helped with field trips, and gave presentations at the National Lynx and Wolverine Steering Committee Meeting in May 2003 and the Interagency Lynx Biology Team Meeting in October 2003, both of which were hosted by SNF. We have developed a website for the Canada Lynx Ecology in the Great Lakes Region project (www. nrri. umn. edu/lynx). This website provides a history of the project, lists project goals and accomplishments, and includes links to press coverage of the project. We begin the report with a brief chronological summary of the Canada lynx ecology in the Great Lakes Region project. The project was supported by several agencies with some common deliverables and some deliverables that varied among agencies. To produce a cohesive, logically organized Annual Report, we describe the project in its entirety, and we indicate specific deliverables in Appendix 1. We first describe Canada lynx trapping and the deployment of radiotelemetry collars. The radiotelemetry program is very important because each of the major deliverables depends on telemetry data. Next, we address progress made on each of the major questions: (1) Location, (2) Distribution, (3) Persistence, and (4) Habitat use. Prey species surveys and National Lynx Survey results are also summarized. We conclude each section with the current status and future plans for each research topic. We believe {{it is important to recognize}} that the project is only 8 months old. A complete answer for any of the questions will require the several years of data collection which is built into the project master plan. We caution that results presented in this report are preliminary because of the few animals that have been collared, and because of the relatively few locations that have been obtained. Management recommendations should not be made from the little information that has been obtained to date. However, with the number of Canada lynx now radiocollared, and with expectations of more in the near future, there will be sufficient data for management recommendations by the end of the second year of this project...|$|R
