5|$|<b>Cecil</b> {{and brother}} Godfrey were {{elected to the}} board of {{directors}} of HBT in early 1884 (Godfrey as Vice-President and <b>Cecil</b> as Auditor), and by the end of the year, Godfrey had become President. By January 1886, Godfrey was both President and Treasurer, and <b>Cecil</b> Vice-President, positions they would hold for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Initially, <b>Cecil</b> was {{forecast}} {{to maintain}} a northward track into a weakness in a subtropical ridge left behind by Typhoon Brenda; however, <b>Cecil</b> turned westward on May23 due to another ridge over China. With favorable atmospheric conditions, <b>Cecil</b> continued to intensify through May24. By 0600UTC, a ragged 75km (45mi) wide eye developed over the center of circulation, indicating {{it had become a}} typhoon. The storm ultimately attained peak winds of 140km/h (85mph) while situated just off the coast of central Vietnam. However, the JMA reported <b>Cecil</b> to have been slightly weaker, classifying it as a severe tropical storm with ten-minute sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph). Around 1800UTC, the storm made landfall near Hoi An with winds of 130km/h (80mph). Once onshore, <b>Cecil</b> quickly weakened to a tropical depression. Turning slightly to the west-northwest, the remnants of <b>Cecil</b> continued inland before dissipating over eastern Laos early on May26.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cecil</b> {{was drawn}} to {{resemble}} David Hyde Pierce, but still look similar to Bob. According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and <b>Cecil</b> standing together because their feet are both so big. There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where <b>Cecil</b> throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E

5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at <b>Cecil</b> before he can press the plunger. <b>Cecil</b> attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and the money is lost. <b>Cecil</b> manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle {{down the side of the}} dam, Bob decides to cut the cord on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent <b>Cecil</b> from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous fall is broken by a conveniently placed pipe.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, <b>Cecil</b> and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles <b>Cecil</b> stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's Lure of the Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, <b>Cecil</b> visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game. <b>Cecil,</b> Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. <b>Cecil</b> and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E

5|$|The Red Wings {{attack the}} city of Mysidia to steal their Water Crystal, {{and return to the}} Kingdom of Baron. When <b>Cecil,</b> Captain of the Red Wings, {{afterwards}} questions the king's motives, he is stripped of his rank and sent with Kain, his friend and Captain of the Dragoons, to deliver a ring to the Village of Mist. There, Kain and <b>Cecil</b> watch in horror as monsters burst forth from inside the ring and lay waste to the village. A young girl, Rydia, is the only survivor and summons a monster named Titan in anger. This monster causes an earthquake, separating <b>Cecil</b> and Kain. <b>Cecil</b> awakens afterward and takes the wounded Rydia to a nearby inn. Baron soldiers come for Rydia but <b>Cecil</b> defends her, and she joins him on his journey.|$|E
5|$|The police {{arrive and}} <b>Cecil</b> is {{immediately}} arrested. Bob gloats over his victory, having gained the respect from Bart and Lisa, who now believed that Bob has truly changed. Unfortunately, Chief Wiggum suddenly arrives and arrests Bob, believing {{him to be}} involved in the plot as well, despite Bart and Lisa's protests. As they are taken away, <b>Cecil</b> tricks Bob into swearing revenge on Bart and incriminating himself. Upon realizing that he just made Bart his enemy again, Bob gets angry at <b>Cecil</b> for it. Just after the brothers are taken away, the dam crumbles and releases a torrent of water on Springfield, only to do apparently minimal damage. Wiggum muses on the evil the brothers could concoct while locked up together; in reality, the brothers merely continue to bicker childishly, as Bob is still angry at <b>Cecil</b> for making Bart his nemesis again.|$|E

Tony Warriner and David Sykes were the game's designer-programmer Carmody the executive producer. The game uses the Virtual Theatre engine, as do Revolution's previous two games.|$|E
