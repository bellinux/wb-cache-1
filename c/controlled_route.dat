By monitoring the 1066 nm emission, the long-lived luminescent lifetime {{was determined to}} be 19. 5 &# 181;s. These NIR nanoparticles with appropriate diameters (< 100 nm) were suitable for cell assays. MTT assays showed that the cytotoxicity of the porous Nd 2 (SiO 4) 3 nanoparticles was very low.

40|$|Abstract — Estimating voltage {{instability}} of power systems {{is important for}} reduction of large blackouts. This paper proposes to use reachability analysis of hybrid systems for predicting voltage {{instability of}} a power system. The reachability analysis is performed by computing backward reachable sets for unsafe sets of hybrid automata. The automata represent continuous voltage dynamics and discrete operations by relay devices. The unsafe sets of hybrid automata are also subsets of state space in which a system voltage shows unacceptable levels such as low or high values. With single machine-load bus (SMLB) system with <b>controlled</b> <b>route</b> switching, we show that voltage instability in the SMLB system can be predicted using the reachability analysis. The obtained result implies that voltage instability leading to large blackouts is possibly detected before its occurrence in power systems. I...|$|E

40|$|I present four {{studies in}} which my coauthors and I {{investigated}} whether presenting information in a foreign language, {{as opposed to the}} native language, influences judgment and decision-making. Research on judgment and decision-making suggests that there are two routes to judgment and choice: an intuitive, emotional route and an analytic, <b>controlled</b> <b>route.</b> Research on bilingualism suggests that the use of a foreign language influences the intuitive route. It attenuates emotions and dampens the activation of moral and sociocultural norms. Merging these lines of research, my coauthors and I predicted that foreign language would influence judgment and decision-making. We found that it influences moral judgment through a deactivation of moral norms, and that it affects the perception of risk and benefit through an attenuation of negative feelings. I discuss the theoretical and practical significance of the present findings, and point out limitations and possible future developments of this research area...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} store {{information}} through the phase change mechanism {{is a well}} established technology for optical data storage, with typically germanium antimony telluride based films forming the active layer of a phase change disc. However, the ever increasing need for greater storage densities, shorter write/erase, duration and longer archival time is driving interest beyond these established materials. A new thin high throughput thin film deposition method provides a well <b>controlled</b> <b>route</b> to the synthesis {{of a wide range}} of chalcogenide compositions through simultaneous deposition of the component elements. When combined with fast primary and secondary screening techniques, the amorphous / crystalline phase transition can be characterised across the ternary compositional space. When combined with a full high throughput characterisation of the phases using EDX and XRD, conductivity measurements and ellipsometric characterisation of the optical properties, a better understanding of the desired phenomena for phase change memory applications is accessible. Results of a high throughput study of the GeSbTe system are presented...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{completion}} of a rail line running from central China to Lhasa in the Tibet Autonomous Region has brought attention not only to China's Architecture and Urbanism questionable occupation of Tibet, {{but also to the}} face that modernization in the TAR has adopted and the accompanying implications of China's large infrastructural projects in the TAR and other provinces. The thesis asserts that the form of development that has been propagated in Tibet has been modernizing in terms of economic growth and the incorporation of Tibet into networks of moving capital, people, and goods, but not actually modern, as Tibetans have generally been forced to the sidelines in the development of Tibet, serving more as indigenous tourist attractions than active participants in the shaping of a modern culture. The resulting condition is a present day state that is at once premodern and postmodern, consisting of a population that is still rooted in ancient traditions but {{very much a part of}} the society of the spectacle. This contradictory condition is heightened by Tibet's tourism industry, which caters to those visiting Tibet for its larger than life landscape features, unique and ubiquitous religion, and what is perceived as an authentic folk culture. The highly <b>controlled</b> <b>route</b> of the tourist in Tibet becomes, to some extent, a site where Tibet happens. Beyond the tourist route there are nomads, farmers, vast landscapes (and extreme poverty), but also a growing network of mines, power plants, military sites, dumps, prisons, and other peripheral [...] . by Sarah Dunbar.

40|$|Abstract — Multihoming {{is used by}} stub {{networks}} to improve the reliability of their Internet connectivity. In recent years, commercial “intelligent <b>route</b> <b>control</b> ” devices are used by multihomed stub {{networks to}} optimize the routing of their Internet traffic. In this work, we first conduct measurement of qualities of alternate paths through multihoming. In the remaining part, we study the <b>route</b> <b>control</b> of traffic {{among a group of}} multihomed stub networks which may belong to an organization and exchange data regularly. This type of <b>route</b> <b>control</b> is special because the access links of such networks may not be over-provisioned and are shared by traffic <b>controlled</b> by multiple <b>route</b> <b>control</b> devices. Such shared bottlenecks may affect the effectiveness of uncoordinated “intelligent route control”. We propose a global optimization based approach to coordinate the <b>route</b> <b>control</b> among such a group of networks. Our approach can avoid oscillations which may be caused by uncoordinated <b>route</b> <b>control.</b> Simulation results show that our approach has advantages over equal-splitting based static load-balancing...|$|R
