30|$|Beside the {{tracking}} device, {{there are also}} two types of special devices: (1) an optional MoCo router (light blue trapeze), installed on key infrastructure for container handling such as cranes, boats, and lorries, and (2) a MoCo reader (light blue trapeze with brown oval inside) integrated in the handhelds (e.g., smartphone) of container operators. Both devices serve a special role. The MoCo router is mains-powered {{and can be used}} as gateway for tracking devices. It enables to collect tracking reports and monitoring data in an energy efficient manner (i.e., by avoiding the usage of the cellular radio). The MoCo reader is used by container operators to interface with {{the tracking}} device. For instance, when a container is loaded and sealed, a <b>container</b> <b>operator</b> can activate the door sensor, and conversely, when a container is unloaded, an operator can disable the door sensor.|$|E
40|$|Improving port {{efficiency}} {{can therefore}} {{have a significant}} impact on the whole maritime economy. Recognizing this fact, many governments have consistently prioritized the ports as a central element of infrastructure to promote regional economic growth. This paper treats container terminal operators as the Decision Making Unit, which represents a divergence from previous port efficiency studies. We compile a panel data of 141 global container terminal operators from 1997 to 2005 to study the efficiency of <b>container</b> <b>operator</b> production. We use the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to compute efficiency scores. We add country and port characteristics into our model except output/input. We examine the contribution of productivity to operator output based on the long time series. The efficiencies of different operators in same port are showed to investigate the core sources of productivity growth.

40|$|During recent years, {{the amount}} of {{software}} in container handling equipment has increased and automation has {{a greater role in}} container terminal operations. Automation systems must be able to constantly adapt to changing environments and <b>container</b> <b>operator</b> requirements. In addition, {{it should be possible to}} monitor the state of the system in order to confirm that it has adapted to the new configurations correctly. The focus of this thesis is on the configuration management of UniQ which is a data distribution framework developed by Cargotec Finland Oy. Within this thesis, a new piece of software, called UniConf, will be introduced for editing the configuration files of UniQ. UniConf allows users to edit configuration files with graphical user interface. UniConf can also validate the configuration files and create necessary installation packages so that configuration files can be installed into container handling equipment. To accomplish distribution of configuration files, existing configuration distribution systems are studied herein. This research has been done by studying manuals and other documentation offered by manufacturers of configuration distribution systems. The study focuses on the most crucial aspects concerning configuration distribution for container handling equipment...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a <b>container</b> <b>operator,</b> who serves {{a number of}} shipping lines by discharging and loading their periodically arriving container vessels. Disruptions on vessels ’ travel times lead to stochastic arrivals in the port. To cope with these disturbances, the oper-ator and each vessel line agree on two types of arrivals: arrivals i) within, and ii) out of a so-called arrival window. If a vessel arrives within its window, the operator guarantees a maximal process time. If not, the operator is not bound to any guaranteed process time. The problem is to construct a periodic window-based i) arrival, ii) departure and iii) time-variant crane capacity plan to minimize the maximal crane capacity reservation. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that minimizes the maximal crane capacity reservation while window agreements are satisfied for all scenar-ios in which vessels arrive within their windows. Results of a case study suggest that with slight modifications to an existing plan, significant reductions in the maximal crane capacity reservation can be achieved. As a particular case, the MILP determines the conventional optimal window-ignoring plan. Results suggest that although the window-ignoring plan on itself requires less crane capacity than the window-based plan, {{it is much more}} sensitive to the arrival window agreements...|$|E

The model is estimated using a Bayesian approach via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the mean efficiency level of the <b>container</b> <b>operators</b> is {{in the range of}} 70 %- 90 % of their full efficiencies, and the mean efficiency changed with time slightly. However, the percentage of highly efficient operators has increased since 1997.

40|$|Container {{shipping}} and its related service sectors help accelerate globalization {{of the world}} economy. This industry has been experiencing rapid growth, prompting <b>container</b> terminal <b>operators</b> to increase their handling capacity in response. Providing container terminal services requires substantial capital investment in physical assets such as cargo handling facilities and information systems. On the other hand, operating container terminals is a long-term investment that typically spans several business cycles. Hence prudent asset management using appropriate tools is critical for <b>container</b> terminal <b>operators</b> to sustain their businesses. Generally, due to risk-adverseness, investors are unwilling to take more risk in their investment unless they can reap a higher return. Contrary to this argument, this study finds no direct influence of better firm performance as a proxy of higher return on business risk-taking by <b>container</b> terminal <b>operators.</b> Instead, scale of operations is positively associated with business risk-taking, suggesting that <b>container</b> terminal <b>operators</b> with a larger scale of operations {{are willing to take}} more business risk.

40|$|Container {{transport}} operations have been extending inland, providing more comprehensive service across the shipping network. Accordingly, <b>container</b> transport <b>operators</b> are making extensive capital investments in deploying inland container depot (ICD) networks. Optimizing {{the location of}} such facilities financially is vital for both capital and operating efficiencies. Currently, there are no models at the regional network level to guide <b>container</b> <b>operators</b> in locating ICDs on their networks. This research studies the ICD location problem and develops a comprehensive ICD location model. Based on comprehensive analysis of the container transport industry, focusing on ICD operations, this thesis developed a useful formulation of the ICD location problem. It recognizes and emphasizes the need to embody the endogenous demand and market competitiveness in the container transport business. The formulation combines the multinomial logit model of discrete choice analysis to quantitatively describe the shipper’s behaviors and preferences, addressing both the endogenous demand and market competitiveness.

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between firm size and the use of electronic commerce (EC) by <b>container</b> transport <b>operators</b> in Hong Kong and their performance implications. Using data collected from a sample of <b>container</b> shipping <b>operators</b> in Hong Kong, we identified internal and external drivers that affect the use of EC by <b>container</b> transport <b>operators.</b> Our findings indicate that large firms tend to adopt EC at a higher level of sophistication. This study also investigates the relationship between the use of EC and firm performance. Our results show that sales growth is positively related to the use of EC and firm size. To understand how firm size affects firm performance, we use a structural equation model (SEM) to examine their structural relationships. Our findings indicate that firm size positively influences sales growth. On the other hand, sales growth affects the profitability of a firm. Although customer satisfaction does not have a direct impact on profitability, our SEM suggests that customer satisfaction is a significant variable that affects the sales growth of firms.

40|$|In India, {{railways}} {{are under}} the control of the government which is the sole provider of the infrastructure, operations and regulatory functions. Private participation, though very limited, was largely in the domain of infrastructure creation. In January 2006, in a landmark initiative to introduce competition in the container operations segment, the Ministry of Railways allowed the entry of private and public sector operators to obtain licences for running container trains on the Indian Railways (IR) network. Until then, the Container Corporation of India, a subsidiary of IR, was the monopoly <b>operator</b> of <b>container</b> trains in India. This initiative was the first significant move of its kind where private parties were allowed to make entry in the domain of railway operations with direct customer interfacing. The response to the policy was good and 15 new entrants obtained licences to run container trains. Due to lack of clarity or inconsistency in matters pertaining to haulage charges, maintenance of wagons, transit guarantees from IR and terminal access charges, operators started feeling skeptical about the viability of the business.
