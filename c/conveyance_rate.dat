Cusp surface is the quantitative cusp catastrophe model in our previous papers. Thom R. bases cusp surface analysis proposed by Cobb L. on cusp model in catastrophe theory. The psychological data used experimental data of visual recognition for ambiguous figures and physical data used measured data of <b>conveyance</b> <b>rate</b> of material transported by magnetic transportation equipment are analysed and characteristics of data are discussed. Therefore, effectiveness of cusp surface analysis for psychological data and physical data is verified. Keywords...|$|E

Background The demand for emergency ambulance services both nationally (in the UK) and internationally has been steadily increasing. A large proportion of calls made to the emergency ambulance service are classified as non-urgent. An alternative response to these calls may release the standard ambulance service to attend more urgent calls. A pilot project was initiated {{in order to provide}} an alternative response to non-urgent emergency calls in an Ambulance Trust in England with support from the local Primary Care Trust. This alternative response comprised a district nurse or an emergency nurse practitioner dispatched with a paramedic to visit low-priority emergency calls. The pilot service was trialled during a 15 -week period in 2003 ??? 2004. Methods This paper evaluates the cost effectiveness of the pilot service by examining both the resource use and the outcomes of the service. Findings It was found that introducing this service to the current provision would increase the overall cost to the ambulance services. However, a reduction in <b>conveyance</b> <b>rate</b> to the hospital was observed as people could be treated on-scene. A reduction in <b>conveyance</b> <b>rate</b> to the hospital would lead to reduced admissions to accident and emergency departments and subsequent hospitalization. This paper provides an indication that further development of this type of service {{has the potential to be}} cost effective, if the wider health care economy is considered, as the cost savings made in secondary care could more than balance the costs to the Ambulance Services in providing such a servic...|$|E
40|$|By {{utilizing}} the inherent traits of optical fiber sensors, the conventional monitoring strategy {{can be extended}} from the form of individual points to networks. Although the optical-fiber-sensor-based system has shown their prominent advantages {{over the last few}} years, however, the measurement task could only be executed on site, ie, the automatically real-time long-term monitoring may not be executed under the current system architecture. In order to improve the performance of current system, integration of the remote-sensing function into the current system is needed. To implement this concept, several types of remote bridge monitoring systems are evaluated in this paper. The application of three different techniques including General Packet Radio Services, (GPRS), wireless transmission, and asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL) were appraised thoroughly with a simulated environment in National Center of Research on Earthquake Engineering. (NCREE) With the help of these methods, the measurement distance of the monitoring system can be extended to hundreds of kilometers. The evaluation result has shown that the case with the combination of ASDL system and wireless transmission is fastest one for offering a reliable data <b>conveyance</b> <b>rate</b> while the GPRS system offers the most economic and robust service. Both of the two system can be easily incorporated into the original surveillance system and largely enhance their performance. The integrated system with the remote-control ability can expected to be applied to any existing bridge under harsh environment in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Background: Emergency {{services}} are facing increasing workload pressures, and new models of care are needed. We evaluate {{the impact of}} a service development involving a partnership between emergency ambulance crews and general practitioners (GPs) on reducing <b>conveyance</b> <b>rates</b> to the Hospital Emergency Department (ED). Methods: The service model was implemented in the West Midlands of England. Call handlers identified patients with needs that could be addressed by a GP using locally agreed criteria. GPs supported the assessment of such patients either at scene or by telephone. Routine data were collected from October 2012 to November 2013, from the ambulance service computer-aided dispatch system. Logistic regression models were used to determine the likelihood for patients being transported to ED. Results: Of 23 395 emergency contacts during the evaluation period, 1903 (8. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background. Achieving {{knowledge}} translation {{in healthcare}} {{is growing in}} importance but methods to capture impact of research are not well developed. We present an attempt to capture impact of a programme of research in prehospital emergency care, aiming to inform the development of EMS models of care that avoid, when appropriate, conveyance of patients to hospital for immediate care. Methods. We describe the programme and its dissemination, present examples of its influence on policy and practice, internationally, and analyse routine UK statistics to determine whether conveyance practice has changed. Results. The programme comprises eight research studies, to a value of >£ 4 [*]m. Findings have been disseminated through 18 published papers, cited 274 times in academic journals. We describe examples of how evidence has been put into practice, including new models of care in Canada and Australia. Routine statistics in England show that, alongside rising demand, <b>conveyance</b> <b>rates</b> have fallen from 90 % to 58 % over a 12 -year period, 2, 721 million fewer journeys, with publication of key studies 2003 – 2008. Comment. We have set out the rationale, key features, and impact on practice of a programme of publicly funded research. We describe evidence of knowledge translation, whilst recognising limitations in methods for capturing impact...|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about people who self-harm and are not {{conveyed}} to the emergency department, or the experiences of ambulance service staff in working with people who self-harm and the conveyance decisions that they make. This research, with two linked studies, was conducted using a sequential mixed methods design. In Study 1, quantitative data was collected about episodes of self-harm that received an ambulance crew decision following a 999 call made in the Yorkshire region. The data collected included details of the episode of self-harm, demographic information, the care provided by ambulance staff, clinical outcomes (including <b>conveyance</b> <b>rates),</b> and explanations for care and conveyance decisions. In the sample there was a proportion of conveyance of 87 % and only 13 % non-conveyance. Method of self-harm was related to conveyance, with people who had cut themselves significantly less likely to be conveyed than those using other methods. Non-conveyance was associated with a longer duration of ambulance visit. The findings from Study 1 informed Study 2, which was a qualitative interview-based study with staff from the ambulance service. Six ambulance service staff were interviewed about their experiences of working with people who have self-harmed and about the decision-making around non-conveyance. There were six major themes identified using thematic analysis and the themes were presented as if they were clinicians’ thoughts to demonstrate the decision-making process around whether or not to convey the person who has self-harmed: ‘I’ll do my best to help’ but ‘I worry about getting it wrong’ because ‘I’m not sure what I’m doing’ and ‘I’m not supported’ so ‘It’s more than your job’s worth’, which contributes to an overall ‘conveyance culture’. There are a number of recommendations for future research and improving clinical practice, and the results are presented in relation to existing literature...|$|R
40|$|Research question: What is {{the extent}} of problem of {{maternal}} mortality in a given population? Objective: 1. To evolve a rapid survey methodology aimed at measuring maternal mortality ratio. 2. To find out the probable medical causes of maternal deaths and behavioural factors associated with them. Study Design: cross- sectional. Setting: Urban and rural areas of district Mohindergarh, Haryana. Participants: Members of families in which a maternal death {{had taken place in}} last 12 months. Sample size: All 275 deaths among women 15 - 44 years occurring in the district from 1 st April 95 to 31 st March 96. Study variables: Age, gravida, parity, literacy, caste, land holding, health care facilities, distance from health centers, mode of <b>conveyance.</b> Statistical Analysis: <b>Rates</b> and ratios. Results: Maternal mortality ratio was estimated to be 275 per 100, 000 live births (298 rural and 82 urban). Major causes of death were &#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;" sepsis(30 &#x 0025;), haemorrhage (21 &#x 0025;), abortion(5 &#x 0025;), eclampsia (3 &#x 0025;) and obstructed labour(3 &#x 0025;). Twenty-nine causes of deaths occurred at home and 26 &#x 0025; on way to hospital. Out of 59 (93. 7 &#x 0025;) cases who could avail medical consultation, 61 &#x 0025; arranged it within five hours after onset of symptoms, and 78 &#x 0025; availed two, 21 &#x 0025; three, and 11 &#x 0025; four consulations. The survey was completed in three months at a cost of Rs. 54, 000. Recommendations: Such rapid surveys should be carried out periodically (every 4 - 5 years) to monitor the progress in maternal health. Staff of heath deptt. Should be involved in carrying out these surveys. This will not only help in reducing cost of the survey but information about specific problems of maternal mortality in the area can be utilized by health staff for taking appropriate action to improve maternal health care...|$|R
