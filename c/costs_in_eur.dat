Diplomska naloga obravnava nadzor in optimizacijo porabe električne energije varilne naprave, robota in mize – treh največjih porabnikov robotske varilne celice. V prvem delu so predstavljeni njeni porabniki: glavna stikalna omara, robotski krmilnik, robotski {{manipulator}}, miza ali pozicioner, vpenjalno-pozicionirno orodje, varilni sistem, čistilnik, dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča. Robotski krmilnik vodi mnogokratne naloge z možnostjo vodenja do osem robotov. V glavni stikalni omari se nahajajo vsi napajalni gradniki celice. Gibljivi strojni del celice sta robotski manipulator in miza z vpenjalno-pozicionirnim orodjem. Varilni sistem sestavljajo varilni izvor, povezni paket in varilna pištola. Čistilnik skrbi za čiščenje šobe varilne pištole. Dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča, na kateri so vsa glavna stikala, se uporabljata za upravljanje celice. Z meritvami parametrov robota, mize in varilne naprave smo izdelali dve preglednici nadzora porabe električne energije in dve predlogi HMI (human-machine interface). V njih se podatki sami preračunajo do porabe električne energije v kilovatnih urah in stroškov porabe v evrih za en, sto tisoč ter tri milijone zvarjenih kosov. V primerjavi varilna naprava porabi med tri do štirikrat več električne energije kot robot in miza skupaj, razmerje je odvisno predvsem od izbranega varilnega postopka. Porabo električne energije je možno najbolj optimizirati pri varilni napravi z dobro izbiro in nastavitvijo varilnega postopka z nanašanjem varilnega materiala s pulziranjem toka. Pri robotu in mizi je največji prihranek energije možen z izklopom servo regulacije motorjev robota, medtem ko robotska varilna celica v času odmorov za malico ne obratuje. Hardware producers {{strive to}} offer their customers a technologically perfected robotic cell. Two important factors that customers take into consideration are the overview of energy consumption and a possibility for optimization {{with regard to the}} energy cost savings. This thesis deals with the electricity consumption of a welding machine, robot and positioner, three main energy consumers of a robotic welding cell. The first part of the thesis describes the consumers of a robotic welding cell: robot controller, main switch cabinet, robot manipulator, positioner, clamping-positioning tool, welding system, cleaner, two-handed stand-alone counter and command panel. The robot controller performs multiple tasks and has the possibility to supervise up to eight robots. The power components are located in the main switching cabinet. The moving parts of the robotic welding cell are the robot manipulator and the positioner with the clamping-positioning tool. The welding system is composed of a welding source, a connecting package and a welding pistol. The cleaner carries out cleaning of the welding pistol 2 ̆ 7 s nozzle. The two-handed stand-alone counter and the command panel with all the main switches are used to operate the robotic welding cell. By measuring the parameters of the robot, the positioner and the welding source we compiled two tables showing electricity consumption and designed two HMI (human-machine interface). The tables automatically calculate the electricity consumption for one, 100, 000 and 3 million welded products in kilowatt hours and the <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> <b>EUR.</b> In comparison to the robot with the positioner, the welding source consumes three to four times more power, whereby the ratio mainly depends on the selected welding process. The electricity consumption of the welding tool can be best optimized by good setting and choosing the right welding process. With regard to the robot and the positioner, the most electricity can be saved by deactivating the servo regulation of the robot motors during the lunch time, when the robotic welding cell is not in operation...|$|E

A retrospective analysis was conducted on administrative data from the health ministry and insurance reimbursement claims with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia in 2009 to determine hospitalization rates, <b>costs,</b> and mortality <b>in</b> adults ≥ 50 years of age. Patient chart reviews were conducted to estimate the number of outpatient cases. Among all adults ≥ 50 years, the incidence of hospitalized CAP per 100, 000 person years was: 456. 6 (CZ), 504. 6 (SK), 363. 9 (PL), and 845. 3 (HU). The average fatality rate for all adults ≥ 50 is 19. 1 %, and for each country; 21. 7 % (CZ), 20. 9 % (SK), 18. 6 % (PL), 17. 8 % (HU). Incidence, fatality, and likelihood of hospitalization increased with advancing age. Total healthcare <b>costs</b> of CAP <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> was 12, 579, 543 (CZ); 9, 160, 774 (SK); 22, 409, 085 (PL); and 18, 298, 449 (HU); with hospitalization representing over 90 % of the direct costs of treatment. The burden of CAP increases with advancing age in four CEE countries, with hospitalizations driving the costs of CAP upwards in the elderly population.

40|$|Objectives: Real-world {{resource}} use and cost data on {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) are scarce. This data {{is needed to}} inform health-economic modelling {{to assess the impact of}} new diagnostic and/or treatment technologies. This study provides detailed insight into real-world medical {{resource use}} and costs of stage I-IV NSCLC in the Netherlands. Materials and methods: A random sample of patients newly diagnosed with NSCLC (2009 - 2011) was selected from four Dutch hospitals. Data was retrospectively collected from patient charts. This data included patient characteristics, tumour characteristics, treatment details, adverse events, survival and resource use. Resource use was multiplied by Dutch unit <b>costs</b> expressed <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> 2012. Total mean costs were corrected for censoring using the Bang and Tsiatis weighted complete-case estimator. Furthermore, costs of adverse events, costs per phase of NSCLC management and costs of second opinions are presented. Results: Data was collected on 1067 patients. Total mean costs for NSCLC diagnosis, treatment and follow-up are (sic) 28, 468 during the study period and (sic) 33, 143 when corrected for censoring. Adverse events were recorded in the patient charts for 369 patients (41 %) and 82 patients (9 %) experienced an adverse event of grade III or higher. For these patients, adverse event-related hospital admissions cost on average (sic) 2, 091. Mean total costs are (sic) 1, 725 for the diagnostic period, (sic) 17, 296 for first treatment line, and (sic) 13, 236 for each later treatment line. Costs of providing a second opinion are (sic) 2, 580 per patient. Conclusions: Total mean hospital costs per NSCLC patient are (sic) 33, 143 for the total duration of the disease. Ignoring censoring in our data underestimates these costs by 14 %. Main limitations of the study relate to the short follow-up time, staging difficulties and missing data. Its main strength is that it provides highly detailed, real-world data on the costs of NSCLC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Tomaž Nerat, Igor Locatelli, Mitja Kos Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is a major}} burden for the payer, however, with proper medication adherence, diet and exercise regime, complication occurrence rates, and consequently costs can be altered. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis on real patient data and evaluate which medication adherence or lifestyle intervention is less cost demanding for the payer. Methods: Medline was searched systematically for published type 2 diabetes interventions regarding medication adherence and lifestyle in order to determine their efficacies, that were then used in the cost-effectiveness analysis. For cost-effectiveness analysis-required disease progression simulation, United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes model 2. 0 and Slovenian type 2 diabetes patient cohort were used. The intervention duration was set to 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. Complications and drug <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> euro (<b>EUR)</b> were based on previously published type 2 diabetes costs from the Health Care payer perspective in Slovenia. Results: Literature search proved the following interventions to be effective in type 2 diabetes patients: medication adherence, the Mediterranean diet, aerobic, resistance, and combined exercise. The long-term simulation resulted in no payer net savings. The model predicted following quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained and incremental costs for QALY gained (EUR/QALYg) after 10 years of intervention: high-efficacy medication adherence (0. 245 QALY; 9, 984 EUR/QALYg), combined exercise (0. 119 QALY; 46, 411 EUR/QALYg), low-efficacy medication adherence (0. 075 QALY; 30, 967 EUR/QALYg), aerobic exercise (0. 069 QALY; 80, 798 EUR/QALYg), the Mediterranean diet (0. 057 QALY; 27, 246 EUR/QALYg), and resistance exercise (0. 050 QALY; 111, 847 EUR/QALYg). Conclusion: The results suggest that medication adherence intervention is, regarding cost-effectiveness, superior to diet and exercise interventions from the payer perspective. However, the latter could also be utilized by patients without additional costs, but medication adherence intervention requires trained personnel because of its complex structure. Interventions should be performed for > 2 years to produce noticeable health/cost results. Keywords: type 2 diabetes, adherence, intervention, medication, lifestyle, cost-effectivenes...|$|R

PI-LOT is a proposed 2. 4 m optical/IR telescope that will <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> excess of <b>EUR</b> 10 m, and is thus representative of the scale of facility that will transform Concordia into a significant international observatory. A design study of PILOT, funded by the Australian government, is cur-rently underway. We describe {{the current status of}} this design study, and discuss the implications that major international projects such as PILOT hold for the future of Antarctic astronomy at Concordia. 1 Four years ago: Capri 2003 Two years before Concordia opened for year-round operation, a meeting was held on the beautiful island of Capri to discuss the potential of Dome C for astronomy. Seventy astronomers from Europe, Australia and the US met to discuss the sci-entific possibilities of Concordia. At that stage, however, no direct measurements had been made of site conditions during the winter, and so discussions were based largely on Automatic Weather Station data and models extrapolated from South Pole data. Delegates at this meeting were very positive about the future, with the final summary noting that: • Conditions at Dome C are unique, and extremely favourable. • A medium-size telescope or interferometer could do ground-breaking science. • A very large telescope could make some future space missions unnecessary. • The opportunity awaits...|$|R
