40|$|M {{the request}} of the United States Army Air Service, the tests {{reported}} herein were con-ducted in the 5 -foot atmospheric wind tunnel of the LangIey MemoriaI A~nauticsl Laboratory. The object was the measurement of prassures over three representative thick, tapered airfoils which are being used on existing or forthcoming Army airphmes. The results me presented in the form of pressure maps, <b>cross-span</b> Ioad and normal forw coefficient curves and load contours. The pressure distribution along the chord waa found very sirdar to that for thin wings, but with a tendency tc) ward greater negative p~es. The characterist. imof the Ioading across the span of the U. S. A. 27 C moditied are inferior to those of the other two wings; in the Iatte. ij the distribution is almost exactly elliptical throughout the usual range of flying angles. The form of tip incorporated in these models is not completely satisfactory end a modifica-tion is recommended...|$|E
40|$|MÃ¡ster Universitario en Sistemas FerroviariosThe {{design of}} a {{catenary}} is a complex process, where all the electrical, geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the line, the trains and the surroundings {{should be taken into}} account. For this project, the following had to be considered: a proposed layout, the applicable regulations for the design of this type of lines in the UK and the characteristics of the existing line, because the new one had to be compatible with it. Once the parameters of the existing line and the applicable regulation were studied, electrical and mechanical calculations have been accomplished. The long-term operational load and the short-circuit current have been calculated in order to select the appropriate wires (materials, cross sections, etc.). The positions of the supports have been chosen according to the maximum span length that could be achievable, which depended on multiple parameters, such as the tensile forces, the wind load and the radius of the curves. Once the positions were chosen, it should be demonstrated that the loads do not exceed the maximum permitted on wires and, where applicable, on poles. Then, the geometry of the <b>cross-span</b> arrangements, the reaction forces at the supports and the moments on the base of the poles have been calculated, in order to define the position and size of every support, attachment or foundation. There are some key risks to this OLE design: track alignment changes, unsuitability of buildings for fixing to and inability to obtain the permission or statutory powers to make fixings to the buildings identified in the layout. This project has provided a bus, rail and tram interchange to the city of Wolverhampton, facilitating the intermodal transport...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The paper {{contains}} {{plane strain}} analysis of uniformly stretched plate working in creep condition. The plate contains initial defects in forms of central and/or edge cracks working in mode I. These cracks are modelled by attributing critical value of damage parameter to preset points and therefore resulting in stresses set to zero (material {{does not support}} any loading). The Continuum Damage Mechanics constitutive equations are {{used to describe the}} creep crack growth problem and Finite Element Method Abaqus system is applied to solve corresponding boundary and initial value problem. Analysis of different initial cracks configuration has been performed. The crack path is defined by points in which damage parameter equals to critical one. Time to failure of the plate with single initial crack is achieved when the crack path spans its width. This time is calculated and compared to the time to failure of initially uncracked structure. For the plate with multiple cracks the paths starting from different cracks can develop independently until they merge and/or span the plate width. In each case the damage field is analysed and the direction of crack path development is determined. The analysis of crack propagation allows for determination of a distance between initial cracks for which the interaction between them is negligible. It is demonstrated that Continuum Damage Mechanics approach allows not only to model the development of initially existing cracks but also initiation of new, <b>cross-spanning</b> cracks and their kinking and branching...|$|R
