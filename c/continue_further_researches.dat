40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of an instructional learning strategy, peer-led team learning (PLTL), on secondary school students' conceptual understanding of biology concepts related {{to the topic of}} evolution. Using a mixed methods approach, data were gathered quantitatively through pre/posttesting using a repeated measures design and qualitatively through observations, questionnaires, and interviews. A repeated measures design was implemented to explore the impact of PLTL on students' understanding of concepts related to evolution and students' attitudes towards PLTL implementation. Results from quantitative data comparing pre/posttesting were not able to be compared through inferential statistics as a result of inconsistencies in the data due to a small sample size and design limitations; however, qualitative data identified positive attitudes towards the implementation of PLTL, with students reporting gains in conceptual understanding, academic achievement, and interdependent work ethic. Implications of these findings for learning, teaching, and the educational literature include understanding of student attitudes towards PLTL and insight into the role PLTL plays in improving conceptual understanding of biology concepts.

The firm's objective is to minimize the total deviation of its cash-balance process to some pre-set target levels by selecting an appropriate premium policy. Our problem is totally new and has three distinguishable features: (1) both full and partial information cases are investigated here; (2) the state is subject to terminal constraint; (3) a forward-backward stochastic differential equation formulation is given which is more systematic and mathematically advanced. This formulation also enables us to <b>continue</b> <b>further</b> <b>research</b> in a generalized stochastic recursive control framework (see Duffie and Epstein (1992), El Karoui et al.

40|$|Assessment {{of heavy}} metal {{concentrations}} in the soil samples of urban parks and playgrounds {{is very important for}} the evaluation of potential risks for residents, especially children. Until recently, there has been very little data about urban parks pollution in Montenegro. To evaluate the sources of potential contamination and concentration of heavy metals, soil samples from coastal urban parks and kindergartens of Montenegro were collected. Based on the heavy metal concentrations, multivariate analysis combined with geochemical approaches showed that soil samples in coastal areas of Montenegro had mean Pb and Cd concentrations that were over two times higher than the background values, respectively. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), soil pollution with Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn is contributed by anthropogenic sources. Results for Cr in the surface soils were primarily derived from natural sources. Calculation of different ecological contamination factors showed that Cd is the primary contribution to ecological risk index (RI) origins from anthropogenic, industry, and urbanization sources.

40|$|Mechanism {{of forming}} new {{capillary}} from basal vessels, named angiogenesis, exist under both physiological and pathological conditions. Initiation {{of this process}} requires imbalance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, which can occur for instance under hypoxic conditions. Angiogenesis is complex process which allow tumor cells to proliferate, thus providing tumor to increase its structure. This dependence is highly connected to enhanced migration of tumor cells through blood, which often ends up being an onset of metastasis. It has been proved that capillaries that form during tumor lifetime are different in case of morphology.

40|$|The {{present study}} is a content {{analysis}} of thirteen speeches presented by Jeane Jordan Kirkpatrick while she served as the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1981 - 1985. Seven of the speeches were made before the Security Council, five before the General Assembly, and once before the Economic and Social Council. Kenneth Burke's pentadic analysis provides a highly appropriate methodology through which to view Kirkpatrick's United Nations speeches. It assumes the existence and use of written texts. The dramatistic metaphor, which constitutes the basis of Burke's critical model, is widely used by political scientists and sociologists, {{as well as by}} rhetorical critics. The pentad serves as an organizing scheme to understand, explain, and to evaluate what speakers do and why they do it. The analyses indicate that Kirkpatrick associates most often with a pragmatic line of argument, incorporating a conservative view of the world. This is revealed through her frequent use of Burke's act-agency and agent-agency ratios. She weaves examples of proven occurrences throughout her rhetoric to support her conservative stance on most issues addressed during this period. In addition, the analysis reveal that Kirkpatrick's motive for speaking is to show support for United States allies, in particular, Israel. The appendix includes data from a DICTION analysis of three of Kirkpatrick's speeches. These results are inconclusive. This study serves as a base from which to branch out to <b>continue</b> <b>further</b> <b>research</b> on Kirkpatrick, other women speakers and other Permanent Representatives.

40|$|The role {{of brand}} has evolved {{to take on}} a broader {{application}} as a post-modern management concept and has attracted increasing attention in the 21 st century as a key component for the development of competitive advantage. Far removed from its origins as an identity device, branding now transcends the pure marketing interpretation and is increasingly seen as a catalyst for corporate strategy and a tool for holistic reputation management and business performance. This thesis evaluates the extent to which brand is being adopted as a mechanism to align with corporate strategy, internal culture and supporting behaviours and external delivery or organisational performance: in essence, the concept of a brand-driven organisation that deploys brand as a core capability in pursuit of competitive advantage. This evaluation takes into account defined South African perspectives and examples in a case research approach. It seeks to evaluate how the brand alignment methodology can advance current theory and be applied as a management practice. The research argues that brand extends beyond the marketing function or the end-point of organisational systems and delivery. Rather, it suggests that brand becomes integrated as one of the primary elements of corporate strategy and seeks to embrace strategic organisational intent, internal culture and external manifestation of the business vision and results. The organisational architecture model is adapted to suit this research and offer a brand alignment framework that facilitates the effective and efficient implementation and realisation of strategic intent. This links brand alignment to resource-based theory and posits that it is considered as a core capability within the firm, enabling the attainment of competitive advantage. iv This thesis concludes that brand is not confined to an aspect of marketing, but should be deployed holistically in the organisation as a core capability and opportunity for competitive advantage. The research demonstrates an emerging body of thought and advances theory and practice in this area of business, both academically and in a professional management context, offering possibilities for <b>continued</b> <b>further</b> <b>research</b> in this field of management.

I explored {{the details of}} the traditional oral narratives and compared those details from personal or close to personal experience. Next, I analyzed the details that have stayed the same over time or changed. To accomplish my project I went to a few of the Welcome Week campus tours, conducted audio and video interviews, archival research, as well as video recording the annual ghost walk in October given by the Communications department. The project comprises mainly of a documentary film with a complimentary written component. What I found was that the stories show some correlation between the traditional oral narratives and the first hand experiences such as names, times, experiences, and location of the events.
