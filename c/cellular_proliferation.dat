The number of crescentic glomeruli is an important prognostic factor in determining whether the patient will develop chronic renal disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation</b> and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E

25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} is the secreted protein which mediates signaling {{activities of}} the notochord and floor plate. Studies involving ectopic expression of SHH in vitro and in vivo result in floor plate induction, and differentiation of motor neuron and ventral interneurons. On the other hand, mice mutant for SHH lack ventral spinal cord characteristics.In vitro blocking of SHH signaling using antibodies against it shows similar phenotypes. SHH exerts its effects in a concentration-dependent manner, so that {{a high concentration of}} SHH results in a local inhibition of <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation.</b> This inhibition causes the floor plate to become thin compared to the lateral regions of the neural tube. Lower concentration of SHH results in <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation</b> and induction of various ventral neural cell types. Once the floor plate is established, cells residing in this region will subsequently express SHH themselves generating a concentration gradient within the neural tube.|$|E

25|$|Regeneration in hydra {{has been}} defined as morphallaxis, the process where {{regeneration}} results from remodeling of existing material without <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation.</b> If a hydra is cut into two pieces, the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent hydra, approximately {{the same size as the}} two smaller severed sections. This occurs through the exchange and rearrangement of soft tissues without the formation of new material.|$|E
25|$|After {{the host}} cell is infected, HPV16 early {{promoter}} is activated and a polycistronic primary RNA containing all six early ORFs is transcribed. This polycistronic RNA contains three exons and two introns and undergoes active RNA splicing to generate multiple isoforms of mRNAs. One of the spliced isoform RNAs, E6*I, {{serves as an}} E7 mRNA to translate E7 oncoprotein. In contrast, an intron in the E6 ORF that remains intact without splicing is necessary for translation of E6 oncoprotein. However, viral early transcription subjects to viral E2 regulation and high E2 levels repress the transcription. HPV genomes integrate into host genome by disruption of E2 ORF, preventing E2 repression on E6 and E7. Thus, viral genome integration into host DNA genome increases E6 and E7 expression to promote <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation</b> and the chance of malignancy.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} evolution, the oldest {{physiological}} role of Ahr is in development. Ahr {{is presumed to}} have evolved from invertebrates where it served a ligand-independent role in normal development processes. The Ahr homolog in Drosophila, spineless (ss) is necessary for development of the distal segments of the antenna and leg. Ss dimerizes with tango (tgo), which is the homolog to the mammalian Arnt, to initiate gene transcription. Evolution of the receptor in vertebrates resulted {{in the ability to}} bind ligand and might have helped humans evolve to tolerate smoke of fires. In developing vertebrates, Ahr seemingly plays a role in <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation</b> and differentiation. Despite lacking a clear endogenous ligand, AHR appears {{to play a role in}} the differentiation of many developmental pathways, including hematopoiesis, lymphoid systems, T-cells, neurons, and hepatocytes. AhR has also been found to have an important function in hematopoietic stem cells: AhR antagonism promotes their self-renewal and ex-vivo expansion and is involved in megakaryocyte differentiation.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, many cancers {{originate}} from a viral infection; {{this is especially}} true in animals such as birds, but less so in humans. 12% of human cancers can be attributed to a viral infection. The mode of virally induced tumors can be divided into two, acutely transforming or slowly transforming. In acutely transforming viruses, the viral particles carry a gene that encodes for an overactive oncogene called viral-oncogene (v-onc), and the infected cell is transformed as soon as v-onc is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the virus genome is inserted, especially as viral genome insertion is obligatory part of retroviruses, near a proto-oncogene in the host genome. The viral promoter or other transcription regulation elements, in turn, cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene, which, in turn, induces uncontrolled <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Because viral genome insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes and the chance of insertion near that proto-oncogene is low, slowly transforming viruses have very long tumor latency compared to acutely transforming virus, which already carries the viral-oncogene.|$|E
25|$|It is {{now well}} {{recognized}} that feeding ticks, sandflies, and, more recently, mosquitoes, have {{an ability to}} modulate the immune response of the animals (hosts) on which they feed. The presence of this activity in vector saliva {{is a reflection of}} the inherent overlapping and interconnected nature of the host hemostatic and inflammatory/immunological responses and the intrinsic need to prevent these host defenses from disrupting successful feeding. The mechanism for mosquito saliva-induced alteration of the host immune response is unclear, but the data have become increasingly convincing that such an effect occurs. Early work described a factor in saliva that directly suppresses TNF-α release, but not antigen-induced histamine secretion, from activated mast cells. Experiments by Cross et al. (1994) demonstrated that the inclusion of Ae. aegypti mosquito saliva into naïve cultures led to a suppression of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-γ production, while the cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 are unaffected by mosquito saliva. <b>Cellular</b> <b>proliferation</b> in response to IL-2 is clearly reduced by prior treatment of cells with mosquito salivary gland extract. Correspondingly, activated splenocytes isolated from mice fed upon by either Ae. aegypti or Cx. pipiens mosquitoes produce markedly higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 concurrent with suppressed IFN-γ production. Unexpectedly, this shift in cytokine expression is observed in splenocytes up to 10 days after mosquito exposure, suggesting natural feeding of mosquitoes can have a profound, enduring, and systemic effect on the immune response.|$|E

2500|$|Inhibition of {{apoptosis}} {{can result}} in a number of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections. It was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation,</b> but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death. The most common of these diseases is cancer, the disease of excessive <b>cellular</b> <b>proliferation,</b> which is often characterized by an overexpression of IAP family members. As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: Cycle-regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors. Some apoptotic factors are vital during mitochondrial respiration e.g. cytochrome C. Pathological inactivation of apoptosis in cancer cells is correlated with frequent respiratory metabolic shifts toward glycolysis (an observation known as the “Warburg hypothesis” [...] ).|$|E

[...] Growth in culture and anchorage-independent growth were inhibited in SFRP1-expressing UMRC3 cells. [...] The growth-inhibitory effects of SFRP1 were due primarily to decreased cell proliferation rather than an increase in apoptosis.
