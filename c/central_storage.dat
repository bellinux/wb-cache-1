25|$|The Harbach Round Barn is {{an example}} of a {{noteworthy}} design variation within round barn design, specifically because of its specially braced roof. It is not entirely unique; its cupola and roof make it very similar to the Fehr Round Barn. The main difference in the Fehr and Harbach Round Barns is the Harbach's lack of a <b>central</b> <b>storage</b> silo. The building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1984 as part of a Multiple Property Submission.|$|E

On 27 August at a meeting in Fukushima City Governor Yuhei Sato spoke out his concern about the sudden proposals, and the implications that this would have for the prefecture and its inhabitants, that had already endured so much from the nuclear accident.

25|$|Workers plan to pump {{water into}} turbine condensers, but need to pump {{water out of}} them first. Work to {{transfer}} water from the unit 2 and unit 1 condensers to a <b>central</b> <b>storage</b> tank was completed on 9 and 10 April. Workers have also knocked holes through the turbine hall buildings of units 2 and 4 to accommodate hoses for the water transfer. At unit 3, work continues to make space for water in the turbine condenser by pumping existing water into other tanks. Japanese news wire NHK reports that workers are laying hoses to transfer water to an LLW waste processing facility, which continues to be inspected. TEPCO says that it cannot start work switching on emergency systems on site until the turbine hall is dry. NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12cm since a leak in a trench was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.|$|E

2500|$|Development on Hyperion {{started in}} 2011 and {{was based upon}} {{research}} into multi-bounce complex global illumination originally conducted at Disney Research in Zürich. Disney, in turn, had to assemble a new super-computing cluster just to handle Hyperion's immense processing demands, which consists of over 2,300 Linux workstations distributed across four data centers (three in Los Angeles and one in San Francisco). Each workstation, as of 2014, included a pair of 2.4GHz Intel Xeon processors, 256 GB of memory, {{and a pair of}} 300 GB solid-state drives configured as a RAID Level 0 array (i.e., to operate as a single 600 GB drive).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} framework for describing, a process for identifying, and a model for evaluating misalignments in the supply chain when varying elements such as structure, processes, and management components. The developed approach {{makes it possible to}} address and improve the alignment of supply chain structures, processes, and management components. To further increase knowledge of how to improve the alignment in supply chains, two specific models were developed for choosing contract types and governance structures in the trucking service supply chain including shipper, forwarders, and carriers. These models extend the first approach with detailed insights {{that can be used to}} align incentives in the trucking service supply chain, which contributes to the overall research purpose. When studying the Swedish cash supply chain and its structure, processes, and management components, particular focus was directed on three major design changes: centralization of <b>central</b> bank <b>storage</b> facilities, eliminating returns to <b>central</b> bank <b>storage</b> facilities, and providing interest compensation at depots. By analyzing these changes using a network flow model, results showed that centralization from two to one <b>central</b> bank <b>storage</b> facility led to unintended increases in transportation costs and risk, while eliminating returns to <b>central</b> bank <b>storage</b> facilities led to increased transportation flow, larger shipment sizes, and larger risk, but reduced transportation costs. Furthermore, results showed that providing interest compensation to private depots led to reduced transportation costs as well as risk. From studying a trucking service supply chain, a performance-based contract type was found to align incentives between a large Swedish grocery retailer and its forwarders by relieving the forwarders of coordination responsibility. This meant that they could improve trucking cost utilization and thereby reduce their price to the shipper, and still improve their profitability. Further, a cooperative governance structure utilizing a profit-sharing mechanism was found to align incentives between forwarders and carriers, which meant increased service frequency, reduced service price, and increased chain profit...|$|R
