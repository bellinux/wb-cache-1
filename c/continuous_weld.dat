50|$|An {{intermittent}} {{fillet weld}} {{is one that}} is not continuous across a joint. These welds are portrayed as a set of two numbers {{to the right of the}} triangle instead of just one. The first number as mentioned earlier refers to the length of the weld. The second number, separated from the first by a “-”, refers to the pitch. The pitch is a measurement from midpoint to midpoint of the intermittent welds. Intermittent welding is used when either a <b>continuous</b> <b>weld</b> is not necessary, or when a <b>continuous</b> <b>weld</b> threatens the joint by warping. In some cases intermittent welds are staggered on both sides of the joint. In this case, the notation of the two triangles aren't directly on top of each other. Instead, the side of the joint to receive the first weld will have a triangle further to the left than the following side’s triangle notation. As an end result of alternating intermittent fillet welds at each side, the space between welds on one side of the joint will be the midpoint of the opposite side’s weld.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} make laser beam welding more economical, {{investment}} and operating costs for laser welding systems have to be reduced and process reliability and weld quality have to be optimized by choice of appropriate process parameters and process control.

The appearance of plasma shielding in laser beam welding is a cause of interruptions and therefore non-fulfilment of this criterion...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} welding technique for thermoplastic composites (TPCs) entails melting the TPC polymer at the joint interface using heat generated by resistive (Joule) heating of a conductive mesh or heating element placed between the surfaces to be welded. The continuous {{resistance welding}} (CRW) is an automated large-scale resistance welding technique {{that consists of}} a moving voltage source along the heating element creating a <b>continuous</b> <b>weld</b> along its path. This paper presents a transient model that is developed to predict the heat transfer in TPCs in all three dimensions during the CRW process. The model is finite element in nature and includes both the resistive and thermal conductivity behaviors of the material involved. The significance of this modeling approach is that it captures {{the movement of the}} electrical connection, as well as the nonuniform distribution of the current and resistive heating along the length and width of the weld seam. The modeling results are compared with experimental data obtained by thermocouples and an infrared camera, and exhibit solid conformance for predicting the trend of variations in weld temperature.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} an experimental investigation on the section moment capacities of rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beams (RHFCB). The rivet fastened RHFCB is {{a new type of}} cold-formed steel section, an extension to the widely researched hollow flange beams, shown to have capacities more typically associated with hot-rolled steel beams. It is characterized by a unique geometry, consisting of two rectangular hollow flanges and a web. Unlike other cold-formed sections, the RHFCB has improved capacity due to its mono-symmetric shape and the absence of free edges. The RHFCB manufacturing involves fastening two hollow flanges to a web, utilizing inexpensive intermittent self-pierced rivet fastening. This enables designers to develop optimum sections with varying web and flange thicknesses, therefore delaying the onset of other buckling failures due to slender web element. Various researches have been carried out to investigate the behavior of continuously welded hollow flange beams but little is known on the behavior of RHFCBs. Hence this paper investigates the section moment capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs. Fifteen section moment capacity tests were conducted to investigate the behavior of RHFCB flexural members. The reduction in section moment capacities from having <b>continuous</b> <b>weld</b> to intermittent rivet connection at its web-flange junction was also investigated. The ultimate moment capacities from the tests were compared with current steel design standards: AS/NZS 4600, AS 4100 and AISI S 100. The paper also explores the suitability of the Direct Strength Method, with modification being proposed, from the results obtained from this investigation...|$|E

40|$|The new welding technique, "SHADOW - {{stepless}} {{high speed}} accurate and discrete one pulse welding", is introduced. SHADOW means {{the use of}} a single pulse to generate a quasi <b>continuous</b> <b>weld</b> of several millimeters in length. The processing time is defined by the pulse duration of the pulsed laser. At present, a state-of-the-art laser is capable of a maximum pulse duration of 20 ms. The variation of the laser power depending on time is a vital capability of the pulsed laser to adapt the energy deposition into the workpiece (pulse shaping). Laser beam welds of several watch components were successfully performed. Similar metals like crowns and axes made out of stainless steel have been welded using pulsed laser radiation. Applying a series of about 130 single pulses for the crown-axis combination, the total energy accumulates to 19. 5 J. The use of the SHADOW welding technique reduces the energy to 2. 5 J. While welding dissimilar metals like stainless steel and brass, the SHADOW technique has even more advantages. Gearwheels made out of brass have been joined to axes made out of stainless steel. Common pulse mode welding generates a considerable amount of contamination but SHADOW welding drastically reduces the contamination and the distortion. Laser beam welding of copper has a low process reliability due to the high reflection and high thermal conductivity. SHADOW welds of 3. 6 mm length were performed on 250 mu m thick copper plates with very high reproducibility. As a result, a pilot plant for laser beam welding of copper plates has been set up...|$|E
40|$|In current 3 -dimensional multi-pass {{repair weld}} {{simulations}} each pass is generally modelled {{as a single}} <b>continuous</b> <b>weld</b> bead using either a simultaneous bead deposition or a progressive bead deposition moving heat source approach. In reality the length of typical manual metal arc (MMA) repair welds often necessitates {{the use of multiple}} weld beads for any individual pass. To investigate the modelling assumptions associated with this approximation a series of results are presented that simulate the deposition of a multi-bead, single MMA weld pass on a stainless steel flat plate. The simulations make use of a fabricated single bead weld test specimen to define the welding conditions. A number of different heat source models and bead sequencing scenarios have been investigated. These include moving heat source simulations, simultaneous bead laying methods (also called "block-dumped" methods) and combinations of the two. The work provides a useful insight into how certain modelling approximations affect weld residual stress distributions. It is concluded that moving heat source end effects are not sensitive to modelling assumptions made in weld beads remote from the stop end. However, residual stress predictions at the mid-length of a multi-bead weld pass on a flat plate are sensitive to the modelling assumptions. In particular, modelling each bead of a multi-bead weld pass can increase the stresses at mid-length relative to a simulation that deposits the whole pass in one go. One further observation made is that modelling the central bead of a multi-bead weld pass using a block-dumped technique (allowing a symmetry boundary condition to be used perpendicular to the weld bead) can result in inaccurate or misleading results...|$|E
40|$|Friction stir welding is a {{patented}} joining process {{invented in}} 1991 at The Welding Institute in Cambridge, UK, and further developed {{to the stage}} suitable for production. In this process, a wear resistant rotating tool is used to join sheet and plate with different materials such as aluminum, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, and titanium. This work studies the thermal characteristics of this process and provides a modeling technique based on Neural Network {{that can be used}} for real-time control. A thermal feed-back control method is presented to control the process. Using some thermal modeling for the heat distribution during friction stir welding process, this paper displays the complexity of obtaining an accurate design for the thermal feed back control. A three-dimensional transient heat transfer model is developed here for a sequential joining process (Friction Stir Welding- FSW) applied on aluminum parts. A neural network is created based on a set of experiments to predict the spatial and temporal variations in the temperature over the weld seam for different set of input variables. The model includes the dynamic and friction behavior of the rotating spindle and the thermal behaviors of the weld components involved. The significance of this modeling approach is that it captures the movement of the spindle, simulating a sequential joining process along a <b>continuous</b> <b>weld</b> seam. The modeling results are compared with experimental data obtained by thermocouples and infrared camera, and accurately predict the trend of variations in weld temperature. A fuzzy-logic based controller is proposed to regulate the FSW process parameters to maintain the weld temperature within the margin required to ensure the weld quality. This modeling and control system can have applications in manufacturing aluminum parts in automotive and aerospace industry. Copyright 9 2011 by ASME. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

50|$|To support trains {{that run}} {{regularly}} at higher speeds, the rails {{need to be}} reliable. Most freight tracks have wooden ties which cause rails to become slightly misaligned over time due to wood rot, splitting and spike-pull (where the spike is gradually loosened from the tie). The concrete ties used to replace them are intended to make the track more stable, particularly with changes in temperature. Rail joints are also an issue, since most conventional rail lines use bolts and fishplates to join two sections of the rail together. This causes the joint to become slightly misaligned over time due to loosening bolts. To make for a smoother ride at higher speeds, the lengths of rail may be welded together to form <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> rail (CWR).
