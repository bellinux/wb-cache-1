500|$|The chamber opera Savitri (1908) {{is written}} for three solo voices, a small hidden female chorus, and an {{instrumental}} {{combination of two}} flutes, a cor anglais and a double string quartet. The music critic John Warrack comments on the [...] "extraordinary expressive subtlety" [...] with which Holst deploys the sparse forces: [...] "...he two unaccompanied vocal lines opening the work skilfully convey the relationship between Death, steadily advancing through the forest, and Savitri, her frightened answers fluttering round him, unable to escape his harmonic pull." [...] Head describes the work as unique in its time for its compact intimacy, and considers it Holst's most successful attempt to end the domination of Wagnerian chromaticism in his music. Dickinson considers it a significant step, [...] "not towards opera, but towards an idiomatic pursuit of [...] vision". Of the Kālidāsa texts, Dickinson dismisses The Cloud Messenger (1910–12) as an [...] "accumulation of desultory incidents, opportunistic dramatic episodes and ecstatic outpourings" [...] which illustrate the composer's <b>creative</b> <b>confusion</b> during that period; the Two Eastern Pictures (1911), in Dickinson's view, provide [...] "a more memorable final impression of Kālidāsa".|$|E
500|$|The album also {{marked the}} {{transition}} of Scott-Heron from beat poet to singer-songwriter with a full-scale band. He further developed this melodic approach with his following work with Brian Jackson, The First Minute of a New Day (1975) and From South Africa to South Carolina (1976). While the album {{did not have a}} direct impact on the black music scene at the time, it proved {{to become one of the}} Strata-East label's most successful LP releases, in terms of sales and appeal to their target audience. While serving as Scott-Heron's and Jackson's only album for the independent label, Winter in America helped Strata-East Records achieve considerable notability among other New York City distributors of soul and jazz music during the 1970s, while the latter genre had been viewed by many jazz purists to be in a period of <b>creative</b> <b>confusion</b> and decline. In describing the label and its issued musical works, Dream magazine's Kevin Moist stated [...] "The diversity and experimentation of the music, plus the great quality of many of those experiments, make it seem like more like a creative golden age in which the dominant idea was new ideas mixing and blending cultural styles and artistic genres or pushing existing styles into new extremes." [...] According to Nick Dedina of Rhapsody, Winter in America had impact elsewhere, stating [...] "this deeply felt (and sometimes deeply funky) album helped break the pioneer of protest jazz-soul and rap to the general public with hit single 'The Bottle'".|$|E
5000|$|The {{performance}} {{started to}} rehearse at Sovremennik Theatre, using {{a certain period}} of administrative and <b>creative</b> <b>confusion,</b> semi-legal, including: Oleg Dal, Valentin Nikulin, Afanasi Trishkin. However, soon the rehearsals were stopped by order of the director of the theater. [...] Unable to find work in Moscow, Afanasy Trishkin moved to Kishinev, where he worked in the theater-studio movie actor at the film studio Moldova-Film. Removed in dozens of paintings by these and other studios, mainly in adventure strips.|$|E
