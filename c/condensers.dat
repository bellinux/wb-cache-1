5|$|Between 1999 and 2000, {{the power}} station {{was given a}} turbine upgrade. In 2000, the station's <b>{{condenser}}s</b> were also refurbished.

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew <b>condensers</b> made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico <b>condensers</b> made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

50|$|Condenser {{enlargers}} produce higher contrast than diffusers because {{light is}} scattered from its path by the negative's image silver; {{this is called}} the Callier Effect. The <b>condenser's</b> increased contrast emphasises any negative defects, such as dirt and scratches, and image grain.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the extent}} of the fouling, the impact can be quite severe on the <b>{{condense}}r's</b> ability to condense the exhaust steam coming from the turbine. As fouling builds up within the tubing, an insulating effect is created and the heat-transfer characteristics of the tubes are diminished, often requiring the turbine to be slowed to a point where the condenser can handle the exhaust steam produced. Typically, this can be quite costly to power plants in the form of reduced output, increase fuel consumption and increased CO2 emissions. This [...] "derating" [...] of the turbine to accommodate the <b>condenser's</b> fouled or blocked tubing is an indication that the plant needs to clean the tubing in order to return to the turbine's nameplate capacity. A variety of methods for cleaning are available, including online and offline options, depending on the plant's site-specific conditions.|$|R
5|$|Active collectors: these collect {{water in}} the same way as a dehumidifier; {{although}} the designs work well, they require an energy source, making them uneconomical except in special circumstances. New, innovative designs seek to minimise the energy requirements of active <b>condensers</b> or make use of renewable energy resources.|$|E
5|$|After {{the raid}} on Yarmouth, {{several of the}} III Squadron battleships {{developed}} problems with their <b>condensers.</b> This included König Albert; tubing needed to be replaced in all three main <b>condensers,</b> which necessitated extensive dockyard work. The ship went into drydock in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven on 29 May, {{two days before the}} rest of the fleet departed for the Battle of Jutland. Work on the ship was not completed until 15 June, and as a result, König Albert was the only German dreadnought in active service to miss the battle. On 18 August 1916, König Albert took part in an operation to bombard Sunderland. Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the original 31 May plan: the two serviceable German battlecruisers— and —augmented by three faster dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. Scheer would trail behind {{with the rest of the}} fleet and provide support. Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.|$|E
5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the King George Vs {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Afterwards, they were ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet. This grand battle was slow to happen, however, because of the Germans' reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force. As a result, the Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie. While the 2nd Battle Squadron was conducting gunnery training off the northern coast of Ireland on 27 October, Audacious struck a mine and sank; all of her crew was successfully rescued before she capsized. King George V developed problems with her <b>condensers</b> in November. This forced the ship to be intermittently withdrawn from operations over the next several months while the <b>condensers</b> had their tubes replaced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{steam power}} plants, any {{improvement}} in the cooling towers thermal performance will cause the <b>condenser's</b> temperature to decrease; which in turn enhances the power plant's efficiency. Due to water shortage, many power plants {{all around the world}} rely on natural draft dry cooling towers (Heller type). In these cooling towers, <b>condenser's</b> exit hot water is pumped to vertical or horizontal finned radiators which are arranged all around of the tower. The tower should then be able to cool down the circulating water to the <b>condenser’s</b> temperature. Conversely ambient air is sucked naturally through these radiators due to heat gain from the hot water. The heated air is then discharged through the tower's top exit to the ambient. Environmental conditions strictly affect Heller cooling tower's performance. Temperature, density and the mass flow rate of sucked air into the cooling tower will completely influence on its operation. To improve the cooling tower's performance it is proposed to inject the steam generator’s flue gas into the tower for better air suction. In this study a natural draft dry cooling tower incorporating the flue gas duct is modeled to study the effect of flue gas injection on the sucked air flow rate and the radiator heat transfer. Considering the buoyancy effect term, for a 3 -D incompressible flow, the navier stoke's equations as well as the energy equation are solved by computational fluid dynamic method (CFD) to obtain the air flow pattern in and around the tower as well as the heat transfer from the radiators. Results show that the flue gas injection will help to improve the performanc...|$|R
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew <b>condensers.</b> They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew <b>condensers</b> were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{is set on}} a post-apocalyptic version of Mount Desert Island, known in-game as The Island, which is north-east of the Commonwealth, Fallouts post-apocalyptic version of Boston, Massachusetts. The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by radioactive fog. Because the creatures that live inside the fog are unwilling to go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called fog <b>condensers</b> to turn the fog into liquid {{in order to protect}} its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Wolf Klaphake was a {{successful}} chemist working in Berlin during the 1920s and 1930s. During that time, he tested several forms of air wells in Yugoslavia and on Vis Island in the Adriatic Sea. Klaphake's work was inspired by Zibold and by the works of Maimonides, a known Jewish scholar who wrote in Arabic about 1,000 years ago and who mentioned the use of water <b>condensers</b> in Palestine.|$|E

The shell is fabricated from carbon steel plates and is stiffened {{as needed to}} provide rigidity for the shell.

The plates also provide support that help prevent sagging of long tube lengths.|$|R
50|$|The ship sailed from New York City on 25 February 1945, {{bound for}} Norfolk, Virginia. There it loaded 6,675 tons of {{aircraft}} bombs in its holds.

The ship waited five days for the next Mediterranean-bound convoy, UGS-80.

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies {{believed that this}} area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through.

Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their <b>condensers,</b> a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative <b>condensers</b> for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three <b>condensers</b> (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, {{the heat}} of {{condensation}} is valuable because it takes large amounts of solar energy to evaporate water and generate saturated, vapor-laden hot air. This energy is, by definition, transferred to the <b>condenser's</b> surface during condensation. With most forms of solar stills, this heat of condensation is ejected from the system as waste heat. The challenge still existing in the field today, is to achieve the optimum temperature difference between the solar-generated vapor and the seawater-cooled condenser, maximal reuse of the energy of condensation, and minimizing the asset investment.|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a {{synchronous condenser}} (sometimes called a synchronous capacitor or synchronous compensator) is aDC-excited synchronous motor, whose shaft is {{not connected to}} anything but spins freely. [...] Its purpose is not to convert electric power to mechanical power or vice versa, but to adjust conditions on the electric power transmission grid. Its field is controlled by a voltage regulator to either generate or absorb reactive power as needed to adjust the grid's voltage, or to improve power factor. The <b>condenser’s</b> installation and operation are identical to large electric motors and generators.|$|R

Bottoming cycles operating from a steam <b>condenser's</b> heat exhaust are theoretically possible, but uneconomical because of the very large, expensive equipment needed to extract energy from the small temperature differences between condensing steam and outside air or water. However, it is common in cold climates (such as Finland) to drive community heating systems from a power plant's condenser heat. Such cogeneration systems can yield theoretical efficiencies above 95%.|$|R
5|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station, heated to create steam to turn the steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by <b>condensers</b> using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, the water is cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the water is discharged back into the river.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the watertight doors could not close, and the <b>condensers</b> remained problematic.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam <b>condensers</b> for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E

A cover story was provided for the sappers as they conducted their training; a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of American engineers in a fictional 'Washington Cup' athletic event, which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute, followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding endurance test. The departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non-essential military personnel, and all mail and telephone calls were censored.|$|E
5|$|São Paulo {{made two}} trips to Europe in 1920. The first {{conveyed}} King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium to Brazil for the centennial celebrations. After São Paulo brought them home, the ship traveled to Portugal {{to take the}} bodies of the formerly-exiled Emperor Pedro II and his wife, Teresa Cristina, back to Brazil. In July 1922, both battleships helped to quash the first of the Tenente revolts (Revolução Tenentista), in which the garrison of Rio de Janeiro's Fort Copacabana rebelled and began bombarding the city. São Paulo shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; Minas Geraes did not fire its guns. In 1924, three lieutenants, including Hercolino Cascardo, took over São Paulo with other crewmen. They were unsuccessful in swaying any other ships to their cause, except for an old torpedo boat, and soon sailed out of the harbor after firing a six-pounder gun at Minas Geraes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} various circulating water flow rate assumptions on the results from analyzing the performance impact of tube plugging in a condenser. The tube-side water’s flow rate has a strong influence in the results of condenser calculations. Affecting flow rate is the pressure drop of the circulating water. This paper advocates accounting for flow rate variations. The equations to account for tube-side pressure drops in the circulating water system are presented, as foundation for this accounting. The purposes of the paper are to present the development of key equations, to demonstrate application of the method of analysis, and to support the assertion that circulating water flow assumptions (as tube plugging varies) are important. The dependence of flow on tube plugging is calculated by accounting for the hydraulic balance between the tube-side circuit’s pressure drop and the pressure head provided by the circulating water pump. Of principal interest is the <b>condenser’s</b> shell side pressure. Comparisons of condenser performance are shown for several different assumptions about flow rate. Example plots are used to illustrate the effects of alternative modeling assumptions. Two models are used. The first is a submodel of a condenser and circulating water pump, along with supply and receiver reservoirs and associated piping. The second is a fossil steam turbine Rankine cycle that includes a condenser and circulating water pump. The method of calculation of the <b>condenser’s</b> shell-side equilibrium pressure closely follows the standard published by the Heat Exchange Institute.
