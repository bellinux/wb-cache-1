40|$|Granular anchors are a {{relatively}} new concept in ground engineering with relatively little known of their applications, failure modes and ultimate pullout capacities. A granular anchor consists of three main components: a base plate; tendon and compacted granular backfill. The tendon is used to transmit the applied load to the base plate which compresses the granular material to form the anchor. A study of the load?displacement response and ultimate pullout capacity of granular anchors constructed in intact lodgement till and made ground deposits is reported in this paper. Parallel tests were also performed on cast-in situ <b>concrete</b> <b>anchors</b> that are traditionally used for anchoring purposes.

5000|$|Tilt current meters {{operate under}} the drag-tilt {{principle}} and are designed to either float or sink depending on the type. A floating tilt current meter typically consists of a sub-surface buoyant housing that is anchored to the sea floor with a flexible line or tether. A sinking tilt current is similar, but the housing is designed such that the meter hangs from the attachment point. In either case, the housing tilts {{as a function of}} its shape, buoyancy (negative or positive) and the water velocity. Once the characteristics of a housing is known, the velocity can be determined by measuring the angle of the housing and direction of tilt. The housing contains a data logger that records the orientation (angle from vertical and compass bearing) of the Tilt Current Meter. Floating tilt current meters are typically deployed on the bottom with a lead or <b>concrete</b> <b>anchor</b> but may be deployed on lobster traps or other convenient anchors of opportunity. Sinking tilt current meters may be attached to an oceanographic mooring, floating dock or fish pen. Tilt current meters have the advantage over other methods of measuring current in that they are generally relatively low-cost instruments and the design and operation is relatively simple. [...] The low-cost of the instrument may allow researchers to use the meters in greater numbers (thereby increasing spatial density) and/or in locations where there is a risk of instrument loss.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand greenshell mussel {{cultivation}} {{began in}} the 1970s and has since undergone massive expansion, with production growth of 708% from 1988 to 2000 (an average annual growth of 18%). Initial farms {{were based on the}} 700-year-old European floating raft method of mussel cultivation which was suitable at small scales; however, methods to support larger scale production were soon needed. An adaption of the Japanese longline shellfish aquaculture system led to the methods used today for commercial greenshell aquaculture and facilitated the transition to large-scale production by incorporating mechanized harvesting. This adaptation of the Japanese longline method consists of a series of large plastic buoys connected by two ropes forming a backbone which is held in place by <b>concrete</b> <b>anchor</b> blocks or steel anchors screwed into the seabed. Once the spat have been transported from the beach to mussel farms around the country, they are transferred into a stocking that holds the spat-covered seaweed material around a “dropper rope” which is suspended in the water column hanging at regular intervals off the backbone ropes. Soon after, the stocking and seaweed rots away, leaving only the rope for the mussels to attach. Subsequent loss of spat from the dropper ropes is typically high, generally over 50% and as high as 95%. This loss is partly due to the secondary settlement behaviour of mussels, whereby the spat can release their point of attachment to the growing rope and exude a mucous “parachute” to help move to an alternative settlement site using water currents. This loss of spat from mussel farms is a significant problem for the industry. A 2007 study identified two stressors that reduce the retention of mussels on the rope; desiccation and starvation (both of which are experienced on the journey from where the spat are harvested to where they are farmed). Steps to reduce these stressors on the spat during transport could potentially improve retention rates.|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{displacement of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>anchor</b> foundation could be rather significant {{due to the}} great pullout loading via main cables in soft soils. The evolution of long-term displacement with time is simulated considering the construction procedure {{as well as the}} influence of time-dependence of the soft soils coupled with consolidation theory using FEM. It is found that the long-term settlement and lateral displacement could be larger than 2 - 4 times the short-term one. The lateral displacement is more notable and lasts longer in long-term than settlement in terms of their magnitudes and developments with time. Copyright ASCE 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a detailed}} buckling {{evaluation of the}} primary tanks in the Hanford double-shell waste tanks (DSTs), {{which is part of}} a comprehensive structural review for the Double-Shell Tank Integrity Project. This work also provides information on tank integrity that specifically responds to concerns raised by the Office of Environment, Safety, and Health (ES&H) Oversight (EH- 22) during a review of work performed on the double-shell tank farms and the operation of the aging waste facility (AWF) primary tank ventilation system. The current buckling review focuses on the following tasks: (1) Evaluate the potential for progressive anchor bolt failure and the appropriateness of the safety factors that were used for evaluating local and global buckling. The analysis will specifically answer the following questions: (a) Can the EH- 22 scenario develop if the vacuum is limited to - 6. 6 -inch water gage (w. g.) by a relief valve? (b) What is the appropriate factor of safety required to protect against buckling if the EH- 22 scenario can develop? (c) What is the appropriate factor of safety required to protect against buckling if the EH- 22 scenario cannot develop? (2) Develop influence functions to estimate the axial stresses in the primary tanks for all reasonable combinations of tank loads based on detailed finite element analysis. The analysis must account for the variation in design details and operating conditions between the different DSTs. The analysis must also address the imperfection sensitivity of the primary tank to buckling. (3) Perform a detailed buckling analysis to determine the maximum allowable differential pressure for each of the DST primary tanks at the current specified limits on waste temperature, height, and specific gravity. Based on the <b>concrete</b> <b>anchor</b> bolt loads analysis and the small deformations that are predicted at the unfactored limits on vacuum and axial loads, it is very unlikely that the EH- 22 scenario (i. e., progressive anchor bolt failure leading to global buckling of the tank under increased vacuum) could occur.

40|$|Purpose: Functioning {{level is}} one of the major {{indicators}} of recovery in schizophrenia. It is important that the assessment of functioning is performed accurately. However, functioning evaluation is difficult due to the absence of specific anchor points in the widely used functioning assessment scales. We aimed to validate a new functioning scale, the life functioning assessment inventory (L-FAI), which assesses the functioning outcome of patients with psychosis in a more objective, and comprehensive manner. L-FAI assesses four life domains including work, social relationships, leisure, and homemaking. Specific and <b>concrete</b> <b>anchor</b> points are set in each of these domains. Methods: The reliability and validity of L-FAI were assessed in 32 patients with psychosis. Opinions towards the scale were also obtained from experienced mental health professionals and members of a local advocacy group. Results: Good inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa 0. 67 - 0. 97) and test-retest reliability (Cohen's kappa 0. 67 - 0. 86) were found. The scale has also been found to have good concurrent validity, correlating well with social and occupational functioning assessment scale (SOFAS) and role functioning scale (RFS) (Spearman's r 0. 53 - 0. 89). The scale was associated solely with negative symptoms (Spearman's r - 0. 48) but not with positive symptoms. Conclusions: L-FAI is suited for both clinical and research purposes in evaluating functioning level in patients with psychosis. More research is needed to replicate the current study with a larger sample size. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
