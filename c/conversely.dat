5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> Jovovich {{received}} a Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Supporting Actress, and Chris Tucker {{was nominated for}} Worst New Star for his performances in both The Fifth Element and Money Talks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> Milla Jovovich's {{performance}} {{was nominated for}} a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} {{chemical}} reactions to produce electricity, and <b>conversely</b> {{the ability of}} electricity to drive chemical reactions has {{a wide array of}} uses.|$|E
5|$|A Month in the Country {{featured}} film debuts {{or early}} roles of several notable British actors. Although {{it was the}} third cinema feature film to cast Colin Firth, it was his first lead role. Similarly, it was Kenneth Branagh's first cinema film, and Natasha Richardson's second. <b>Conversely,</b> it was the last role of David Garth who died in May 1988.|$|E
5|$|Adelaide has a Mediterranean climate with St Kilda being {{slightly}} hotter and drier {{than the}} Adelaide average. Summer daytime temperatures {{can be expected}} to exceed 40°C on 4days of the year. <b>Conversely,</b> nighttime temperatures in winter are expected to drop below 0°C on 1 day, although generally the season is mild with moderate rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. <b>Conversely,</b> colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|After his death, non-Mormon {{newspapers}} were almost unanimous in portraying Smith {{as a religious}} fanatic. <b>Conversely,</b> within Mormonism, Smith was memorialized first and foremost as a prophet, martyred to seal the testimony of his faith.|$|E
5|$|Another {{classification}} scheme considers genetic and demographic factors. Type 1 {{has a positive}} family history, starts {{before the age of}} 40, and is associated with the human leukocyte antigen, HLA-Cw6. <b>Conversely,</b> type 2 does not show a family history, presents after age 40, and is not associated with HLA-Cw6. Type 1 accounts for about 75% of persons with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its role}} in facilitating iron uptake, copper {{deficiency}} can produce anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. <b>Conversely,</b> Wilson's disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.|$|E
5|$|Because the law grants a {{municipality}} significant regulatory latitude, 35 of the state's 565 municipalities {{are currently}} dry. <b>Conversely,</b> {{because of the}} grandfathering of licenses, several municipalities have a substantially higher ratio of licenses. For instance, the resort town of Wildwood has a permanent population of 5,300, but 61 active liquor licenses.|$|E
5|$|Considered by itself, Artemisium was a {{relatively}} insignificant battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor prevent it from advancing further {{along the coast of}} Greece. <b>Conversely,</b> neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> Cawkwell and Sealey {{suggest the}} Maroneia {{campaign}} was in 353 BC (though without explicit justification). The Maroneia campaign might therefore {{have been part}} of the campaign that Philip fought against Cetriporis (probably 355 BC), or a camapaign against Amadokos (probably 353 BC).|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> Gallagher {{was voted}} the most overrated guitarist {{of the last}} {{millennium}} in a 1999 poll of fellow players, and the ninth-most overrated ever in a 2002 listener survey – he cited the former as the award he most enjoyed receiving.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> Robespierre's impassioned {{defense of}} the march raised his public profile considerably. The episode gave him a lasting heroic status among the poissardes and {{burnished}} {{his reputation as a}} patron of the poor. His later rise to become virtual dictator of the Revolution was greatly facilitated by his actions during the occupation of the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> UConn boasted one of {{the better}} {{defenses}} in the country. The Huskies allowed the 10th-fewest yards per game in the nation with 281yards allowed. Connecticut was especially good against the pass; they allowed an average of only 165yards per game, seventh-best in the country. No UConn opponent passed for more than 259yards during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> every {{directed}} acyclic graph has a topological ordering. Therefore, {{this property}} {{can be used as}} an alternative definition of the {{directed acyclic graph}}s: they are exactly the graphs that have topological orderings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> {{poisonous}} or distasteful {{animals that}} advertise their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, skunks, salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high-contrast patterns that display their outlines.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> populations {{can expand}} rapidly {{after a series}} of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an {{increase}} of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into deciduous woodlands where they would not normally breed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conversely,</b> {{some enzymes}} display enzyme promiscuity, having broad {{specificity}} and {{acting on a}} range of different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.|$|E
5|$|Current historiography {{developed}} in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions {{for the development of}} elites. <b>Conversely,</b> the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{has a few}} {{advantages}} over DisplayPort, such as ability to carry Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) signals, and electrical compatibility with DVI (though practically limited to single-link DVI rates). Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this; DisplayPort cables, <b>conversely,</b> don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters.|$|E
5|$|If it {{advances}} much faster, {{then the}} tool becomes choked; <b>conversely,</b> if it advances much slower, then an interrupted or zig-zag cut occurs. In practice {{the rate of}} cut is slightly less than the ideal rate so that the load is released on the non-cutting edge of the tool.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} become world {{champion}} for the third time, Sebastian Vettel needed to defend a 13-point advantage over Fernando Alonso meaning the Spaniard needed at least third place even if the German failed to score. <b>Conversely,</b> a fourth place was sufficient for Vettel even if Alonso won.|$|E
5|$|In other words, {{a country}} that imports more than it exports must either {{decrease}} its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports. <b>Conversely,</b> Germany's large trade surplus (net export position) means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital, lending money to other countries {{to allow them to}} buy German goods.|$|E
5|$|John lacks {{scenes from}} the synoptics such as Jesus' baptism, the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the Last Supper. <b>Conversely,</b> it {{includes}} scenes {{not found in the}} synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The VX update from 2000 {{featured}} a revised headlamp design. The VT's rear tail lamp panel {{was replaced by}} two separate light assemblies. <b>Conversely,</b> the luxury-oriented Berlina and Calais sedans continued using a full-width boot-lid panel incorporating the registration plate and tail lamps.|$|E
5|$|The income {{generating}} {{activity in}} this case is gathering coconuts. As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food he has to eat, and <b>conversely,</b> the more time he spends gathering coconuts, the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} 0.021572 is positive, so {{one would}} say that the euro is trading at a 0.021572 or 2.16% premium against the dollar for delivery in 30 days. <b>Conversely,</b> if one were to work this example in euro terms rather than dollar terms, the perspective would be reversed and one {{would say that}} the dollar is trading at a discount against the Euro.|$|E
5|$|This careful {{treatment}} of the Haraldskær Woman's remains explains the excellent state of conservation of the corpse; <b>conversely,</b> Tollund Man, a later discovery, was not properly conserved {{and most of the}} body has been lost, leaving only the head as original remains in his display.|$|E
5|$|Torn was {{to contain}} {{four types of}} magic: Chaos, Order, Alchemy and Summoning. Order magic {{primarily}} consisted of healing, protective, and empowering spells. <b>Conversely,</b> Chaos magic was to have consisted of harmful elemental attacks, detrimental status afflictions, and invisibility spells.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{wilderness}} of the pampas to reinforce his social analysis, he characterizes {{those who were}} isolated and opposed to political dialogue as ignorant and anarchicsymbolized by Argentina's desolate physical geography. <b>Conversely,</b> Latin America was connected to barbarism, which Sarmiento used mainly to illustrate {{the way in which}} Argentina was disconnected from the numerous resources surrounding it, limiting the growth of the country.|$|E
5|$|Various {{commentators}} {{noted that}} there was a renewed sense of pride among the country's indigenous population following Morales' election. <b>Conversely,</b> the opposition accused Morales' administration of aggravating racial tensions between indigenous, white, and mestizo populations, with some non-indigenous Bolivians feeling that they were now experiencing racism.|$|E
5|$|When a Purkinje cell axon enters one of {{the deep}} nuclei, it {{branches}} {{to make contact with}} both large and small nuclear cells, but the total number of cells contacted is only about 35 (in cats). <b>Conversely,</b> a single deep nuclear cell receives input from approximately 860 Purkinje cells (again in cats).|$|E
5|$|While ReactOS has the aim {{to build}} a Windows-compatible kernel as {{open-source}} software, much of the surrounding required functionality to create a complete OS is already available in the greater open-source ecosystem. When available and possible, ReactOS therefore builds on and collaborates with already existing open-source projects. <b>Conversely,</b> projects like Wine, former Captive NTFS, and Longene re-use the open-source ReactOS code-base as well.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, <b>conversely,</b> would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. <b>Conversely,</b> if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E
