5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin lemon shark. Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and <b>certainly</b> <b>this</b> species has been known to defend itself quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, and circled for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters visual range. Young sharks are reportedly more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon sharks are the main attraction of daily shark-feeding ecotourism dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E
25|$|Darden had {{a rather}} {{idiosyncratic}} term he {{used to describe the}} underside, substratum of architecture (and <b>certainly</b> <b>this</b> applied to anything in general), which he termed the underbelly. It was a term/idea that Darden himself did not feel could be fully defined, as he expresses in Douglas Darden: Looking After the Underbelly, but generally refers to the unknown and the unknowable, the unconventional, unexpected, improper, obscene, and ultimately the inverse of custom and tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree to}} which blackface {{performance}} drew on authentic African-American culture and traditions is controversial. Blacks, including slaves, were influenced by white culture, including white musical culture. <b>Certainly</b> <b>this</b> {{was the case with}} church music from very early times. Complicating matters further, once the blackface era began, some blackface minstrel songs unquestionably written by New York-based professionals (Stephen Foster, for example) {{made their way to the}} plantations in the South and merged into the body of African-American folk music.|$|E

25|$|Further {{illustrations}} are plentiful. In East v Maurer where Maurer lied that {{he would}} not set up a barber competing with the one he was selling to East, Maurer was liable for East's normal market lost profits, costs of improvements and the price paid minus the business' selling price. In Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd Smith New Court Ltd was deceitfully told there were close rival bids for shares in a company called Ferranti IS Inc. Smith New Court Ltd bought, but then it transpired that massive fraud had occurred. The Court of Appeal held that only £1.2m was recoverable, the difference between the market price at the time of purchase and the real price, but the House of Lords held that the full losses of £11.8m were recoverable (even though the fraud was unconnected to the misrepresentation) because that loss was one which Smith New Court Ltd had due to entering the transaction after being deceived. In practice, because an action for negligent misrepresentation has now been developed through Hedley Byrne and the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), it is often not beneficial to sue for deceit. The only certain difference is that the defence of contributory negligence is unavailable in a deceit action. But deceit is harder to prove, since evidence of a person's state of mind is needed. Because the charge can sink people's reputations, alleging deceit is also contrary to professional conduct rules at the bar, unless a good case exists. A large difference which is subject to debate, is that the causation and remoteness rules are more generous for deceit. <b>Certainly</b> <b>this</b> is true when comparing negligence and deceit. However, the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), which was modelled on the law as it stood when the Act was passed, has the same causation rules as for deceit (see below).|$|E
500|$|After the incident, a {{spokesperson}} for Russian president Vladimir Putin called it a [...] "terrible tragedy", blaming it on a failing of [...] "supervisory bodies": [...] "What happened in Irkutsk was a tremendous tragedy.

[...] Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister, called for a ban on non-traditional alcoholic liquids like the bath lotion, stating that [...] "it's an outrage, {{and we need to}} put an end to this". Days later, the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Putin planned to lower taxes on alcohol in an effort to curb the use of unsafe alcohol substitutes, requiring officials to present a plan by 31 March 2017.|$|E

Three days later, it {{was reported}} that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid. Mathis' lawyer also told the press, [...] "My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. <b>Certainly</b> <b>this</b> thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult." ...|$|E

500|$|Unni R. Nair {{noted in}} his review for Kerala9.com, [...] "The care with which the script is done, the finesse with which the {{direction}} part is executed and the characterization and performance plus the thoughtful placing of the songs makes Drishyam worth real appreciation. That the film has almost zero-'filmy' humour is also worth noting. It's the logical {{manner in which the}} story unfolds and the very convincing manner in which the characters behave makes it impressive." [...] The critic rated the film three in a scale of five. IndiaGlitz's reviewer rated the film 8/10 and stated, [...] "Drishyam is undoubtedly cladded with exceptional story telling combined with bravura performances. An undoubtedly exceptional film as far the content is concerned, the movie is a must watch for all the audiences of family and thriller movies." [...] In contrast, Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Scripted more or less in a convincing manner and mounted with finesse, writer-director Joseph fleshes out his characters. However, Drishyam often seems like a radio play, long dialogues mar its cinematic qualities, and like many other helmers, Joseph too does not know where to end his film. Cinema need not be so explanatory; <b>certainly</b> <b>this</b> is not how contemporary movies are made.|$|E
500|$|The catastrophic {{loss was}} due to more than these three issues, though. Indeed, he {{violated}} his own rules of strategy and tactics because he faced an enemy he despised, and this brought out the worst of his generalship. In this way, the loss at Kunersdorf {{was similar to that}} of the Battle of Hochkirch. There, the British envoy traveling with the Prussian Army attributed Frederick's loss to the contempt in which he held the Austrians and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with his imagination; <b>certainly,</b> <b>this</b> contempt for the Austrians and the Russians contributed to his loss at Kunersdorf as well. Yet, as Herbert Redman notes, [...] "...seldom in military history has a battle been so completely lost by an organized army in such a short space of time." [...] The loss was not only due to Frederick's unwillingness to accept that the Russians, whom he despised, and the Austrians, whom he despised only slightly less, had any military acumen. At Hochkirch, Frederick demonstrated good leadership by rallying his troops against the surprise attack; Prussian discipline and the bonds of regimental cohesion had prevailed. Importantly, the Prussian army at Kunersdorf was not the same army that had fought at Hochkirch, because it had already fought, and lost, there. Over the winter, Frederick had cobbled together a new army, but it was not as well-trained, well-disciplined, and well-drilled as his old one. He failed to accept this. Arguably Frederick's worst defeat, at Kunersdorf, his army panicked and discipline disintegrated before his eyes, especially in the last hour of the battle. The few regiments that held together, such as that of Lestwitz, were the exception. Frederick had demanded more of his men than they could bear.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{consensus}} that agricultural {{technology and the}} main breeds of animals and plants which are farmed entered Europe {{from somewhere in the}} area of the Fertile Crescent and specifically the Levant region from the Sinai to Southern Anatolia (Less <b>certainly,</b> <b>this</b> agricultural revolution is sometimes argued to have in turn been partly triggered by movements of people and technology coming across the Sinai from Africa.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "borrowings" [...] from medieval commentaries may be {{explained}} in a simple manner. It is not unheard of that a note written {{on the side of}} a text should on later copying be added into the main part of the text.

(43) {{can be used to}} determine a reasonably accurate experimental value of κ, from the slope of a plot of form [...] In this case, a second plot, of ln(i)/V'κ vs. 1/V, should be an exact straight line of slope –B.

2500|$|As the {{inventor}} of curative drugs and philosophical mercuries, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that Starkey was concerned with guarding these inventions and preserving his trade secrets. The pseudonym 'Philalethes' allowed him to accomplish this by creating a fictitious identity under which a series of manuscripts and tracts were produced that proclaimed these discoveries while advertising that access to concealed alchemical knowledge might be obtained through Starkey, a 'friend' of Philalethes and guardian of his manuscripts. It is also believed that Starkey's interest in concealing his work was driven by a desire to fashion himself as the [...] "master of secrets" [...] whose discoveries were [...] "divinely sanctioned revelations." [...] <b>Certainly</b> <b>this</b> might lift Starkey's socioprofessional standing in the minds of influential patrons within the Hartlib circle.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Larry Kramer {{claimed that}} he had {{uncovered}} previously unknown documents while performing research for his work-in-progress, The American People: A History, including some allegedly found hidden in the floorboards of the old store once shared by Lincoln and Joshua Speed. The documents reportedly provide explicit details of a relationship between Lincoln and Speed, and currently reside in a private collection in Davenport, Iowa. Their authenticity, however, has been called into question by historians such as Gabor Boritt, who wrote, [...] "Almost <b>certainly</b> <b>this</b> is a hoax." [...] C. A. Tripp also expressed his skepticism over Kramer's discovery, writing, [...] "Seeing is believing, should that diary ever show up; the passages claimed for it have not the slightest Lincolnian ring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{readings}} of the play may maintain that Cassius and the other conspirators are motivated largely by envy and ambition, whereas Brutus is motivated by the demands of honour and patriotism. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>this</b> is the view that Antony expresses in the final scene. But {{one of the central}} strengths of the play is that it resists categorising its characters as either simple heroes or villains. The political journalist and classicist Garry Wills maintains that [...] "This play is distinctive because it has no villains". It is a drama famous for the difficulty of deciding which role to emphasise. The characters rotate around each other like the plates of a Calder mobile. Touch one and it affects the position of all the others. Raise one, another sinks. But they keep coming back into a precarious balance.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the end of}} the 1746–1747 season, Fleetwoods' {{patent on}} Drury Lane expired in {{partnership}} with James Lacy, Garrick took over the theatre in April 1747. The theatre had been in a decline for some years, but the partnership of Garrick and Lacy led to success and accolades. The first performance under Garrick and Lacy's management opened with an Ode to Drury Lane Theatre, on dedicating a Building and erecting a Statue, to Shakespeare read by Garrick and written by his friend, Dr. Johnson. The ode promised the patrons that [...] "The drama's law the drama's patrons give,/For we that live to please must please to live." [...] <b>Certainly</b> <b>this</b> statement could be regarded as succinctly summing up Garrick's management at Drury Lane where he was able to balance both artistic integrity and the fickle tastes of the public.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{cautious}} language, however, {{was being}} used in publications distributed only {{to members of the}} group.

What can [...] do in that time?" [...] Some Witnesses sold their possessions, postponed surgery or cashed in their insurance policies to prepare for Armageddon and in May 1974 the Watch Tower Society told members: [...] "Reports are heard of brothers selling their homes and property and planning to finish out the rest of their days in this old system in the pioneer service. <b>Certainly</b> <b>this</b> is a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world's end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing in the Libertarian Review, Jeff Riggenbach {{compared}} Dhalgren to {{the work}} of James Joyce. A quote from his review was included on the inside advertisement page of the fifteenth printing of the Bantam edition. As the critic and novelist William Gass writes of Joyce, [...] "The Homeric parallels in Ulysses are of marginal importance to the reading of the work but are of fundamental importance to the writing of it[...] [...] [...] Writers have certain ordering compulsions, certain ordering habits, which are part of the book only {{in the sense that they}} make the writing possible. This is a widespread phenomenon." [...] Almost <b>certainly</b> <b>this</b> is also the case with Dhalgren: Writing about the novel both as himself and under his pseudonym K. Leslie Steiner, Delany has made similar statements and suggested that it is easy to make too much of the mythological resonances. As he says, they are merely resonances, and not keys to any particular secrets the novel holds.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps it was Garrick's acting, {{the most}} showy of his careers, {{that brought him}} the most adulation. Garrick was not a large man, only {{standing}} 5'4", and his voice is not described as particularly loud.

[...] <b>Certainly</b> <b>this</b> new style brought acclaim: Alexander Pope stated, [...] "he was afraid the young man would be spoiled, for he would have no competitor." [...] Garrick quotes George Lyttelton as complimenting him by saying, [...] "He told me he never knew what acting was till I appeared."
