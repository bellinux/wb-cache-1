These processors {{were designed to}} compete with other <b>clock</b> <b>doubling</b> solutions such as the Intel 80486DX2, AMD Am486DX2 and Cyrix Cx486DX2, but due to ongoing legal troubles UMC withdrew the U486DX2 from production.

In his second match - his league debut - he scored nine; within a month he <b>clocked</b> <b>double</b> figures and topped the scorechart {{for the first time}} with 13; in July he took over as club captain following the departure of Bruce Cribb and hit his first Heathens maximum; and by the end of the year he had achieved a season average of over 9.00 points per match.|$|R
50|$|When the 64-bit UltraSPARC was introduced, SBus was {{modified}} to use <b>clock</b> <b>doubling</b> and transfer two 32-bit data words per cycle {{to produce a}} 200 MB/s 64-bit bus. This variant of the SBus architecture used the same 96-pin connector as the older one.|$|E
50|$|For CPU-bound applications, <b>clock</b> <b>doubling</b> will {{theoretically}} {{improve the}} overall {{performance of the}} machine substantially, provided the fetching of data from memory does not prove a bottleneck. In more modern processors where the multiplier greatly exceeds two, the bandwidth and latency of specific memory ICs (or the bus or memory controller) typically become a limiting factor.|$|E
50|$|The Intel i486DX2, rumored as 80486DX2 (later rebadged IntelDX2) is a CPU {{produced}} by Intel that {{was introduced in}} 1992. The i486DX2 was nearly identical to the i486DX, but it had additional clock multiplier circuitry. It was the first chip to use <b>clock</b> <b>doubling,</b> whereby the processor runs two internal logic clock cycles per external bus cycle. An i486 DX2 was thus significantly faster than an i486 DX at the same bus speed thanks to the 8K on-chip cache shadowing the slower clocked external bus.|$|E

50|$|The Cyrix Cx486DX2 {{design was}} used by STMicroelectronics in 1999 for their STPC SoC range. This was {{essentially}} a Cyrix Cx486, chipset, graphics and most I/O integrated into a single chip. The CPU performs identically to a Cyrix part at the same clock speed. The STPC was produced until 2008 and {{was found in a}} variety of systems, usually small embedded systems for industrial use or Single-board computer devices, such as those using the PC/104 form factor. One notable difference between the STPC and other Cx486 processors is the Host Clock which operates at 66MHz for STPC devices. As such, the 66MHz model does not use <b>clock</b> <b>doubling</b> at all, but the 133MHz version does. This differs from most competing systems, such as the AMD Elan processors based on AMD's Enhanced Am486 core as used in the Am5x86 which still relied upon a 33MHz external clock.|$|E
5000|$|Third parties {{offered a}} wide range of upgrades, for both SX and DX systems. The most popular ones were based on the Cyrix 486DLC/SLC core, which {{typically}} offered a substantial speed improvement due to its more efficient instruction pipeline and internal L1 SRAM cache. The cache was usually 1 kB, or sometimes 8 kB in the TI variant. Some of these upgrade chips (such as the 486DRx2/SRx2) were marketed by Cyrix themselves, but they were more commonly found in kits offered by upgrade specialists such as Kingston, Evergreen and Improve-It Technologies. Some of the fastest CPU upgrade modules featured the IBM SLC/DLC family (notable for its 16 kB L1 cache), or even the Intel 486 itself. Many 386 upgrade kits were advertised as being simple drop-in replacements, but often required complicated software to control the cache or <b>clock</b> <b>doubling.</b> Part of the problem was that on most 386 motherboards, the A20 line was controlled entirely by the motherboard with the CPU being unaware, which caused problems on CPUs with internal caches.|$|E

50|$|Introduced in May 1992, {{like the}} later and more famous Cyrix Cx5x86 {{it was a}} hybrid CPU, {{incorporating}} features of a new CPU (in this case the Intel 80486) while having a pin out similar to the existing 386SX, enabling existing board designs to be easily modified for the new chip. It ran at speeds of 20, 25, 33, and 40 MHz, although it had difficulty running reliably at 40 MHz using some operating systems. In December 1992 Cyrix also released the Cyrix Cx486SLC/e (25, 33 MHz) which offered power management, and a low voltage laptop version, the 3.3v Cyrix Cx486SLC/e-V (20, 25 MHz). In December 1993 Cyrix released a <b>clock</b> <b>doubled</b> version (25/50 MHz) cx486SLC2, {{as well as a}} clip-on upgrade for 386SX systems, the cx486SRx2 (16/33, 20/40 & 25/50 MHz).|$|R
