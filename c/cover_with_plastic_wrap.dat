30|$|Cool water gelatin was {{prepared}} {{similar to the}} method suggested by Jussila for the preparation of ballistic gelatin [3]. Forty-five percent of the water was at 20 °C. Fifty-five percent of the water was heated to 70 °C. The gelatin {{was added to the}} cool water and mixed by hand until achieving the consistency of mashed potatoes. This was allowed to sit for approximately 5  min. References suggest that allowing the gelatin particles to sit for a few minutes is necessary for 250  Å particles to swell [3]. Next, the warmer water was poured into the gelatin mixture, the psyllium was added and the mixture was stirred for 8  min using a paint stirrer on a handheld electric drill. After pouring into the mold, the mixture was <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> and allowed to cool at room temperature for 20  min.

40|$|SCORCHED EARTH CROCODILES Guangchen Zhang Fall 2016 Kee-ho Yuen School of Art and Art History When I went to {{the bookstore}} last summer, I found a book about metal clay jewelry. There are many {{examples}} and tutorial {{about how to make}} jewelry with metal clay which I have never seen or done before. For my honors project, I wanted to study metal clay and explore the uses of this form of metalwork in rendering a 3 D animation figure of a crocodile. However, as I began my project, my instructor felt it would work better to learn how to make a mold to create the crocodile. I choose to create a crocodile because I was inspired and influenced by the character Renekton in the video game called League of Legends. When I first came to America, I was alone and helpless. However, I made some friends and became outgoing and optimistic by playing League of Legends. Renekton is a hero and most honored warrior in his country, and he protected his country, during wartime. I was encouraged by his brave and strong, so I decided to create a crocodile to remind me and encourage me to be courageous later in life. Because I didn 2 ̆ 7 t have an actual crocodile mold for casting, I used clay to form the basic form of the crocodile. When the clay was hard, I fixed the crocodile on a 4 X 4 wooden board with hot glue gun. To make the rubber mold, I <b>cover</b> the model <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> and then 1 / 42 ̆ 2 clay. Then I <b>covered</b> the clay <b>with</b> plaster to create a plaster jacket which helped me hold the mold. After the plaster jacket had cured, I opened the jacket and removed all the clay inside of the jacket. Since the crocodile has too many undercuts and a huge tail, I had to build two parting lines to divide the jacket into three parts. After the plaster had dried, I drilled a hole {{at the top of the}} jacket and three small holes at each piece. Before I poured the rubber in the jacket, I tied the jacket with a belt and secured all gaps with clay. However, I overlooked two important facts, one, that the pressure is higher at the bottom than the top and second, my piece is too big. When I poured the rubber into the jacket, the rubber started to run out. I had to wait for all rubber run out and dry which took about one day. I cleaned the surface of the crocodile and re-poured the rubber into the jacket. I made the crocodile in a solid plastic to bear the weight of the heavy metal armour and the blade. After the figure was complete, I made the jacket with paper first. Then. I drew all the paper armour on one piece of brass, which I sawed and soldered to form the metal armour. To show his ruthlessness, I painted the armour in black and the blade point in blood red. I also painted the crocodile in green and red with oil paint. I enjoyed the process of making the crocodile, and I have learned how to make a silicone rubber mold and how to cast a plastic object. Since I have a silicon mold, I can now explore making more crocodiles in differing styles. I enjoyed this project, and in the future, I plan to look for a job that involves making molds and models for characters or objects...|$|R

40|$|El trips de las flores Frankliniella occidentalis (P.) es, sin dudas, uno de los insectos del orden Thysanoptera de mayor peligrosidad en el mundo, ya que produce importantes pérdidas económicas. Esto se debe a su periódica aparición y al daño que ocasiona, tanto por la extracción de savia como por la transmisión de enfermedades virósicas, principalmente en cultivos hortícolas y plantas ornamentales tales como rosa, gerbera y clavel. El monitoreo con trampas adhesivas de color proveen un método simple para estimar la densidad poblacional del trips con poco esfuerzo. Las mismas pueden medir poblaciones de la plaga más fácilmente que los métodos absolutos de monitoreo con uso intensivo de mano de obra, ya que continúan capturando en el tiempo mayor cantidad de trips. La efectividad del uso de trampas adhesivas de color como herramienta para monitoreo de trips ha sido evaluada en invernáculos estando condicionado al atractivo de las trampas y a las tasas de captura de trips según la especie. Al observarse un importante daño de trips, predominantemente en las flores en un cultivo de Gerbera jamesonii ubicado en un invernáculo de producción {{de flores}} de corte de la EEA INTA Concordia, provincia de Entre Ríos (Argentina), se inició el presente trabajo cuyo objetivo fue evaluar la efectividad de trampas de luz adhesivas de dos coloraciones (amarillas y azules, ambas seleccionadas por su reconocida atracción a diferentes especies de trips y con diferentes intensidades de luz (25 y 40 watts) sobre la captura de trips de las flores. La unidad muestral fue la trampa de luz, mientras que los tratamientos fueron: color de la trampa de luz (amarilla y azul), a dos intensidades distintas (25 y 40 watts), siendo por cada tratamiento un total de cuatro repeticiones. Las trampas de luz adhesivas fueron dispuestas en los canteros de Gerbera jamesonii, a razón de cuatro por cantero a los lados de los mismos, {{a la altura}} media de las flores de corte. La disposición de las trampas de cada tratamiento en la parcela {{experimental}} fue al azar. Las lámparas eran encendidas al atardecer y apagadas por la mañana, momento en que se llevaban al laboratorio con el fin de contabilizar el número de trips adultos capturados. Las trampas de luz amarillas de ambas intensidades (25 y 40 watts) resultaron ser significativamente más atractivas para la captura de adultos de F. occidentalis en comparación con las de color (azul) e igual intensidad. Por otra parte, las trampas de luz adhesivas indistintamente de su color, tanto amarillo como azul, resultaron ser significativamente más eficientes en la captura del trips F. occidentalis cuando las lámparas poseían una intensidad de 40 watts. Flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (P.) may cause severe economic losses due to its periodic occurrence, {{the damage caused by}} sucking sap and spreading plant diseases through the transmission of viruses, mainly in horticultural crops and ornamental plants, such as roses, gerbera and carnation. Monitoring through sticky colored traps provides a simple method of obtaining estimates of thrips population densities. These traps may measure a far more rapid estimate of pest population than labor-intensive absolute methods of counting individuals, as these traps continuously catch a higher number of thrips throughout the time. The utility of these sticky colored traps methods as tools for monitoring thrips population has been assessed in greenhouses, taking into consideration the traps attractiveness and the capture rate according to species. This work was conducted once a serious damage on flowers (Frankliniella occidentalis) caused by thrips was observed, mainly in a Gerbera jamesonii crop located in a greenhouse for cut flowers production in the Argentine Agricultural Experiment Station (EEA) of the National Institute for Agricultural Technology (INTA) of Concordia, Province of Entre Rios (Argentina). The main purpose of this work was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} sticky light traps of two colors (yellow and blue, both of them selected due to its known attractiveness to various thrips species and different light intensities (25 and 40 watt bulb)) on the capture of flower thrips. These traps were made from cardboard boxes (22 x 30 x 20 cm) with an opening (10 x 15 cm) through which light passes and <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> coated <b>with</b> adhesive material on which the adults thrips become trapped (The Tanglefoot Company Adhesive Pest Management & Tree Protection Products, USA). The trial consisted of the following four treatments: (i) yellow light trap with 25 watt bulb; (ii) yellow light trap with 40 watt bulb; (iii) blue light trap with 25 watt bulb and (iv) blue light trap with 40 watts bulb. Each treatment was replicated four times. Four sticky light traps were positioned on both sides of the Gerbera jamesonii flowerbeds to half-height of cut flowers. For each trial, the trap placement in each experimental design was at random. The bulbs were turned on at sunset and turned off in the morning when the traps were removed and carried to the laboratory and the number of adult thrips caught was counted. On the one hand, yellow light traps with both intensities (25 and 40 watt bulbs) became significantly more attractive to F. occidentalis adults in comparison to the capture rate on the blue ones with the same intensity; and, on the other hand, both yellow and blue sticky light traps were much more efficient for the capture of thrips F. occidentalis with 40 watt intensity bulbs. One reason why thrips would respond to various visual stimuli (a more effective response to w color and its high intensity) would be related to its response to the different changes of physiological features of plants. These changes would play a significant important role in sending a visual signal (color and intensity), which would lead Frankliniella occidentalis (P.) to change the search behavior as to its feeding sources and oviposition...|$|R

Be sure to keep column running without stop. 6. Subsequent analysis of eluant fractions can be performed following acetone precipitation of individual fractions, or spin concentration of all eluant fractions combined. For acetone precipitation (in 1. 5 ml screw top tubes, add 300 µl of each fraction to 300 µl of - 20 °C 100 % acetone, mix and store overnight at - 20 °C. Spin for 15 min at 4 °C, pull/discard supernatant and add 1 ml/tube of 50 % acetone (precooled to - 20 °C), mix and spin for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove/discard supernatant. Use yellow tip to remove all remaining supernatant and let pellet dry for 1 hr at RT. Make pellet up in 40 µl of SDS (5 %) gel sample buffer, boil for 5 min at 90 °C, place 1 min on ice, spin for 1 min (RT), transfer to a fresh tube and load 15 µl/well on a 8 % or 5 - 15 % SDS PAGE gel (See ‘Pouring and Running Protein Gels/Electrotransfer’). Run at 25 mAmp/gel. For spin concentration, add part of eluant to a Centricon- 100 (preblocked by incubation in 1 % BSA in PBS for 1 hr at 4 °C; at end of block, spin for 15 min at 2500 rpm in SA 600 rotor with rubber inserts [4 °C]; then do a PBS wash). Spin for 30 min to 1 hr, discard flow through and more eluant and spin. Repeat until all has been concentrated to minimum volume. Add 1 / 6 volume SDS (2 - 5 %) gel sample buffer, boil for 5 min at 90 °C, place 2 min on ice, spin for 1 min (RT), and load all in one or two wide wells on a 8 % or 5 - 15 % SDS PAGE gel. Run at 25 mAmp/gel. 7. For biotinylated prep, electrotransfer from gel to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham#RPN 2020 D), as follows. Have blotting buffer prepared (can be reused a number of times; record each time used by marking label). Cut nitrocellulose to same size (or slightly larger) as gel. Have two pieces of Whatmann 2 MM paper cut to same size as gel. Have plastic tray containing transfer buffer and immersed in it in the following order: plastic cage (‘+’ side down), sponge (push out air bubbles), one piece of Whatmann paper and nitrocellulose filter. Turn off power to gel. Place gel plates on bench. Gently remove glass side. Notch bottom left corner. Discard stacking gel. Carefully invert gel onto nitrocellulose and use a spatula or gel spacer to encourage gel to separate from plate onto filter. Add onto gel in order: other Whatmann piece, sponge (remove bubbles), and other half of cage. Insert caged gel into blotting buffer and transfer (- from gel to + on filter) overnight at 60 mAmp (RT). For spin concentrated prep, remove gel and fix/stain in 0. 08 % Commassie blue in 25 % isopropanol/ 10 % methanol for 30 min (up to 2 hr). Destain in 10 % acetic acid/ 10 % isopropanol. Photograph. Band(s) corresponding to receptor is carefully cut out with a clean scapel blade, placed in an ependorf tube and stored at - 20 °C until ready for sequencing. 8. Stop transfer, remove cage into transfer buffer. Use black marker to outline orientation of gel on filter, and remove filter. Immerse filter in 50 ml of 37 °C PBS-T (PBS containing 0. 1 % Tween- 20; need 500 ml total per blot experiment) containing 2. 5 % milk for 1 hr at 37 °C. Wash 1 x (50 ml) with PBS-T for 15 min, then 2 x (50 ml each) with PBS-T for 5 min each. Incubate in 50 ml of streptavidin-HRP (Amersham#RPN 1231; dilute 1 / 1000 in PBS-T) for 1 hr at RT on rotator. Wash 1 x 15 min and 4 x 5 min with PBS-T.
