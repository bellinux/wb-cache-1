At around 22:30, up to 100 protesters led by Joshua Wong, the Convenor of Scholarism, went to [...] "reclaim" [...] Civic Square, a customarily open but recently <b>closed</b> public <b>access</b> <b>area,</b> by clambering over the perimeter fence. The police mobilised on Civic Square, surrounded protesters at the centre and prepared to remove them overnight. Protesters who chose to depart were allowed to do so; the rest were picked off and carried away one by one by groups of four or more police officers.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{strategic}} location as {{a gateway to}} Hong Kong and in the CBD of Shenzhen, the Luohu District has flourished with many top-grade office buildings. Nevertheless, the Lo Wu area in Hong Kong is remote from the city centre, and far from urban development. As it is lying within the <b>Closed</b> <b>Area,</b> <b>access</b> is restricted, development is impossible and the area has largely remained rural. Relatively cheaper prices of durable goods, gourmet dining and entertainment in the Shenzhen side has hit the retail industry of Hong Kong, particularly in Sheung Shui and Fanling in the North District.|$|R
500|$|The {{stadium is}} 2.5km east of Manchester city centre. Manchester Piccadilly railway station, which serves {{mainline}} trains. It is a twenty-minute walk away along a well-lit signposted route that is supervised by stewards {{close to the}} ground. [...] Piccadilly station also has a Metrolink tram stop (in the undercroft); from which regular trams along the East Manchester Line to Ashton-under-Lyne serve the stadium and Etihad Campus, with enhanced service frequencies and doubled tram units on matchdays. The Etihad Campus tram stop close to Joe Mercer Way to the immediate north of the stadium opened in February 2013, and handles several thousand travellers each matchday; spectators travelling by tram from Manchester city centre being able to board services at Piccadilly Gardens, the journey taking approximately 10 minutes. The Velopark tram stop also opened in February 2013 and provides access to the southeastern approach to the stadium, as well as <b>closer</b> <b>access</b> to other <b>areas</b> of SportCity such as the Manchester Velodrome and the City Football Academy.|$|R
30|$|First, we {{see that}} unlike the uplink[17], the {{preferred}} access schemes for home and cellular users are incompatible, with home user preferring <b>closed</b> <b>access.</b> For femtocells with coverage area extending outside the home, i.e., far from the MBS, <b>closed</b> <b>access</b> provides higher sum throughput for home user and lower sum throughput for neighboring cellular users, when compared to open access. For example, in a cell edge femtocell, open access causes at least 20 % throughput loss to home user compared to <b>closed</b> <b>access,</b> while the neighboring cellular user experiences outage for typical data service (less than 15 kbps for 5 MHz bandwidth) in <b>closed</b> <b>access.</b> Furthermore, we observe that the open access femtocells far from MBS reduce the macrocell load, thereby open <b>access</b> rather than <b>closed</b> <b>access</b> offers higher throughput for a few home users (in its femtocell coverage area smaller than home area) located near and connected to the MBS. Nevertheless, most home users in cell site accessing FAPs are still reluctant to use their femtocells in open access.|$|R

Access to the regulated <b>access</b> <b>area</b> is possible during a limited time of the year (1 June to 31 October), provided visitors are accompanied by a guide with the proper credentials. There is also an observation tower accessible without a guide located in the part of the nature reserve located in Krustpils Municipality.|$|R

30|$|Besides the {{activity}} probability of BS, access policy also impacts MUE coverage probability. In addition, the different modes (active/sleep) of MBS would lead different results when femtocell operates in <b>closed</b> <b>access</b> mode. In the following, under {{the condition of}} <b>closed</b> <b>access</b> and open access, we assume {{that there is a}} centralized control in MBS and investigate users’ coverage probability respectively in random sleeping strategy.|$|R
30|$|Generally speaking, small cells such as femtocells, {{which provide}} {{improved}} radio coverage and throughput by wireless access, operate in three access modes: open <b>access,</b> <b>closed</b> <b>access,</b> and hybrid access. When femtocells work in <b>closed</b> <b>access</b> mode, only registered femtocell user equipments (FUEs) can {{connect to the}} femtocell access point (FAP). In open access mode, all kinds of users {{will be allowed to}} connect to the FAP. In hybrid access mode, registered users and non-registered macro users that satisfy certain constraints can connect to the FAP. Although there already have some researches on femtocells with partially open channels [2], for simplicity, we consider completely <b>closed</b> <b>access</b> mode and completely open access mode in this paper.|$|R

The thesis describes positives and negatives that appeared during the collection establishment. Furthermore it describes experience after one year of operation in the new building. As an output of this successful collection establishment in NTL, two questionnaires were compiled - one for employees and one for customers.
