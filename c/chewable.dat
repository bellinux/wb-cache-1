40|$|AbstractObjectiveGutkha and pan masala {{addiction}} among humans {{of different}} occupations is very common. The {{increase in the}} occurrence of oral cancer has raised a serious concern regarding {{the nature of these}} <b>chewables.</b> Study designIn the present study, the effect of pan masala and gutkha was studied on micronucleus frequency and comet tail length in the buccal epithelial cells taking into consideration the duration of keeping the <b>chewables</b> (gutkha and pan masala) in mouth, duration of addiction, and the number of pouches of the <b>chewables</b> (gutkha and pan masala) consumed per day. ResultsThe {{results of the present study}} reveal that the micronucleus frequency and comet tail length in buccal epithelial cells are higher in gutkha users as compared to pan masala users and also to controls. ConclusionThe micronucleus frequency and comet tail length also depend on the duration of <b>chewables</b> kept in mouth, duration of addiction and the number of pouches consumed per day...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, chromium(III) picolinate was {{approved}} by Health Canada {{to be used in}} dietary supplements. The monograph includes use in capsules, <b>chewables</b> (e.g. gummies, tablets), liquids, powders, strips or tablets. Approved labeling statements include: a factor in the maintenance of good health, provides support for healthy glucose metabolism, helps the body to metabolize carbohydrates and helps the body to metabolize fats.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Eclipse Mints, another Wrigley product, were rebranded as Altoids Arctic, {{with the}} tin {{remaining}} identical save for labeling. The rebranded mints were released in only Peppermint, Wintergreen, and Strawberry, {{doing away with}} the wider varieties of Eclipse such as Cinnamon, Winterfrost and several other flavors, {{as well as the}} <b>chewables.</b> As before, each tin contains 1.2 oz (34g), or about 50 mints.|$|R
25|$|Montelukast, a {{medicine}} {{used for the}} treatment of allergies and asthma, was added to the free medication program in February 2017. 90-day supplies of 4- or 5-mg <b>chewable</b> tablets for children, or 10-mg oral tablets for adults, are available with a doctor's prescription.|$|E
25|$|Unlike aspartame, {{acesulfame}} potassium is stable under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, {{allowing it to}} be used as a food additive in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially <b>chewable</b> and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultural}} tradition of chewing gum {{seems to have}} developed through a convergent evolution process, as traces of this habit have arisen separately {{in many of the}} early civilizations. Each of the early precursors to chewing gum were derived from natural growths local to the region and were chewed purely out the instinctual desire to masticate. Early chewers did not necessarily desire to derive nutritional benefits from their <b>chewable</b> substances, but at times sought taste stimuli and teeth cleaning or breath-freshening capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|Some nutrients, such as {{calcium and}} magnesium, are rarely {{included}} at 100% of the recommended allowance because the pill would become too large. Most multivitamins come in capsule form; tablets, powders, <b>chewables,</b> liquids, and injectable formulations also exist. In the U.S., the FDA requires any product marketed as a [...] "multivitamin" [...] to contain {{at least three}} vitamins and minerals; furthermore, the dosages must be below a [...] "tolerable upper limit", and a multivitamin may not include herbs, hormones, or drugs.|$|R
50|$|Many {{women have}} {{difficulty}} tolerating prenatal vitamins or experience constipation {{as a result}} of the high iron content. Due to tolerance challenges, the prenatal vitamin industry has developed a multitude of dosage forms to meet the needs and tolerances of expecting mothers. The most common form of prenatal vitamin is the compressed tablet which is available through all channels and at various quality levels. Category leaders utilize this as the dosage form of choice. Other organizations within the category offer products in a variety of dosage forms such as liquids, prenatal vitamin soft chews, vitamin <b>chewables,</b> and even jellied prenatal vitamins.|$|R
50|$|Alternate {{recordings}} {{based on}} the Crew Cuts' recording were heard in the TV series Happy Days (1974-84) and in the film Clue (1985). The original Crew Cuts' recording was featured in The Super (1991), Liberty Heights (1999), The Sum of Us (1994), Cry-Baby featuring Johnny Depp (1990), Two of Us (2000), Road House (1989), and the mini-series Lipstick on Your Collar (1993). It was briefly featured in the HBO mini-series From the Earth To The Moon (1998) and the movie Hearts in Atlantis (2001). The Trevor Horn Orchestra covered the song for the Mona Lisa Smile (2003) soundtrack. Pixar's Cars used a long recording of the song (2006), and Disney California Adventure prominently incorporated it into the nightly neon lighting ceremony in the new Cars Land. It is heard in the 2011 film Dolphin Tale. The song is briefly featured in a Nexgard <b>Chewables</b> for Dogs commercial.|$|R
25|$|Caustic {{chemicals}} {{may cause}} ulceration {{of the oral}} mucosa if they are of strong-enough concentration and in contact for a sufficient length of time. The holding of medication in the mouth instead of swallowing it occurs mostly in children, those under psychiatric care, or simply {{because of a lack}} of understanding. Holding an aspirin tablet next to a painful tooth in an attempt to relieve pulpitis (toothache) is common, and leads to epithelial necrosis. <b>Chewable</b> aspirin tablets should be swallowed, with the residue quickly cleared from the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the trade}} names Equal, NutraSweet, and Canderel, {{aspartame}} is an ingredient in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, <b>chewable</b> vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, instant coffees, topping mixes, wine coolers and yogurt. It is provided as a table condiment in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for baking than other sweeteners, because it breaks down when heated and loses {{much of its}} sweetness.|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} of the GBP bypass the duodenum, which is the primary site of absorption of both iron and calcium. Iron replacement is essential in menstruating females, and supplementation of iron and calcium is preferable in all patients. Ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated. Alternative forms of iron (fumarate, gluconate, chelates) are less irritating and probably better absorbed. Calcium carbonate preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or gluconate (with 1200mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed. <b>Chewable</b> calcium supplements that include vitamin K are sometimes recommended by doctors as {{a good way to}} get calcium.|$|E
5000|$|Christopher Powell (stage name Pow Pow) is {{a musical}} artist from Philadelphia. He {{has been the}} drummer and percussionist for {{experimental}} rock group Need New Body, the equally adventurous music group Man Man, and the Chicago sextet Icy Demons. After Need New Body disbanded, Powell joined Man Man before recording the group's second album, [...] "Six Demon Bag." [...] He has played on all albums since {{as well as at}} all live shows, making him the second most consistent and oldest member (lead singer Ryan Kattner, a.k.a. Honus Honus, being the first). Christopher participated as drummer 11 in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance which occurred on 7 July 2007 at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York. He participates in, what according to Obey Your Brain's website is his solo project, Endless Joy. He also participates in the band The <b>Chewables.</b> He co-presented with Brian Dwyer the 2010 exhibit, [...] "Give Pizza Chance" [...] {{which was one of the}} bases for museum and pizzeria, Pizza Brain. He also owns and operates the record label Obey Your Brain.|$|R
25|$|Mannitol {{increases}} {{blood glucose}} {{to a lesser}} extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for <b>chewable</b> tablets.|$|E

2500|$|Prevention of {{heartworm}} infection can {{be obtained}} {{through a number of}} veterinary drugs. The drugs approved for use in the US are ivermectin (sold under the brand names Heartgard, Iverhart, and several other generic versions), milbemycin (Interceptor Flavor Tabs and Sentinel Flavor Tabs) and moxidectin (ProHeart) administered as pills or <b>chewable</b> tablets. Moxidectin is also available in both a six-month and 12-month, sustained-release injection, ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, administered by veterinarians. [...] The injectable form of moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns in 2004, but the FDA returned a newly formulated ProHeart 6 to the market in 2008. ProHeart 6 remains on the market in many other countries, including Canada and Japan. Its sister product, ProHeart 12, is used extensively in Australia and Asia as a 12-month injectable preventive. [...] Topical treatments are available, as well.
