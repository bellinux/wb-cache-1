5|$|Although Godwin {{was fond}} of his children, he was, in many ways, ill-equipped to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> As Todd explains, he was {{constantly}} annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked. However, {{when he took a}} trip to Dublin to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of people with chronic pain notice memory and attention difficulties. Objective psychological testing has found problems with memory, attention, verbal ability, mental flexibility and thinking speed. Pain is also associated with increased depression, anxiety, fear, and anger. Persistent pain reduces function and overall quality of life, and is demoralizing and debilitating for the person experiencing pain {{and for those who}} <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) are {{designated}} by local authorities under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The local authority {{must have a}} legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having {{an agreement with the}} owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically, and local authorities have a duty to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> They can apply local bye-laws to manage and protect LNRs.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and {{easy for the}} player to care about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed {{that there was little}} reason to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> until their backstories were revealed.|$|E
5|$|Zaimeche further {{observed}} that Islamic agricultural practice was documented by the mediaeval agronomists Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl (11th century) of Toledo {{in his book}} Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> including leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. Abū l-Khayr described in minute detail how olive trees should be grown, grafted, treated for disease, and harvested, and gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were {{celebrated in}} early medieval England, but the April date {{appeared}} {{first in the}} liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened {{at the spot where}} the water used to wash his body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the natural world {{extended}} to a detailed examination of plants. The work done was directly useful in the unprecedented growth of pharmacology across the Islamic world. Al-Dinawari popularised botany in the Islamic world with his six-volume Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants). Only volumes 3 and 5 have survived, with part of volume 6 reconstructed from quoted passages. In what survives, 637 plants are described in alphabetical order from the letters sin to ya, so the whole book must have covered several thousand kinds of plants. Al-Dinawari described the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit. Zakariya al-Qazwini's thirteenth century encyclopedia ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt (The Wonders of Creation) contained, among many other topics, both realistic botany and fantastic accounts. For example, he described trees which grew birds on their twigs in place of leaves, but which could only be found in the far-distant British Isles. The use and cultivation of plants was documented in the 11th century by Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl of Toledo in his book Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his 12th century book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> It covered leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees.

25|$|Of the Australian oncomerines, {{the bronze}} orange bug (Musgraveia sulciventris) {{is the only}} species {{unequivocally}} documented to lack maternal brooding behavior. This peculiarity might {{be connected to the}} unreliability of the food plant availability for the species (Monteith, 2011). Unlike other oncomerines who can only lay one egg clutch for the certain amount of time it takes to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> M. sulciventris can produce multiple egg clutches rapidly because females don't have to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> This allows M. sulciventris to rapidly expand their population when conditions are favorable.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the reasons}} {{children}} were placed in care related to poverty and family breakdown. Until social change came about in Australia in the 1970s, {{there was almost no}} community or government support for families in crisis or financial need so most children whose families could not <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> were placed in some form of out-of-home care.|$|E
25|$|In {{rural areas}} {{continued}} decline in childhood death means {{that at some}} point parents realize they need not require so many children to be born to ensure a comfortable old age. As childhood death continues to fall and incomes increase parents can become increasingly confident that fewer children will suffice to help in family business and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> in old age.|$|E
