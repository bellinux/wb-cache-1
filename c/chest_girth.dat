40|$|To date, {{there is}} very little {{information}} about the effects of ageing and sport selection on the characteristics of former athletes. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse anthropometric and physiological characteristics of 146 former elite volleyball players in Italy. The possible effect of an active or inactive lifestyle on ageing was assessed by comparing the biological profiles of subsamples of former athletes with and without regular sport activity. All the former athletes underwent measurements of standard anthropometry (height, sitting height and body mass; skinfold thicknesses; bi-acromial and bi-cristal breadths; upper limb length; upper arm, calf and <b>chest</b> <b>girths),</b> cardio-respiratory function (vital capacity, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s; systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate), muscle strength (handgrip strength), and cognitive function (visual and auditory simple reaction times; Digit-Symbol subtest). Body composition parameters were estimated from anthropometric measurements. Data on lifestyle were collected by questionnaires. The results show that the former players differ from current players in several anthropometric and physiological traits. Selection pressure seems to be more responsible for these differences than ageing. This study underlines the particular performance of former players in cognitive functions. Moreover, it confirms that an active lifestyle has beneficial effects on the biological age profiles of former athletes...|$|R
40|$|Objective The growth, carcass {{and retail}} cut yield records on 1, 428 Hanwoo steers {{obtained}} through progeny testing were analyzed in this study, and their heritability and genetic {{relationships among the}} traits were estimated using animal models. Methods Two different models were compared in this study. Each model was fitted for different fixed class effects, date of slaughter for carcass traits and batch of progeny test live measurement traits, and a choice of covariates (carcass weight in Model 1 or backfat thickness in Model 2) for carcass traits. Results The differences in body composition among individuals were deemed being unaffected by their age at slaughter, except for carcass weight and backfat thickness. Heritability estimates of body size measurements were 0. 21 to 0. 36. Heritability estimates of retail cut percentage were high (0. 56 from Model 1 and 0. 47 from Model 2). And the heritability estimates for loin muscle percentage were 0. 36 from Model 1 and 0. 42 from Model 2, which were high enough to consider direct selection on carcass cutability traits as effective. The genetic correlations between body size measurements and retail cut ratio (RCR) were close to zero. But, some negative genetic correlations were found with <b>chest</b> <b>girths</b> measured at yearling (Model 1) or at 24 months of age or with chest widths. Loin muscle ratio (LMR) was genetically negatively correlated with body weights or body size measurements, in general in Model 1. These relationships were low close to zero but positive in Model 2. Phenotypic correlation between cutability traits (RCR, LMR) and live body size measurements were moderate and negative in Model 1 while those in Model 2 were all close to zero. Conclusion Therefore, the body weights or linear body measurements {{at an earlier age}} {{may not be the most}} desirable selection traits for exploitation of correlated responses to improve loin muscle or lean meat yield...|$|R

Twelve male (71. 6 ± 2. 2 kg mean liveweight and standard error of the mean; LW) and six female (80. 3 ± 2. 8 kg LW) weaned Bali cattle, ∼ 6 months of age at the commencement were used in this experiment. LW, wither height (WH), hip height and <b>chest</b> circumference (<b>girth)</b> were measured from ∼ 6 to 27 months of age. Dry matter intake and the concentration of glucose, urea and insulin-like growth factor- 1 in the plasma were measured at ∼ 9, 18 and 27 months of age. There was no difference in LW gain of male and female Bali cattle between 6 and 18 months of age but males had a greater average LW gain (0. 40 kg/day) than females (0. 22 kg/day) between 18 and 27 months of age. Overall females displayed a curvilinear growth path in LW, WH and girth between 6 and 27 months of age, while males displayed a linear growth path in LW and girth but curvilinear in WH over the same age. Dry matter intake did not differ with stage of development or between male and female cattle. The plasma urea concentration declined in male Bali cattle with stage of development but was constant in female cattle across the experiment. The concentration of insulin-like growth factor- 1 in the plasma increased with age and tended to be greater in male (268 ng/mL) than female (222 ng/mL) Bali cattle. In conclusion, Bali cattle display sexual dimorphism in growth after ∼ 18 months of age, which is important to consider when developing feeding strategies across the full growth path...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project consisted of five experiments. The main {{objective of this}} study was to determine the effects of restricted feeding and season on growth, carcass characteristics, meat chemical composition, reproduction and egg laying performance of Koekoek chickens. Feed restriction lowered the body weight, weight gain, feed intake and improved the feed conversion efficiency during the rearing phase. During the laying phase, chickens that were in the RA treatment had higher body weights, weight gains and lower FCR. Chickens that were reared in summer had a higher body weight, weight gain and FCR, while total feed intake and mortality rates were high in winter. Feed restriction reduced the slaughter weight, defeathered weight, dressed weight, skin weight, breast muscle weight, shank width, chest width and heart girth during the rearing phase. The intestine, liver and abdominal fat pad weights were higher in chickens that were fed ad libitum. Chickens that were reared in summer had higher shank width, slaughter weight, defeathered weight, <b>chest</b> width, heart <b>girth,</b> breast muscle weight, skin weight, abdominal fat pad weight, intestine weight, liver weight and the relative skin percentage at the age of 18 weeks. During the laying phase, abdominal fat pad weight, abdominal fat pad percentage, intestine percentage, liver weight, gizzard weight and gizzard percentage were higher in the ad libitum fed chickens. Unrestricted feeding during the rearing phase increased the development of combs, wattles, pubic bones, ovaries and oviducts more than restricted feeding while at the age of 32 weeks, enhanced growth of the reproductive organs was seen in chickens that were fed ad libitum only during the laying phase (RA). The cold winter conditions hindered the growth of the combs, wattles, pubic bones, oviducts and ovaries. Restricted feeding during the laying phase reduced the laying percentage, egg weights and improved the hatching percentage. Ad libitum feeding during the rearing phase resulted in the attainment of puberty at an earlier age in chickens. Chickens that were produced in summer reached puberty first as well as 20 %, 50 % and 80 % egg production, and had a higher average laying percentage and egg weights.

Animal live weight was predicted by simple regression models using dependent variable (Y) of the animal live weight and independent variable (X) of the animal body measurement, either body length, <b>chest</b> <b>girth,</b> or body volume. The correlations between all pairs of measurements were highly significant (P < 0. 01) for all age groups. Regression analysis showed that live weight could be predicted accurately from body volume (R 2 = 0. 92) and <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> (R 2 = 0. 90). Simple regression model that can be recommended to predict horse live weight based on body volume with their age groups ranging from 3 to ≥ 10 years old was as follow: Live weight (kg) = 5. 044 + 1. 87088 body volume (liters). The analyses of data on horse <b>chest</b> <b>girth,</b> body length and body volume formula provided quantitative measure of body size and shape that were desirable, as they enable genetic parameters for these traits to be estimated and also included in breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|Body {{measurements}} {{have been}} used to predict live weights of cattle, an important variable in determining market value of an animal. Animals of varying ages from White Fulani (Bunaji), Sokoto Gudali and the N'Dama breeds of cattle were evaluated to determine the relationships between weights and body measurements. <b>Chest</b> <b>girth</b> accounted for 86 to 96 percent of the variation in body weight in the three breeds. The linear regression coefficient of weight of <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> in the N'Dama differed significantly from the other two breeds. Within each breed, the regression coefficient of young animals was lower than those of older groups. The variables that contributed most to improving the prediction of weights when added to <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> were rump length and body length. Live weight estimates of indigenous breeds of cattle in Nigeria can be made with the same precision as with the European breeds of cattle using <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> measurements. Such estimates should consider not only the breed type but also age and condition in order to improve the accuracy of the estimate...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} relationship between body weight and body measurement of Peranakan Etawah (PE) goat male at different age in Klaten Regency. The research was conducted in District Karangnongko and Kemalang. The research used 98 male goats aged 0 - 60 months and the data were analyzed using correlation and regression. The study found a very positive relationship between the <b>chest</b> <b>girth,</b> the body length, shoulders height, chest depth and body weight on goats aged 0 - 6 months until 12 - 24 months of age. Another findings were goats with 24 - 36 months of age had a very positive relationship between <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> and the body length with body weight, while shoulders height and chest depth had a positive correlation with body weight. A very positive relationship was also found on the <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> with body weight of goats with age of 36 - 60 months, while other body measurements had a very low positive relationship. The study concluded that <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> had a close correlation with body weight of the PE goat...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in order to study changes in body measurements in the Chiapas sheep breed. For this purpose 66 males and 79 females of various ages were measured: body weight, <b>chest</b> <b>girth,</b> knee perimeter, cannon perimeter, coronne perimeter, hock perimeter and ear length. The study reflects a regional change according to age, which are not isometrical. Body weight and <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> are the most discriminative variables, which presented identical age regression trajectories for both sexes (F= 1. 006, p= 0. 317). Although body weight in adult male (> 12 months, n= 56) was greater than those of females (n= 64) (U= 1320, p= 0. 014), and no differences appeared for <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> (U= 1720, p= 0. 704), regression trajectories for both traits appeared similar...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the accuracy of prediction of body weight from body measurements in beef cattle. Wither height, <b>chest</b> <b>girth,</b> body length, chest depth, hip width and hip height measurements were obtained from Holstein, Brown Swiss and crossbred (n = 140). Determination coefficients (R 2) of regression equation that included all body measurements were higher in Brown Swiss and crossbred than Holstein (92. 2, 95. 0 and 68. 2 %, respectively). However, it was found that <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> was the best parameter of all for prediction of body weight in Brown Swiss (R 2 = 91. 1 %) and crossbred cattle (R 2 = 88. 8 %) in comparison to Holstein (R 2 = 60. 7 %). According to these results, the body weight estimation of Brown Swiss and crossbred cattle using the body measurements produced higher prediction accuracies than Holstein but <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> was the best parameter to prediction of body weight among all body measurements. However, the prediction accuracy of prediction of body weight from body measurements and also <b>chest</b> <b>girth</b> was decreased when the animals frame size was increased...|$|E
