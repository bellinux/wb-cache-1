40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading causes <b>of</b> {{involuntary}} culling {{of breeding}} stock in swine is lameness. Many of these sows are lame due to lesions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> wall. Although an important function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porcine <b>hoof</b> capsule {{is to protect}} the terminal limb structures, little is known about its anatomy. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study was to create a basic reference for normal porcine hoof measurements as well as quantify <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> epidermal laminae. For <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> wall measurements, forty forelimbs and forty hind limbs were obtained from clinically sound sows and sixty-nine forelimbs and seventy-four hind limbs were obtained for <b>the</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. For <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> wall, measurements were made investigating the dorsal wall length, abaxial wall height, sole width, sole + wall length, ground surface, dorsal wall depth, abaxial wall depth and the sole depth at the cranial, caudal, axial and abaxial aspects. <b>The</b> second group <b>of</b> limbs were sliced for visualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laminar junction. The laminae were stained and divided into zones of 25 laminae each. Significant differences were present between the dorsal wall depth and the abaxial wall depth of various digits, but the sole depth at all four measurements (cranial, caudal, axial, abaxial) was significantly thicker than the abaxial wall depth on all eight measured digits (p 3 Ì†c 0. 0001). The laminae also showed significant decreases in zone width as they moved from <b>the</b> palmar/plantar aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> to <b>the</b> dorsal aspect with zones A and B being significantly smaller than all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other zones on both the thoracic and pelvic limb (p 3 Ì†c 0. 0001).

The abaxial wall wall depth is significantly less than <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> at <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sole, or in many digits, the dorsal wall as well. The abaxial wall region also holds the least dense zones of epidermal laminae, with the density increasing at the more dorsal aspect.

40|$|In {{a yearlong}} field trial <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> season, housing conditions, {{nutrition}} and domestication on <b>the</b> horn quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equine <b>hoof</b> were studied. <b>The</b> trial included twenty horses {{of two different}} housing systems with clinically asserted good and poor <b>hoof</b> horn quality. <b>The</b> sampling <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> clippings and measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> shape took place at regular intervals {{in line with the}} farriery. Furthermore, blood samples, hoof photos and samples of feedstuff were taken on three occasions. Laboratory analysis included physical material examination (water content and horn hardness), light- and scanning electron microscopy, analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fatty acid content of hoof horn and feedstuff via gas chromatography as well as determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mineral and trace element status in the blood. In addition, a scoring for an objective assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> horn quality was designed. Also <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> horn production and changes in body weight were determined. Thus, <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methods employed in the study allowed to judge <b>the</b> interactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various factors affecting the horn quality. During the investigation period minor variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> shape were detected. In comparison with the Przewalski horse (SCHNITKER, 2004) these changes could not be associated with a certain season as they were a result of farriery. Compared to the Przewalski horses <b>the</b> <b>hooves</b> displayed an obtused angle. As described for the Przewalski horse (SCHNITKER, 2004) <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> horn production was clearly reduced in winter in both stables. Seasonal changes in <b>the</b> water content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> horn and horn hardness were also asserted and these were related to the housing system. In open stable housing the horses possessed the highest horn hardness in summer whereas the least hardness was measured in winter. On the other hand the water content was highest in wintertime. In contrast such seasonal changes could not be observed in indoor housing. Concerning <b>the</b> architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> horn no seasonal changes were seen by means of light- and scanning electron microscopy. <b>The</b> architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tubular as well as the lamellar horn was constant within the entire investigation period. An increased incidence of macroscopic and microscopic cracks in <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> horn was detected in summer. Those cracks appeared frequently in association with a low humidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment and brittle horn. Break-outs at the weight-bearing margin appeared more often in summer than in winter. Physiological horn rings were observed all year round, primarily in <b>the</b> <b>hooves</b> <b>of</b> horses and ponies in open stable housing. These horn rings were more dinstictive in summertime. Using gas chromatography slight seasonal changes in the fatty acid composition in hoof horn and feedstuff were detected. In feedstuff predominantly unsaturated fatty acids were found, whereas in <b>hoof</b> horn near <b>the</b> weight-bearing margin saturated fatty acids dominated. <b>The</b> total concentration <b>of</b> fatty acids in feedstuff and hoof horn declined simultaneously, but a difference in the fatty acid composition between good and inferior horn quality was not asserted. Several aspects <b>of</b> ageing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronary horn near the weight-bearing margin were observed. This appeared in an increased formation of cracks, a frequent lack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tubular medulla and supposably a reduced concentration of fatty acids in <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> horn. All blood parameters flucutated in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> one year. Distinct differences between the two housing conditions did not exist. Furthermore most horses showed a zinc, copper and selenium deficiency but this deficiency was not associated with inferior horn quality. However, there was a negativ correlation between changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serum selenium concentration and serum zinc concentration respectively and changes in hoof horn hardness over <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> one year. Also <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse`s age, gender and breed as well as <b>the</b> pigmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> horn on its quality was assessed. However, these factors were only an underpart and individual fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> horn quality were more distinct. In conclusion <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> horn quality <b>of</b> domesticated horses is subject to a multitude of seasonal changes. These show a number <b>of</b> similarities to <b>the</b> wild living Przewalski horse but lessened in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> domestication. Also considerable differences concerning the horn quality among the two housing systems were detectet. Thus, <b>the</b> equine <b>hoof</b> clearly reflects <b>the</b> versatile factors <b>of</b> influence...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTLaminitis in horses {{is often}} {{associated}} with endocrine disorders, especially the pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) in older animals. Morphologic exams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laminar tissue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> were performed in two horses with suspected PPID, with no clinical signs of laminitis. Changes compatible with laminitis of endocrine origin were observed, such as rounding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclei <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basal cells, thinning and stretching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary epidermal laminae and tissue proliferation. PPID horses with no clinical signs of laminitis may be affected by lesions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laminar tissue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> that compromise <b>the</b> integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dermal-epidermal junction and may develop clinical symptoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. It has been suggested that <b>the</b> development stage <b>of</b> endocrine laminitis is longer, but further studies should be conducted to confirm it...|$|R
50|$|All crevices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> are cleaned, {{particularly}} the sulci between the frog and the bars, as those areas {{are most likely}} to trap rocks or other debris, and also are the most common area to develop thrush. It is best to work <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> pick from heel to toe, so to avoid accidentally jabbing the horse's leg, <b>the</b> frog <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof,</b> or <b>the</b> person using the pick. When picking the feet, the groom stands at the horse's side, facing <b>the</b> tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse, then slides his or her hand down the horse's leg. If the horse was not trained to pick up its foot when a person runs their hand to the fetlock and lifts lightly, most horses will pick up their feet if the tendons behind their cannon bone are squeezed. Some horses, particularly draft breeds, may be trained to pick up their feet to pressure on their fetlock.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{establish}} <b>the</b> biochemical parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abaxial wall, dorsal wall and sole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial thoracic, lateral, and medial pelvic digits <b>of</b> buffalos. <b>The</b> <b>hoof</b> samples were subjected to destructive biochemical analyses to identify the dry material (DM), mineral matter (MM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE) contents. Sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) levels were determined based on nondestructive biochemical analyses. <b>The</b> parameters <b>of</b> dry material, mineral matter, organic matter, crude protein and ether extract <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> capsule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digits <b>of</b> buffalos can be determined by means of both destructive and nondestructive biochemical analysis. In addition, this study revealed that <b>the</b> highest concentrations <b>of</b> DM, CP and minerals such as, K, Zn and Cu are concentrated in the digits that bear the greatest body mass weight, suggesting that there is a positive correlation between the aforementioned parameters and the strength and growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> capsule in <b>the</b> digits. As for the element S, this study demonstrated that its highest concentration is located in <b>the</b> lateral digits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic members...|$|R

The long and slim limbs of Pliohippus reveal a quick-footed steppe animal.|$|R
25|$|Before {{beginning}} to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe pullers) and trims <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> wall to <b>the</b> desired length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and frog <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> with a hoof knife. Shoes {{do not allow}} <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> should line up straight with both bones in the pastern. If <b>the</b> excess <b>hoof</b> is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on <b>the</b> legs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal.|$|R
