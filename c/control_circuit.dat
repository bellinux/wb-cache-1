25|$|By 1967 most {{producers}} of guitar amplifiers changed from vacuum tubes to transistors and therefore redesigned their circuits. For several years, Gibson {{continued to use}} ROs in transistor amplifiers for the tremolo effect. In 1973, they designed another RO-based <b>control</b> <b>circuit,</b> where a signal from a pedal or an external generator seamlessly connected a diode-based signal stabilizer. However, {{in the same year}} they abandoned ROs in favor of field-effect transistors.|$|E

25|$|Diminutive, thin-sectioned {{symmetrical}} wing airfoils {{were designed}} for high-speed flight. The elevator <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> was designed by Heston Aircraft Company's Chief Draughtsman, C.G.W Ebbutt, with a variable ratio- with the stick near the neutral position, large movements could be made with small resulting pitch movements. This was needed for accurate handling at low level and high speed (the 3km airspeed record course had to be flown under 100ft above sea level). Towards {{the ends of the}} control column movement, the ratio increased to allow utilization of the full range of elevator travel.|$|E

500|$|Mennekes:On {{the right}} hand {{side of the car}} is the “fast” and “slow” AC {{charging}} point, accessed in a similar way to the DC charge point. This is a five pin [...] point. Three large pins are the line, neutral and earth/ground. The two small pins are a <b>control</b> <b>circuit.</b> This circuit enables the charge current to be cut off when charging is complete, cuts off power if the plug is removed from the vehicle (the plug and socket are both unshuttered), prevents both rapid and fast charging being done simultaneously and also prevents the vehicle from being driven while the plug is inserted. For “fast charging”, the control box (mounted at the roadside) is limited to 20 amps enabling a charge time (from depletion) of four hours. For “slow charging”, [...] a non-captive lead/cord is provided with the car. It is intended for use in the home or other domestic places. This has a local plug at one end and a Mennekes connector at the other. [...] The Mennekes plug has a retaining trigger with a hole for a padlock to prevent the plug from being removed from the car if deemed necessary. There is a “floating” [...] control box {{in the middle of this}} lead/cord that functions similarly to the fast charger but limits current to 10 amps so enabling an eight-hour charge time (from complete depletion on 230 volts) ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{their most}} basic form, tone <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> {{attenuate}} the {{high or low}} frequencies of the signal. This is called treble or bass [...] "cut". The simplest tone <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> are passive circuits which utilize only resistors and capacitors or inductors. They rely on the property of capacitive reactance or inductive reactance to inhibit or enhance an AC signal, in a frequency-dependent manner. Active tone controls may also amplify or [...] "boost" [...] certain frequencies. More elaborate tone <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> can boost or attenuate the middle range of frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{particular}} note is Rameyev's {{invention of}} diode-matrix <b>control</b> <b>circuits,</b> which {{were used to}} build his first brainchild, the first serially manufactured Soviet mainframe [...] "Strela" [...] (1954). In the 1950s, the diode-matrix <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> were not widespread due to their significant dimensions and high power consumption. However, with subsequent development of microelectronics {{and the emergence of}} large-scale integrated circuits, which made possible to deploy tens or hundreds of thousands of diodes and transistors in a single piece of silicon, the concept of <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> became viable and commonly used.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a typical}} hard wired motor {{start and stop}} circuit (called a <b>control</b> <b>circuit)</b> a motor is started by pushing a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "Run" [...] button that {{activates}} a pair of electrical relays. The [...] "lock-in" [...] relay locks in contacts that keep the <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> energized when the push button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The [...] "lock in" [...] contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a [...] "stop" [...] or [...] "off" [...] button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.|$|E
2500|$|Phase {{noise is}} {{another type of}} jitter {{observed}} in PLLs, and {{is caused by the}} oscillator itself and by elements used in the oscillator's frequency <b>control</b> <b>circuit.</b> [...] Some technologies are known to perform better than others in this regard. [...] The best digital PLLs are constructed with emitter-coupled logic (ECL) elements, at the expense of high power consumption. To keep phase noise low in PLL circuits, it is best to avoid saturating logic families such as transistor-transistor logic (TTL) or CMOS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designers}} built cavities {{into the}} piers where demolition charges could be placed, {{but when the}} French occupied the Rhineland after World War I, they filled these cavities with cement. After the Germans reacquired the Rhineland {{and control of the}} bridge, in 1938 they attached 60 zinc-lined boxes to the bridge girders, each capable of containing [...] of explosives. The system was designed to detonate all 60 charges at once, though by 7 March 1945, the charges had been removed and were stored nearby. They placed additional charges on the two piers. Within an inspection shaft in the west pier, the Germans placed [...] of explosives, and on the east pier they attached two charges of [...] to the girders connecting the bridge to the pier. The approximately [...] of charges were attached to an electric fuse and connected by electrical cables run through protective steel pipes to a <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> located in the entrance to the tunnel under Erpeler Ley. As a backup, the Germans attached a primer cord to the charges under the eastern pier that could be manually ignited.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E
