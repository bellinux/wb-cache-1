To address this, we devised an average velocity map to normalize the motion vectors.|$|R

30|$|We {{describe}} {{a method that}} can detect specific human behaviors, such as running and meeting, even within crowded sequences. Although tracking all human objects in a crowded scene is a difficult problem, it could be possible to detect specific human behaviors by searching for a certain unique feature value from major normal feature values. The trajectory of a moving person <b>contains</b> <b>rich</b> <b>information</b> about the person's behaviors, such as velocity or travel distance, so we used this trajectory for recognizing human behaviors.

Original survey data from Fiji <b>contain</b> <b>rich</b> <b>information</b> about cyclone damage, traditional kin status, and aid allocations over post-disaster phases, at both household and kin-group levels.

Elite domination can occur not only in aid allocation independent of damage, but also in targeting on damage (i. e., targeting bias). ...|$|E

As such they <b>contain</b> <b>richer</b> <b>information</b> than the basic beliefs they are aggregated from and can be used to optimize an agent’s search through its memory and its reasoning processes.
