Based on the synergistic effect of polychloroprene latex and styrene-acrylate emulsion, a waterborne <b>contact</b> <b>adhesive</b> consisting of polychloroprene latex (PCL) and styrene-acrylate emulsion (SAE) blend has been developed. In order to blend PCL with SAE easily and to accelerate the drying rate of the adhesive, boric acid was chosen for use in the PCL/SAE blend system.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{problems}} of non-slipping <b>contact,</b> non-slipping <b>adhesive</b> <b>contact,</b> and non-slipping <b>adhesive</b> <b>contact</b> with a stretched substrate are sequentially studied under the plane strain theory. The main results are obtained as follows:(i) The explicit solutions {{for a kind of}} singular integrals frequently encountered in contact mechanics (and fracture mechanics) are derived, which enables a comprehensive analysis of non-slipping contacts. (ii) The non-slipping contact problems are formulated in terms of the Kolosov–Muskhelishvili complex potential formulae and their exact solutions are obtained in closed or explicit forms. The relative tangential displacement within a non-slipping contact is found in a compact form. (iii) The spatial derivative of this relative displacement will be referred to in this study as the interface mismatch eigenstrain. Taking into account the interface mismatch eigenstrain, a new non-slipping <b>adhesive</b> <b>contact</b> model is proposed and its solution is obtained. It is shown that the pull-off force and the half-width of the non-slipping <b>adhesive</b> <b>contact</b> are smaller than the corresponding solutions of the JKR model (Johnson et al., 1971). The maximum difference can reach 9 % for pull-off force and 17 % for pull-off width, respectively. In contrast, the new model may be more accurate in modeling the non-slipping adhesion. (iv) The non-slipping adhesions with a stretch strain (S-strain) imposed to one of contact counterparts are re-examined and the analytical solutions are obtained. The accurate analysis shows that under small values of the S-strain both the natural <b>adhesive</b> <b>contact</b> half-width and the pull-off force may be augmented, but for the larger S-strain values they are always reduced. It is also found that Dundurs’ parameter β may exert a considerable effect on the solution of the pull-off problem under the S-strain.

The force required to pull an elastomeric hemisphere from a surface was determined by contact mechanics, via the JKR model, using a model siloxane network for the elastomeric contact sphere.

40|$|CMOS {{has been}} the {{building}} block for modern digital logic for decades and the performance and energy efficiency of CMOS continues to improve as technology develops, mainly through scaling. However due to the 60 mV/dec limit on MOS transistors, continue to reduce the power supply voltage would result {{in an increase in}} off-stage leakage current that would eventually dominate and increase the energy per operation of a transistor. In order to overcome this barrier, mechanical switches are proposed. Mechanical relays has the benefit of no leakage current through the air gap in the off state, which potentially enables further scaling of power supply voltage that can surpass MOS transistors. Several groups have been able to demonstrate mechanical switches with no leakage and abrupt on-off switching characteristics, however both the sizes of switches (~ 10 4 &# 956;m 2) and the operation voltages (> 10 V) are huge, causing the switching energy to be significantly larger than MOS transistors. Scaling efforts are needed to minimize the switching energy of a mechanical switch. In this thesis, prototype relay devices demonstrated by previous studies are discussed and the key factors {{that need to be addressed}} in order to minimize the switching energy are pointed out. The minimum switching energy is found to be limited by the <b>contact</b> <b>adhesive</b> force between contacts; studies on prototype devices with different contact areas shows that van der Waals force between contacts are the main source of adhesion in the prototype mechanical relays. Experiments show that by adding surface coating materials with low Hamaker constant can lower the <b>contact</b> <b>adhesive</b> force. In order to lower the structural stiffness, process development of poly-SiGe is optimized through multiple post-deposition processing techniques for reduced stress gradient of 100 nm thin films, a 10 X reduction from the prototype devices. The combined learning from adhesive force work and thin film processing leads to the experiments of fabricating scaled devices of 500 X smaller footprint. The results show that scaled relays can potentially operate at low voltages (~ 2 V), but more process optimization needs to be done to demonstrate a fully operational device...|$|E

40|$|Classical cadherin {{adhesion}} molecules are key {{determinants of}} cell-cell recognition during development and in post-embryonic life. A decisive step in productive cadherin-based recognition is {{the conversion of}} nascent adhesions into stable zones of contact. It is increasingly clear that such contact zone extension entails active cooperation between cadherin adhesion and the force-generating capacity of the actin cytoskeleton. Cortactin has recently emerged as an important regulator of actin dynamics in several forms of cell motility. We now report that cortactin is recruited to cell-cell <b>adhesive</b> <b>contacts</b> in response to homophilic cadherin ligation. Notably, cortactin accumulates preferentially, with Arp 2 / 3, at cell margins where <b>adhesive</b> <b>contacts</b> are being extended.
