40|$|The <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> of 35 072 Italian {{schoolchildren}} aged 7 - 10 {{years were}} investigated {{as part of}} a nation-wide survey of nutritional patterns. The Friuli, Piedmont, Latium and Sicily regions of Italy were selected as representative of the nation's north-south and east-west socio-economic divisions. A food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess the nutritional intakes of the whole sample. The validity of the food-frequency questionnaire method was assessed in a sub-sample of children by traditional methods: 24 -h dietary recall and a weighted food diary. The data indicate that the mean <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> of girls were below the recommended daily intake of 800 mg in all of the regions except Sicily, and that the <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> of boys were above the recommended daily intake in all of the regions except Friuli. These results suggest that there may be deficiencies in the <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> of this age-group in the wider population, particularly in girls.

40|$|Concern has {{recently}} arisen {{about the potential}} adverse effects of excessive <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes,</b> i. e., <b>calcium</b> loading from supplements, on arterial calcification and risks of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in older adults. Published reports that high <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> in free-living adults have relatively little or no beneficial impact on bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture rates suggest that current recommendations of calcium for adults may be set too high. Because even healthy kidneys have limited capability of eliminating excessive calcium in the diet, the likelihood of soft-tissue calcification may increase in older adults who take calcium supplements, particularly in those with age or disease-related reduction in renal function. The maintenance of BMD and bone health {{continues to be an}} important goal of adequate dietary calcium consumption, but eliminating potential risks of CVDs from excessive <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> needs to be factored into policy recommendations for calcium by adults...|$|R

40|$|Recommended {{elemental}} <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> for NorthAmerican {{children are}} 800 mg/d for those 4 to 8 {{years old and}} 1300 mg/d for those 9 {{years of age and}} older. 1 With a traditional diet, Inuit children in north-ern Canada ingest only 20 mg of elemental calcium per day. 2 After presumably adapting to this constraint over millennia, the Inuit are now adopting a more southern “market ” diet, with appreciably higher <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes.</b> Having observed cases of severe hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis in children from northern communities, we hypothesized that adaptation to a restricted calcium in-take might be associated with altered intestinal or renal tubular calcium absorption, which might be maladaptive as the traditional diet is supplanted.

40|$|Background: Dairy {{product and}} <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> have been {{associated}} with increased prostate cancer risk, but whether specific dairy products or calcium sources are associated with risk is unclear. Objective: In the Continuous Update Project, we conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies on intakes of dairy products and calcium and prostate cancer risk. Design: PubMed and several other databases were searched up to April 2013. Summary RRs were estimated by using a random-effects model. Results: Thirty-two studies were included. Intakes of total dairy products [summary RR: 1. 07 (95 % CI: 1. 02, 1. 12; n = 15) per 400 g/d], total milk [summary RR: 1. 03 (95 % CI: 1. 00, 1. 07; n = 14) per 200 g/d], low-fat milk [summary RR: 1. 06 (95 % CI: 1. 01, 1. 11; n = 6) per 200 g/d], cheese [summary RR: 1. 09 (95 % CI: 1. 02, 1. 18; n = 11) per 50 g/d], and dietary calcium [summary RR: 1. 05 (95 % CI: 1. 02, 1. 09; n = 15) per 400 mg/d] were associated with increased total prostate cancer risk. Total calcium and dairy <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes,</b> but not nondairy calcium or supplemental <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes,</b> were also positively associated with total prostate cancer risk. Supplemental calcium was associated with increased risk of fatal prostate cancer. Conclusions: High intakes of dairy products, milk, low-fat milk, cheese, and total, dietary, and dairy calcium, but not supplemental or nondairy calcium, may increase total prostate cancer risk. The diverging results for types of dairy products and sources of calcium suggest that other components of dairy rather than fat and calcium may increase prostate cancer risk.

40|$|Background: Obesity in the United States has in-creased {{significantly}} {{during the}} past several decades. The role of calcium in the maintenance of a healthy body weight remains controversial. Methods: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was performed with 36 282 postmeno-pausal women, aged 50 to 79 years, who were already enrolled in the dietary modification and/or hormone therapy arms of the Women’s Health Initiative clinical trial. Women were randomized at their first or second annual visit to receive a dose of 1000 mg of elemental calcium plus 400 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D) or pla-cebo daily. Change in body weight was ascertained an-nually for an average of 7 years. Results: Women receiving calcium plus cholecalcif-erol supplements vs women receiving placebo had a mini-mal but consistent favorable difference in weight change (mean difference, − 0. 13 kg; 95 % confidence interval, − 0. 21 to − 0. 05;P =. 001). After 3 years of follow-up, women with daily <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> less than 1200 mg at baseline who were randomized to supplements were 11 % less likely to experience small weight gains (1 - 3 kg) and 11 % less likely to gain more moderate amounts of weight (3 kg) (P for interaction for baseline calcium intake=. 008).

However, once an individual has been found to possess a high risk for fracture (as assessed by a 10 -yr fracture risk assessment tool), the clinical focus shifts towards treatment, which includes reinforcing positive lifestyle habits, but also necessitates the probable addition of pharmaceutical therapies to minimize this risk (Papaioannou et al. 2010).|$|R
25|$|H. aspersa {{requires}} {{at least}} 3% to 4% calcium {{in the soil}} (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than H. aspersa.

25|$|However, if the {{thyrotoxicosis}} {{is treated}} early, bone loss can be minimized.

40|$|Background : Extremely preterm infants {{generally}} experience postnatal growth failure. It {{is still}} unclear if this is related to micronutrient intakes. Aim : To investigate the effect of micronutrient <b>intakes</b> (<b>calcium,</b> zinc, iron, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, folate and vitamin B 12) on growth during the first 28 days of life in extremely preterm infants. Method : From the EXPRESS cohort (all infants born < 27 gestational weeks between 2004 - 2007 in Sweden), those who survived the first 28 days were included (n= 524). Daily parenteral and enteral intakes and anthropometric measurements were retrieved from hospital records. Results : Preliminary analyses of data from 333 infants (mean±SD gestational age 25. 2 ± 1. 0 weeks, birth weight 753 ± 168 g) showed that macronutrient intakes were lower than recommended (energy 98 ± 13 kcal/kg/day, protein 2. 9 ± 0. 4 g/kg/day). Infants showed postnatal growth failure: mean standard deviation scores decreased by 2. 2 for weight, 2. 3 for length and 1. 4 for head circumference. Intakes of micronutrients were generally low, e. g. adjusted enteral <b>intakes</b> of <b>calcium</b> were 66. 6 ± 21. 4 mg/kg/day. The exception was iron, with a high parenteral intake of 2. 7 ± 1. 6 mg/kg/day, mainly from blood transfusions. Adjusting for protein intake and other confounders, <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> were positively correlated with head growth (r=+ 0. 19, p= 0. 006) and iron intakes were negatively correlated with length gain (r=- 0. 18, p= 0. 009). Conclusions : Low <b>calcium</b> <b>intakes</b> and high iron intakes were associated with poor growth with regard to head circumference and length, respectively. If these results are confirmed, optimized micronutrient intakes may improve early growth in extremely preterm infants...|$|R
