50|$|The {{current number}} of Golden Telecom's GSM postpaid and prepaid {{subscribers}} is just below 50,000 (June 2007). The outlook of its GSM business is quite grim {{in the wake}} of huge success and growth of traditional (Kyivstar, UMC) and emerging (Astelit) competitors. Even its earlier competitive advantage, absence of the connection fee (a small flat fee, usually $0.05-$0.06, charged by Kyivstar and UMC per connection in addition to per minute rate), is not a factor anymore as new competitors (Astelit, Beeline) do not <b>charge</b> <b>connection</b> fees as well.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} KSFs of TTQS, as {{introduced}} in international hotels in Taiwan. The method {{to carry out}} this study was using a survey AHP method. The findings of this study are, as follows: (1) Order of importance of the four dimensions: organizational management, training design, training execution, and result assessment, shows that when introducing TTQS, tourist hotels must first focus on reforming the organizational system. They should change the previous model to authorize training of the operational department. The training department should not play a passive role, and must establish a systematic training model with documents to dominate, as well as assist and audit training operations. (2) Among the 19 key factors of the sub-dimensions, the top 5 are high-ranking supervisors’ high degree of support and participation, TTQS knowledge of persons in <b>charge,</b> <b>connection</b> between target members’ and organizational needs, specific training goals before training, and regular training organization experience before introduction of TTQS. Based on the order, “high-ranking supervisors’ support and participation” is the most important factor for organizations to introduce the TTQS system...|$|E

Purpose of the work: creation of special technical facilities for personal computers {{and their use}} in the problems of machine processing of images in the digital interferometry, high-energy physics and other fields. New results are obtained {{in the investigation of}} the characteristics of device matrixes with a <b>charge</b> <b>connection</b> and in the methods of increasing the accuracy of measurements. A number of electronic modules are created for personal computers which provide for the input, processing and presentation of images in the experiment complex automated systems in the digital interferometry and in the diagnostics systems of accelerator bunches, {{as well as in the}} semiconductor technology. The developed devices and systems are introduced in the United Institute of Nuclear Investigations, Institute of Measurement Problems (Bratislava), Department of Physical Electronics of the Slovak Academy of Sciences (Bratislava), etc. The introduced devices provide for a complex automation of measurements in the digital interferometry and for processing of images in the real time or in the time close to realAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines (ICE) are combined {{with electric motors}} and batteries in both hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) to improve efficiency and allow a limited all electric range. This paper quan- tifies the electrical power needed for charging a fleet of PHEVs in Belgium. A stochastic model based on the driving behavior of Western European drivers, determines {{the availability of the}} PHEVs for charging from grid. Three scenarios are defined to generate charging profiles based on the driving profiles. The scenarios are based on current tariff schemes available to residential users, which only includes a day and night tariff. Therefore, the management or coordination of the PHEVs is diffucult based on these tariffs. Two scenarios are based on the current single tariff schemes; the distinction between them is the availability of a <b>charging</b> <b>connection</b> at the work place. The third scenario is a day and night tariff. As night work is not that popular, there is no effectual difference whether or not a <b>charging</b> <b>connection</b> at work is available. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Revenues {{are usually}} {{generated}} through two <b>charges</b> to customers: <b>connection</b> fees and use <b>charges.</b> <b>Connection</b> fees are <b>charged</b> once to new customers as they {{connect to the}} sanitary sewer collection system, and are usually designed to recover capital investments made by the enterprise to serve its customers. Use charges are periodic charges for ongoing use of the system, and are designed to recover operations and maintenance expenses. Both connection fees and use charges are typically proportionate to the amount and strength of wastewater expected to be generated by each customer. Therefore, a single family residence would pay much smaller fees and charges than a food processing plant.|$|R
