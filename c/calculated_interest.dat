40|$|While it is {{commonly}} believed that derivative instruments are a recent invention, we document the existence of forward contracts {{for the sale of}} wool in medieval England around 700 years ago. The contracts were generally entered into by English monasteries, who frequently sold their wool for up to twenty years in advance to mostly foreign and particularly Italian merchants. Employing a unique source of data collected by hand from the historical records, we determine the interest rates implied in these transactions and we also examine the efficiency of the forward and spot markets. The <b>calculated</b> <b>interest</b> rates average around 20 %, in accordance with available information concerning the interest rates used in other types of transactions at that time. Perhaps surprisingly, we also find little evidence of informational inefficiencies in these markets. Wood market, forward contracts, market efficinecy, Medieval England, Interest rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{mortality}} tables and life insurance is sprinkled {{with the names}} of people more famous for other things. American composer Charles Ives, who, like your columnist, worked in Danbury, Connecticut, also invented the insurance agency, so that insurance customers themselves no longer had to negotiate directly with the insurance companies. Edmund Halley, of comet fame, devoted a good deal of energy to calculating one of the earlier mortality tables. [Halley 1693] Henry Briggs, better known for his pioneering work with logarithms, <b>calculated</b> <b>interest</b> tables. Swiss religious reformer John Calvin preached that life insurance was not necessarily immoral usury, as some maintained at the time. Daniel Defoe, author of Gulliver's Travels, proposed a national insurance scheme for England in 1697. We find other familiar names, DeMoivre, Fermat, Harriot, Hudde, Huygens, de Witt, van Shooten, Maclaurin, Maseres, Pepys and, of course, Euler. Euler wrote half a dozen articles that related to mortality and life insurance, and several other articles about lotteries and card games that used many of the same principles of probability. His first excursion into this particular subject was in 1760, when he had been working in Berlin for almost 20 years. Euler was probably inspired to write Recherches générales sur la mortalité et la multiplication du genre humain, (General research on mortality and population growth of human kind) [E 334] by hi...|$|E

These programs overcome the difficulties of using a spreadsheet program such as Excel. Generally, these program are specifically designed for situations with irregular payment histories, irregular rate changes and unusual payment allocation options.

40|$|Frequently {{analysts and}} {{teachers}} use the capitalized {{rate of interest}} {{for the cost of}} debt when forecasting and discounting cash flows. On the other hand, some authors (and analysts) estimate the interest payments when forecasting annual financial statements or cash flows based on the average of debt calculated with the beginning balance and the end of year balance. This makes some sense because usually firms repay debt in a monthly or quarterly basis and <b>calculating</b> <b>interest</b> payments might not reflect reality.

40|$|Public {{savings in}} the Banking System are of prime {{importance}} to dictate {{the economy of}} India. A major component of such savings is through Time deposits constituting nearly 85 % of the Total deposits. Furthermore, Term deposits constitute {{a major component of}} such Time deposits. Considering all scheduled commercial banks of India, Time deposits are in the order of Rs. 830, 000 crores and are growing at more than 17 % every financial year. The interest amount paid on the Time deposits directly depends not only on the rate of interest applicable to such deposits but also on a number of other factors, including the method used to calculate the same. Though {{there has been a lot}} of discussion in the literature on the quantum of the rate of interest, there appear to be no discussions on the method of <b>calculating</b> such <b>interests.</b> This could be because it was thought that the method of calculation should have one and only one meaning. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between the rate of interest and the interest amount. We give several different methods of <b>calculating</b> the <b>interest</b> amount. Although not an exhaustive list, the methods of <b>calculating</b> <b>interest</b> described here are some of the more common methods in use. They indicate that the method of interest calculation can substantially affect the amount of interest paid, and that depositors should be aware not only of nominal interest rates but also of how nominal rates are used in <b>calculating</b> total <b>interest</b> amount. Moreover, since the depositors constitute 89 % of bank customers, in the interest of customer protection as also to bring about meaningful competition we observe that it is necessary to have a greater degree of transparency in regards to effective interest rates for depositors. 1...|$|R

However, if repayment is scheduled to occur at regular intervals throughout the term, the average amount to which the borrower has access is lower and so the effective or true rate of interest is higher.

This is the case in the example to the right, where the loan contract is for 400,000 Cambodian riels over 4 months.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is: 1. to discuss the methods of <b>calculating</b> <b>interest</b> rates that are {{commonly}} used in New Zealand; 2. to present case examples showing the difference between quoted and effective interest rates for a number of major lending institutions; and 3. to generate discussion as to the need for effective interest rate disclosure legislation in New Zealand.

In all other cases, except where no interest rate is quoted at all, the quoted rates are lower than the effective rates. In one case the quoted rate is less than half the effective rate. If the effective rates were reduced to the quoted rates then for some of the larger loans borrowers would pay several thousand dollars less in interest over the term of the loan. The advent of programmable calculators and desktop computers has greatly simplified the <b>calculating</b> of effective <b>interest</b> rates.
