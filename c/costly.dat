5|$|<b>Costly</b> {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and <b>costly</b> signalling could explain this. All religions may involve <b>costly</b> and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. <b>Costly</b> signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are <b>costly</b> enough to deter free riders.|$|E
