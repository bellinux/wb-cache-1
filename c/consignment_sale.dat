40|$|Under a {{consignment}} {{contract with}} revenue sharing, a supplier decides on the retail price and delivery quantity for his product, and retains {{ownership of the}} goods; for each item sold, the retailer deducts a percentage from the selling price and remits the balance to the supplier. In this paper we show that, under such a contract, both the overall channel performance {{and the performance of}} individual firms depend critically on demand price elasticity and on the retailer's share of channel cost. In particular, the (expected) channel profit loss, compared with that of a centralized system, increases with demand price elasticity and decreases with retailer's cost share, while the profit share extracted by the retailer decreases with price elasticity and increases with retailer's cost share. With an iso-price-elastic demand model, we show that the channel profit loss cannot exceed 26. 4 %, and that the retailer's profit share cannot be below 50 %. When price elasticity is low, or when the retailer's cost share approaches 100 %, or both, the retailer can extract nearly all the channel profit that is almost equal to the centralized channel profit. <b>consignment</b> <b>sales,</b> revenue sharing, supply chain management...|$|R

The results presented in the table's indicate that no appreciable difference {{can be attributed to}} selling wool either on a graded or ungraded basis. They do indicate an advantage for the farm flock grower, who produced less than 3, 000 pounds, to sell his wool by consignment to local wool pools. The results also imply an advantage for the farm flock grower producing from 3, 000 to 5, 000 pounds and above, to sell their wool directly to buyers. The results of this study also indicate that net returns are largest on both direct and <b>consignment</b> <b>sales</b> to manufacturers, implying that returns are highest " to growers when handler's margins are not a cost to manufacturers. This indication must-be qualified, however, because of the limited number of manufacturers who bought wool in the state in 1956. In certain instances it may be less costly for the manufacturer to buy in volume from handlers in the central markets.

40|$|We analyze {{a supply}} chain {{consisting}} of one manufacturer and one retailer under <b>consignment</b> <b>sales</b> with a revenue sharing contract. The manufacturer produces before, but charges price to sell the products through the retailer after the demand curve is revealed. The retailer deducts a fraction from the selling price for each unit sold and remits the balance to manufacturer. We refer to the capability whereby firms delay price decision and make sales in response to actual market condition as postponement. We find that, when market demand admits a multiplicative structure, the revenue share and allocation of channel profit between the firms when they have postponement capability are similar to {{when they do not}} have such capability. Postponement improves the profits of individual firms. Such an effect is more phenomenal in the centralized system than in decentralized system, and when the market demand is more sensitive to price changes. However, it causes the profit loss, defined as the percentage deviation of channel profit in the decentralized system relative to the centralized system, to worsen, and the gap widens with retailer’s sales cost. When the demand has an additive structure, while the roles of postponement on firms’ decisions differ slightly from those under the multiplicative structure, the structure of the strategic interactions between firms and relative channel performance are not significantly altered.

40|$|Although leases, <b>consignments,</b> and <b>sales</b> of {{accounts}} and chattel paper annually result in commercial transactions involving many billions of dollars, the Uniform Commercial Code, which establishes {{the legal framework}} for these transactions, provides only a few sentences of guidance for the practitioner or judge seeking {{to determine whether a}} transaction denominated as a lease, <b>consignment,</b> or <b>sale</b> {{of accounts}} or chattel paper is in fact a secured transaction subject to all provisions of article 9 of the Code. In this Article, Mr. Peter F.

Concluding that the standards established by section 1 - 201 (37) are lacking in the precision and clarity needed to make the difficult decision of when a transaction is indeed a true lease as opposed to a disguised secured transaction, Mr. Coogan considers whether leases-like sales of account and chattel paper-should be subjected to {{some or all of the}} provisions of article 9 in order to make this determination. The author finds the application of these provisions to leases unsatisfactory; and he consequently turns to the standards of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act, the tax bar, and the accounting profession in an effort to establish useful standards in this area. Finally, Mr. Coogan recommends that, at a minimum, a more direct treatment of this problem should be incorporated into the Code, indicating that the standards and precedents of the UCSA provide the best guidelines for determining whether a transaction is a true lease or a secured transaction...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Validation of {{a method}} for the minimally-invasive {{measurement}} of physiological stress will help understanding of risk factors that may contribute to stress-associated events including recrudescence of Equid herpesvirus (EHV), which is anecdotally associated with <b>sales</b> <b>consignment</b> of pregnant Thoroughbred mares. In this study we compared two similar groups of late-gestation Thoroughbred broodmares on the same farm: a consigned Sales group (N = 8) and a non-consigned Control group (N = 6). The Sales mares were separated from their paddock companions and grouped prior to their preparation for, transport to, and return from the sales venue. Both groups were monitored by sampling at regular intervals from 5 days prior to until 14 days after the sales date (D 0) to measure physiological stress in terms of changes in faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations, and for event-related viral recrudescence via daily body temperature measurements and periodic nasal swabs for PCR analysis for EHV- 1 and − 4 DNA. RESULTS: In both groups, FGM levels increased post-sales before returning to pre-sales levels. Specifically, FGM concentrations in the Sales mares were significantly higher on D + 3 and D + 10 than on D- 4 and D- 3 (F = 12. 03, P < 0. 0001, Post hoc: P = 0. 0003 – 0. 0008) and in the Control group FGM concentrations were higher on D + 10 than D- 4 (F = 5. 52, P = 0. 004, Post hoc: P = 0. 005). Interestingly, mean FGM levels in Control mares were significantly higher at 4 of the 5 sampling points (t = 5. 64 – 2. 25, p = 0. 0001 – 0. 044). Only one (Sales) mare showed PCR evidence of EHV- 1 shedding.

40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{prevalence}} of equine herpesvirus types- 1 and - 4 (EHV- 1 and - 4) in South African Thoroughbreds at auction sales is currently undefined. Commingling of young Thoroughbreds from various populations together with physiological stress {{related to their}} transport and confinement at a sales complex, {{may be associated with}} shedding and transmission of EHV- 1 and - 4. This prospective cohort study sampled 90 young Thoroughbreds consigned from eight farms, originating from three provinces representative of the South African Thoroughbred breeding demographic to a sales complex. Nasal swabs for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to detect EHV- 1 and - 4 nucleic acid and blood samples for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for EHV- 1 and - 4 antibodies were collected from all horses on arrival and departure. Additional nasal swabs for qPCR were obtained serially from those displaying pyrexia and, or nasal discharge. Daily faecal samples were used for determination of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations as a measurement of physiological stress and these values were modelled to determine the factors best explaining FGM variability. RESULTS : EHV- 4 nucleic acid was detected in 14. 4 % and EHV- 1 from none of the animals in the study population. Most (93. 3 %) and very few (1. 1 %) of this population showed antibodies indicating prior exposure to EHV- 4 and EHV- 1 respectively. Pyrexia and nasal discharge were poor predictors for detecting EHV- 4 nucleic acid. The horses’ FGM concentrations increased following arrival before decreasing for most of the remaining study period including the auction process. Model averaging showed that variation in FGM concentrations was best explained by days post-arrival and transport duration. CONCLUSIONS : In this study population, <b>sales</b> <b>consignment</b> was associated with limited detection of EHV- 4 nucleic acid in nasal secretions, with most showing prior exposure to EHV- 4 and very few to EHV- 1.

Ninety, two-year old Thoroughbreds (51 colts, 39 fillies) were consigned from eight farms and sampled at a South African auction sale. The horses were monitored for pyrexia and nasal discharge. Nasal swabs were collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to detect EHV- 1 and - 4 and faecal samples were collected for enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to determine faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations. EHV- 4 nucleic acid was detected in some and EHV- 1 nucleic acid in none of the population. Pyrexia and nasal discharge were poor indicators of EHV- 4 status. Variation in FGM concentrations was best explained by transportation and preparation for auction. Peaks in EHV- 4 detection and increases in FGM concentrations were identified shortly post-arrival and {{on the first day of}} auction. Temporal changes in FGM concentrations of horses from individual farms showed two distinct patterns: Pattern A (biphasic peaks) and Pattern B (single peak). It was concluded that <b>sales</b> <b>consignment</b> was associated with some EHV- 4 nucleic acid detection and distinctive physiological stress patterns in this population of young Thoroughbreds.
