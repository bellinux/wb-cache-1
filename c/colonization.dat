40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} caves and other {{subterranean}} environments assert {{the presence of}} white, gray, yellow and pink <b>colonizations</b> caused by microbial communities colonizing the walls and ceilings. In the case of white <b>colonizations,</b> {{most of the studies}} were carried out using molecular techniques. Nevertheless, there is not much information obtained by cultivation techniques. White <b>colonizations</b> are particularly important in biodeterioration process in caves (Altamira) and tombs (Etruscan, necropolis). Therefore, the aim of this work is the study of white <b>colonizations</b> of the cultivable fraction of two Spanish caves: the Gruta de las Maravillas (Aracena, Huelva) and the Cueva del Tesoro (Rincón de la Victoria, Málaga). The most abundant microorganisms isolated from white <b>colonizations</b> belong to the phylum Actinobacteria followed by the phylum Firmicutes in both caves. In this pool of bacterial diversity, we have characterized following a polyphasic approach two novel species, Paenibacillus speluncae in the Gruta de las Maravillas and Acinetobacter thesauricus in the Cueva del Tesoro, respectively. The discovery of new species allow us to know their physiology and potencial in the biodeterioration processes of the cave. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{circulation}} of multiresistant bacteria between pediatric intensive care units {{is a reality}} and {{it is necessary to}} know the profi le of the most prevalent microorganisms to establish effective control measures. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the profi le of imported multiresistant bacteria (MRB) in a pediatric intensive care unit in Rio de Janeiro, according to the geographic region the hospitals. Methods: Nasal and rectal swabs were collected from all patients who remained for more than 12 hours in other units, and were admitted at the four pediatric intensive care units of Prontobaby. Results: Between August 2009 and December 2011. Sixty BMR were detected, of which 19 caused infection and 41, <b>colonizations.</b> Gram-negative infections accounted for 68. 4 % and 60. 8 % of the <b>colonizations.</b> Most hospitals (21 / 33 - 63. 6 %) were located in the city of Rio de Janeiro and those located in the north and west regions of the city had 25 of the 60 (41. 6 %) BMR. Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBL was the most commonly isolated bacteria in infections, while Escherichia coli ESBL was the most frequent in Gram-negative <b>colonizations.</b> Conclusion: We conclude that the imported Gram-negative MRB were more prevalent in both infections and <b>colonizations.</b> The north and west regions of the city had the most cases of MRB.

40|$|Monitoring {{bacterial}} {{communities is}} critical for assessing biodeterioration among other processes. This study presents a strategy and an example of comparative analysis of bacterial communities developing in a cave environment, Altamira Cave which contains unique paleolithic paintings. The analyzed question was whether white <b>colonizations</b> discovered throughout the cave corresponded to similar or different bacterial communities. Molecular fingerprints were obtained by PCR–DGGE from DNA and RNA and statistically compared. Results based on DNA analysis showed that a similar bacterial community was present in white <b>colonizations</b> throughout the cave. Fingerprints based on RNA confirmed the similarity of the major metabolically active components of these communities. The proposed procedure confirmed that white <b>colonizations</b> in Altamira Cave were {{a consequence of the}} development of a single complex bacterial community, and the method proves to be highly useful for comparative analysis of microbial communities, including biodeteriorating processes and any other comparative analysis of bacterial communities.

40|$|Aims]: To {{determine}} the major components of total and metabolically active microbial communities {{of yellow and}} grey <b>colonizations</b> threatening the conservation of palaeolithic paintings in Altamira Cave (Spain). [Methods and Results]: Micro-organisms present in yellow and grey <b>colonizations</b> were determined from DNA analysis with those showing metabolic activity determined from RNA analysis. Microbial community fingerprints were obtained by {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and 16 S rDNA libraries were constructed from PCR amplified products. Proteobacteria was the most frequent bacterial phylum. Other phyla detected from RNA-based microbial surveys were Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae and Gemmatimonadetes. The detected metabolically active micro-organisms represented {{only a fraction of the}} total bacterial community present in the studied <b>colonizations</b> as compared from DGGE analysis. [Conclusions]: The major bacterial participants in the development of yellow and grey <b>colonizations</b> in Altamira Cave were determined using RNA-based molecular techniques. Micro-organisms showing undetectable activity represent a potential risk for the conservation of these paintings if environmental conditions experience variations. [Significance and Impact of the Study]: Caves with palaeolithic paintings are affected by microbial deterioration. Assessing the composition of the microbial communities colonizing these caves represents a first stage to understand and control these colonizationsThe authors acknowledge the support through a contract with the Ministry of Culture (Contract 31321000710 T, 'Analysis of the conditions for the conservation of palaeolithic paintings in Altamira Cave') and projects CGL 2006 - 11561 /BTE, CGL 2006 - 07424 /BOS, from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (MEC).

40|$|Parasite {{diversity}} on remote oceanic archipelagos {{is determined}} by the number and timing of <b>colonizations</b> and by in situ diversification rate. In this study, we compare intra-archipelago diversity of two hemosporidian parasite genera, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon, infecting birds of the Mascarene archipelago. Despite the generally higher vagility of Plasmodium parasites, we report a diversity of Plasmodium cytochrome b haplotypes in the archipelago much lower than that of Leucocytozoon. Using phylogenetic data, we find that this difference in diversity is consistent with differences in the timing and number of <b>colonizations,</b> while rates of diversification do not vary significantly between the two genera.
