5|$|In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, {{moving about}} 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber {{shop in the}} Hotel Conneaut. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the {{itinerary}} for dance bands who worked {{up and down the}} Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Ranger Company entered {{action on}} 11 April, {{part of a}} tank-infantry task force {{conducting}} aggressive reconnaissance in a wide valley near the river. Encountering a village, the 3rd Platoon cleared the village and killed two Chinese stragglers. After the lead elements of the tank company and the 3rd Platoon had taken the Kantongyon village, the tank company commander wanted to move his company west {{into the center of}} the valley before continuing north. Captain and now Executive Officer, Bob Channon was near the rear of the company column. CO, Jess Tidwell, riding with the tank Co, called Channon on the radio and instructed him to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> take control of the 1st and 2nd Platoons.|$|E
5|$|A {{flurry of}} action followed. On 1 July 1941 he {{expended}} 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader's section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing {{sight of the}} squadron, Johnson and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived so as to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> underneath into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109's starboard wing. Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and {{did not make a}} claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E

5|$|Point 343 {{was held}} through the 18th, however, though {{with the loss}} of 63 men; by the evening, a force of tanks had managed to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{stabilise}} the position with the aid of artillery support. The 4th/11th Sikh Regiment moved around the Gurkhas to the north, covering the northern flank of the San Marino heights, and the division's 11th Brigade passed through them to help encircle the city. On the evening of the 19th, the 2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of 11th Indian Infantry Brigade began to push into {{the outskirts of the city}} from the north, but early on the morning of the 20th were held back by defensive positions in the north-west of the city, where the road to the upper part of the city, situated higher on the mountain, began. Tanks moved into the suburbs, whilst a company of the Camerons moved uphill toward the summit in heavy rain. The city was secured by the early afternoon, with only 24 casualties among the attackers, and 54 prisoners taken.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Falkenstein {{would ride}} her {{horse in the}} dark on the beach to see the sun <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> spend time looking at the shells, rocks, seaweed, and driftwood, and these nature forms {{inspired}} her sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The {{afternoon}} of the wreck, the purser, Mr. J.W. McCully, went downriver to Salem, where he telegraphed to the company Oregon City to send up nails, lumber and carpenters to repair the Alice, and another steamer, either the Fannie Patton or the E.N. Cooke to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> take off the cargo.|$|E

25|$|Forgery of forint {{banknotes}} is not significant. However, forged 20,000 forint notes {{printed on}} the paper of 2000 forint notes after dissolving the original ink might <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{are not easy to}} recognize. Another denomination preferred by counterfeiters was the 1000 forint note until improved security features were added in 2006.|$|E
25|$|When escape seemed unlikely, Seringapatam changed {{course and}} {{appeared}} to be making an attack run on Greenwich but the latter came to a halt and waited for Georgiana to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> provide assistance. At this point, four men were transferred from Georgiana to Greenwich so Captain Stavers chose to break off the attack and continue fleeing. Lieutenant Gamble closed the distance between the two ships and he first demanded that the British surrender. But when the Americans came within pistol range, Seringapatam raised her colors and fired a powerful broadside.|$|E
25|$|By the 13th {{century the}} {{universities}} of Oxford and Paris had <b>come</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> the scholars were now studying mathematics and philosophy with lesser worries about mundane chores of life—the fields {{were not as}} clearly demarcated {{as they are in}} the modern times. Of these, compendia and redactions, such as those of Johannes Campanus, of Euclid and Aristotle, confronted scholars with ideas about infinity and the ratio theory of elements as a means of expressing relations between various quantities involved with moving bodies. These studies led to a new body of knowledge that is now known as physics.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{fighting}} during the night of August 10–11 and during {{the day of the}} 11th, the regimental commander decided that he could not safely move the regimental trains and the artillery through the pass during the day, and accordingly he had made plans to do it that night. That afternoon, however, division commander William B. Kean wanted the division to move forward rapidly, and said that a battalion of the US 24th Infantry Regiment would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> protect its right, north flank. General Kean apparently did not believe any considerable force of enemy troops was in the vicinity of Pongam-ni, despite representations to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|Under fire, Minerve {{attempted}} to ram Dido. Manoeuvering to avoid destruction, Captain George Henry Towry turned aside and instead found his rigging impaled on the French ship's bowsprit. After 15 minutes of hand-to-hand combat, the French bowsprit shattered under the strain. Dido too was left badly damaged, but the delay allowed Lowestoffe to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> rake Minerve, causing such severe damage that the French ship was rendered unmanageable. On seeing his companion in this situation, Captain Charbonnier of Artémise, which had played an ineffectual {{part in the}} combat, withdrew, briefly and distantly pursued by Lowestoffe. Isolated and immobile, Minerve was then battered into surrender by Lowestoffe. The captured frigate was commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name, and served until she was recaptured by the French at the Action of 2 July 1803.|$|E
25|$|A {{storm had}} <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the seas had grown very heavy, with waves {{crashing}} over the bow. There {{was only one}} lifeboat on Wellington and Lieutenant Brown mustered all the men abreast of this except for the radio operator and three men on the pumps. It was his intention to remain with these four until all hope of saving the ship was gone, the other men meanwhile standing by in the lifeboat. One Seneca man and seven Wellington men were lowered with the boat, the others to slide down the falls into the boat {{as soon as it}} reached the water. Fearful lest the boat be smashed against the ship by the heavy seas, one of Wellingtons men chopped the painter and the lifeboat with its eight men drifted away rapidly. They tried to row back, but inexperienced in a pulling boat, they were no match for the heavy seas and strong current.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} January 20, 2009 on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States. In Canada, the DVD {{was released on}} January 20, 2009 and the Blu-ray was released February 10, 2009. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on March 9, 2009. It was released in Ireland on March 6, 2009. The DVD was released in Germany on April 14. The US DVD release contains two audio commentaries (one by Bousman and actors Vega, Moseley, and Ogre; the other by Bousman, creators Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich, and music producer Joseph Bishara), two featurettes (From Stage to Screen and Legal Assassin - A Repo Man), and the theatrical trailer.

25|$|At this dire point, Gen. Jackson rode to {{that part}} of the field to rally the men and came upon his old brigade finally being brought up to {{reinforce}} the line. Intending to inspire the troops there, he attempted to brandish his sword; however, due to the infrequency with which he drew it, it had rusted in its scabbard and he was unable to dislodge it. Undaunted, he unbuckled the sword from his belt and waved it, scabbard and all, over his head. He then grabbed a battle flag from a retreating standard bearer and yelled at his men to rally around him. The Stonewall Brigade, heartened by their commander, launched into the Union troops and drove them back. By this point, Banks's men were becoming tired and disorganized, with their ammunition nearly gone. Without any support, his men had been unable to follow up on their initial success. In their zeal, the Stonewall Brigade pursued the Federals as they fell back, but soon found themselves beyond the Confederate line and without support. The Federals reformed and attacked, driving the 4th and 27th Virginia back. But the actions of the Stonewall Brigade gave the Confederate line time to reform and A.P Hill's troops to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fill the gaps from Winder's broken regiments. Jackson ordered Hill and Ewell to advance. He encountered Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch (a career politician) making a lengthy speech to his troops, and urged him to press forward. The Union right immediately collapsed. Ewell, having difficulty silencing his guns, was delayed, but the Union left began to waver at the sight of Crawford's retreat and were finally broken by a charge down Cedar Mountain by Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade.|$|E
500|$|Biden {{went on to}} {{duplicate}} other parts of Kinnock's speech, such as their forebears' ability {{to read and write}} poetry, their strength in working for hours underground in a mine only to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> play football afterward, and their being limited by lack of a [...] "platform" [...] upon which to stand.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for Chicago Music Magazine, Chloë Agnew described the lyrics of the song as [...] "really incredible". She stated that [...] "It is a songs that I listen to and wish I had written. It’s really so special. I {{think a lot of}} people have found strength and hope in the lyrics. It's been really rewarding to meet and talk to people at our meet and greet events <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> tell me how much that song means to them and how it has helped them". Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E
500|$|Yamamoto felt {{deception}} {{would be}} required to lure the U.S. fleet into a fatally compromised situation. To this end, he dispersed his forces so that their full extent (particularly his battleships) would be concealed from the Americans prior to battle. Critically, Yamamoto's supporting battleships and cruisers trailed Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's carrier force by several hundred miles. They were intended to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> destroy whatever elements of the U.S. fleet might come to Midway's defense once Nagumo's carriers had weakened them sufficiently for a daylight gun battle;. (This tactic was typical of the battle doctrine of most major navies at the time.) ...|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{resistance}} Zayas's men, possibly the best {{troops in the}} Spanish army at the time, were being slowly forced back. However, they held long enough for Ballesteros and Lardizabal to <b>come</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> for Stewart's 2nd Division to advance to their support. [...] Stewart brought John Colborne's 1st Brigade up, followed by the Division's two other brigades. The 3rd Regiment of Foot (the Buffs) took the lead, followed by the 48th and the 66th. Colborne's brigade formed up on the French left, and supported by a battery of KGL cannon the British opened fire, forcing Girard's two flanking battalions to face outwards in order to return fire.|$|E
