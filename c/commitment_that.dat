5|$|Re-formed at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, in July 1946, No.86 (Transport) Wing was {{assigned}} control of Nos.36, 37, and 38 Squadrons, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The wing was augmented by No.386 (Base) Squadron and No.486 (Maintenance) Squadron, formed in August. The Dakotas initially flew supply missions to the Australian-administered Territory of Papua and New Guinea, {{as well as}} three-times weekly courier flights to Japan {{in support of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The latter schedule continued until December 1947, when the service was taken over by Qantas Avro Lancastrians. No.37 Squadron disbanded in February 1948. In August that year, crews from Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons departed for Europe {{to take part in the}} Berlin Airlift, a <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> lasted almost a year. The Australians were responsible for delivering over 16million tons of supplies, and almost 8,000 passengers.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{how social}} Web services are {{held responsible for}} the actions they take at run time. Compared to (regular) Web services, social Web services perform different actions, for instance establishing and maintaining networks of contacts and forming with some privileged contacts strong and long lasting collaborative groups. Assessing these actions' outcomes, to avoid any violation, occurs through <b>commitments</b> <b>that</b> the social Web services are required to bind to. Two types of commitments are identified: social <b>commitments</b> <b>that</b> guarantee the proper use of the social networks in which the social Web services sign up, and business <b>commitments</b> <b>that</b> guarantee the proper development of composite Web services in response to users' requests. Detecting commitment violation and action prohibition using monitoring results in imposing sanctions on the “guilty” social Web services and taking corrective actions. A system for commitment management in terms of definition, binding, monitoring, and violation detection is also discussed in this paper. Zakaria Maamar, Noura Faci, Khouloud Boukadi, Quan Z.

25|$|Ironically, {{while the}} rule was {{intended}} to encourage star players to stay with their current teams, the first major move by an NBA team involving a player eligible for the DVPE was the Sacramento Kings' trade of DeMarcus Cousins to the New Orleans Pelicans during the 2017 All-Star break.

Politically, this was a little late in coming, but Washington had finally woken to the dire predicament it found itself embroiled in.

Hanoi had only sought an end to the air campaign against the north (Operation Rolling Thunder), but Johnson went one further by calling a halt to all northern operations, both overt and covert. This order effectively ended MACSOG's agent team, propaganda, and aerial operations.|$|E

25|$|District heating {{requires}} a long-term financial <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> fits poorly {{with a focus}} on short-term returns on investment. Benefits to the community include avoided costs of energy through the use of surplus and wasted heat energy, and reduced investment in individual household or building heating equipment. District heating networks, heat-only boiler stations, and cogeneration plants require high initial capital expenditure and financing. Only if considered as long-term investments will these translate into profitable operations for the owners of district heating systems, or combined heat and power plant operators. District heating is less attractive for areas with low population densities, as the investment per household is considerably higher. Also it is less attractive in areas of many small buildings; e.g. detached houses than in areas with a fewer larger buildings; e.g. blocks of flats, because each connection to a single-family house is quite expensive.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{negotiation}} process starts, {{people in a}} positive mood have more confidence, and higher tendencies to plan to use a cooperative strategy. During the negotiation, negotiators {{who are in a}} positive mood tend to enjoy the interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics and more cooperative strategies. This in turn increases the likelihood that parties will reach their instrumental goals, and enhance the ability to find integrative gains. Indeed, compared with negotiators with negative or natural affectivity, negotiators with positive affectivity reached more agreements and tended to honor those agreements more. Those favorable outcomes are due to better decision making processes, such as flexible thinking, creative problem solving, respect for others' perspectives, willingness to take risks and higher confidence. Post-negotiation positive affect has beneficial consequences as well. It increases satisfaction with achieved outcome and influences one's desire for future interactions. The PA aroused by reaching an agreement facilitates the dyadic relationship, which brings <b>commitment</b> <b>that</b> sets the stage for subsequent interactions. PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts perception of self performance, such that performance is judged to be relatively better than it actually is. Thus, studies involving self reports on achieved outcomes might be biased.|$|E
