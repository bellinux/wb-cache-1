5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> virus in dogs. Evidence of <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E
5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, <b>canine</b> <b>distemper,</b> infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|In <b>canines,</b> <b>distemper</b> impacts several body systems, {{including}} the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and {{the spinal cord}} and brain, with common symptoms that include high fever, eye inflammation and eye/nose discharge, labored breathing and coughing, vomiting and diarrhea, loss of appetite and lethargy, and hardening of nose and footpads. The viral infection can be accompanied by secondary bacterial infections and can present eventual serious neurological symptoms.|$|R
5000|$|Antibiotics {{are given}} to treat any {{bacterial}} infection present. Cough suppressants are used if the cough is not productive. NSAIDs are often given to reduce fever and upper respiratory inflammation. Prevention is by vaccinating for <b>canine</b> adenovirus, <b>distemper,</b> parainfluenza, and Bordetella. In kennels, the best prevention is to keep all the cages disinfected. In some cases, such as [...] "doggie daycares" [...] or nontraditional playcare-type boarding environments, it is usually not a cleaning or disinfecting issue, but rather an airborne issue, as the dogs are in contact with each other's saliva and breath. Although most kennels require proof of vaccination, the vaccination is not a fail-safe preventative. Just like human influenza, even after receiving the vaccination, a dog can still contract mutated strains or less severe cases.|$|R
40|$|Cetacean morbillivirus	 (CeMV) 	 has	 caused	 several {{epizootics}} {{in multiple}} species of cetaceans globally {{and is an}} emerging disease among cetaceans in Australia. We detected CeMV	 in	 2 	 stranded	 coastal	 Indo-Pacific	 bottle-nose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Western Australia. Preliminary phylogenetic data suggest that this virus variant is divergent from known strains. Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV; family Paramyxoviri-dae) has caused several epizootics globally during the past 25 years. Three strains of CeMV—porpoise, dolphin, and pilot whale morbillivirus—are classified as 1 species (1). CeMV is {{more closely related to}} ruminant morbillivi-ruses and human measles virus than to <b>canine</b> and phocine <b>distemper</b> viruses (1, 2).

5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of <b>canine</b> <b>distemper,</b> rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E
5|$|Some golden jackals carry {{diseases}} and parasites harmful to human health. These include rabies, and Donovan's Leishmania that is harmless to jackals but may cause leishmaniasis in people. Jackals in southwestern Tajikistan can carry up to 16 species of parasitic cestodes (flatworm), roundworms, and acanthocephalans (thorny-headed worms), these being: Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T.pisiformis, Taenia ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dracunculus medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with Dracunculus medinensis can infect {{bodies of water}} with their eggs, which cause dracunculiasis in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading coenurosis in sheep and cattle, and <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> in dogs. In Tajikistan, jackals carry at least 12 tick species (which include Ixodes, Rhipicephalus turanicus, R. leporis, R. rossicus, R. sanguineus, R. pumilio, R. schulzei, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. scupense and H. asiaticum), four flea species (Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla nesokiae, Ctenocephanlides canis and C. felis), and one species of louse (Trichodectes canis).|$|E
5|$|Various {{species of}} tick {{commonly}} infest the ears, neck and groin regions of most lions. Adult forms of {{several species of}} the tapeworm genus Taenia have been isolated from intestines, the lions having ingested larval forms from antelope meat. Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) in 1962; this resulted in lions becoming covered in bloody bare patches and emaciated. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many perished or emigrated as the population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions. Lions, especially in captivity, are vulnerable to the <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> virus (CDV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). CDV is spread through domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis. FIV, {{which is similar to}} HIV while not known to adversely affect lions, is worrisome enough in its effect in domestic cats that the Species Survival Plan recommends systematic testing in captive lions. It occurs with high to endemic frequency in several wild lion populations, but is mostly absent from Asiatic and Namibian lions.|$|E
40|$|Two {{independent}} cDNA clones, {{identified as}} representing the mRNA of the nucleocapsid protein gene of peste-des-petits-ruminants virus, were sequenced. The longest insert was 1662 nucleotides, {{not counting the}} poly(A) tail, and {{it was estimated that}} about 21 nucleotides were missing from the complete gene sequence. The sequence contained one long open reading frame encoding a protein of 525 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of 58008. Comparisons of the nucleic acid and protein sequences of all the morbillivirus nucleoproteins so far determined indicated two major subgroups in the morbillivirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae: one group included <b>canine</b> and phocine <b>distemper</b> viruses, and the other rinderpest, measles and peste-des-petits-ruminants viruses.

40|$|A border collie was {{evaluated}} by the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Ophthalmology Service because of a sudden onset of apparent complete loss of vision. Signalment: The border collie was a three year old 17 kg (37. 5 -lb) spayed female. History: The dog, which resided {{on a farm in}} upstate New York with 17 other border collies, had been obtained as a rescue approximately two years ago. In that time she had experienced no medical problems and had not traveled out of New York State. She had traveled to an area south of Albany (Saugerties) known to harbor Lyme disease (Borreliosis); her owner and three other dogs reportedly had been treated for Lyme disease recently. The dog's medical, travel and reproductive history prior to her acquisition by her present owner was unknown. She was up to date on vaccinations against rabies, <b>distemper,</b> <b>canine</b> adenovirus 2, parvovirus and panleukopenia. 	On the afternoon of presentation the dog was found by her owner to be exhibiting signs of acute vision loss. She was running into objects and was unable to catch treats thrown by her owner, a feat she had previously been able to accomplish. According to her owner, her pupils were dilated and she acted lethargic. Her owner therefore brought her immediately to the Ophthalmology Service of Cornell University...|$|R

25|$|Black-footed ferrets are {{susceptible}} to numerous diseases. They are fatally susceptible to <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> virus, introduced by striped skunks, common raccoons, red foxes, coyotes, and American badgers. A short-term vaccine for <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> is available for captive black-footed ferrets, but no protection is available for young born in the wild. Black-footed ferrets are also susceptible to rabies, tularemia, and human influenza. They can directly contract sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis), and epidemics in prairie dog towns may completely destroy the ferrets' prey base.|$|E
25|$|The lion {{population}} is also influenced {{to some extent}} by the takeover of prides by incoming males, which typically kill small cubs. The biggest influence, however, appears to be disease, particularly <b>canine</b> <b>distemper.</b>|$|E
25|$|Where rabies occurs, rabies {{vaccination}} of dogs may {{be required}} by law. Other canine vaccines include <b>canine</b> <b>distemper,</b> canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease, among others.|$|E
25|$|To prevent <b>canine</b> <b>distemper,</b> puppies {{should begin}} {{vaccination}} at {{six to eight}} weeks of age and then continue getting the “booster shot” every two to four weeks until they are 16 weeks of age. Without the full series of shots, the vaccination will not provide protection against the virus. Since puppies are typically sold at the age of eight to ten weeks, they typically receive the first shot while still with their breeder, but the new owner often does not finish the series. These dogs are not protected against the virus and so are susceptible to <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> infection, continuing the downward spiral that leads to outbreaks throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} {{recorded}} in stoats inhabiting the former Soviet Union and New Zealand. They are largely resistant to tularemia, but are reputed to suffer from <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> in captivity. Symptoms of mange have also been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Feline {{panleukopenia}} virus (FPV), {{more commonly}} known as feline distemper, {{is caused by the}} feline parvovirus, a close relative of canine parvovirus. It is not related to <b>canine</b> <b>distemper.</b> Panleukopenia is highly contagious and can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Canine</b> <b>distemper</b> (sometimes termed hardpad disease) is a {{viral disease}} that affects {{a wide variety}} of animal families, {{including}} domestic and wild species of dogs, coyotes, foxes, pandas, wolves, ferrets, skunks, raccoons, and large cats, as well as pinnipeds, some primates, {{and a variety of other}} species. It was long believed that animals in the family Felidae, including many species of large cat as well as domestic cats, were resistant to <b>canine</b> <b>distemper,</b> until some researchers reported the prevalence of CDV infection in large felids. It is now known that both large Felidae and domestic cats can be infected, usually through close housing with dogs or possibly blood transfusion from infected cats, but such infections appear to be self-limiting and largely without symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Rinderpest virus (RPV), {{a member}} of the genus Morbillivirus, is closely related to the measles and <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> viruses. Like other members of the Paramyxoviridae family, it {{produces}} enveloped virions, and is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The virus was particularly fragile and is quickly inactivated by heat, desiccation and sunlight.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} {{treatment for the}} <b>canine</b> <b>distemper.</b> As with measles, the treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The supportive care is geared towards treating fluid/electrolyte imbalances, neurological symptoms, and preventing any secondary bacterial infections. Examples include administering fluids, electrolyte solutions, analgesics, anticonvulsants, broad spectrum antibiotics, antipyretics, parenteral nutrition and nursing care.|$|E
25|$|Outbreaks of <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> {{continue}} to occur throughout the United States and elsewhere, and {{are caused by}} many factors. These factors include the overpopulation of dogs and the irresponsibility of pet owners. The overpopulation of dogs is a national problem that {{organizations such as the}} Humane Society and ASPCA face every day. This problem is even greater within areas such as Arizona, owing to the vast amount of rural land. An unaccountable number of strays that lack vaccinations reside in these areas and are therefore more susceptible to diseases such as <b>canine</b> <b>distemper.</b> These strays act as a host for the virus, spreading it throughout the surrounding area, including urban areas. Puppies and dogs that have not received their shots can then be infected if in a place where many dogs interact, such as a dog park.|$|E
25|$|Paramyxoviruses {{are also}} {{responsible}} {{for a range of}} diseases in other animal species, for example <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> virus (dogs), phocine distemper virus (seals), cetacean morbillivirus (dolphins and porpoises), Newcastle disease virus (birds), and rinderpest virus (cattle). Some paramyxoviruses such as the henipaviruses are zoonotic pathogens, occurring naturally in an animal host, but also able to infect humans.|$|E
25|$|Experimental data {{indicate}} that ribavirin may have useful activity against <b>canine</b> <b>distemper.</b> Ribavirin has also {{been used as a}} treatment for herpes simplex virus. One small study found that ribavirin treatment reduced the severity of herpes outbreaks and promoted recovery, as compared with placebo treatment. Another study found that ribavirin potentiated the antiviral effect of acyclovir.|$|E
25|$|Paramyxoviruses are {{a diverse}} family of non-segmented {{negative}} strand RNA viruses that include many highly pathogenic viruses affecting humans, animals, and birds. These include <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> virus (dogs), phocine distemper virus (seals), cetacean morbillivirus (dolphins and porpoises) Newcastle disease virus (birds) and rinderpest virus (cattle). Some paramyxoviruses {{such as the}} henipaviruses are zoonotic pathogens, occurring primarility in an animal hosts, but also able to infect humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Canine</b> <b>distemper</b> {{is caused}} by a {{single-stranded}} RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae (the same family of the viruses that causes measles, mumps, and bronchiolitis in humans). The disease is highly contagious via inhalation and fatal 50% of the time. Despite extensive vaccination in many regions, it remains a major disease of dogs, and was the leading cause of infectious disease death in dogs, prior to a vaccine becoming available.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> {{in the community}} has decreased dramatically due to the availability of vaccinations. However, the disease continues to spread among unvaccinated populations, {{such as those in}} animal shelters and pet stores. This provides a great threat to both the rural and urban communities throughout the United States, affecting both shelter and domestic canines. Despite the effectiveness of the vaccination, outbreaks of this disease continue to occur nationally. In April 2011, the Arizona Humane Society released a valley-wide pet health alert throughout Phoenix, Arizona.|$|E
25|$|The Ethiopian wolf is {{restricted}} to just six isolated mountaintop areas of the Ethiopian highlands. With a total world population of approximately 400 individuals, the Ethiopian wolf is the most endangered carnivore in Africa and most endangered canid in the world. As a result it is legally protected in the country from any activities that may threaten its survival. Habitat loss, caused by unsustainable and rapidly expanding cattle and crop farming is the most severe underlying threat, but diseases (rabies and <b>canine</b> <b>distemper)</b> transmitted from domestic dogs are a serious immediate threat and have recently caused population crashes in the Bale Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Long-term data {{imply that}} lions in the crater {{were struck by}} four deadly disease {{outbreaks}} between 1962 and 2002. Drought in 1961 and rains throughout the 1962 dry season caused a massive build-up of blood-sucking stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans) by May 1962. They drained blood and caused painful skin sores that became infected, causing lion numbers to crash from 75-100 to 12. The population recovered to around 100 by 1975 and remained stable until 1983, when a persistent decline began. Numbers have generally remained below 60 animals since 1993, reaching a low of 29 in 1998. In 2001, 34 percent of the lion population died between January and April {{from a combination of}} tick-borne disease and <b>canine</b> <b>distemper.</b>|$|E
25|$|The island fox, though {{considered}} a near-threatened species throughout the world, {{is becoming increasingly}} endangered in its endemic environment of the California Channel Islands. A population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resources like space, food and shelter. Island populations, therefore, are highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather. On the California Channel Islands, {{it was found that}} the population of the island fox was so low due to an outbreak of <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> virus from 1999 to 2000 as well as predation by non-native golden eagles. Since 1993, the eagles have caused the population to decline by as much as 95%. Because of the low number of foxes, the population went through an Allee effect; this is where at low enough densities, an individual's fitness decreases. Conservationists, therefore, had to take healthy breeding pairs out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until they had enough foxes to release back into the wild. Nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plants would be able to grow back to their natural height, thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the foxes against golden eagles.|$|E
25|$|Bale Mountains National Park {{is faced}} with many threats {{associated}} with an ever developing and an increasingly populated Ethiopia. One of the biggest threats to the park is grazing. For example, within the Web Valley, a prime Ethiopian wolf habitat, cattle density is estimated at 250 per square kilometer. Other threats include increasing settlements within the park. Currently over 40,000 people live within the park’s boundaries, increasing pressure on the natural resources of the area and diminishing natural habitats of wild animals. With these settlements come domestic dogs, which pose a great threat to the Ethiopian wolf. Dogs transmit rabies and <b>canine</b> <b>distemper,</b> and in 2010 killed 106 individuals (approximately 40% of the Bale population). Other serious threats {{include the use of}} the wolf habitat by livestock for grazing which significantly reduces the availability of rodent prey. Over 12 million people, their livestock and the environment in the south of Ethiopia as well as neighboring Somalia and northern Kenya rely on the water that originates from the Bale massif. Unsustainable use and pollution are major threats. Conservationists suggest that if conservation efforts in the Bale Mountains are not successful and people continue to exploit the resources in an unsustainable way, more species of mammal would go extinct than any other area of equivalent size on the planet.|$|E
25|$|For a time, the {{black-footed ferret}} was {{harvested}} for the fur trade, with the American Fur Company having received 86 ferret skins from Pratt, Chouteau, and Company of St. Louis {{in the late}} 1830s. During {{the early years of}} predator control, black-footed ferret carcasses were likely discarded, as their fur was of low value. This likely continued after the passing of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, for fear of reprisals. The large drop in black-footed ferret numbers began during the 1800s through to the 1900s, as prairie dog numbers declined because of control programs and the conversion of prairies to croplands. Sylvatic plague, a disease caused by Yersinia pestis introduced into North America, also contributed to the prairie dog die-off, though ferret numbers declined proportionately more than their prey, thus indicating other factors may have been responsible. Plague was first detected in South Dakota in a coyote in 2004, and then in ~50,000 acres of prairie dogs on Pine Ridge Reservation in 2005. Thereafter 7,000 acres of prairie dog colonies were treated with insecticide (DeltaDust) and 1,000 acres of black-footed ferret habitat were prophylactically dusted in Conata Basin in 2006–2007. Nevertheless, plague was proven in ferrets in May 2008. Since then each year 12,000 acres of their Conata Basin habitat is dusted and about 50–150 ferrets are immunized with plague vaccine. Inbreeding depression may have also contributed, as studies on black-footed ferrets from Meeteetse, Wyoming revealed low levels of genetic variation. <b>Canine</b> <b>distemper</b> devastated the Meeteetse ferret population in 1985. A live virus vaccine originally made for domestic ferrets killed large numbers of black-footed ferrets, thus indicating that the species is especially susceptible to distemper.|$|E
500|$|Viral {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include rabies, <b>canine</b> <b>distemper,</b> canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, papillomatosis, and canine coronavirus. Wolves {{are a major}} host for rabies in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and India. In wolves, the incubation period is 8–21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to [...] a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, with most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> is lethal in dogs, {{it has not been}} recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and endotoxic shock or sepsis, is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely doesn't cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviors. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, with infections being most prevalent in winter months.|$|E
500|$|Measles {{is an old}} disease, but it was {{not until}} the 10th century that the Persian {{physician}} Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (865–925) – known as [...] "Rhazes" [...] – first identified it. Rhazes used the Arabic name hasbah for measles. It has had many other names including rubeola from the Latin word rubeus, [...] "red", and morbilli, [...] "small plague". The close similarities between measles virus, <b>canine</b> <b>distemper</b> virus and [...] rinderpest virus have given rise to speculation that measles was first transmitted to humans from domesticated dogs or cattle. The measles virus appears to have fully diverged from the then-widespread rinderpest virus by the 12th century.|$|E
500|$|The fossa {{has been}} {{assessed}} as [...] "Vulnerable" [...] by the IUCN Red List since 2008, as its population size has probably declined {{by at least}} 30percent between 1987 and 2008; previous assessments have included [...] "Endangered" [...] (2000) and [...] "Insufficiently Known" [...] (1988, 1990, 1994). The species is dependent on forest and thus threatened by the widespread destruction of Madagascar's native forest but is also able to persist in disturbed areas. A suite of microsatellite markers (short segments of DNA that have a repeated sequence) {{have been developed to}} help aid in studies of genetic health and population dynamics of both captive and wild fossas. Several pathogens have been isolated from the fossa, some of which, such as anthrax and <b>canine</b> <b>distemper,</b> are thought to have been transmitted by feral dogs or cats.
