They {{are required to}} take GCSEs in English, mathematics and science, alongside two option blocks, plus either a modern foreign language or a vocational course. English Language is taught in Year 10 and Literature the following year. Mathematics in taken by all pupils; they may opt-in for a GCSE in Statistics in Year 10, and the most able pupils may take Further Maths at GCSE in Year 11. Science courses are based on ability; pupils may study for three separate science qualifications, a dual or single award in Science or BTEC Applied Science. pupils may choose a modern foreign language (French, Spanish or German), a humanity (history or geography), computing or separate sciences (biology, chemistry and physics) for their options as part of the English Baccalaureate. Additionally, the school offers six technology courses at GCSE (electronics, food technology, graphics, product design, resistant materials and textiles), as well as art and design, drama, music, PE, RE and child development GCSE qualifications. Vocational courses are also offered at Level 2, including applied business, <b>construction,</b> <b>engineering,</b> health and social care, ICT, music, performing arts, and travel and tourism.

25|$|In general, civil {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the overall interface of human created fixed projects with the greater world. General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, pavement, water supply, sewer service, dams, electric and communications supply. General {{civil engineering}} is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with stakeholders, and preparing construction plans. Civil engineers apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and <b>construction</b> <b>engineering</b> to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.|$|E

25|$|As a discipline, project {{management}} developed from several fields of application including civil <b>construction,</b> <b>engineering,</b> and heavy defense activity. Two forefathers of {{project management}} are Henry Gantt, called {{the father of}} planning and control techniques, who is famous for {{his use of the}} Gantt chart as a project management tool (alternatively Harmonogram first proposed by Karol Adamiecki); and Henri Fayol for his creation of the five management functions that form the foundation of the body of knowledge associated with project and program management. Both Gantt and Fayol were students of Frederick Winslow Taylor's theories of scientific management. His work is the forerunner to modern project management tools including work breakdown structure (WBS) and resource allocation.|$|E

In an eventual competitive move, other Kellogg engineering interests were merged with Rust Engineering becoming Kellogg Rust, which itself became The Henley Group, and later Rust International before it became the Rust Division of what is today Washington Group International, a specialty contracting firm that competes directly with Halliburton worldwide. Washington Group International is the successor to the Morrison Knudsen civil engineering and contracting corporation, and is also the owner of Montana Rail Link.|$|E

The LTA also announced that construction on the Circle Line Stage 6 was to commence on late 2017. LTA also said that a joint venture - by China State <b>Construction</b> <b>Engineering</b> (The Singapore branch) and Nishimatsu Construction - won the contract to build the new Keppel MRT station and its associated tunnels.
