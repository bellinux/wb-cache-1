40|$|We have {{developed}} a continuous theory for grinding of solids in batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>mills</b> which includes only a few parameters, the values {{of which can be}} obtained directly from data on a laboratory scale batch mill. This allows an easy scale-up from a laboratory-scale batch mill to an industrial <b>continuous</b> <b>mill.</b> Furthermore, the analysis presented indicates that a characteristic material parameter, the "critical volume", plays an important role on the grinding process in general, and it is the only parameter which is affected by the additives. The performance of industrial mills is due to the influence that additives may have on the value of the critical volume...|$|R
50|$|Juice {{extraction}} by milling is {{the process}} of squeezing the juice from the cane under a set mills using high pressure between heavy iron rollers. Those mills can have from 3 up to 6 rolls; every set of mills are called tandem <b>mill</b> or <b>mill</b> <b>train.</b> For improve the milling extraction efficiency, imbibition water is added at each mill: Hot water is poured over the cane just before it enters the last mill in the <b>milling</b> <b>train</b> and is recirculated up to the reach the first mill. The juice squeezed from this cane is low in sugar concentration and is pumped to the preceding mill and poured onto the cane just before it enters the rollers, the juice from this mill is the same way pumped back up the <b>milling</b> <b>train.</b> Mixed juice (that is to say cane juice mixed with the water introduced at the last mill) is withdrawn from the first and second mills and is sent for further processing. <b>Milling</b> <b>trains</b> typically have four, five or six mills in the tandem. For improve the milling extraction performance before the cane reach the first mill, normally are used knife and shredder as preparation equipments.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the main <b>milling</b> <b>train</b> management tasks necessary for maintaining good extraction performance through a season. The main activities discussed are making week by week decisions about shredder and mill setting adjustments, and selecting preseason mill settings. To maintain satisfactory <b>milling</b> <b>train</b> extraction performance, the main factors affecting extraction should be examined: cane preparation with pol in open cells or shredder torque, delivery nip compaction through the load or torque controller outputs such as roll lift, feed chute flap position or pressure feeder to mill speed ratio, and added water rate.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} recent updates to a <b>milling</b> <b>train</b> extraction {{model used}} to assess and predict {{the performance of a}} <b>milling</b> <b>train.</b> An extension was made to the milling unit model for the bagasse mills to replace the imbibition coefficient with crushing factor and mixing efficiency. New empirical relationships for reabsorption factor, imbibition coefficient, crushing factor, mixing efficiency and purity ratio were developed. The new empirical relationships were tested against factory measurements and previous model predictions. The updated model has been implemented in the SysCAD process modelling software. New additions to the model implementation include: a shredder model to assess or predict cane preparation, mill and shredder drives for power consumption and an updated imbibition control system to add allow water to be added to intermediate mills...|$|R

40|$|Process {{modelling}} is {{an integral}} part of any process industry. Several sugar factory models have been developed over the years to simulate the unit operations. An enhanced and comprehensive milling process simulation model has been developed to analyse the performance of the <b>milling</b> <b>train</b> and to assess the impact of changes and advanced control options for improved operational efficiency. The developed model is incorporated in a proprietary software package ‘SysCAD’. As an example, the milling process model has been used to predict a significant loss of extraction by returning the cush from the juice screen before # 3 mill instead of before # 2 mill as is more commonly done. Further work is being undertaken to more accurately model extraction processes in a <b>milling</b> <b>train,</b> to examine extraction issues dynamically and to integrate the model into a whole factory model...|$|R
