6000|$|As soon as Julia {{returned}} to England he broke ground {{to his mother}} {{on the subject of}} her making the mistress of Broadwood understand that she and the girls now regarded their occupancy of that estate as absolutely over. He had already, several weeks before, picked a little at the arid tract of that indicated surrender, but in the interval the soil appeared to have formed again to a considerable thickness. It was disagreeable to him to call his parent's attention to the becoming course, and especially disagreeable to have to emphasise it and discuss it and perhaps clamour for it. He would have liked the whole business to be tacit--a little triumph of silent delicacy. But he found reasons to suspect that what in fact would be most tacit was Julia's certain endurance of any <b>chance</b> <b>failure</b> of that charm. Lady Agnes had a theory that they had virtually--"practically" [...] as she said--given up the place, so that there was no need of making a splash about it; but Nick discovered in the course of an exploration of Biddy's view more rigorous perhaps than any to which he had ever subjected her, that none of their property had been removed from the delightful house--none of the things (there were ever so many things) heavily planted there when their mother took possession. Lady Agnes was the proprietor of innumerable articles of furniture, relics and survivals of her former greatness, and moved about the world with a train of heterogeneous baggage; so that her quiet overflow into the spaciousness of Broadwood had had all the luxury of a final subsidence. What Nick had to propose to her now was a dreadful combination, a relapse into the conditions she most hated--seaside lodgings, bald storehouses in the Marylebone Road, little London rooms crammed with objects that caught the dirt and made them stuffy. He was afraid he should really finish her, and he himself was surprised in a degree at his insistence. He wouldn't have supposed he should have cared so much, but he found he did care intensely. He cared enough--it says everything--to explain to his mother that her retention of Broadwood would show [...] "practically" [...] (since that was her great word) for the violation of an agreement. Julia had given them the place on the understanding that he was to marry her, and once he was definitely not to marry her they had no right to keep the place. [...] "Yes, you make the mess and we pay the penalty!" [...] the poor lady flashed out; but this was the only overt protest she made--except indeed to contend that their withdrawal would be an act ungracious and offensive to Julia. She looked as she had looked during the months that succeeded his father's death, but she gave a general, a final grim assent to the proposition that, let their kinswoman take it as she would, their own duty was unmistakably clear.|$|E
5000|$|Failure, in Paul Auster's works, is {{not just}} the {{opposite}} of the happy ending. In Moon Palace and The Book of Illusions, it comes from the individual's uncertainty about the status of their own identity. The protagonists start a search for their own identity and reduce their life to the absolute minimum. From this zero point they gain new strength and start their new life, and they also are able to regain contact with their surroundings. A similar development may also be seen in City of Glass and The Music of <b>Chance.</b> <b>Failure</b> in this context is not the [...] "nothing", it is the beginning of something all new.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the influence of}} phonological context on the sound errors produced in narrative speech by a fluent aphasic subject, RWB. At {{the time of the}} study, RWB was a 56 year-old male diagnosed with Wernicke's aphasia {{as a result of a}} left temporo-parietal stroke two months earlier. The subject was asked to watch and relate a series of video-taped movie segments. From a total of 42 narrative samples, 93 sound errors were extracted for contextual analysis. Perseveratory or anticipatory contextual windows were defined for each error as the number of phonemes before or after the error within which a phoneme or group of phonemes corresponding to the error should occur by chance factors alone fifty percent of the time. Significantly more than half the errors had to have potential sources within perseveratory or anticipatory windows to establish context effects in RWB's corpus. RWB's errors had potential sources in anticipatory windows at about chance levels, while perseverations occurred less often than expected by <b>chance.</b> <b>Failure</b> to demonstrate significant context effects in RWB's sound error corpus suggests that the contextual interaction widely acknowledged to underlie nonaphasic errors may not be a significant cause of errors in all aphasic speakers. These findings have important implications for the relation between aphasic and nonaphasic language production systems...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a {{characterization of}} fatigue behavior of [0 /&plusmn; 45 / 90]s glass/epoxy laminate {{in terms of}} the following parameters: static properties; S-N relationship; reliability; effect of thickness variation; damage initiation and growth; temperature increase; secant modulus change; effect of preloading on residual modulus and strength; and effect of ply failure on compression buckling strength. Some of the findings are the following. The primary failure process responsible for up to about 106 cycles of fatigue life is the wear-out followed by the <b>chance</b> <b>failure.</b> Change of secant modulus {{can be used as a}} measure of damage extent. Preloading to a high level has negligible effect on the residual tensile strength when the fatigue stress is low. However, ply failure and partial delamination result in a moderate loss of compression buckling strength. SCOPE NIDIRECTIONAL CONTINUOUS fiber composites are known to be highly in-Usensitive to fatigue in the fiber direction. The excellent fatigue resistance can be easily understood if one notes that the load in unidirectional composites are mainly carried by fibers and also that fibers such as boron and graphite exhibit excellent resistance to fatigue. In actual applications composites are mostly used in the form of laminates. Because of difference in orientation. in each ply, some plies are weaker in the loading direction than the others and fail early before the final fracture [1, 2, 3, 4]. Here ply failure is physically defined to be the appearance of micro-cracks within a ply. These cracks originate at locations of high stress concentration and low strength. In homogeneous materials a crack, once it is formed, rapidly grows leading to final fracture. In composites, however, even visible cracks do not lead to immediate fracture; rather, they may even grow in such a way as to relieve stress concentration on fibers. Further, since they occur throughout the volume of weak plies in a laminate, decrease of modulus may also result. J.

40|$|Abstract Successful {{education}} of marine engineering students could {{be provided with}} combination of theoretical classes, training on simulators and real training onboard training vessels. The most effective practical training is correction of <b>chance</b> <b>failures</b> after they occur within the real engine room. This paper is dealing with technological model for detection and correction of the main engine <b>chance</b> <b>failures</b> from the training vessel Nase More. Methods for measuring cylinder liners, pistons, crankshafts, main bearings and crank bearings are described together with forms for registration and analysis of all measured data. The {{second part of the}} paper is presenting results from the main engine tests that are proving right maintenance actions after measuring relevant parameters and diagnosing present working conditions of the main engine. Presented model is uniting theoretical knowledge gained in the classroom and practical training for the students, provided on the training vessel.
