500|$|In October 2006, Fox News {{entertainment}} reporter Roger Friedman {{said that}} Jackson had been recording at {{a studio in}} rural Westmeath, Ireland. It was not known at the time what Jackson was working on, or who had paid for the sessions, since his publicist had recently issued a statement claiming that he had left Two Seas. In November 2006, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and MSNBC reported that {{he was working on}} a new album, produced by will.i.am. Jackson performed at the World Music Awards in London on November 15, 2006, and accepted a Diamond Award for selling over [...] records. During his period in Ireland he sought Dr. Patrick Treacy for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> after reading about his experience with HLA fillers and his charitable work in Africa. Treacy became his only doctor when he lived in Ireland in 2006. He started as Jackson's personal dermatologist and developed a friendship with the singer. Jackson returned to the United States after Christmas 2006 to attend James Brown's funeral in Augusta, Georgia, where he gave one of the eulogies, saying that [...] "James Brown is my greatest inspiration." [...] In 2011, Treacy appeared on the Dr. Drew show on CNN and said that he had gave propofol to Michael Jackson on two occasions but the singer always requested an anaesthetist to be present.|$|E

50|$|Mesotherapy {{treatments}} {{have been}} performed throughout Europe, South America, and more recently the United States for over fifty years. However physicians have expressed concern over the efficacy of mesotherapy, arguing that the treatment hasn't been studied {{enough to make a}} determination.

5000|$|Individuals {{with gender}} {{dysphoria}} {{may or may}} not regard their own cross-gender feelings and behaviors as a disorder. Advantages and disadvantages exist to classifying gender dysphoria as a disorder. Because gender dysphoria had been classified as a disorder in medical texts (such as the previous DSM manual, the DSM-IV-TR, under the name [...] "gender identity disorder"), many insurance companies are willing to cover some of the expenses of sex reassignment therapy. Without the classification of gender dysphoria as a medical disorder, sex reassignment therapy may be viewed as <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment,</b> rather than medically necessary treatment, and may not be covered. In the United States, transgender people are less likely than others to have health insurance, and often face hostility and insensitivity from healthcare providers.|$|E
50|$|A synaptopathy is {{a disease}} of the brain, spinal cord or {{peripheral}} nervous system relating to the dysfunction of synapses. This can arise {{as a result of}} a mutation in a gene encoding a synaptic protein such as an ion channel, neurotransmitter receptor, or a protein involved in neurotransmitter release. It can also arise {{as a result of a}}n autoantibody targeting a synaptic protein. Synaptopathies caused by ion channel mutations are also known as synaptic channelopathies. An example is episodic ataxia. Myasthenia gravis is an example of an autoimmune synaptopathy. Some toxins also affect synaptic function. Tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin affect neurotransmitter release. Tetanus toxin can enter the body via a wound, and botulinum toxin can be ingested or administered therapeutically to alleviate dystonia or as <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{documentation}} of grape cures was first {{seen in a}} publication by V.N. Dmitriev called “Treatment With Grapes in Yalta on the Southern Crimean Shore” (1878). In the USSR, {{the principles of the}} grape cure were developed in the 1920s by a group of physicians of the Semashko Institute (Yalta), headed by A.V. D’iakov. Ampelotherapy continues to be offered in health clinics and spas, particularly in Europe, together with vinotherapy, a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> that involves rubbing grapes into the skin. Johanna Brandt, a South African doctor, popularized the grape diet as a treatment for cancer from 1925. She published about twenty pamphlets on the subject of natural remedies for health problems with her best-known publication being The Grape Cure, which {{is said to have been}} written after Brandt had cured herself of stomach cancer by following the diet. The book was republished in 1989 as How to Conquer Cancer, Naturally, including an endorsement of Brandt’s work by Benedict Lust, who is commonly referred to as [...] "the father of naturopathy". The book may have been inspired by Arnold Ehret, a contemporary, who taught a Grape Cure course.|$|E

40|$|The latest {{trend in}} the beauty {{industry}} is the growth of lower cost and short-term procedures like Botox, chemical peels, and laser skin rejuvenation, which outnumber severe plastic surgery. Anti-age treatments and Botox, in particular, {{have made it to}} the top of the most popular cosmetic procedures worldwide. In a neo-liberal economy, when an individual is evaluated through continuous self-improvement, body becomes a symbol of wealth and classed lifestyle. Within this cultural logic, heroic body work and investment in bodily capital are understood as self-improvement and work towards a better self. Russia has recently moved to the logic of global consumer capitalism introducing new classed symbolic hierarchies of body and gender. This research aims to analyze the use of anti-age <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> in the context of a new symbolic reordering of gender in capitalist Russia. The study draws on the analysis of interviews with Russian cosmetologists and clients undergoing anti-age <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> and ethnographic fieldwork in the beauty salons. Using the framework of ‘governmentality’, ‘body work’ and ‘emotion management’, I show how the global circulation of neo-liberal post-feminist values is domesticated in Russia through classed body practices. Anti-age <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> become a classed ‘technology of the self’, which transforms the self with the help of expert-cosmetologists in the expectation of life changes, higher life chances and improvement of status. Emotion work and emotion management become an important part of the project of self-governance. The meta-discourse of choice is the main trope in talking about one’s own decisions to undergo anti-age treatments, which presents new challenges for the feminist critique of such body practices...|$|R
