50|$|In version 4.0, {{the basic}} <b>message</b> <b>syntax</b> was {{switched}} over to XML. Further, {{the number of}} roundtrips necessary was reduced, allowing asynchronous communication (e.g. via SMTP) for simple transaction dialogues.|$|R

50|$|Syntax is {{concerned}} with the formalism used to represent a <b>message.</b> <b>Syntax</b> as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems. Syntax is devoted {{to the study of the}} form rather than the content of signs and sign-systems.|$|R
50|$|PAdES is {{complementary}} to {{two other}} standards for an implementation of electronic signatures through cryptographically secured digital signatures in compliance to the eIDAS regulation. Like PAdES, they are legally binding in the European Union and suited for applications {{that do not}} involve human-readable documents: <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Syntax</b> Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES) and XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES).The PAdES, CAdES and XAdES standards can be downloaded from the ETSI website ETSI download page.|$|E
5000|$|XML Signature is more {{flexible}} than {{other forms of}} digital signatures such as Pretty Good Privacy and <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Syntax,</b> {{because it does not}} operate on binary data, but on the XML Infoset, allowing to work on subsets of the data, having various ways to bind the signature and signed information, and perform transformations. Another core concept is canonicalization, that is to sign only the [...] "essence", eliminating meaningless differences like whitespace and line endings.|$|E
50|$|S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a {{standard}} for public key encryption and signing of MIME data. S/MIME is on an IETF standards track and defined {{in a number of}} documents, most importantly RFCs 3369, 3370, 3850 and 3851. It was originally developed by RSA Data Security Inc. and the original specification used the IETF MIME specification with the de facto industry standard PKCS#7 secure message format. Change control to S/MIME has since been vested in the IETF and the specification is now layered on <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Syntax,</b> an IETF specification that is identical in most respects with PKCS #7. S/MIME functionality is built into the majority of modern email software and interoperates between them.|$|E

40|$|Multiple Signatures in <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Syntax</b> (CMS) <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Syntax</b> (CMS) SignedData {{includes}} the SignerInfo structure to convey per-signer information. SignedData supports multiple signers and multiple signature algorithms per signer with multiple SignerInfo structures. If a signer attaches {{more than one}} SignerInfo, there are concerns that an attacker could perform a downgrade attack by removing the SignerInfo(s) with the ’strong’ algorithm(s). This document defines the multiple-signatures attribute, its generation rules, and its processing rules to allow signers to convey multiple SignerInfo objects while protecting against downgrade attacks. Additionally, this attribute may assist during periods of algorithm migration. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document.
