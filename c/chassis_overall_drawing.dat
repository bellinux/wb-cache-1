40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} a new {{modified}} processing route {{has been proposed}} for producing long cylindrical cups from 12 mm thick circular blanks of AISI 1020 steel (Aluminium (Al) -killed). In this route, flat blanks were made to preformed shape by stamping operation, followed by multistage deep drawing processes(without blank-holder and with inter-stage stress relief annealing) to increase cup depth. Wall ironing was also purposefully included in each draw step to reduce wall thickness and earing tendency on cup edges. Thus, evolution of wall thickness distribution, Drawability and Ironability, punch force history, and strain distribution profiles on outer cup surfaces were obtained as the effects of interaction between processes, tools and material. The <b>overall</b> <b>draw</b> stages showed: LDR 2. 06; <b>overall</b> <b>draw</b> reduction > 50 % with a drawing efficiency ~ 72 %; LIR 3. 55; overall ironing reduction > 70 % with an ironing efficiency ~ 68 %, which were achieved in the experimental works...|$|R

Cañizares made a two-foot (0.6 m) putt on the 18th green to win 1 up and give Europe a 14 - 10 lead, with four matches remaining on the course.

Juxtapoze is a clipart composition workflow that supports cre-ative expression and serendipitous discoveries in the shape domain. We achieve creative expression by supporting a workflow of searching, editing, and composing: the user queries the shape database using strokes, selects the desired search result, and finally modifies the selected image before composing it into the <b>overall</b> <b>drawing.</b> Serendipitous dis-covery of shapes is facilitated by allowing multiple explo-ration channels, such as doodles, shape filtering, and relaxed search.
