50|$|In 1988, the {{development}} agency adopted a development strategy which focussed upon economic development, {{the improvement of}} housing and {{the improvement of the}} environment. The Heartlands area was broken up into project areas. Government Estate Action funding was used to improve housing and to provide a mixture of tenures in the area which had been dominated mainly by council housing. The funding was provided in the project areas that had been specifically designated to be focussed upon housing. Areas closer to the city centre were given <b>commercial</b> <b>designations.</b> To prevent conflicts with city centre uses, the commercial areas in the Heartlands were targeted at a specific market. Aston Science Park, which had opened in 1983, was further developed and close to the science park, the Aston Waterlinks village was constructed. This was built using £6.2 million of government City Grant. The business village, located alongside the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, was constructed by Waterlinks plc, a company set up by four of the five board members, to provide jobs for 750 people.

40|$|The {{composition}} WC-(W,Cr) (2) C-Ni {{is one of}} {{the standard}} compositions used for the preparation of thermally sprayed coatings by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying. Surprisingly, this composition has been poorly investigated in the past. Frequent use of <b>commercial</b> <b>designations</b> WC-'CrC'-Ni, WC-Cr 3 C 2 -Ni, and WC-NiCr indicates the insufficient knowledge about the phase compositions of these powders and coatings. The properties of these coatings differ significantly from those of WC-Co and WC-CoCr coatings. In this paper, the results of different series of experiments conducted on HVOF-sprayed WC-(W,Cr) (2) C-Ni coatings are compiled and their specific benefits pointed out. The focus of this study is on the analysis of the microstructures and phase compositions of the feedstock powders and coatings. Unlike WC-Co and Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr, WC-(W,Cr) (2) C-Ni is not a simple binary hard phase-binder metal composite. The phase (W,Cr) (2) C with unknown physical and mechanical properties appears as a second hard phase, which is inhomogeneously distributed in the feedstock powders and coatings.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Weight {{assessment}} {{is a critical}} aid in patient care. It is particularly important in monitoring progression of pregnancies, heart failure status, and when adjusting medications. Although weight is generally determined using a scale, few studies have evaluated the precision of non-household scales. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess scale precision across a variety of settings. METHODS: An evaluation of scales from randomly selected primary care clinics (n= 30), diabetology/endocrinology clinics (n= 7), weight loss facilities (n= 25), and fitness centers (n= 30) was performed. Assessments were completed on a total of 223 scales: 94 from primary care clinics, 32 from diabetology/endocrinology clinics, 39 from weight loss centers, and 58 from fitness centers. Scales were assessed for condition, location in facility, resting surface, <b>commercial</b> <b>designation,</b> and calibration history. Scale precision was validated using 100 lb. (45. 5 kg), 150 lb. (68. 3 kg), 200 lb. (90. 9 kg), and 250 lb. (113. 6 kg) certified weights. RESULTS: Overall, scales demonstrated decreased precision with increased weight. At higher weights, more than 15 % of scales were off by more than 6 lbs. (2. 3 kg), approximately 1 Body Mass Index (BMI) unit. While facility type was not significant, condition, location in facility, resting surface, <b>commercial</b> <b>designation,</b> and calibration history were significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that many scales used to measure body weight are imprecise and that scales in health care settings are no more precise than those in other facilities. Clinical decisions based on scales that are imprecise have the potential to cause iatrogenic complications in patient care...|$|E

50|$|Industrial {{property}} takes a {{range of}} forms, these include patents for inventions, industrial designs (aesthetic creations related to the appearance of industrial products), trademarks, service marks, layout-designs of integrated circuits, <b>commercial</b> names and <b>designations,</b> geographical indications and protection against unfair competition. In some cases, aspects of an intellectual creation, although present, are less clearly defined. What counts then is that the object of industrial property consists of signs conveying information, in particular to consumers, regarding products and services offered on the market. Protection is directed against unauthorized use of such signs that could mislead consumers, and against misleading practices in general.|$|R

Protection generally means that the trade name of one company may not be used by another company, either as a trade name or a trade or service mark - and that a name or designation similar to the trade name may not be used by another company if it is likely to mislead the public.|$|R
40|$|Olive oil {{traceability}} {{remains a}} challenge nowadays. DNA analysis {{is the preferred}} approach to an effective varietal identification, without any environmental influence. Specifically, olive organelle genomics is the most promising approach for setting up a suitable set of markers as they would {{not interfere with the}} pollinator variety DNA traces. Unfortunately, plastid DNA (cpDNA) variation of the cultivated olive has been reported to be low. This feature could be a limitation for the use of cpDNA polymorphisms in forensic analyses or oil traceability, but rare cpDNA haplotypes may be useful as they can help to efficiently discriminate some varieties. Recently, the sequencing of olive plastid genomes has allowed the generation of novel markers. In this study, the performance of cpDNA markers on olive oil matrices, and their applicability on <b>commercial</b> Protected <b>Designation</b> of Origin (PDO) oils were assessed. By using a combination of nine plastid loci (including multi-state microsatellites and short indels), it is possible to fingerprint six haplotypes (in 17 Spanish olive varieties), which can discriminate high-value commercialized cultivars with PDO. In particular, a rare haplotype was detected in genotypes used to produce a regional high-value commercial oil.

40|$|Considering that seafood mislabeling {{has been}} widely {{reported}} throughout {{the world and that}} the authentication of food components {{is one of the key}} issues in food safety, quality and sustainability, the aim of this study was to use DNA barcoding to investigate the prevalence of mislabeling among fish fillet products from markets and supermarkets located in Apulia (SE Italy). The study reveals a high degree of species mislabeling in fish fillet products. In particular, this study shows that the labels of only 32 / 200 fish fillet samples provided comprehensive information relating to <b>commercial</b> <b>designation,</b> scientific name, geographical area, production method and whether previously frozen. The labeling of other samples was not compliant with European legislation. Indeed, the scientific name, which must also be indicated from 1 st January 2012, according to Article 68 of EU Commission Implementing Regulation No. 404 / 2011, was missing in 157 / 168 samples, the geographical area was missing in 152 / 168, while the <b>commercial</b> <b>designation</b> and the production method were reported in all samples. Furthermore, results from molecular investigations reveal a high occurrence of incorrect species declaration in fish fillet products. The commercial and/or scientific name declared failed to match the species identified in 164 / 200 (82 %) samples. The study also highlighted that threatened, Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) and Critically Endangered (CR) species considered to be facing a high risk of extinction has been used in the place of commercial species. This study thus provides further evidence of the need for increased traceability and assessment of food product authenticity. Additionally, traceability may improve the management of hazards related to fish safety, as well as guaranteeing product authenticity, providing reliable information to customers, enhancing supply-side management and improving product quality and sustainability...|$|E

The term “industrial minerals ” includes nonmetallic minerals such as limestone, clays, cement (portland and masonry), dimension stone, and aggregates. Although aggregate is not a mineralogical definition, it is a <b>commercial</b> <b>designation</b> for a group of mineral products that include industrial sand and gravel, construction sand and gravel, and crushed stone. California—Value of Nonfuel Mineral Production In 1997 California was the third leading state in the Nation in total nonfuel mineral production value.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results from an experimental analy-sis aiming at the characterization of the behaviour of a new feature steel bolted joint, that is not yet considered in Eurocode 3. The referred joint is I Beam – SHS Column using an innovative fasten-ing solution with the <b>commercial</b> <b>designation</b> of hollo-bolt. This kind of device is a pre-assembled unit that allows fixing and fastening when access is possible from one side only. This is particularly useful for nodes in which the column is a hollow profile, which has recently become an increas-ingly popular design solution. The test programme is currently being undertaken at the Civil Engi-neering Department of the University of Coimbra and encompasses 17 tests, accounting for exter-nal, corner and internal façade node configurations, flush and extended end-plate type, on full scale prototypes. Some preliminary isolated hollo-bolt tests were also performed in order to fully charac-terize its behaviour when subjected to tension and shear. The results are presented in terms of char-acterization of initial stiffness and resistance for each configuration. A comparison is established, for the referred parameters, between nodes with the same typology. Some preliminary conclusions concerning the main parameters and phenomena influencing the behaviour of the new feature joints are presented and discussed. Three main phenomena are in evidence: i) membrane behaviour re-sponse of the tubular column wall; ii) influence of hollo-bolts on the column holes area yielding; iii) three-dimensional effect when an orthogonal cantilever beam is added. ...|$|E

When examining pine nuts (which belong to the category of indehiscent fruit according to the <b>commercial</b> <b>designation</b> for nuts and kernels), food control authorities and the European Federation of the Trade in dried fruits, edible nuts, preserved food, spices, honey and similar foodstuffs (FRUCOM) detected elevated levels of cadmium. All samples exceeded the maximum level of 0. 05 mg cadmium per kilogram laid down by the European Commission. Dietary cadmium can cause kidney damage in humans. Against this backdrop the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) examined whether the consumption of pine nuts could constitute a health risk for consumers. Based on its exposure assessment the Institute comes {{to the conclusion that}} there is no risk to consumers arising from current eating habits. Cadmium is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth’s crust and is also introduced by humans into the environment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) stipulates the value of 0. 007 milligram per kilogram body weight as the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of cadmium that can be taken in daily over a lifetime without any health risk. For an adult weighing 60 kg this means a PTWI of 0. 42 mg. Less than one percent of the population in Germany eat pine nuts. This means that these oil seeds rank amongst rarely eaten foods.

In downtown Moscow, the highway intersects with PA435 (Main Street) and turns south onto a concurrency on South Main Street. Paralleling the tracks of the Delaware–Lackawanna Railroad, PA690 soon splits off under the tracks. Turning northward after the underpass, PA690 heads northward on Market Street, passing the former Moscow train station. The stretch along Market Street is mainly <b>commercial,</b> before the <b>designation</b> turns off Market at the intersection with Brook Street. Along Brook Street, the route {{is primarily}} residential. Before crossing the borough line, PA690 remains known as Brook Street, but after the borough line, the route becomes woodlands. Soon changing names to Madisonville Road, PA690 passes a residential complex and enters Madisonville, a rural hamlet. After the intersection with Reservoir Road, the highway turns from the northeast and curves into the hamlet of Aberdeen.|$|R
