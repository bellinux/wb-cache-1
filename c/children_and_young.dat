5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people with epilepsy, {{as well as}} six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and {{only one of the}} trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E
