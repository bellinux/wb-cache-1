40|$|<b>Cymiazole</b> {{hydrochloride}} is {{the active}} ingredient of a synthetic systemically acting acaricide used in beekeeping (Apitol®, Apichem®). Considering that residues of <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride were detected in all bee products being used for human nutrition and as alternative medications in human and veterinary medicine, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride on mitotic activity of cultured human lymphocytes. The mitotic and proliferation indices in phytohaemagglutinin-activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined using three experimental concentrations of <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride (0. 01; 0. 1; 1 mg/ml). All experimental concentrations of <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride increased mitotic index values (MI) by a statistically highly significant amount (p< 0. 001). Moreover, proliferation index (PI) was also changed very significantly (p< 0. 001) after each experimental <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride treatment. The dose dependent increase in proliferation index values clearly demonstrates the ability of <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride to induce significant alterations of cell cycle kinetics having an influence on G 0 state and arousing cell division. This indicates a risk from consuming bee products with <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride residues particularly in those predisposed to malignant diseases. Strict respect to the withrawal time while using <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride (Apitol®, Apichem®) is of great importance because residue levels higher than the permitted one can easily occur in honey and other bee products from treated honey bee colonies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cymiazole</b> {{hydrochloride}} is {{the active}} {{component of the}} acaricides Apitol® and Apichem®, which are used as varroacides in beekeeping. Considering that residues of <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride were detected in all bee products being used for human nutrition and as alternative medications in human and veterinary medicine, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the ability of this substance to produce genotoxic effects in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The genotoxic effects were studied by sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test in vitro. The results obtained for all doses applied to the cultures (0. 01; 0. 10 and 1 mg/ml) showed very significant increases in frequencies (p< 0. 001) of SCEs in comparison to the negative control, i. e. <b>cymiazole</b> hydrochloride exhibited genotoxic properties...|$|E
