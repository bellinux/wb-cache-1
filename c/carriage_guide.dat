40|$|DE 10128184 A UPAB: 20030218 NOVELTY - The device has {{positioning}} units (1, 2) with {{at least}} one support rail (7, 8), several carriers (3 - 6) for the rails, and at least one guide unit (9, 10). Each carrier has several <b>guide</b> <b>carriages</b> (11 - 18) moving independently along the guide unit. At least one <b>guide</b> <b>carriage</b> of each carrier unit is connected to a drive unit. Each support rail is also connected to a drive unit, and each of this is connected to a console (19 - 22) on a carrier.

40|$|A {{new model}} to {{estimate}} all friction losses between the balls and the circular-arch grooves races (two contact points) from <b>carriage</b> and <b>guide</b> in a linear rolling guidance {{system has been}} developed. Based on the equilibrium of the forces and moments acting on the ball, the sliding forces between ball and both <b>carriage</b> and <b>guide</b> are determined without an integrating of the shear stress on contact ellipses. The sliding forces include the rolling forces on the two contacts, the friction moments due to the races curvature, the elastic resistance moments in ball-races contacts, the contact force between the balls and the friction moment between the balls. The program was adapted for the linear ball rolling guidance system type KUVE 25 V 1 and the influences of ratio C/P (where C is the basic dynamic load rating and P is equivalent dynamic load) on total friction forces was investigated. A global friction coefficient in the linear system was computed and good agreement with the catalogue values was obtained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} two control {{approaches for}} a linear axis with pneumatic muscles. Its <b>guided</b> <b>carriage</b> {{is driven by}} a nonlinear drive system consisting of two pulley tackles with pneumatic muscle actuators arranged at both sides. This innovative drive concept allows for an increased workspace as well as higher carriage velocities as compared to a direct actuation. Both proposed control schemes have a cascaded structure, where the control design is based on backstepping techniques. Hysteresis in the force characteristic of the pneumatic muscles is considered by an asymmetric shifted Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, while remaining uncertainties are compensated using an adaptive backstepping strategy. The main difference between both approaches is the usage of either the internal muscle pressures or the muscle forces as controlled variables of the inner control loops. Both control approaches have been implemented on a test-rig and show an excellent closed-loop performance...|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section H of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE The apparatus and procedure for obtaining coefficient of friction values of bituminous and portland cement concrete pavements and bridge decks using a portable skid tester are described in this test method. B. APPARATUS 1. Skid testing unit A 2 -ply tire (200 mm rim height, 95 mm rim width, 425 mm tire height and a maximum overall tire width from 100 to 120 mm) with 170 ± 15 kPa air pressure manufactured with a smooth tread, together with rim, axle, and driving pulley, is mounted to a rigid frame. The tire is brought to the required test speed by a motor. A carriage moves on two parallel guides. Friction is reduced to a low uniform value with three roller bearings fitted at 120 ˚ points to bear against the guide rod at each corner of the <b>carriage.</b> Two <b>guide</b> rods are rigidly connected to the end frame bars. The front end of the guide bar frame assembly is firmly fastened to a bumper hitch to restrain forward movement. The bumper hitch provides for swinging the skid tester to the right or left after positioning the vehicle. The rear end of the frame assembly is raised by an adjustable knob to hold the tire 6 mm above the surface to be tested. This device is constructed so that the tire may be dropped instantaneously to the test surface by tripping the release arm. A tachometer indicates the speed of the tire in kilometers per hour. The springs are calibrated by procedures outlined i...|$|R
40|$|Log {{extraction}} in undulating forest areas needs special attention. Forest Products Research Centre {{has made}} improvement on P 3 HH 20 skyline system designed for extracting log on undulating area. The equipment {{consists of three}} main parts such as power machine unit, wire rope and its auxillary and <b>carriage</b> intended to <b>guide</b> log movement. At the first time, {{the capacity of the}} equipment was only 0. 308 m 3 /round trip. In 1998, the equipment was improved and then in 1999 was tried to extract logs in forest plantation of PT Inhutani II. Pulau Laut. South Kalimantan. The choice of the location was done purposively. The objective is to prove whether the impoved P 3 HH 20 skyline system is suitable for extracting log in plantation forest area having undulating terrain. The research results showed that: 1. The use of improved P 3 HH 20 skyline cable system for log extraction in plantation forest Pulau Laut provides promising suitability with still relatively low productivity, 2. log diameter extracted ranged from 17 to 43 cm with an average of 23 cm while log length extracted ranged from 8 m to 12 m with an average of 11 m. 3. log volume extracted varied from 0. 026 to 0. 309 m 3 /round trip with an average of 0. 160 m 3 /round trip. 4. Effective log extraction productivities ranged from 1. 404 to 2. 810 m 3 (hour with an average of 1. 980 m 3 /hour while the total log extraction productivities varied from 0. 485 to 1. 080 m 3 /hour with an average of 0. 885 m/hour. 5. The average of log extraction cost was Rp 23. 572 /m 3. 6.
