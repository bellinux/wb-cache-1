5|$|Immediately {{following}} the final, Hamm <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> locker room from severe hydration. She was treated by medical staff with an intravenous drip and three liters of fluids. After 12 hours of sleep, {{she joined the}} team for magazine cover shoots, went to Disneyland for a celebration rally, and made numerous television appearances. A week later, the team met President Clinton at the White House and flew with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton on Air Force One to Cape Canaveral. Her leadership and performance at the 1999 World Cup cemented Hamm as a soccer icon.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{at the age}} of 53, {{one week}} and four days before his 54th birthday, Pennock <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel {{as a result of a}} {{cerebral}} hemorrhage.

5|$|The Byzantine Empire's {{military}} {{position in}} the Balkans <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 7th century {{as a result of}} disastrous military ventures against the Persians and then the Arabs in the East, which forced the effective abandonment of the Danube limes and opened the way for large-scale penetration and settlement of the Balkan hinterland by various Slavic tribes. The Slavs raided as far as southern Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. Most of the region's cities were sacked or abandoned and only a few, including Thessalonica, remained occupied and in imperial hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene of}} the crime which took place along Bathurst Gardens showed the course of events of the violent confrontation. Pryce's book and gloves were lying outside No 56, a silver Audi car was smeared with blood outside No 82 and a list of wedding venues outside 84. Pryce was found <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gutter between parked cars outside No 90.|$|E
5|$|These {{industries}} <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{aftermath of}} World War II {{due to the}} failure to introduce mechanisation, although the automated Chilton Tile Factory, which produced up to 5 million tiles each year, lasted until 1968.

5|$|While {{studying}} in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light. In April 1962, he <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of an}} art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed various checks, but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. On 10 April 1962, {{he was taken to}} the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later revealed to have been an aneurysm in his brain's right hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had <b>collapsed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fate}} of the Finns was decided outside Finland in Saint Petersburg on 15 March 1917, it was decided outside Finland again on 11 November 1918, in Berlin, after Germany {{accepted}} defeat in World War I. The German Empire <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German Revolution of 1918-19, caused by lack of food, war-weariness and defeat in the battles on the Western Front. Rüdiger von der Goltz and his squad left Helsinki on 16 December, and Prince Friedrich Karl, who had not yet been crowned, left his post on 20 December. Finland's status altered from a monarchist protectorate of the German Empire to an independent democratic republic, with a modernizing civil society. The system of government, the primary Constitution of Finland, was confirmed on 17 July 1919.|$|E

5|$|During its {{formative}} stages, Hellen meandered around northern Mozambique {{and produced}} prolonged heavy rains over the region. The city of Pemba in Cabo Delgado Province {{was the hardest}} hit area, with the Messalo River over-topping its banks. Tagir Carimo, mayor of Pemba, described the rains as the heaviest {{he had seen in}} 20years. More than 100poorly constructed homes <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floods while severe erosion exposed and destroyed water pipes. A major bridge connecting Pemba to surrounding areas was washed away by the Messalo river. This isolated the northern portion of Cabo Delgado Province {{from the rest of the}} country, forcing ferries to transport cars. Three people died in the district of Cariaco when their home collapsed while a fourth drowned in Chiuba. Distributing assistance following the storm was disrupted by damaged roads.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall. Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64, having top-scored in both innings, to leave England at 153/4. Thereafter, England <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fading light, prompting the umpires to call off play. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E
5|$|Further north, minor {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Jalisco. Statewide, four people were killed. A 26-year-old man died after being swept away by {{in the village of}} Juanacatlan while a 12-year-old boy drowned after falling in a dam in the municipality of Teocuitatlan de Corona. Another man perished when he drove his car into a ravine in Cuautitlan de Garcia Barragan. Fifteen hundred people were evacuated from their homes. Classes were briefly cancelled in 588schools, leaving over 40,000pupils home. Bridges <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jalisco towns of Zacoalco de Torres and Tamazula de Gordiano. The worst-hit areas in the state were the southern and coastal areas of the state, as well as the Guadalajara area, where flooding and landslides occurred in some neighborhoods.

5|$|Like {{most major}} cities, Montreal needs easy highway access from its suburbs and {{surrounding}} areas. However, because Montreal {{was built on}} an island surrounded by three rivers, it can be entered by land only on a bridge or through a tunnel. Although the city was founded in 1642, it was not before 1847 that the first fixed link to the outside was established when a wooden bridge was built across Rivière des Prairies to Île Jésus, {{on the site of}} what is now Ahuntsic Bridge. Another bridge was built immediately afterward, a few kilometers west, which became Lachapelle Bridge, and another in 1849, Pont des Saints-Anges, to the east. The latter bridge <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880s and was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} storms to strike Vietnam since 1944, Typhoon Hester caused considerable damage in the country and disrupted the Vietnam War. Making landfall directly over the United States military installation in Chu Lai, Hester damaged or destroyed 75percent of the structures in the base. Sustained winds and gusts in the base were estimated to have reached 130km/h (80mph) and 160km/h (105mph) respectively. Four hangars <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chu Lai airbase, with total aircraft losses amounting to 36 destroyed and 87 damaged. Losses from the destroyed helicopters exceeded $3.6million (1971USD). Dozens of barracks were damaged in Chu Lai and communications were hampered. The 91st Evacuation Hospital was mostly destroyed and was forced to transfer patients to Quy Nhơn. Nearly 50percent of the structures at the Marble Mountain Air Facility were damaged by the storm's high winds.|$|E
5|$|The German Army halted its offensives in July. The King's 11th Battalion disbanded in April, {{followed}} in May by the temporary {{consolidation of the}} Liverpool Pals as the 17th (Composite) Battalion. Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the U.S. 137th Regiment. In August, after four months {{of being on the}} defensive, the Allies launched an offensive against Amiens, in the Somme area. Meticulous preparation gave them the element of surprise when it began on the 8th. More than 16,000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly <b>collapsed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following Battle of Albert, begun on the 21st, the 13th King's suffered 274 casualties, but captured 150 soldiers and many machine-guns, while the 1st assisted in the taking of Ervillers.|$|E

5|$|The Salvation Army {{gave the}} castle to the Ministry of Works in 1948, {{and it is}} now owned by English Heritage, classed as a {{scheduled}} monument and a Grade I listed building. Subsidence and landslips have continued; the north-east tower largely <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, and further major slippages occurred in 1969, 1970, and 2002. One of the three-storey towers at the eastern side stands to nearly full height with narrow rectangular windows in the upper levels. The second tower has only about one-third of its original form. Some sections of the curtain wall have survived, as well as the foundations of the great hall, solars, and the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{population}} {{became more}} diverse {{after the end}} of World War II, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted thousands of workers. In the 1950s, the Latino population grew significantly; and by the 1970s, St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church and the First Spanish Baptist Church of Ohio were among the largest religious institutions for Spanish-speaking residents in the Youngstown metropolitan area. While diversity is among the community's enduring characteristics, the industrial economy that drew various groups to the area <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s. In response to subsequent challenges, the city has taken well-publicized steps to diversify economically, while building on some traditional strengths.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels followed. During an {{interview}} segment before the match, Orton attacked Michaels. Before the match began, Orton stood {{alone in the}} ring and declared himself the winner by forfeit. Michaels, however, appeared {{and came to the}} ring, although he showed signs of injury. Michaels came into the match with a legitimate knee injury. During the match, Orton tried to perform a superplex over the top turnbuckle, but Michaels used an eye rake and caused Orton to fall. Michaels followed up with a diving elbow drop and tried to execute Sweet Chin Music, but <b>collapsed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. The referee declared Orton the winner as a result. After the match, Orton attacked Michaels again, causing a kayfabe career-threatening concussion.|$|E
