5|$|The Australians {{were also}} {{experiencing}} their own supply problems. To {{enable them to}} mount a counter-attack, it was vital that they build up a stockpile of supplies in the forward areas. To reduce the burden placed on the native <b>carrier</b> <b>system</b> the Allies turned to aerial resupply, a technique that was still in its infancy. The loss of Kokoda had deprived them of a forward airfield, but to an extent this had been alleviated by {{the creation of a}} supply drop zone for US transport aircraft around the dry lake at Myola. These efforts, though, were hamstrung by deficiencies in the aerial resupply process and inexperience in its application. Only a few supplies were dropped by parachute, while the rest were just free-dropped. Inevitably some supplies fell away from their intended drop zones, while others were damaged due to inadequate packaging. Additionally, poor staff work and inattention resulted in fewer supplies being collected in the drop zone than Potts had been promised. This had the effect of slowing the arrival of the Australian reinforcements as they had to be held up and then committed piecemeal company by company, as adequate supplies could be brought forward to sustain them.|$|E
25|$|Folic acid used in {{fortified}} foods is {{a synthetic}} form called pteroylmonoglutamate. It {{is in its}} oxidized state and contains only one conjugated glutamate residue. Folic acid therefore enters via a different <b>carrier</b> <b>system</b> from naturally occurring folate, and this may have different effects on folate binding proteins and its transporters. Folic acid has a higher bioavailability than natural folates and are rapidly absorbed across the intestine; therefore, {{it is important to}} consider the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) when calculating one's intake. Natural occurring folate is equal to 1 DFE;, however, 0.6µg of folic acid is equal to 1 DFE.|$|E
25|$|Presented as the Annfield Plain Industrial Co-Operative Society Ltd, (but more {{commonly}} referred to as the Anfield Plain Co-op Store) this department store opened in 1984, and was relocated to Beamish from Annfield Plain. It represents the store element of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), formed in 1863 and having a presence in Annfield Plain since 1870. A two-storey building, the ground floor comprises the three departments - grocery, drapery and hardware; the upper floor is taken up by the tea rooms (accessed from Redman Park via a ramp to the rear). Most of the items are for display only, but a small amount of goods are sold to visitors. The store features an operational cash <b>carrier</b> <b>system,</b> of the Lamson-Paragon wooden ball design - common in many large stores of the era, but especially essential to Co-Ops, where customer's dividends had to be logged.|$|E

500|$|The {{treatment}} of the upper floors provides a striking contrast. 134,000 green, orange, lime and yellow glazed terracotta tiles cover the façades in 13 irregularly oriented vertical panels on the external perimeter. The façades facing the inner courtyard are lined with another eight panels covered with grey tiles, a design which project architect Maurits van der Staay says was intended to [...] "ensure that the upper storeys did not detract from the transparency of the ground floor and to maximise the amount of light reflected back into the offices." [...] The façades are hung on an internal chassis <b>carrier</b> <b>system</b> (a similar system is in use in another Piano development on Berlin's Potsdamer Platz). Pierced by rows of identical windows repeated across the entire development, the façades {{are expected to be}} effectively self-cleaning and immune to fading. The colours of the façades are evoked in the design of many of the development's interior fittings, such as lift-door reveals, handrails and lift displays. The tiles were produced in Germany by NBK of Emmerich am Rhein and mounted on prefabricated façade units in Wrocław, Poland, by Schneider Fassadenbau.|$|E
500|$|Following the landing, several minor skirmishes {{took place}} around Awala and Giruwa between the forward {{elements}} of the Japanese landing force– Yokoyama Force– and small groups of Australian and Papuan forces primarily from the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB). Brushing these aside, the Japanese began advancing steadily towards their objective on the southern coast. Meanwhile, the Australians, who had deployed only limited forces north of Port Moresby, attempted to delay the Japanese along the track long enough to bring reinforcements forward. The Australian reinforcement effort was hampered initially due to a shortage of essential combat supplies of food and ammunition in the forward areas, as well as limited port facilities, which slowed {{the transfer of the}} experienced Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) troops that had been withdrawn from the Middle East to Australia earlier in the year. As shipping and logistics resources became available in mid-August, the initial 2nd AIF troops moved to Port Moresby and Milne Bay, while US engineer and service units began arriving to conduct vital airfield and port development work, to help improve the effectiveness of Allied supply system. Nevertheless, a lack of supplies [...] forward of Port Moresby continued to limit the ability of the Allies to concentrate troops along the Kokoda Track throughout much of the campaign, as the native <b>carrier</b> <b>system</b> was stretched and aerial resupply [...] a technique that was still developing [...] was less effective than initially envisaged.|$|E

The analysis, design, and implementation of the DAR are covered in detail. Performance comparisons and mechanization tradeoffs are made, wherever possible, with discrete <b>carrier</b> <b>systems</b> and other suppressed <b>carrier</b> <b>systems</b> presently in use.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we first}} extend the {{convolution}} theory of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and introduce {{a structure of}} layered fast Fourier transform (FFT). Based on this framework, we propose novel asymmetric orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems that bridge general OFDM and single <b>carrier</b> <b>systems.</b> Adaptive to the capability of the transceiver, asymmetric OFDM systems provide significant flexibility in system design and operation. We show how effects of noise enhancement and frequency diversity counteract each other in asymmetric OFDM systems. Performance comparison with general OFDM and single <b>carrier</b> <b>systems</b> is also given. Index Terms—Fast Fourier transform (FFT), frequency diversity, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), peakto-average power ratio (PAPR). I...|$|R
