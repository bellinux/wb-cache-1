40|$|The risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) increases in post-menopausal women, yet, the role of exercise, as a preventative measure for CVD risk in post-menopausal women has not been adequately studied. Accordingly, we investigated the impact of voluntary <b>cage-wheel</b> exercise and forced treadmill exercise on cardiac adaptation in menopausal mice. The most commonly used inducible model for mimicking menopause in women is the ovariectomized (OVX) rodent. However, the OVX model has a few dissimilarities from menopause in humans. In this study, we administered 4 -vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) to female mice, which accelerates ovarian failure as an alternative menopause model to study the impact of exercise in menopausal mice. VCD selectively accelerates the loss of primary and primordial follicles resulting in an endocrine state that closely mimics the natural progression from pre- to peri- to post-menopause in humans. To determine the impact of exercise on exercise capacity and cardiac adaptation in VCD-treated female mice, two methods were used. First, we exposed a group of VCD-treated and untreated mice to a voluntary cage wheel. Second, we used forced treadmill exercise to determine exercise capacity in a separate group VCD-treated and untreated mice measured as a tolerance to exercise intensity and endurance...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{exercise}} {{during pregnancy}} {{has been shown}} to improve long-term metabolic health on offspring in later life. Mitochondria are the critical site of metabolism, and are inherited by maternal origin. However, the effects of maternal exercise during pregnancy on fetal mitochondrial biogenesis are not well understood. PURPOSE: To test whether maternal exercise can activate genes associate with mitochondrial biogenesis in the fetal heart. METHODS: Female C 57 BL/ 6 mice were divided into sedentary and exercise groups. The mice in the exercise group were exposed to voluntary <b>cage-wheel</b> from gestational day 1 through 17, at which time they were sacrificed. Litter size and individual fetal weights (3 days before birth) were taken when pregnant dams were sacrificed. All fetuses were sexed and two to three hearts from same sex within the group were pooled to study gene expression: all data were presented by group since there was no sex difference within group. RESULTS: Exercise dams ran an average of 7. 22 ± 0. 41 km/day until mid-pregnancy and gradually decreased to low levels (1. 39 ± 0. 43 km/day) through the remainder of gestation. Weight gain during pregnancy was not significantly different between exercise (14. 45 ± 0. 99 g) and sedentary (15. 99 ± 1. 13 g) pregnant dams. There {{were no significant differences in}} litter size, sex distribution, and average fetal body weight per litter between sedentary and exercise dams. Genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, including Ppargc 1 a (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha), Nrf 1 (nuclear respiratory factor- 1), and Nrf 2 (nuclear respiratory factor- 2) were significantly upregulated in fetuses from exercise dams. CONCLUSION: Although total kilometers run per day (km/day) were significantly decreased in later stage of pregnancy, maternal exercise initiated at day 1 of gestation significantly increased genes associated with mitochondria biogenesis, indicating that maternal exercise enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function...|$|E

These are also known as power tillers or walking tractors. Years ago they were considered only useful for rice growing areas, where they were fitted with steel <b>cage-wheels</b> for traction, but now the same are being used in both wetland and dryland farming all over the world. They have multiple functions with related tools for dryland or paddys, pumping, transportation, threshing, ditching, spraying pesticide. They can be used on hills, mountains, in greenhouses and orchards. Diesel designs are more popular in developing countries than gasoline.|$|R
