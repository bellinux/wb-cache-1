40|$|In Australia, {{all school}} {{teachers}} {{are required to}} have completed teacher education courses, usually four years of study, in higher education institutions. Teachers then gain certification or registration through an appropriate body in their home state or territory. The same body sets professional standards and accredits the teacher education courses. Till now these have been considered appropriate mechanisms for the preparation of quality Australian teachers. In the latest declaration of national goals of schooling, 1 the Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers signaled interest in involvement in teacher preservice education. The Commonwealth Government has launched a $ 50 m initiative to 'Improve Teacher Quality' including a 'National Teaching Professional Framework [to] provide nationally agreed and consistent requirements and principles to guide reform {{in the areas of}} teacher registration, accreditation of pre-service teacher education courses and accreditation of teachers at the graduate, competent, highly accomplished and lead teacher levels'. Recently, the Queensland Government has supported a recommendation by Dr Geoff Masters, the Director of ACER (Australia's largest test development organisation), that 'aspiring primary teachers be required to demonstrate through test performances, as a <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration,</b> that they meet threshold levels of knowledge about the teaching of literacy, numeracy and science and have sound levels of content knowledge in these areas', 2 with the Queensland College of Teaching to take responsibility for developing and administering such tests. Given the Commonwealth directions on school testing and the publication of the MySchools website with national test data, {{it is possible that the}} Commonwealth agenda to direct teacher preparation may align with the Queensland directions. Teacher competency tests are used in a number of states in the US, and have given rise to a number of legal issues. Such vocational testing requires a higher standard of test quality than testing children on basic competencies. This paper will examine both legal issues that have arisen in case law on teacher competency testing in the US and issues that have arisen in Australian case law in assessment and vocational assessment to prepare teachers, administrators and lawyers for such testing in Australia.

The <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the whistler wave packets by a remote on board VLF receiver have been analyzed; {{they depend on}} mutual disposition of the electron gun and the VLF receiver {{as well as on}} the pitch angle of the injected electrons. It is shown that the internal frequency width of the whistler signal, connected with the ray representation of a wave field, depends on the distance between the emitting region of the beam and the receiver and determines the lowest bandwidth of the VLF receiver in use. It is found that near the double pole singularity at the Gendrin's velocity the energy loss of a single electron increases by a factor of the order of ratio of the background electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency. The estimations for the coherence length of the beam and the ratio of coherent to incoherent level of radiated whistler amplitude are also presented.

The {{subject matter of the}} study is the current planning of objects survey on the underlying surface in order to increase the effectiveness of sensing system due to the rational use of its resources. Method. New concept of a group object, stochastic swath and stochastic length of the route is introduced. The overview of models for single, group objects and their parameters is given. The criterion for the existence of the group object based on two single objects is formulated. The method for group objects formation while current survey planning has been developed and its description is presented. The method comprises several processing stages for data about objects with the calculation of new parameters, the stochastic characteristics of space means and validates the spatial size of the object value of the stochastic swath and stochastic length of the route.

The level <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> in the countries which allow homosexual couples to be registred is shown with the help of one fundamental indicator - the crude rate <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> homosexuals. Where the amount of data available permits it, the character <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> homosexual couples at national level is presented in bigger detail. Moreover, an analysis of the behaviours of same-sex couples in different countries is completed, comparing patterns of behaviour across national boundaries and against heterosexual couples as well.
