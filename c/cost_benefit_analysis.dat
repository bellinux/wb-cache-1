Additionally the concept of liquidity is a critical component to capturing [...] "inefficiencies" [...] in tests for abnormal returns. Any test of this proposition faces the joint hypothesis problem, where it is impossible to ever test for market efficiency, since to do so requires the use of a measuring stick against which abnormal returns are compared —one cannot know if the market is efficient if one does not know if a model correctly stipulates the required rate of return. Consequently, a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient, but one has no way of knowing which is the case.|$|E

40|$|Software {{industry}} {{deals with}} a vital challenge that {{is caused by a}} rapidly growing demand for speedy and cost-effective development of large and complex software systems. To overcome this challenge, software community is moving towards the component based software engineering (CBSE). The major inspiration for software industry, to adopt CBSE as its software development paradigm, is to rapidly build and deploy complex and trustworthy software systems with enormous savings, least engineering effort, cost, and time. CBSE provides the technical facilities that enable the easy assembly and upgrading of the software systems out of independently developed pieces of the software. As the demand for new software increases, software reuse has become an attraction point for the many organizations because in a competitive environment, every organization wants to increase its productivity, reduce the development cost and time to market. Organizations also want to achieve a systematic software reuse in order to ensure a higher reliability, better maintenance and quality by exploiting reusability. Software reuse has become an important objective for every organization that is developing the software systems. CBSE is the systematic approach to achieve the systematic software reuse. The aim of this thesis is to present a precise study of the CBSE advantages, available CBSE lifecycle models in literature, component models, CBSE <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>analysis</b> (CBA), and comparison of CBSE economics with another software reuse strategy named as copy paste strategy in the railway industry. This thesis also defines a method to identify the reusable software components from the existing systems.
