5|$|Due to the overshadowing {{issue of}} the Soviet vs. U.S. Space Race, the ethical issues raised by this {{experiment}} went largely unaddressed for some time. As newspaper <b>clippings</b> from 1957 show, the press was initially focused on reporting the political perspective, while the health and retrieval—or lack thereof—of Laika only became an issue later.|$|E

He commissioned the local blacksmith to create an iron witch bottle, into which he placed toe-nail <b>clippings</b> and locks of hair belonging to the putative victim. The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded, with this supposedly defeating the witch's machinations.|$|E
5|$|Production of Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI, {{originally}} titled Sejarah Orde Baru (History of the New Order), {{took nearly}} two years, spending {{four months in}} pre-production and a year and half in filming.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these two songs, Tharani contributed to similar creations for the music store where Tamizhselvi works as a saleswoman, the street surrounding the music store, the warehouse behind the music store, the interior portions of Thamizhselvi's house and Adiseshan's office room. The music shop was designed in the Victorian architecture style, while the warehouse was constructed at AVM Productions with the fight sequence being filmed there as well. Filming of another action sequence in an open-air theatre, which was also designed by Tharani, took place for approximately 15–20 days. K. V. Anand used balloon lights brought from a French company Airstar Space Lighting for the sequence. The interior portions of Thamizhselvi's house was designed using <b>clippings</b> of flats constructed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board.|$|E
5|$|In early April 2009, {{a carbon}} copy of {{one version of}} the list was {{discovered}} at the State Library of New South Wales by workers combing through boxes of materials collected by author Thomas Keneally. The 13-page document, yellow and fragile, was filed among research notes and original newspaper <b>clippings.</b> The document was given to Keneally in 1980 by Pfefferberg when he was persuading him to write Schindler's story. This version of the list contains 801 names and is dated 18 April 1945; Pfefferberg is listed as worker number 173. Several authentic versions of the list exist, because the names were re-typed several times as conditions changed in the hectic days {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as newspaper <b>clippings,</b> from which to draw the scenes and characters; for The Secret of the Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. In drawing {{many of the old}} vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published L'Art et la Mer ("Art and the Sea") by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted a friend of his, Gérard Liger-Belair, who owned a Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; Le Brillant, which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 2009, an 18-year-old male {{member of}} Anonymous {{ran into the}} New York Scientology {{building}} shirtless and covered with Vaseline, pubic hair, and toenail <b>clippings.</b> He then proceeded to toss books around and smear the mixture on objects in the building. The man, identified by police as Mahoud Samed Almahadin, was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as hate crimes. Two weeks later, 21-year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with aggravated harassment and criminal mischief as hate crimes after he filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank. According {{to his mother and}} the video, Speregen was filming the event from behind the barricade. Scientology critics Mark Bunker and Jason Beghe disagreed with the individual's actions.|$|E
5|$|Oskar's classmates {{regularly}} bully him, and {{he spends}} his evenings imagining revenge, collecting <b>clippings</b> from {{newspapers and magazines}} about grisly murders. One night he meets Eli, {{who appears to be}} a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment with an older man, Håkan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. Over time, however, they begin to form a close relationship, with Oskar lending his Rubik's Cube to Eli, and the two exchanging Morse code messages through their adjoining wall. Håkan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a cut on his cheek, Eli learns that the boy is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. This inspires Oskar to enroll for weight-training classes after school.|$|E

5|$|Dickinson's herbarium, {{which is}} now held in the Houghton Library at Harvard University, was {{published}} in 2006 as Emily Dickinson's Herbarium by Harvard University Press. The original work was compiled by Dickinson during her years at Amherst Academy, and consists of 424 pressed specimens of plants arranged on 66 pages of a bound album. A digital facsimile of the herbarium is available online. The town of Amherst Jones Library's Special Collections department has an Emily Dickinson Collection consisting of approximately seven thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, family correspondence, scholarly articles and books, newspaper <b>clippings,</b> theses, plays, photographs and contemporary artwork and prints. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College has substantial holdings of Dickinson's manuscripts and letters {{as well as a}} lock of Dickinson's hair and the original of the only positively identified image of the poet. In 1965, in recognition of Dickinson's growing stature as a poet, the Homestead was purchased by Amherst College. It opened to the public for tours, and also served as a faculty residence for many years. The Emily Dickinson Museum was created in 2003 when ownership of the Evergreens, which had been occupied by Dickinson family heirs until 1988, was transferred to the college.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and <b>clippings.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Terhunes died, Sunnybank slowly deteriorated, {{with the}} house {{and much of the}} grounds destroyed. Large chunks of the {{property}} were sold by the Albert Payson Terhune, Inc, an organization set up in the wills of Bert and Anice Terhune to provide funds for a charitable organization, the Terhune Foundation. The last ten acres of the property were eventually sold to a housing developer, which included the house, graves of the Terhune collies, and the dogs' old kennels. In 1967, this remaining chunk of Sunnybank was condemned by the Wayne Township. The next year, the township made the remaining acres a historical park, Terhune Memorial Park. The Van Riper-Hopper Historic House Museum, located several miles away, displays Terhune's writings, the awards won by the Sunnybank collies, and other memorabilia. The graves of Lad, Wolf, Lady, and the other Sunnybank dogs are preserved there and available for viewing by visitors. <b>Clippings</b> of Lad's coat are stored at the Library of Congress, having been donated by Anice. Annual gatherings to Sunnybank are organized by the Collie Health Foundation on the third weekend in August, during which speakers familiar with Terhune and his dogs speak, seminars and tours are conducted, and various collie-focused events and competitions are conducted. In 2005, Marilyn R. Horowitz published a Sunnybank calendar, the proceeds of which were used by the Terhune Sunnybank Memorial to restore Lad's grave, which had fallen into disrepair, and to aid in maintaining the grounds of Sunnybank.|$|E
5|$|Calculus' shark-shaped {{submarine}} was visually {{based on}} a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper. The diving suit worn in the story was also based on <b>clippings</b> that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was {{based on a}}n illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The Sirius, which had appeared before in The Shooting Star, was named after the SS Sirius, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a trawler, the John-O.88. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders, Jos Boel & Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the Vasa, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail <b>clippings,</b> women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E
5|$|The retrial {{was delayed}} {{for one day}} to give the {{defendants}} more time to prepare. The new jury selection was marked by attempts by Williams to be relieved of her duties, owing to disagreements with Shakur {{as well as with}} Hilton's attorney. Judge Arnold Bauman denied the application, but directed another lawyer, Howard Jacobs, to defend Shakur while Williams remained the attorney of record. Shakur was ejected following an argument with Williams, and Hilton left with her as jury selection continued. After the selection of twelve jurors (60 were excused), Williams was allowed to retire from the case, with Shakur officially representing herself, assisted by lawyer Florynce Kennedy. In the retrial, White testified that the six alleged robbers had saved their hair <b>clippings</b> to create disguises, and identified a partially obscured head and shoulder in a photo taken from a surveillance camera as Shakur's. Kennedy objected to this identification {{on the grounds that the}} prosecutor, assistant United States attorney Peter Truebner, had offered to stipulate that Shakur was not depicted in any of the photographs. Although both White and Rivers testified that Shakur was wearing overalls during the robbery, the person identified as Shakur in the photograph was wearing a jacket. The defense attempted to discredit White on the grounds that he had spent eight months in Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1968, and White countered that he had faked insanity (by claiming to be Allah in front of three psychiatrists) to get transferred out of prison.|$|E
