Changes in <b>Coxibs</b> expenditure in 2007 and 2009, calculated {{by using the}} Laspeyres index, were attributed to two factors: cost per patient (P) and number of patients (Q) per year. By measuring quantity as defined daily dose, changes in P comprised two subfactors: cost per day (p) and days of therapy per patient (q); p was weighted average cost of <b>Coxibs</b> per day, and q was weighted average days of therapy of new and current patients. Furthermore, the pattern of concomitant drugs, proton pump inhibitors, was analyzed. ResultsExpenditure on <b>Coxibs</b> rose from 57. 7 to 69. 4 million baht from 2007 to 2009. With Laspeyres index, total index of 1. 20 {{was a result of}} three main factors. The highest impact was from change in cost per day (p index at 1. 17), which was a result of a slight increase in drug cost, mainly weighted by product mix, which tended to switch drug from low to high cost. Another positive impact was the number of <b>Coxibs</b> patients (Q index at 1. 04). Finally, the negative impact was from days of therapy per patient (q index = 0. 98). Although days of therapy per patient for both new and current patients were decreased, patient mix of more current patients slowed the decrease down. In addition, the percentage of proton pump inhibitors coprescription also rose from 30. 8 % in 2007 to 32. 3 % in 2009.

Aim To identify whether and in whom either of these strategies should be preferred in daily practice. Methods A nested case-control study was conducted using three European primary care databases. We selected a cohort including all naive nsNSAID+GPA (≥ 80 % GPA adherence) and <b>coxib</b> users (without GPA use) aged ≥ 50 years. Cases with an UGI event (i. e. symptomatic UGI ulcer or bleeding) were matched to cohort members without an UGI event on age, sex and number of individual UGI risk factors (i. e.

Conditional logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % CI, while adjusting for potential confounders. Results Within the NSAID cohort (n = 617 220), 398 UGI cases were identified. The risk of UGI events was equivalent for <b>coxib</b> and nsNSAID+GPA (≥ 80 % adherence) users (OR: 1. 02; 95 %CI: 0. 77 - 1. 37).

Composite results across all four cancer sites revealed that regular intake of 325 mg aspirin, 200 mg ibuprofen, or standard dosages of <b>coxibs</b> (200 mg celecoxib or 25 mg rofecoxib) produced risk reductions of 49 %, 59 %, and 64 %, respectively. Use of <b>coxibs</b> for at least 2 years was associated with risk reductions of 71 %, 70 %, 55 %, and 60 % for breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer, respectively. Effects of ibuprofen were similar to selective <b>coxibs,</b> and slightly stronger than aspirin. These observed effects are consistent with the relative COX- 2 selectivity of ibuprofen, <b>coxibs,</b> and aspirin. Acetaminophen, an analgesic without COX- 2 activity, had no effect. Overexpression of COX- 2 and increased prostaglandin biosynthesis correlates with carcinogenesis and metastasis at most anatomic sites.

The cyclooxygenase- 2 selective agents (COXIBS) have an efficacy similar to that of aspirin for most gastrointestinal (GI) lesions but not esophagus. Specifically, there are beneficial short term effects of <b>COXIBs</b> on the risk of colorectal adenoma as shown in the Approve, PreSAP, and APC studies. However, there is still an increased risk of upper GI complications with <b>COXIBs</b> when compared with placebo, and this risk may increase further in some people when aspirin is also consumed. Whereas aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, <b>COXIBs</b> and most traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (but not all) are both associated with an increased risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events compared with placebo. In conclusion, <b>COXIBs</b> have a niche role for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. The value of aspirin remains with respect for efficacy, mainly in the esophagus, and the side effect profile, especially in the elderly if given with acid suppression therapy. <b>COXIBs</b> should be used in younger populations, but if they are considered in the elderly because of increased GI risks, and the cardiovascular risk is also increased, then combination treatment with aspirin and a proton-pump inhibitor should also be considered instead, such as in the ASPECT trial.

Given {{a broad spectrum of}} pleiotropic effects of <b>coxibs,</b> our intention was to narrow potential mechanisms affecting CAD risk as we hypothesized that the affected genes may also display genomic signals of coronary disease risk. A Drug Gene Interaction Database search identified 47 gene products to be affected by <b>coxibs.</b> We traced association signals in 200 -kb regions surrounding these genes in 84, 813 CAD cases and 202, 543 controls. Based on a threshold of 1 x 10 (- 5) (Bonferroni correction for 3131 haplotype blocks), four gene loci yielded significant associations.

40|$|Background: Comparative {{assessments}} of the vascular and upper gastrointestinal risks of different regimens of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are required. Methods: Meta-analyses were conducted, using individual participant data where possible, of placebo-controlled trials of a selective cyclo-oxygenase [COX]- 2 inhibitor ('coxib') or traditional NSAID, or randomised trials of a <b>coxib</b> versus traditional NSAIDs. A prespecified subdivision of traditional NSAID regimens of those with antiplatelet activity (mainly naproxen) and those without (mainly diclofenac) was made. Primary outcomes were major vascular events (MVEs; nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or vascular death) and upper gastrointestinal complications (UGICs; perforation, obstruction or bleed). Findings: Searches identified 788 trials: 200 comparisons of a <b>coxib</b> vs placebo (88, 604 participants, mean follow-up 0. 60 years), 206 comparisons of a traditional NSAID vs placebo (43, 482 participants, 0. 46 years) and 149 comparisons of a <b>coxib</b> vs traditional NSAID (137, 466 participants, mean follow-up 0. 95 years). Compared to placebo, allocation to a <b>coxib</b> increased the risk of MVEs (rate ratio 1. 38, 95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 66), vascular mortality (1. 58, 1. 11 - 2. 24) and UGICs (1. 81, 1. 17 - 2. 81). Overall, in the population studied, coxibs were associated with three additional major vascular events (one fatal) and two (rarely fatal) upper gastrointestinal complications per 1000 person-years exposure. There {{was no evidence of}} heterogeneity by duration of follow-up, <b>coxib</b> type, dose (other than for celecoxib), or patient characteristics, for the primary outcomes. The risk of MVEs for traditional NSAIDs without antiplatelet activity (mostly diclofenac 75 mg bd or ibuprofen 800 mg tds) were comparable to coxibs (1. 40, 1. 15 - 1. 72); but the risk of UGICs (1. 98, 1. 39 - 2. 84) was significantly greater. For traditional NSAIDs with antiplatelet activity (mostly naproxen 500 mg bd) there were no significant excess of MVEs (0. 84, 0. 66 - 1. 08), but UGICs were substantially increased (4. 06, 2. 85 - 5. 78). Both coxibs and traditional NSAIDs increased risk of hospitalisation for heart failure by about two-fold. Interpretation: The vascular and upper gastrointestinal risks of coxibs and high-dose tNSAID regimens can be predicted, allowing the choice of analgesia to be tailored for particular patients.
