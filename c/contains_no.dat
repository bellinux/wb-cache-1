A complete list of the ingredients includes: soybean oil, water, egg yolk, gluconic acid, yeast extract, stabilizer (microcrystalline cellulose, modified food starch, xanthan gum, guar gum, gum arabic), cultured dextrose, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, spice, natural smoke flavor, natural flavors, tocopherols, calcium disodium EDTA, and autolyzed yeast extract.|$|E
5|$|Corvus <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> Messier objects. It {{has several}} galaxies and a {{planetary}} nebula observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus {{is home to}} a planetary nebula, NGC 4361. The nebula itself resembles a small elliptical galaxy and has a magnitude of 10.3, but the magnitude 13 star at its centre gives away its true nature.|$|E
5|$|Examinations of {{the burial}} grounds, of which even the largest used {{continuously}} over periods {{of up to}} several centuries, <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> more than several hundreds graves, shows that the overall population density was low. The dead were cremated and the ashes sometimes placed in urns, which had the mid-part {{in the form of}} an engraved bulge. In the 1st century AD this was replaced with a sharp-profiled (with a horizontal ridge around the circumference) shape.|$|E

5|$|In Aprilâ€“May 2012, {{a team of}} archaeologists {{unearthed}} {{a previously}} unknown inscription on a stairway at the La Corona site in Guatemala. The inscription, on {{what is known as}} Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.|$|E
5|$|In Ghana, FES is brewed in Kumasi by Guinness Ghana Breweries, {{which is}} 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE {{is mixed with}} a locally brewed sorghum lager, but it differs from the Nigerian version in that it <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> wheat and has a higher {{proportion}} of roast barley. In Ghana, the product is believed to have medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.|$|E
5|$|In a {{different}} reading, Shakespearean scholar Eric Sams has interpreted this reference to spiritual communion as {{an allusion to}} Barnabe Barnes, a notorious English occultist and poet, while others contend that {{the significance of the}} spirit is simply an allusion to poetic genius and that it <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> reference to an actual personage.|$|E

5|$|Kosher salt, though refined, <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> iodine {{and has a}} {{much larger}} grain size than most refined salts. This can give it {{different}} properties when used in cooking, and can be useful for preparing kosher meat. Some kosher salt has been certified to meet kosher requirements by a hechsher, {{but this is not}} true for all products labelled as kosher salt.|$|E
5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of the}} sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|The Glamorgan sausage is a Welsh {{vegetarian}} sausage. It <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> meat or skin, {{instead it}} is made with cheese, generally Caerphilly, but sometimes cheddar, along with leek or spring onion. This mixture is then coated in breadcrumbs and rolled into a sausage shape before cooking. Glamorgan sausages date back to at least the early 19th century, {{at which point the}} sausages would have contained pork fat.|$|E

5|$|The film <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> {{dialogue}} for {{the first}} and last 20 minutes or so. By the time shooting began, Kubrick had removed much of the dialogue and narration; what remains is notable for its banality (making the computer Hal seem to have more emotion than the humans) juxtaposed with epic space scenes.|$|E

In the Director's Cut, Hazel Ellerby returns to voice Nicole Collard {{in the new}} sections, playing Nico again {{for the first time}} since the original game's release. Rolf Saxon, as in every sequel, also returns to voice George Stobbart. Due to the platform's size limits, the DS version <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> spoken dialogue, only subtitles.|$|E

5|$|When tumors compress, invade or inflame {{parts of}} the nervous system (such as the brain, spinal cord, nerves, ganglia or plexa), they can cause pain and other symptoms. Though brain tissue <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> pain sensors, brain tumors can cause pain by {{pressing}} on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the meninges), or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid (edema) that may compress pain-sensitive tissue.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In Escape from Butcher Bay, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} Richard B. Riddick and {{attempts}} {{to break out of}} Butcher Bay prison. The game incorporates elements from video game genres such as first-person shooter, adventure and stealth, and is played primarily from a first-person perspective, though the camera switches to a third-person perspective during certain scenes. Unlike many first-person shooters, the game <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> head-up display; on-screen cues are limited to flashes when a new weapon is selected, and small, white boxes that display the player character's health when damage is taken. Health can be replenished in designated areas throughout the game. By finding cigarette packs hidden in levels, the player can unlock concept art and video files.|$|E

5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Kaminsky {{stands up}} Incanto while he waits at a restaurant. He leaves, murdering a {{slightly}} overweight prostitute who injures {{him in a}} struggle. Incanto is forced to flee before he can fully dissolve the body. At the autopsy, Scully finds that the body's airways are choked with the same substance that dissolved Lauren. The State Genetic Lab report reveals that the skin under the victim's nails <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> oils or fatty acids, convincing Mulder that the killer is sucking body fat from his victims.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food <b>contains</b> <b>no</b> animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
