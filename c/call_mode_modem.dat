40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates a {{multi-mode}} MAC {{protocol suite}} {{for use in}} a heterogeneous underwater network. Modems from different manufacturers may employ different physical layers and MAC protocols. If multiple modems operating in the same or overlapping frequency bands are deployed in the same geographic area, they cannot function correctly due to interference. We propose a mechanism to achieve co-existence and communication among such heterogeneous assets. Co-existence is defined as the state where modems of the same type can communicate with each other while minimizing interference with other types. The Communications state is when all modems in one area can communicate with each other. Alien signals are defined as non-decipherable communication signals for any one modem type. The Co-existence <b>mode</b> requires all <b>modems</b> to implement an alien signal detection feature. In this mode, a CSMA based scheme will be used to communicate among modems of the same type, if alien signals are detected, and to allow non-interfering co-existence among different modem types. In order to achieve Communications <b>mode,</b> <b>modems</b> will be required to implement a standardized Physical Layer (along with their proprietary Physical Layer or as the only system and o...|$|R

40|$|The design {{tradeoffs}} of turbo-coded burst-by-burst adaptive orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplex (OFDM) wideband transceivers are analyzed. We demonstrate that upon {{aiming for a}} higher throughput {{a higher proportion of}} low-quality OFDM subcarriers has to be used for the transmission of inherently vulnerable high-order <b>modem</b> <b>modes,</b> transmitting several bits per subcarrier. Upon invoking turbo coding and adjusting the <b>modem</b> <b>mode</b> switching regime near-error-free performance can be achieved at the cost of a reduced throughput. Various blind <b>modem</b> <b>mode</b> detection techniques have also been investigated and the most complex channel coding trellis-based detection algorithm was found to be the most powerful. Last, the design tradeoffs of spectral pre-equalization have been explored and qualtified. We concluded that AOFDM provides a convenient framework for adjusting the required target integrity and throughput both with and without turbo channel coding. I.
