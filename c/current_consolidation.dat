Consolidation resulting from increased overburden stress results in increased particle alignment and compression of fabric elements with depth. The transition from open, random fabric in shallow samples to preferred orientation at depth represents the only change in these sediments that can be ascribed directly to a specific depositional or post-depositional process. Mineralogical variations, owing to changes in weathering processes and growth of authigenic/diagenetic minerals, also have a pronounced effect on sediment fabric...|$|R
40|$|This paper's {{objective}} is to analyze the etiology of the crisis confronting the farm sector and its creditors. It draws on data for the period 1950 to 1984 to argue that: (1) rising productivity of farm assets led to large increases in asset values during the 1950 s, 1960 s, and 1970 s; (2) rising asset values significantly altered the incentive structure of agriculture; and (3) the resulting capital-gains based agriculture of the postwar period motivated farmers to alter their capital structure in ways that made the current financial debacle inevitable once the income growth from assets tapered. From this basis, the paper concludes that farmers' borrowing behavior was substantially more responsible for the existing crisis than often-cited adversities in the markets for agricultural commodities. Accordingly, a farm incomes policy cannot remedy the situation, and the <b>current</b> <b>consolidation</b> in agricultural debt-though painful-represents an unavoidable adjustment for American agriculture.

40|$|When {{enterprise}} applications are consolidated on shared platforms, meeting application-level {{quality of service}} (QoS) goals becomes a challenge because complex interactions and dependencies exist among the components of multi-tier applications. <b>Current</b> <b>consolidation</b> tools just use system utilization metrics, and do not consider such dependencies when allocating resources to individual application components. We have developed an adaptive controller that can adjust dynamically resources for individual application tiers within a consolidated environment to meet the QoS goals of the applications. We have evaluated our controller design experimentally using multi-tier applications hosted on testbeds using Xen virtual machines. Results indicate that the adaptive controller is able to adjust multiple resources (e. g., CPU and network bandwidth) for multi-tier applications {{in order to maintain}} target QoS levels in scenarios with different platform and application configuration.

Because application components typically run in multiple servers, these applications pose a number of unique challenges during consolidation.

40|$|AbstractThe Austrian {{health system}} {{is much more}} complex and {{fragmented}} than in other OECD countries. In 2013 legislation was adopted to enhance efficiency through better balancing care provision across providers by promoting new primary care models and better coordination of care. Reform objectives should be achieved by cooperative and unified decision making across key stakeholders and by adherence to a budget cap that prescribes fiscal containment {{on the order of}} 3. 4 billion Euros until 2016. This is priced into the envisaged savings of the <b>current</b> <b>consolidation</b> program. Efforts have been made to bridge the accountability divide by establishing agreements and administrative layers to govern the health system by objectives. Yet, more could have been achieved. For example, cross-stakeholder pooling of funds for better contracting governance and effective purchasing across care settings could have been introduced. This would have required addressing overcapacity and fragmentation within social security. At the same time, legal provisions for cooperative governance between Sickness Funds and the governments on the regional level should have been stipulated. The Austrian 2013 reform is interesting to other countries as it aims to ensure better-balanced care at a sustainable path by employing a public management approach to governance relations across key payers of care...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the fiscal}} {{expansion}} during the Great Recession 2008 - 2009 and the <b>current</b> European <b>consolidation</b> and austerity measures, {{the analysis of}} fiscal multiplier effects {{is back on the}} scientific agenda. The number of empirical studies is growing fast, tackling the issue with manifold model classes, identification strategies, and specifications. While plurality of methods seems to {{be a good idea to}} address a complicated issue, the results are far off consensus. We apply meta regression analysis to a set of 89 studies on multiplier effects in order to provide a systematic overview of the different approaches, to derive stylized facts and to separate structural from method-specific effects. We classify studies with respect to type of fiscal impulse, model class, multiplier calculation method and further control variables. Moreover, we analyse subsamples of the model classes in order to evaluate the effects of model-class-specific properties, currently discussed in the literature, such as the influence of central bank reaction functions and liquidity constrained households. As a major result, we find that the reported size of the fiscal multiplier crucially depends on the setting and method chosen. Thus, economic policy consulting based on a certain multiplier study should lay open by how much specification affects the results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Stone {{consolidation}} {{is almost}} always a very risky intervention. It is a non-reversible intervention and has serious harmful side effects. Due to these shortcomings, a decision {{to go for a}} consolidation action is always difficult to take and it is simple only when it is taken as a “last option ” when replacement or full destruction are the unique alternatives at sight. Stone consolidation is needed because stones decay and loose cohesion in the exposed surfaces down to a certain depth. This conservation operation should take into account that type, extent and rate of decay largely depend on the intrinsic properties of the stone and on the extrinsic or environment factors. The combination of the intrinsic and extrinsic decay factors can give raise to multiple degradation forms that largely influence the decision on to consolidate and the options on the type of consolidant and on its application forms. The identification and characterisation of decay profiles is also a relevant step in stone conservation, namely when consolidation is concerned. The paper gives a brief introduction to a few topics on stone consolidation exemplifying with some <b>current</b> stone <b>consolidation</b> products. It quotes some cases of stone consolidation in recent Portuguese experience and presents some illustrations {{on the use of the}} microdrilling instrument in the detection of past consolidation actions. 1...|$|R
40|$|When {{the first}} {{pieces of the}} Farm Credit System (FCS) were {{initially}} established by the Federal government {{at the beginning of}} this century, it was in response to the lack of sources of credit for farmers from commercial for-profit financial institutions. The FCS was created as the first Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) to address a perceived market failure. Over time the number of for-profit financial intermediaries providing credit to agriculture has increased, as have their complaints over having to compete with a non-profit government sponsored agency. As a result of the increase in lenders the notion of significant market failure in agricultural lending is less obvious. Preserving competition may now be the major rationale for the existence of the FCS. One consequence of the on-going competition between banks and the FCS for farm lending is pressure on both types of institutions to seek ways to improve their position. A significant part of the <b>current</b> <b>consolidation</b> process of the System was driven by this competitive pressure, but consolidation can now be seen as creating other problems. As the FCS evolves, its structure as a non-profit, cooperatively owned financial intermediary is seen by some as placing it at a competitive disadvantage.

40|$|Following the {{literature}} on the comparative advantage of small versus large banks at lending to small businesses and in light of the worldwide {{decline in the number of}} intermediaries that specialise in this type of lending associated with deregulation in the banking industry, we examine the role that specific categories of banks have played in the context of Italy's regional economic growth. Over the estimation period, 1970 - 1993, which ends in the year of full implementation of the banking reform that introduced statutory de-specialisation and branching liberalisation, Italy featured not only a substantial presence of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the real sector, as is still the case, but also a large and heterogeneous set of credit institutions with different ownership, size and lending styles. Exploiting these peculiarities we study the role of specific intermediaries and gather indirect evidence concerning the likely effects, ceteris paribus, of the <b>current</b> <b>consolidation</b> processes. The main findings, stemming from panel regressions with fixed effects, are as follows. The overall size of the financial sector has a weak impact on growth, but some intermediaries are better than others: cooperative banks and special credit institutions play a positive role, banks of national interest (basically large private banks) and public law banks (government-owned banks) either do not affect growth or have a negative influence depending on how growth is measured. Cooperative banks were mostly small banks and special credit institutions were all but large conglomerates with standardized credit policies, hence our results lend support to the current worldwide concerns of a reduction in the availability of credit to SMEs resulting from consolidation and regulatory reforms in the banking industry...|$|E

Spindle activity occurring phase-locked to the SO {{is considered a}} candidate mediator of memory consolidation during sleep. We used source localization of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from 11 sleeping human subjects for an in-depth analysis of the temporal and spatial properties of sleep spindles co-occurring with SOs. Slow oscillations and spindles were identified in the EEG and related to the MEG signal, providing enhanced spatial resolution. In the temporal domain, we confirmed a phase-locking of classical 12 – 15 Hz fast spindle activity to the depolarizing SO up-state and of 9 – 12 Hz slow spindle activity to the up-to-down-state transition of the SO. In the spatial domain, we show a broad spread of spindle activity, with less distinct anterior–posterior separation of fast and slow spindles than commonly seen in the EEG. We further tested a prediction of <b>current</b> memory <b>consolidation</b> models, namely {{the existence of a}} spatial bias of SOs over sleep spindles as a mechanism to promote localized neuronal synchronization and plasticity. In contrast to that prediction, a comparison of SOs dominating over the left vs. right hemisphere did not reveal any signs of a concurrent lateralization of spindle activity co-occurring with these SOs. Our data are consistent with the concept of the neocortical SO exerting top-down control over thalamic spindle generation. However, they call into question the notion that SOs locally coordinate spindles and thereby inform spindle-related memory processing...|$|R

This thesis project investigates typical and conformational tendencies of a hypothetical end-of-life electronics recycling system based in the United States.

The experimental procedure entails varying the model scenario based on: type of material being recycled, the properties of <b>current</b> recycling and <b>consolidation</b> practices, and an extrapolation of current trends into the future. The transition from a decentralized to a centralized recycling network is shown to be dependent on the balance between transportation costs and facility costs, with the latter being a much more important cost consideration than the former.

In addition to the evaluation of roller compaction, the influence of tableting force and dwell time on the interaction of aspirin and sodium bicarbonate was also studied. ^ A factorial statistical design was selected for the evaluation of tableting force and dwell time on the degradation of aspirin when combined with sodium bicarbonate. Samples were exposed to two tableting forces and two dwell times. Half of these samples were stored for six months at two different temperatures, 20 and 40 °C. These studies indicated that both force and dwell time are significant factors contributing to aspirin degradation when tableted in combination with sodium bicarbonate. Storage temperature was also found to be significant. The influence of force and dwell time is consistent with <b>current</b> powder <b>consolidation</b> hypotheses such as cold welding, and fusion bonding. ^ In order to thoroughly evaluate roller compaction of an effervescent formulation, a statistical design was selected containing all possible combinations of formulation ingredients.

It establishes a few basic insights about these questions through a combination of experiments and empirical analysis. This experimental study points out potential pitfalls in the use of current VM management tools and identifies promising opportunities for more effective performance consolidation algorithms.

The reason for this extremely high energy consumption {{is not just the}} quantity of computing resources and the power inefficiency of hardware, but rather lies in the inefficient usage of these resources. VM consolidation involves live migration of VMs hence the capability of transferring a VM between physical servers with a close to zero down time. It is an effective way to improve the utilization of resources and increase energy efficiency in cloud data centers. VM consolidation consists of host overload/underload detection, VM selection and VM placement. Most of the <b>current</b> VM <b>consolidation</b> approaches apply either heuristic-based techniques, such as static utilization thresholds, decision-making based on statistical analysis of historical data; or simply periodic adaptation of the VM allocation. Most of those algorithms rely on CPU utilization only for host overload detection. In this paper we propose using hybrid factors to enhance VM consolidation. Specifically we developed a multiple regression algorithm that uses CPU utilization, memory utilization and bandwidth utilization for host overload detection. The proposed algorithm, Multiple Regression Host Overload Detection (MRHOD), significantly reduces energy consumption while ensuring a high level of adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLA) since it gives a real indication of host utilization based on three parameters (CPU, Memory, Bandwidth) utilizations instead of one parameter only (CPU utilization). Through simulations we show that our approach reduces power consumption by 6 times compared to single factor algorithms using random workload. Also using PlanetLab workload traces we show that MRHOD improves the ESV metric by about 24 % better than other single factor regression algorithms (LR and LRR). Also we developed Hybrid Local Regression Host Overload Detection algorithm (HLRHOD) that is based on local regression using hybrid factors. It outperforms the single factor algorithms...|$|R
