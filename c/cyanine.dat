25|$|There {{are many}} hybrid {{variations}} of the dye formulations, such as Formazan by Kodak (a hybrid of <b>cyanine</b> and phthalocyanine).|$|E
25|$|They were {{originally}} used, and still are, {{to increase the}} sensitivity range of photographic emulsions, i.e., to increase the range of wavelengths which will form an image on the film, making the film panchromatic. Cyanines are also used in CD-R and DVD-R media. The ones used are mostly green or light blue in color, and are chemically unstable. This makes unstabilized <b>cyanine</b> discs unsuitable for archival CD and DVD use, as they can fade and become unreadable in a few years, however, recent <b>cyanine</b> discs contain stabilizers that slow down the deterioration significantly. These discs are often rated with an archival life of 75 years or more. The other dyes used in CD-Rs are phthalocyanine and azo.|$|E
25|$|The amine group, in aminoallyl-modified nucleotide, is {{reactive}} with dyes {{such as the}} <b>cyanine</b> series, {{or other}} patented dyes.

25|$|Phthalocyanine dye CD-Rs {{are usually}} silver, gold or light green. The patents on {{phthalocyanine}} CD-Rs {{are held by}} Mitsui and Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Phthalocyanine is a natively stable dye (has no need for stabilizers) and CD-Rs based on this are often given a rated lifetime of hundreds of years. Unlike <b>cyanine,</b> phthalocyanine is less resistant to UV rays and CD-Rs based on this dye show signs of degradation only {{after two weeks of}} direct sunlight exposure. However, phthalocyanine is more sensitive than <b>cyanine</b> to writing laser power calibration, meaning that the power level used by the writing laser has to be more accurately adjusted for the disc {{in order to get a}} good recording; this may erode the benefits of dye stability, as marginally written discs (with higher correctable error rates) will lose data (i.e. have uncorrectable errors) after less dye degradation than well written discs (with lower correctable error rates).|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, many {{manufacturers}} have added additional coloring to disguise their unstable <b>cyanine</b> CD-Rs in the past, so {{the formulation of}} a disc cannot be determined based purely on its color. Similarly, a gold reflective layer does not guarantee use of phthalocyanine dye. The quality of the disc is also not only dependent on the dye used, it is also influenced by sealing, the top layer, the reflective layer, and the polycarbonate. Simply choosing a disc based on its dye type may be problematic. Furthermore, correct power calibration of the laser in the writer, as well as correct timing of the laser pulses, stable disc speed, and so on, is critical to not only the immediate readability but the longevity of the recorded disc, so for archiving {{it is important to}} have not only a high quality disc but a high quality writer. In fact, a high quality writer may produce adequate results with medium quality media, but high quality media cannot compensate for a mediocre writer, and discs written by such a writer cannot achieve their maximum potential archival lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as <b>cyanine</b> dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E
40|$|The present {{work has}} been carried out to explore the {{potential}} application of <b>cyanines</b> in photodynamic therapy. After photosensitization, the in vitro cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity on HeLa cells of a total of 35 <b>cyanines</b> belonging to several chemical subgroups is explored. Most of these <b>cyanines</b> have never been used before in similar experimental work. From a first set of experiments, it is found that none of the krypto-, oxa- and imidacyanines is photobiologically active on HeLa cells. Conversely, five thiacyanines (Thiacl- 5), one rhodacyanine (Rhodac) and four indocyanines (Indoc 2, Indoc 4, Indoc 5, Indoc 7) show photodependent cytotoxicity or antiproliferative effects. A more detailed study shows that out of the ten selected compounds, eight <b>cyanines</b> feature significant photodependent cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects. All possess maximum absorption ranges between 545 and 824 nm. In particular, Rhodac, a tetramethinemeromonomethine rhodacyanine dye with an absorption maximum of 655 nm (ethanol) and a molar absorption coefficient epsilon = 108000 shows very promising photo-dependent biological activity. In general, the measured singlet oxygen quantum yield of the selected <b>cyanines</b> is low (< 0. 08) and does not correlate with the degree of photosensitization. Furthermore, the present study shows that <b>cyanines</b> with a partition coefficient close to 1. 5 accumulate to the highest extent in HeLa cells, while the more hydrophobic compounds (e. g., indocyanines) concentrate less intracellularly. status: publishe...|$|R

We have {{recently}} reported that simple lipophilic cationic <b>cyanines</b> are specific and potent dopaminergic toxins with a mechanism of toxicity {{similar to that of}} the Parkinsonian toxin MPP+. In the present study, a group of fluorescent lipophilic <b>cyanines</b> have been used to further exploit the structure activity relationship of the specific dopaminergic toxicity of <b>cyanines.</b> Here, we report that all <b>cyanines</b> tested were highly toxic to dopaminergic MN 9 D cells with IC(50) s in the range of 60 - 100 nM and not toxic to non-neuronal HepG 2 cells parallel to that previously reported for 2, 2 '- and 4, 4 '-cyanines. All <b>cyanines</b> nonspecifically accumulate in the mitochondria of both MN 9 D and HepG 2 cells at high concentrations, inhibit the mitochondrial complex I with the inhibition potencies similar to the potent complex I inhibitor, rotenone. They increase the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production specifically in dopaminergic cells causing apoptotic cell death. These and other findings suggest that the complex I inhibition, the expression of low levels of antioxidant enzymes, and presence of high levels of oxidatively labile radical propagator, dopamine, could be responsible for the specific increase in ROS production in dopaminergic cells. Thus, the predisposition of dopaminergic cells to produce high levels of ROS in response to mitochondrial toxins together with their inherent greater demand for energy may contribute to their specific vulnerability toward these toxins. The novel findings that <b>cyanines</b> are an unusual class of potent mitochondrial toxins with specific dopaminergic toxicity suggest that their presence in the environment could contribute to the etiology of PD similar to that of MPP+ and rotenone.

Similarly, we are developing {{a new set of}} <b>cyanines</b> that have been designed to achieve highly selective binding to DNA G-quadruplexes with much weaker binding to DNA duplexes. A systematic set of structurally analogous trimethine <b>cyanines</b> has been synthesized and evaluated for quadruplex targeting. The results reveal that elevated quadruplex binding and specificity are highly sensitive to the polymethine chain length, heterocyclic structure and intrinsic charge of the compound. Biophysical experiments show that the compounds display significant selectivity for quadruplex binding with a higher preference for parallel stranded quadruplexes, such as cMYC.

40|$|WOS: 000340269200013 International audienceComputational {{investigation}} of the longest wavelength excitations {{in a series of}} <b>cyanines</b> and linear n-acenes is undertaken with the use of standard spin-conserving linear response time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) as well as its spin-flip variant and a Delta SCF method based on the ensemble DFT. The spin-conserving linear response TD-DFT fails to accurately reproduce the lowest excitation energy in these pi-conjugated systems by strongly overestimating the excitation energies of <b>cyanines</b> and underestimating the excitation energies of n-acenes. The spin-flip TD-DFT is capable of correcting the underestimation of excitation energies of n-acenes by bringing in the non-dynamic electron correlation into the ground state; however, it does not fully correct for the overestimation of the excitation energies of <b>cyanines,</b> for which the non-dynamic correlation does not seem to play a role. The ensemble DFT method employed in this work is capable of correcting for the effect of missing non-dynamic correlation in the ground state of n-acenes and for the deficient description of differential correlation effects between the ground and excited states of <b>cyanines</b> and yields the excitation energies of both types of extended pi-conjugated systems with the accuracy matching high-level ab initio multireference calculations.

40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} a two-state valence-bond model of non-equilibrium {{solvation}} {{effects on the}} excited-state twisting reaction of monomethine <b>cyanines.</b> Suppression of this reaction is thought responsible for environment-dependent fluorescence yield enhancement in these dyes. Fluorescence is quenched because twisting is accompanied via the formation of dark twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) states. For monomethine <b>cyanines,</b> where the ground state is a superposition of structures with different bond and charge localization, there are two possible twisting pathways with different charge localization in the excited state. For parameters corresponding to symmetric monomethines, the model predicts two low-energy twisting channels on the excited-state surface that lead to a manifold of twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) states. For typical monomethines, twisting on the excited state surface will occur with a small barrier or no barrier. Changes in the solvation configuration can differentially stabilize TICT states in channels corresponding to different bonds, and that {{the position of a}} conical intersection between adiabatic states moves in response to solvation to stabilize either one channel or the other. There is a conical intersection seam that grows along the bottom of the excited-state potential with increasing solvent polarity.
