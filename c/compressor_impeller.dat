Aim to assess ultrahigh fatigue life of impellers, fatigue tests up to 109 cycles were carried out by ultrasonic fatigue testing machine to research ultrahigh cycle fatigue (UHCF) behavior and mechanism of FV 520 B-I. The results show that the S-N curve of FV 520 B- I can be divided into two segments at 107 cycles apparently. The fatigue cracks almost all initiated from the surface of an impeller when the fatigue life less than 107 cycles and then from the subsurface inclusion of an impeller when the fatigue life more than 107 cycles. In other words, the fatigue behavior of FV 520 B-I is in accordance with UHCF except one specimen's crack occurred at surface surprisingly when fatigue cycles greater than 107. Through the fracture morphology to be observed and measured, the reasons of “fish eye” area and GBF area formation were discussed, and the relationship of fatigue strength, fatigue life, and characteristic area size were researched by relative models...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSolutionising and {{quenching}} are key {{steps in}} the fabrication of heat treatable aluminium parts such as AA 2618 <b>compressor</b> <b>impellers</b> for turbochargers. Quenching not only dictates the mechanical characteristics of the product but also induces residual stresses that can cause unacceptable distortions during machining and unfavourable stresses in service. Predicting and controlling stress generation during quenching of large AA 2618 forgings is therefore of great interest. Since possible precipitation during quenching may affect the local yield strength of the material and thus impact the level of macro-scale residual stresses, consideration of this phenomenon is required. A phenomenological material model accounting for precipitation in a simple way is used instead of modelling in detail precipitation that occurs during quenching. The required model parameters are identified using {{a limited number of}} tensile tests achieved after representative interrupted cooling paths in a Gleeble machine. This model is used in FE computations of stress generation during quenching of large massive AA 2618 forgings for <b>compressor</b> <b>impellers.</b> The residual strain and stress profiles are compared with neutron diffraction measurements carried out at SALSA and STRESS-SPEC diffractometers in as-quenched and in T 6 conditions.

The bionic form of the blade delayed the boundary layer separation of the impeller suction surface, reducing the turbulent kinetic energy loss and improving internal air flow. The effect of drag reduction was shown to have a close relationship with the dimple size and bionic surface area; the greater the area, the better the drag reduction effect.
