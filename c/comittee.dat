5000|$|The United States Department of Education's {{measurement}} of the status dropout rate is the percentage of 16-24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a high school credential. This rate {{is different from the}} event dropout rate and related measures of the status completion and average freshman completion rates. The status high school dropout rate in 2009 was 8.1%. There are many risk factors for high school dropout. These can be categorized into social and academic risk factors. Members of racial and ethnic minority groups drop out at higher rates than white students, as do those from low-income families, from single-parent households, and from families in which one or both parents also did not complete high school. Students at risk for dropout based on academic risk factors are those who often have a history of absenteeism and grade retention, academic trouble, and more general disengagement from school life. High school dropouts in the U.S. {{are more likely to be}} unemployed, have low-paying jobs, be incarcerated, have children at early ages and/or become single parents. Many of the high school dropouts have blamed their current year of schooling as the main culprit. Freshman tend to attribute 72% of their schooling tenure as [...] "enjoyable," [...] while sophomores hover around 36%, and juniors a mere 3%.
