In all other cases, readers {{are responsible for}} configuring their reading of the text.Texts of liberature that generate multiple statements {{are not limited to}} literary works, and definitely not to electronic texts - the category embraces computer games and other forms of both ergodic and non‐ergodic literature. The former requires a non‐trivial effort to traverse the text. In a classical, non-ergodic literary work, such as The Odyssey, the reader is required only to turn the pages and to interpret the text.In permutative works - those in which the order of text is inconsequential - instead of static function defining the dynamics, something else occurs. An intratextonic dynamic, one that guides the reader throughout the text, occurs. The text is also not determinate, meaning that it lacks a specificity which would hinder interpretation and different readings. The ergodic character of the work is usually determined by the exploratory function of the reader.The parallel character of the works is written into the very core of liberature; the order in which the reader perceives the text governs the way the work is rendered. The interactive capacity of the work becomes, if not an aesthetic category, a way of the reader’s behavior that is written into the text. The work of liberature disrupts the structure of expectations based on a syntagmatic order as well as the strategies characteristic of a linear text. The works of liberature refer to the experience of simultaneousness. Furthermore, liberature as a hybrid genre incorporating the features of numerous media at the same time, including the arts, assumes a quality of simultaneousness as a dominating one.|$|E

40|$|In {{traditional}} principle {{component analysis}} (PCA), {{because of the}} neglect of the dimensions influence between different variables in the system, the selected principal components (PCs) often fail to be representative. While the relative transformation PCA is able to solve the above problem, {{it is not easy}} to calculate the weight for each <b>characteristic</b> <b>variable.</b> In order to solve it, this paper proposes a kind of fault diagnosis method based on information entropy and Relative Principle Component Analysis. Firstly, the algorithm calculates the information entropy for each <b>characteristic</b> <b>variable</b> in the original dataset based on the information gain algorithm. Secondly, it standardizes every variable’s dimension in the dataset. And, then, according to the information entropy, it allocates the weight for each standardized <b>characteristic</b> <b>variable.</b> Finally, it utilizes the relative-principal-components model established for fault diagnosis. Furthermore, the simulation experiments based on Tennessee Eastman process and Wine datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new method...|$|R

It is shown that local OBCs leading to positive results in previous comparative studies do fulfil two requirements : they make use of incoming <b>characteristic</b> <b>variables</b> (privilege the hyperbolic aspect of the equations), and satisfy a consistency relationship between the model solution and some external data. The classical OBCs used in atmosphere and ocean modeling are revisited from this point of view. It is shown that several usual boundary conditions should be avoided, while conditions satisfying the two preceding criteria are pointed out. Finally, the application of these criteria to the design of OBCs for primitive equations is discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} {{definition of}} strong/symmetric hyperbolicity for a second-order system of evolution equations {{is that it}} admits a reduction to first order which is strongly/symmetric hyperbolic. We investigate the general system that admits a reduction to first order and give necessary and sufficient criteria for strong/symmetric hyperbolicity of the reduction {{in terms of the}} principal part of the original second-order system. An alternative definition of strong hyperbolicity is based on the existence of a complete set of <b>characteristic</b> <b>variables,</b> and an alternative definition of symmetric hyperbolicity is based on the existence of a conserved (up to lower order terms) energy. Both these definitions are made without any explicit reduction. Finally, strong hyperbolicity can be defined through a pseudo-differential reduction to first order. We prove that both definitions of symmetric hyperbolicity are equivalent and that all three definitions of strong hyperbolicity are equivalent (in three space dimensions). We show how to impose maximally dissipative boundary conditions on any symmetric hyperbolic second order system. We prove that if the second-order system is strongly hyperbolic, any closed constraint evolution system associated with it is also strongly hyperbolic, and that the <b>characteristic</b> <b>variables</b> of the constraint system are derivatives of a subset of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>variables</b> of the main system, with the same speeds...|$|E
