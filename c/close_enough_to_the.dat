5|$|Gert {{was a large}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{for most of its}} lifespan; it always remained <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116deaths and 16missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170million.|$|E

5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon {{the type and}} energy of the supernova, {{it could be as}} far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} great {{distance}} from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points {{in the night sky}} that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.|$|E

Unlike the imperial escort-armies, these were <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theatre of operations to succour the border troops. But their stationing may have differed little from the location of legions in the 2nd century, even though they apparently wintered inside cities, rather than in purpose-built legionary bases. For example, the two comitatus of Illyricum (East and West) are documented as wintering in Sirmium, which was the site of a major legionary base in the Principate.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was designed to provide affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a self-contained community <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rail network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line {{with the principles of}} the Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, no public houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E
5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|TypeIa supernovae {{are thought}} to be {{potentially}} the most dangerous if they occur <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi (see below). Recent estimates predict that a TypeII supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs (26light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone layer, and there are no such candidates closer than about 500 light years.|$|E

5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, {{command post}} west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 {{soldiers of the}} battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get {{up out of the}} rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|In late 1758 Brilliant {{joined a}} Royal Navy {{squadron}} supporting amphibious raids along the French coastline. In company with other frigates she protected fleet transports and bomb vessels and assisted with shore bombardment in the Battle of Saint Cast on 11 September 1758. The progenitor of the Royal Geographic Society, James Rennell, was a midshipman aboard Brilliant {{during this period}} and produced his first coastal map while the frigate was stationed off Saint Cast. Brilliant played an undistinguished role in this engagement as her draught was too deep for her to approach the shore. By {{the afternoon of the}} battle she was <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach for her crew to witness the surrounding and defeat of the British Grenadier Guards, but was too distant to range her guns onto their French assailants.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda {{teams in}} Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, {{attacked}} the cities' U.S. embassies simultaneously with truck bombs. In Nairobi, the explosion collapsed the nearby Ufundi Building and destroyed the embassy, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans; another 4,000 people were wounded. In Dar es Salaam, the bomber {{was unable to}} get <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> embassy to demolish it, but the blast killed 11 Africans and wounded 85. Bin Laden justified the high-casualty attacks, the largest against the U.S. since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, by claiming they were {{in retaliation for the}} deployment of U.S. troops in Somalia; he also alleged the embassies had devised the Rwandan Genocide and a supposed plan to partition Sudan.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{flotilla}} of Haitians {{once more}} retired to Gonâve and replaced their wounded crewmembers with fresh ones. Seeing that Daniel and Mary and Washington had drifted {{away from the}} convoy, the Haitians set out to attack them. The two civilian vessels, having drifted {{too far from the}} protection of Experiment guns, were abandoned by their crews and passengers who fled to the American warship. The Haitians boarded and plundered these two vessels, carrying them further away from Experiment. Experiment managed to get <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barges to attack them with her cannon but could not pursue them, as two barges had broken away from the main flotilla and were positioned to take Mary and Sea Flower if Experiment left them. Eventually the remnants of the convoy managed to make it to Léogâne, where they were looked after by the American consul.|$|E
5|$|With {{the funds}} {{available}} from the UERL, construction began in July 1902 at Knightsbridge, before the formal approval of the merger of the B and GN Work proceeded quickly, enabling the UERL to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the tunnels had been completed and that track laying was about to begin. Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Except for Finsbury Park, where the platforms were <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface to be accessed by stairs, and Gillespie Road where a long ramp was used, each of the stations with platforms in tube tunnels was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, they issued a hurricane watch for Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch was replaced by a tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was replaced by a tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa was replaced by a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E

5|$|At 1800UTC on August29, Omar {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} with 10‑minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg) as estimated by the JMA; this intensity was maintained for 24hours before a steady weakening trend began. The JTWC estimated higher 1‑minute winds of around 240km/h (150mph), making Omar a super typhoon. Two days later, the typhoon came <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA, who named the storm Lusing. By 1500UTC on September3, the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity through the next day. Heading generally westward, the storm made landfall {{on the east coast}} of Taiwan near Hualien City on September4. After traversing the island in seven hours, Omar exited the coast of Yunlin County and emerged into the Taiwan Strait. The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near Xiamen, Fujian, on September5. Inland, Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west-southwest. It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening, and completely dissipated over northern Vietnam on September9.|$|E
5|$|Because no seismographs were <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nazko swarm zone {{before the}} {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs {{in the area}} to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E
5|$|In essence {{this type}} of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on {{psychological}} shock for effect. Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive. Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. Captain Mercer, who commanded 'G' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, thought the Brunswick troops {{on either side of}} him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.|$|E
