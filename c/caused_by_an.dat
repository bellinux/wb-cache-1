5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E

Bluetongue disease, a disease <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> orbivirus broke out in sheep in France in 2007. Until then the disease had been mainly confined to the Americas, Africa, southern Asia and northern Australia, but it is now an emerging disease around the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Most shipwrecks {{involved}} ships over 20 {{years in}} age. A glut of ships {{of this age}} occurred in the 1980s, <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> overestimate {{of the growth of}} international trade.

5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus.

5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E
5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
50|$|Epidemics {{that occur}} under these {{conditions}} {{are referred to as}} polyetic epidemics and can be <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> both monocyclic and polycyclic pathogens.

A pestilence in China in 311 AD that killed 98% of the population locally was blamed on locusts, {{and may have been}} <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> increase in numbers of rats (and their fleas) that devoured the locust carcases.|$|E
5|$|Chris {{appears in}} the 2010 live-action film , portrayed by Wentworth Miller. In the film, Chris is found trapped in a maximum {{security}} cell after his unit's attempt to control the T-virus in Los Angeles goes haywire; the survivors who find him believe {{him to be a}} prisoner. He is reunited with his sister Claire, who cannot remember him because of memory damage <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> Umbrella mind control device. He, Alice and Claire eventually defeat Albert Wesker and rescue imprisoned survivors being used for Umbrella's experiments. Miller said he prepared for the role by searching for images and videos of Chris on the Internet, as well as doing cardio for endurance.|$|E
5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E

5|$|Extensive but {{superficial}} {{damage was}} <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> IRA bomb that exploded {{close to a}} snack bar at approximately 1:10pm on 10 September 1973, injuring eight people. A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{rejected}} {{the use of}} fiscal policy {{as a tool of}} demand management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he termed the Great Contraction, arguing that it had been <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Gravitationally induced {{irregularities}} in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually {{to the discovery}} of Neptune in 1846, and presumed {{irregularities in}} Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities to be due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass.|$|E

25|$|The dbtL {{mutation}} {{causes the}} period of PER and TIM oscillations, as well as animal behavioral activity, to lengthen to about 27 hours.

This mutation is <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> substitution in the protein sequence (Met-80→Ile mutation). The dbtS mutation causes a PER/TIM oscillation period of 18–20 hours.
