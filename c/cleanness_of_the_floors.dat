To let the speaker judge that Zhangsan’s room is clean, <b>the</b> degrees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cleanness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standardFoc should be lower than <b>the</b> <b>cleanness</b> <b>of</b> Zhangsan’s room.

50|$|Hydrogen is {{used for}} welding of nickel and some {{stainless}} steels, especially thicker pieces. It improves the molten metal fluidity, and enhances <b>cleanness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface. It can however cause hydrogen embrittlement of many alloys and especially carbon steel, so its application is usually limited only to some stainless steels. It is added to argon in amounts typically under 10%. It {{can be added to}} argon-carbon dioxide blends to counteract <b>the</b> oxidizing effects <b>of</b> carbon dioxide. Its addition narrows the arc and increases the arc temperature, leading to better weld penetration. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|R
