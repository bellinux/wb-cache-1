The Legislative Council refused to recognise Campbell as anything more than acting {{in the role of the}} <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments,</b> stating that he was not correctly appointed (the Council was not consulted and the appointment was not Gazetted) and that his duties were never defined. A compromise resolution to this impasse was eventually reached with the passing of The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> Act, 1872, which provided that Campbell would continue to be the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> for as long as he held the office of Clerk of the House of Representatives; after which subsequent appointments would be made [...] "in accordance with the law and usage of the Imperial Parliament". Accordingly, Leonard Stowe, who was appointed Clerk of the Legislative Council in 1865, was appointed as the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> when Campbell retired in 1889.|$|E
