5|$|The {{chelating}} {{ability of}} amino acids {{has been used}} in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies, such as iron <b>chlorosis.</b> These fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and improving the overall health of the plants. The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of drugs and cosmetics.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (<b>chlorosis)</b> of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate <b>chlorosis</b> from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as <b>chlorosis,</b> this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia spinulosa var.spinulosa was {{introduced}} into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by Joseph Banks who supplied seed to Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens and Woburn Abbey among others; var.collina followed in 1800 and var.cunninghamii in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained soils with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from Wianamatta shales may tolerate heavier soils. It is resistant to dieback, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia spinulosa is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as <b>chlorosis,</b> it manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and {{occurs when the}} plant is grown in soils of higher pH. This can also happen where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
25|$|Mondeuse noire is a mid-ripening grape {{variety that}} tends to thrive on stony {{vineyard}} soils that have a high limestone and clay content. The vine can be very vigorous and high yielding which requires the cordons to be pruned short during the winter to keep the vine in check. Among the viticultural hazards that Mondeuse noire is susceptible to include <b>chlorosis,</b> mites, downy and powdery mildew. The vine is also very sensitive to drought conditions which may require irrigation in the vineyard.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{females and}} nymphs suck sap with their {{piercing}} mouthparts. This leads to plant {{damage in the}} form of wilting and <b>chlorosis</b> of the foliage, leaf drop, stunted growth, and sometimes the death of the plant. Fruits such as oranges become lumpy and discolored when the insect feeds on them, and they may fall off the tree. Insects packed with harvested fruits continue to feed, causing more losses during shipping. The mealybug secretes honeydew, which coats leaves and fruits and causes the growth of sooty molds. A layer of mold can reduce the ability of a leaf to perform photosynthesis, and makes fruit unmarketable. The citrus mealybug is also a vector for plant viruses.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{faced by}} many plants is high soil salinity. One {{study shows that}} some EcM fungi are capable of {{improving}} salt tolerance in a species of poplar by altering leaf physiology. Though the symbiotic contact {{takes place at the}} root interface, the fungus was able to alter such leaf traits as concentration of nutrients and phytohormones, and ratios of fatty acids in order to combat leaf <b>chlorosis</b> and shedding. In seagrape seedlings, the EcM fungus Scleroderma bermudense was able to alleviate salt stress. In the seagrape tissue, there was a decrease in both sodium and chlorine, but an increase in potassium and phosphorus, implying this trend might represent a mechanism to explain the observed tolerance. Another study even identified 22 proteins differentially produced under salt stress of the EcM fungus Boletus edulis. They mostly concerned cellular processes such as metabolism, cell cycle control and stress tolerance, with 14 proteins being upregulated and 8 down.|$|E
25|$|Moulin-à-Vent - Wines {{are very}} similar to the nearby Chénas Cru Beaujolais. This region {{produces}} some of the longest-lasting examples of Beaujolais wine, with some wines lasting up to ten years. Some producers will age their Moulin-à-Vent in oak which gives these wines more tannin and structure than other Beaujolais wines. The phrase fûts de chêne (oak casks) will sometimes appear on the wine label of these oak aged wines. The region is noted for the high level of manganese that is in the soil, which can be toxic to grape vines in high levels. The level of toxicity in Moulin-à-Vent does not kill the vine but is enough to cause <b>chlorosis</b> and alter the vine's metabolism to reduce yields severely. The resulting wine from Moulin-à-Vent are the most full bodied and powerful examples in Beaujolais. The vin de garde styles require at least 6 years aging and can last up to 20 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. D.dryina infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and <b>chlorosis</b> caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|E
500|$|A. rubrum does {{very well}} {{in a wide range}} of soil types, with varying textures, moisture, pH, and elevation, {{probably}} more so than any other forest tree in North America. A. rubrums high pH tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places, and it [...] is widespread along the eastern United States. It grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks: granite, gneiss, schist, sandstone, shale, slate, conglomerate, quartzite, and limestone. <b>Chlorosis</b> can occur on very alkaline soils, though otherwise its pH tolerance is quite high. Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds.|$|E
500|$|In C4 plants, sodium is a {{micronutrient}} {{that aids}} metabolism, specifically in regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and synthesis of chlorophyll. In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding {{in the opening}} and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil can limit [...] the uptake of water by decreasing the water potential, which may result in plant wilting; excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition, which in turn causes necrosis and <b>chlorosis.</b> In response, some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots, to store it in cell vacuoles, and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves; excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth. Halophytes have adapted {{to be able to}} flourish in sodium rich environments.|$|E
500|$|Golden wattle is {{cultivated}} in Australia and {{was introduced to}} the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an ornamental plant, it {{has been used as a}} windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) to make a two-layered windbreak. One form widely cultivated was originally collected on Mount Arapiles in western Victoria. It is floriferous, with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild soil salinity. It can suffer yellowing (<b>chlorosis)</b> in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs [...] winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard seed coating.|$|E
2500|$|CBSD is {{characterized}} by severe <b>chlorosis</b> and necrosis on infected leaves, giving them a yellowish, mottled appearance. <b>Chlorosis</b> {{may be associated with}} the veins, spanning from the mid vein, secondary and tertiary veins, or rather in blotches unconnected to veins. [...] Leaf symptoms vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. [...] The growing conditions (i.e. altitude, rainfall quantity), plant age, and the virus species account for these differences. [...] Brown streaks may appear on the stems of the cassava plant. [...] Also, a dry brown-black necrotic rot of the cassava tuber exists, which may progress from a small lesion to the whole root. [...] Finally, the roots can become constricted due to the tuber rot, stunting growth. Typically the affected plants do not possess all of these characteristics, but those that are severely affected may. Farmers may be unaware of their infected cassava crops until they are harvested and see the tuber lesions because leaves are asymptomatic.|$|E
2500|$|Italian {{physician}} Angelo Dubini was {{the modern-day}} discoverer of the worm in 1838 after an autopsy of a peasant woman. Dubini published details in 1843 and identified the species as A. duodenale. [...] Working in the Egyptian medical system in 1852 German physician Theodor Bilharz, drawing upon {{the work of}} colleague Wilhelm Griesinger, found these worms during autopsies and went a step further in linking them to local endemic occurrences of <b>chlorosis,</b> which would probably be called iron deficiency anemia today.|$|E
2500|$|The phlegm of humorism is {{far from}} the same thing as phlegm as it is defined today. Nobel laureate Charles Richet MD, when {{describing}} humorism's [...] "phlegm or pituitary secretion" [...] in 1910 asked rhetorically, [...] "...this strange liquid, which is the cause of tumours, of <b>chlorosis,</b> of rheumatism, and cacochymia — where is it? [...] Who will ever see it? [...] Who has ever seen it? [...] What can we say of this fanciful classification of humours into four groups, of which two are absolutely imaginary?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Philippine {{downy mildew}} {{has been most}} studied on maize for its {{economic}} significance, but it shares similar symptoms with other hosts. [...] A characteristic <b>chlorosis,</b> which develops {{from the loss of}} chlorophyll, and the downiness that gives the genus its popular name, are the two most common symptoms. The species also cause the growth of new leaves to be narrow and rigid, a stunting of shoots and roots, decreased production of pollen, and sterile and malformed ears. Mycelium extends throughout the entire plant except for the roots.|$|E
2500|$|Liquidambar styraciflua is {{a popular}} {{ornamental}} and forestal tree, cultivated for its distinctive foliage and intense autumn colors. [...] It is commonly grown throughout its native North American range {{as well as many}} other temperate parts of the world. The species grows best in moist, acidic loam or clay soil, and tolerates poor drainage. It typically grows with other coastal plain species such as willow oak and sweetbay magnolia. [...] Its salt tolerance is moderate. <b>Chlorosis</b> can develop on alkaline soil, especially where organic matter is low. Also, the American sweetgum tree doesn't grow well in shady areas.|$|E
2500|$|A {{considerable}} {{range of}} soil pH is tolerated by white spruce (Nienstaedt 1957). Thrifty stands of white spruce in Manitoba have developed on soils of pH 7.6 at only 10nbsp&cm {{below the surface}}, and pH 8.4 at 43nbsp&cm below the surface (Stoeckeler 1938, USDA Forest Service 1938); rooting depth in those soils was at least 81nbsp&cm. An abundant calcium supply is common to most white spruce locations in New York state (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). <b>Chlorosis</b> was observed in young white spruce in heavily limed nursery soils at about pH 8.3 (Stone, cited by Nienstaedt 1957). Wilde (1966) gave 4.7 to 6.5 as the approximate optimum range of pH for white spruce in Wisconsin, but optimum growth seems possible at pH levels up to 7.0 and perhaps higher (Sutton 1968). Alluvium on the floodplains of northern rivers shows pH levels from 5.0 to 8.2 (Zasada et al. 1977). High-lime ecotypes may exist (Pelletier 1966), and in Canada Forest Section B8 the presence of balsam poplar and white spruce {{on some of the}} moulded moraines and clays seems to be correlated with the considerable lime content of these materials (Rowe 1972, [...] Stiell 1976), while calcareous soils are favourable sites for northern outliers of white spruce (Hustich 1953).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chlorosis</b> is briefly {{mentioned}} in Casanovas Histoire de ma vie: [...] "I do not know, {{but we have}} some physicians who say that <b>chlorosis</b> in girls {{is the result of}} that pleasure onanism indulged in to excess".|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorosis</b> is a {{condition}} in which leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll, turning them yellow. <b>Chlorosis</b> can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of iron—called iron chlorosis—or by a shortage of magnesium or nitrogen. Soil pH sometimes plays a role in nutrient-caused chlorosis; many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pH levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this. <b>Chlorosis</b> can also be caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria and fungal infections, or sap-sucking insects.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, {{physician}} Sir Andrew Clark of London Hospital {{proposed a}} physiological cause for <b>chlorosis,</b> tying its onset {{to the demands}} placed on the bodies of adolescent girls by growth and menarche. In 1891, Frank Wedekinds play Spring Awakening referenced the disease. In 1895, University of Edinburgh pathologist Ralph Stockman built upon experiments demonstrating that inorganic iron contributed to hemoglobin synthesis to show that <b>chlorosis</b> {{could be explained by}} a deficiency in iron brought on by loss of menstrual blood and an inadequate diet. Despite the work of Stockman and the effectiveness of iron in treating the symptoms of <b>chlorosis,</b> debate about its cause continued into the 1930s. A character in T. C. Boyles The Road to Wellville suffers from <b>chlorosis,</b> and the narrator describes her green skin and black lips.|$|E
