40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the price}} convergence in the Czech Republic and other Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries towards the European Union (EU). Cross-country comparisons {{based on the}} International Comparison Project (ICP) 1999 are used. The authors conclude that in a benchmark convergence scenario, the equilibrium real exchange rate appreciation of the <b>Czech</b> <b>koruna</b> (<b>CZK)</b> should reach roughly 1. 5 - 2. 0 percent a year. They also warn, however, {{that there may be}} additional sources of real appreciation such as terms-of-trade changes or price deregulations, which may lead to a higher pace in the medium run. Studying a more detailed breakdown of commodities, the authors find that no clear distinction can be made between tradable and non-tradable goods, the 'degree of non-tradability' varying between 10 and 85 percent. The implications of this for differences in the structures of relative prices in the CEE countries compared with the EU are analysed. The paper concludes that it may take about 15 years for the Czech relative price structure to converge to the least-developed EU countries.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of reference interest rates in the Czech Republic after the currency crisis of May 1997 and covers the period to the years 2002 / 2003 (that is to the time just before the country’s entry into the European Union in May 2004) when the currency exchange of the <b>Czech</b> <b>koruna</b> (<b>CZK)</b> and interest rates were stabilised. The relatively high volatility of Czech reference interest rates in the late 1990 ’s influenced the development of company debt financing, forcing companies to become more sophisticated and dynamic in their use of debt instruments and hedging tools as they attempt to manage the subsequent interest rate risk. In this paper, the situation in three model corporations is also described – the first, a solvent company with a foreign owner (Moravian-Silesian Heating Company – MSHC, renamed to Dalkia Morava in 2002), the second, a solvent company with the Czech state as its majority owner (North Moravian Power Company – NMPC), and the third with domestic capital, which had economic problems during the given period (Vítkovice, a. s.), plus a big insurance company as a specific and very important institutional investor in a domestic financial markets...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the fiscal {{implications of the}} changes in personal income tax implemented in the Czech Republic in January 2006. In addition to evaluating the direct effect of this tax reform, our analysis takes into account its employment effect on the government budget due to individuals entering or leaving employment. We first estimate the probability of working (labor supply) {{as a function of the}} effective net wage and then simulate the impact {{of the changes in}} paid taxes and received benefits on employment. We find that a 10 percent rise in the net wage increases the probability of working by 0. 55 and 0. 18 percentage points for women and men respectively. These estimates suggest that the employment effect is unlikely to substantially alleviate the fall in net budget revenues. We predict that, for the sub-population of prime age employees, net government revenues decline by roughly 8 billion <b>Czech</b> <b>korunas</b> (<b>CZK)</b> as a consequence of the implemented income tax cuts. The employment effect counteracts the decline by only CZK 0. 4 billion. The stimulating effect of the tax reform on employment is reduced by the current benefit system: the incentive to work due to the higher after-tax wage is partially offset by the fall in social benefits once people start working.

We find that the <b>Czech</b> <b>koruna</b> was on average undervalued over the period 1994 to 2004 by about 7 percent with respect to the estimated BEER.

40|$|In 2012, the <b>Czech</b> <b>koruna</b> celebrated {{twenty years}} since its inception. During {{this time it}} went through systems of various {{exchange}} rates. While fixed system was implemented {{at the beginning of}} its existence, since 1997 the <b>Czech</b> <b>Koruna</b> has moved to a system that allows greater exchange rate volatility. Businesses must cope with this volatility, and therefore seek appropriate methods of forecasting future exchange rate movements. One of the methods is forecast by forward rates. The indisputable advantage of this method is the low cost associated with the detection of forward exchange rate for the most traded currency pairs. The euro and dolar are the most important currencies in the Czech republic for foreign trade. Con-sequently it is necessary to forecast exchange rates for the <b>Czech</b> <b>Koruna</b> and USD and Euro. One of the tools for forecasting the future spot rate is the forward rate.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{estimate}} bilateral equilibrium exchange rate of the <b>Czech</b> <b>koruna</b> relative to Euro and {{to determine if the}} Czech currency is undervalued or overvalued relative to the market equilibrium. We employ fundamental (FEER) and behavioral (BEER) equilibrium exchange rate models, which enables to measure the currency position relative to the market rate. To tackle the uncertainty of the implied equilibrium exchange rates that differ among alternative specifications of the models, we aggregate the estimates via principal components analysis. The perception on the market is that <b>Czech</b> <b>koruna</b> is undervalued, since the intervention regime imposed by the Czech National Bank in the 2013, was defending the exchange rate floor of 27 <b>Czech</b> <b>korunas</b> to Euro. Then, we extend conventional specifications of BEER models for variables representing exchange rate interventions and forward rates offered on the market because both can have protracted effects not only on spot rates but on adjustment towards long-term equilibrium as well. The original models with fundamental factors show equilibrium exchange rate near to 25 CZK/EUR. However, extended models with interventions show higher equilibrium exchange rate, near to 27 CZK/EUR. Thus, there is possibility of slow adjustment near to the [...] ...|$|R

Our empirical approach is tantamount to the behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER), popularized by MacDonald (1997) and Clark and MacDonald (1998), in that the Czech real exchange rate vis-a`-vis the euro is regressed on the dual productivity differential; and the net foreign assets position, based on which actual and total misalignment figures, are derived in a time-series context. In other words, we check {{the quality of the}} Czech BEER. We also study the impact of a possible initial undervaluation on the estimated equilibrium exchange rate.
