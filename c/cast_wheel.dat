50|$|Its {{popularity}} in South East Asia, mainly in Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines, {{is due to}} its price—around US$1850 (94,000 to 95,001 pesos or around 16,500,001 rupiah in Indonesia). The main features are full-length front shock, rear monoshock suspension, six-speed short gear ratio transmission, dual camshaft engine, lightweight chassis construction, alloy <b>cast</b> <b>wheel,</b> large-diameter front disc brake, and a rear disc brake, which is rarely found in underbones. The top speed of stock Raider 150 is between 125 and 155 kilometers per hour.|$|E
50|$|Both {{coupled axles}} {{as well as}} the {{carrying}} axle were fixed rigidly into the frame. The wheel spokes were made of forged bar steel. Later <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> spokes were fitted. Because it had an inside drive the second axle had to be designed as a crank axle, which is remarkable, bearing in mind the manufacturing technology of that time. A technical innovation was the trailing axle which had been intended by Schubert mainly to improve the locomotive's riding qualities.It was subsequently determined to be superfluous and was removed in 1840. From 1842, however, the operation of twin-axled locomotives was banned on safety grounds, so the trailing axle had to be refitted.The brake was initially a screw-operated band brake which acted on the two driven wheels from the top. Because this did not prove suitable due to high wear and tear, it was later removed.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{into account}} their {{generally}} inferior quality compared to forged wheels, the main advantage of <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> is {{the relatively low}} cost of production. And although <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> are more affordable than forged <b>wheels,</b> <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are designed to be}} heavier than forged wheels for a given required load. Manufacturing defects found in <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> include cavities or porosity and a different metallurgical microstructure, entailing larger grain size. <b>Cast</b> <b>wheels</b> will tend to fracture upon overbearing high-speed impact, whereas forged wheels will tend to bend.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> {{had already}} been used on {{automobiles}} previously, {{it was not until}} the 1927 that the Böhmerland, a motorcycle built in Czechoslovakia was fitted with <b>cast</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha RD400C sold in 1976 was {{the first}} {{motorcycle}} by a major manufacturer to be fitted with <b>cast</b> <b>wheels.</b> The <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> weighed 100 g more than the spoked wheels fitted to its RD350 predecessor.|$|R
50|$|The Comstar was Honda's {{replacement}} for the tension spoked wheel. Whilst spoked wheels offered a degree of flexibility to help absorb road imperfections, they also required periodic maintenance to ensure correct spoke tension and required the fitment of an inner tube. Honda claimed the Comstar design combined {{the strength of a}} <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> but allowed a predetermined level of radial flex like spoked wheels. Comstar wheels also allowed the fitment of tubeless tyres which, like other alloy wheels, helped to reduce unsprung mass, although not all models fitted with Comstars had tubeless tyres.Honda debuted Comstars on their FIM European Motorcycle Endurance Championship winning RCB-941 production endurance race bikes for the 1976 season. Honda first fitted Comstars to its road going motorcycles in 1977 on models such as the CB400T Dream, CB750F2 and the later flagship CBX1000. A special lightweight version was also used on HRC's failed oval-piston four stroke GP motorcycle, the NR500, and the later NS500 two-stroke ridden by Freddie Spencer.|$|E
50|$|Forged {{magnesium}} {{wheels are}} manufactured by mechanically deforming (forging) a prefabricated rod using a powerful forging press. Several somewhat different forging techniques exist, {{all of them}} comprising a multi-step process/operation. The resultant forging is subsequently machined (lathe-turned and milled) into the final shape of a wheel by removing excess metal from the forged blank. A forged magnesium wheel is 25 percent lighter than <b>cast</b> <b>wheel.</b> The main disadvantage of forged wheels is the high manufacturing cost. And due to the typically high costs of finished wheels, forged wheels are still rarely purchased by non-professional drivers for regular road use. But since forged wheels can be designed to be lighter than cast wheels for a given load, forged wheels do offer fuel economy and other distinct advantages. The forging process allows alignment of the metal fibers and optimization of the directional pattern arrangement along the spokes of a wheel. This, along with the smaller grain size, results in superior mechanical properties and performance characteristics that make forged magnesium wheels widely popular both for motor racing and with knowledgeable driving enthusiasts.|$|E
50|$|The {{pre-production}} wooden-spoke wheels {{were replaced}} beginning in 1936 with more durable light-metal <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> discs and removable tires {{that made the}} howitzer easier to tow. The motorized version was fitted with wider solid-rubber tires. A combination of wooden wheels and rubber tires was a frequent occurrence. Towards {{the end of the}} war, even older wooden wheels from the leFH 16 were used. The howitzer was designed from the start to be transported either by horse or motor vehicle. The heavy weight made horse-drawn transport difficult, especially in the mud and snow of the Eastern Front. The motorized version was attached directly without a limber to either a SdKfz 6 or Sd.Kfz. 11 prime mover and could easily achieve a march speed of 40 km/h, equivalent to a day's march by a horse-drawn battery. Although the SdKfz 6 was intended as the primary motor transport for the howitzer, the lighter SdKfz 11 could also achieve the same task. A motorized leFH 18 battery had a radius of action 10 times greater than a horse-drawn one and required 49 less personnel.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> {{were not}} easily {{compatible}} with drum brakes.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the early}} 1980s Honda had begun {{equipping}} newer models with <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> called ComCast [...] stating [...] "...that technology has solved the casting porosity {{problem and that}} <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> are now used on Hondas for styling and marketing reasons". ComCast wheels were a combination of pressed-together cast aluminium hub and spokes with a hollow extruded aluminium rim.|$|R
50|$|The RD400C was {{the first}} {{motorcycle}} by a major manufacturer to be fitted with <b>cast</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their {{construction}} was a wooden plank, around two feet long. It rode {{on a single}} double-flanged wheel, with a V-shaped iron slipper on {{the rear of the}} plank. It was balanced by an iron outrigger to one side, with a pipe-shaped roller over its end. This wide roller also allowed for slight variations in gauge. To control the car there was a hand brake. Pulling upwards on this applied an iron brake to the tread of the wheel. Despite the simplicity of the idea, the cars were not unsophisticated in their manufacture. Most was made by the smith, but the <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> was made by a foundry in Portmadoc. The brake linkage comprised several pieces, each hand-forged. The brake handle was detachable and fitted over the main lever. It was decoratively forged with a lightweight curve. When not in use it was carried in the quarryman's pocket, a primitive form of anti-theft measure. This could have tragic consequences; one of the few fatal accidents was to children in the 1920s who crashed into a slate wagon through not having the brake handle. For reasons of safety, later operation of the cars became more organised, a responsible mine foreman leading the descent as 'captain', and setting a maximum speed. At times cavalcades of up to two hundred cars would descend in close procession.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame is}} a full steel duplex {{swingarm}} design, with Ceriani rear suspension, and Marzocchi front forks. The early models had a twin leading shoe drum brake up front (Strada: 200 mm drum, Sport: 230 mm drum) that was notoriously grabby on the Borrani spoked wheels, but these were replaced with a single chromed 260 mm Grimeca disc in 1976, and later optional double discs. The rear drum brake was replaced in the early 1980s with a Grimeca disc. Switchgear, tail and brake lights were the standard CEV model used on many Italian motorcycles of the 1970s. The month and year of manufacture is embossed in small figures {{on the side of}} each <b>cast</b> <b>wheel,</b> near where one of the seven cast spokes meets the rim. The helical gear transmission was a six-speed, with a top gear ratio of 1:0.954, making it akin to an overdrive. The transmission was engaged with a six-plate dry clutch, making a characteristic rattle similar to Ducatis when disengaged. Secondary drive was by a 5/8 x 3/8-inch chain to a rear sprocket with cush drive. Gear change is by right foot and the rear brake operated by left foot. Engine lubrication was by oil pump to the crankshaft but no force lubrication went to the rocker gear. Instead, crankcase pressure forced oil mist up the short pushrod tunnels to the rocker covers, where two 'crow's feet' allowed mist to condense and drip onto the rocker gear. Although ingenious, it required riders to gentle warm up their engines before using maximum revs, redlined at 9,200 rpm. Oil filtration was by plastic mesh filter.|$|E

50|$|Motorcycle {{wheels are}} made to cope with radial and axial forces. They also provide a way of {{mounting}} other critical components such as the brakes, final drive and suspension. Wheels, and anything directly connected to them, {{are considered to be}} unsprung mass. Traditionally motorcycles used spoked wheels with inner tubes and pneumatic tyres. Although <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> were first used on a motorcycle in 1927, it would not be until the 1970s that mainstream manufacturers would start to introduce <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> on their roadgoing motorcycles. Spoked wheels are usually made with steel spokes and steel or aluminium rims. <b>Cast</b> <b>wheels</b> are predominantly made from aluminium or an alloy of, but can also be made from more exotic materials such as magnesium or carbon fibre.|$|R

50|$|High-performance {{motorcycles}} {{began to}} use <b>cast</b> alloy <b>wheels</b> (usually aluminum but sometimes magnesium) {{as early as the}} Münch Mammoth, with its single cast-elektron rear wheel which was shown at the Intermot motorcycle show at Cologne in late 1966. Elliott Morris began producing seven-spoke <b>cast</b> magnesium racing <b>wheels</b> in 1973. In November 1974 the Van Veen was exhibited at the Cologne motorcycle show with front and rear <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> and triple Brembo disc brakes for their 1975 Model Year rotary-engined OCR1000 machines. Aftermarket <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> for Japanese makes having drum rear and front disc brakes were available in UK from late 1974. In 1975, the Moto Guzzi 850 Le Mans and the MV Agusta 750 America were available with alloy wheels as an option.|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{evaluation of}} fatigue and fracture behaviour of commercially produced cast 13; and forged rail wheels {{has been made}} using specimens extracted from various locations of 13; the wheel quadrant. A systematic investigation in the web and rim regions of the wheel 13; quadrant with various notch orientations showed that the forged material exhibited a 13; better intrinsic resistance to fatigue crack growth than the cast material. Since linear 13; elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) based fracture toughness could not be validated for 13; both the cast and forged wheel material, elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) based 13; characteristic fracture toughness was used. Results showed that fracture resistance of the 13; forged material is superior {{to that of the}} cast material. <b>Cast</b> <b>wheel</b> specimens exhibited 13; unstable crack extension in comparison to substantial stable tearing in forged specimens. 13; Microstructural and fractographic analyses showed that the <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> material contained 13; large amounts of inclusions. The poor fracture resistance of <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> material is therefore 13; attributed to the inferior material quality...|$|E
40|$|The A 356 {{aluminum}} alloy wheels were produced by thixo-forging {{combined with a}} low superheat casting process. The as-cast microstructure, microstructure evolution during reheating and the mechanical properties of thixo-forged wheels made from the A 356 {{aluminum alloy}} were studied. The {{results show that the}} A 356 aluminum alloy round billet with fine, uniform and non-dendritic grains can be obtained when the melt is cast at 635 篊. When the round billet is reheated at 600 篊 for 60 min, the non-dendritic grains are changed into spherical ones and the round billet can be easily thixo-forged into wheels. The tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of the thixo-forged wheels with T 6 heat treatment are 327. 6 MPa, 228. 3 MPa and 7. 8 %, respectively, which are higher than those of a <b>cast</b> <b>wheel.</b> It is suggested that the thixo-forging combined with the low superheat casting process is an effective technique to produce aluminum alloy wheels with high mechanical properties...|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} a study of low- {{pressure}} die casting process in Southern Aluminium Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of Comalco in Tasmania. The first major stage in the wheel manufacturing process is casting. Wheels for automobile companies such as Nissan, Ford and Mazda are cast using a low-pressure die casting process. A casting cycle involves filling of the dies with molten aluminium solidifying the aluminium in the dies, ejecting the solidified castings from the dies, quenching the castings to a temperature close to room temperature and delivering the castings to the operator for further processing. When running at full capacity, each casting machine is capable of producing two castings simultaneously every six minutes. Each metal transfer into the caster crucible yields enough volume of metal {{for the production of}} approximately sixty wheels. The operator that initiates the casting cycle is responsible for some further wheel processing operations. These operations include the stamping of each <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> with a melt number stamp, manually removing any visible marks from the front face of each wheel and removing excess aluminium from the top and bottom rim of each wheel and finally, checking the castings for distortion using a distortion gauge. Each time the caster crucible is filled, an alloy sample is taken from the crucible and examined spectrographically to determine alloy composition. The alloy composition is recorded and the melt number is changed. The melt number of each <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> can then be related to an exact alloy composition. A distortion gauge placed on the front face of the wheel will inform the operator of the wheel distortion. A wheel that it badly distorted, greater than plus or minus half a millimeter out of plane is rejected. Further there is limitations on the minimum thickness that can be cast on these wheels. The conditions to achieve the minimum thickness in effective casting have been established in industry over a series of investigations. This project highlights the conditions necessary to maintain minimum thickness in wheel castings, produced by low-pressure die casting, by taking into consideration various process variables. The stress analysis and solidification rates have been studied as a part of this investigation using finite element and finite difference methods. The experimental investigation in achieving minimum effective casting thickness complements the results from the finite element investigations. The experiments were carried out over 500 wheels for Nissan, Ford and Mazda wheels to understand the effect of process variables on cast dimensions This investigation gives {{a better understanding of the}} major process variables that control the thickness in casting process. The outcomes of this thesis are extremely useful for practicing engineers in achieving minimum effective thickness in aluminium wheel castings, using low pressure die casting, in modern manufacturing industry...|$|E
