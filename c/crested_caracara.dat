5|$|While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, Joel Asaph Allen {{argued that}} the painted vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed {{elements}} of different species to create this bird. Allen {{pointed out that the}} birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's. For example, Bartram observed the birds following wildfires to scavenge for burned insects and box turtles. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking. The northern <b>crested</b> <b>caracara</b> (Caracara cheriway) was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if the painted vulture is accepted as a Sarcoramphus. However, Francis Harper {{argued that the}} bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.|$|E

500|$|Many birds {{migrate to}} the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Year-round {{residents}} include least grebe, brown pelican, neotropic cormorant, white-faced ibis, roseate spoonbill, black-bellied whistling-duck, mottled duck, white-tailed hawk, <b>crested</b> <b>caracara,</b> pauraque, golden-fronted woodpecker, great kiskadee, green jay, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, seaside sparrow, and bronzed cowbird. [...] The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay. Despite {{the fact that there}} were only 15 in 1900, over 180 are found in the wild today. The whooping crane's and other birds' survival depends on the availability of blue crab. Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population.|$|E

50|$|Caracara is a genus in the Family Falconidae and the Subfamily of Polyborinae. This genus {{consists}} of two extant, the Northern and Southern <b>Crested</b> <b>Caracaras,</b> and one extinct species, the Guadalupe Caracara.

50|$|Several {{potential}} predators are known, being {{almost exclusively}} avian raptors. These include white-throated hawks (Buteo albigula), variable hawks (Buteo polyosoma), bicolored hawks (Accipiter bicolor), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and southern <b>crested</b> <b>caracaras</b> (Caracara plancus) (the latter {{most likely a}} predator only of young). When they encounter these potential predators while not nesting, Magellanic woodpecker usually respond by being quiet and staying still. However, raptorial birds are often aggressively attacked during the nesting season.|$|R
5000|$|The {{northern}} <b>crested</b> <b>caracara</b> (Caracara cheriway), {{also called}} the northern caracara and <b>crested</b> <b>caracara,</b> is a bird of prey in the family Falconidae.

It has also been known as Audubon's caracara. As with its relatives, the northern caracara was formerly placed in the genus Polyborus. Unlike the Falco falcons in the same family, the caracaras are not fast-flying aerial hunters, but are rather sluggish and often scavengers.|$|E

[...] Although these animals are known to opportunistically feed on birds, no instances of predation on maguari storks have been hitherto recorded; but such predation is considered likely.|$|R
500|$|The fruit are {{dispersed}} by animals; fruit {{which are}} not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by bruchid beetles. Certain species of Attalea have been mentioned as examples of [...] "anachronistic" [...] species which are adapted for dispersal by now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna. On Maracá Island, Roraima, in the Brazilian Amazon, Attalea maripa fruit were consumed by tapirs, collared peccaries, deer and primates. Rodents, including agoutis, fed upon the fruit and, as the fruit availability declined, they fed on the seeds. Other dispersers of Attalea fruit include <b>Crested</b> <b>Caracaras</b> which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A.phalerata in the Brazilian Pantanal.|$|R

40|$|Hawks and owls are {{birds of}} prey and are {{frequently}} referred to as raptors— a term that includes the falcons, eagles, vultures, kites, ospreys, northern harriers, and <b>crested</b> <b>caracaras.</b> There are two main groups of hawks: accipiters and buteos. Accipiters are the forest-dwelling hawks. North American species include the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Cooper’s hawk (Accipiter cooperii), and sharpshinned hawk (Accipiter striatus). The buteos are known as the broadwinged or soaring hawks. They are the most commonly observed raptors in North America. Typical species include the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), Swainson’s hawk (Buteo swainsoni), rough-legged hawk (Buteo lagopus), and ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis) ...|$|R
