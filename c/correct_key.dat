25|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock is a lock {{mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the <b>correct</b> <b>key.</b> Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E

500|$|The song's time {{signature}} is 4/4 throughout, and {{the musical}} key is F major.

Graphically, Orr and Zzap!64s Phil King found the game [...] "primitive", though [...] "adequate". More troubling to several reviewers was the game's copy protection system. [...] Ekholm was not pleased {{that he had to}} unfold a flimsy poster to identify the requested city. [...] His copy was falling apart after several identifications. [...] The game further frustrated him when it failed to acknowledge the <b>correct</b> <b>key.</b> [...] The provided hints were incorrect, a situation also experienced by the Lessers.

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss how}} to recover RSA secret keys from noisy ana-log data {{obtained}} through physical attacks such as cold boot and side channel attacks. Many {{studies have focused}} on recovering <b>correct</b> secret <b>keys</b> from noisy binary data. Obtaining noisy binary keys typically in-volves rst observing the analog data and then obtaining the binary data through quantization process that discards much information pertaining to the <b>correct</b> <b>keys.</b> In this paper, we propose two algorithms for recov-ering <b>correct</b> secret <b>keys</b> from noisy analog data, which are generalized variants of Paterson et al. 's algorithm. Our algorithms fully exploit the analog information. More precisely, consider observed data which fol-lows the Gaussian distribution with mean (1) b and variance 2 for a secret key bit b. We propose a polynomial time algorithm based on the maximum likelihood approach and show that it can recover secret keys if < 1 : 767. The rst algorithm works only if the noise distribution is explicitly known. The second algorithm does not need to know the ex-plicit form of the noise distribution. We implement the rst algorithm and verify its effectiveness. This is the full version of [7]...|$|R

50|$|The {{business}} {{keys and}} their associations are structural attributes, forming {{the skeleton of}} the data model. The data vault method has {{as one of its}} main axioms that real business keys only change when the business changes and are therefore the most stable elements from which to derive the structure of a historical database. If you use these keys as the backbone of a data warehouse, you can organize the rest of the data around them. This means that choosing the <b>correct</b> <b>keys</b> for the hubs is of prime importance for the stability of your model. The keys are stored in tables with a few constraints on the structure. These key-tables are called hubs.|$|R
50|$|Let L be {{the element}} {{with the largest}} <b>correct</b> <b>key</b> among the {{elements}} we removed. The stored key of L is possibly larger than its <b>correct</b> <b>key</b> (if L was corrupted), and even this larger value is smaller than all the stored keys of the remaining elements in the heap (as we were removing minimums). Therefore, the <b>correct</b> <b>key</b> of L is smaller than the remaining n/3 uncorrupted elements in the soft heap. Thus, L divides the elements somewhere between 33%/66% and 66%/33%. We then partition the set about L using the partition algorithm from quicksort and apply the same algorithm again to either the set of numbers less than L or the set of numbers greater than L, neither of which can exceed 2n/3 elements. Since each insertion and deletion requires O(1) amortized time, the total deterministic time is T(n) = T(2n/3) + O(n). Using case 3 of the master theorem (with ε=1 and c=2/3), we know that T(n) = Θ(n).|$|E

50|$|The {{output of}} a {{cryptographic}} hash function, {{also known as}} a message digest, can provide strong assurances about data integrity, whether changes of the data are accidental (e.g., due to transmission errors) or maliciously introduced. Any modification to the data will likely be detected through a mismatching hash value. Furthermore, given some hash value, it is infeasible to find some input data (other than the one given) that will yield the same hash value. If an attacker can change not only the message but also the hash value, then a keyed hash or message authentication code (MAC) can be used for additional security. Without knowing the key, it is infeasible for the attacker to calculate the <b>correct</b> <b>keyed</b> hash value for a modified message.|$|R
