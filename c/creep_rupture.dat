50|$|Polymer {{fracture}} is {{the study}} of the fracture surface of an already failed material to determine the method of crack formation and extension in polymers both fiber reinforced and otherwise.

The low strength of polymers compared to theoretically predicted values are mainly due to the many microscopic imperfections found in the material. These defects namely dislocations, crystalline boundaries, amorphous interlayers and block structure can all lead to the non-uniform distribution of mechanical stress.|$|E

This paper proposes a new <b>creep</b> <b>rupture</b> assessment method under the Linear Matching Method framework, where the <b>creep</b> <b>rupture</b> limit is evaluated through an extended shakedown analysis using the revised yield stress, which is determined by the minimum of the yield stress of the material and the individual <b>creep</b> <b>rupture</b> stress at each integration point.
