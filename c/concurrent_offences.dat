40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the profile of}} offenders who commenced the Blacktown Traffic Offender Program between 1994 and 2011 and investigates which factors predict re-offending. Method: Descriptive statistics were {{used to examine the}} profile of program participants. Logistic regression models were used to determine which participant characteristics were associated with an increased risk of reconviction (for any offence and any traffic offence). Results: Fifteen per cent of participants committed a new offence in the 2 years following program commencement, and 11 per cent committed a further traffic offence. Being male, aged between 16 and 20 years, Indigenous, having a prior criminal record, and having 3 or more <b>concurrent</b> <b>offences</b> were all associated with an increased risk of being convicted for any further offence. Being aged between 16 and 20 years, living in more disadvantaged areas, having a prior criminal record, and having 3 or more <b>concurrent</b> <b>offences</b> were associated with an increased likelihood of being convicted for a new traffic offence. Approximately two-thirds of offenders who present with 4 or more risk factors go on to commit any new offence and one-third commit a new traffic offence. Conclusion: Results suggests that certain individual characteristics indicate an elevated risk of reconviction for any further offence, and further traffic offences in the 2 years following commencement of the Blacktown Traffic Offender Program. Offenders who present with multiple (4 or more) risk factors are at significantly greater risk of reconviction...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various statutory presumptions surrounding bail {{and the risk of}} bail refusal. Method: A total 37, 165 cases where defendants were either granted or refused bail by a Local Court were analysed to determine what impact the presumptions surrounding bail had on the risk of bail refusal. Controls included in the analysis were age; gender; Indigenous status of the defendant; number of concurrent offences; the number of prior criminal convictions; whether the offender had a previous conviction for a breach offence; the number of days between the date of first court appearance and the date of finalisation; whether the defendant had legal representation in the current case; and the plea in the current case at time of finalisation. Results: After adjusting for the effects of other factors, the risk of bail refusal was found to be higher for those charged with offences where there was a presumption against bail or where bail should only be granted in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The risk of bail was also elevated for those with a larger number of prior convictions and/or <b>concurrent</b> <b>offences.</b> Three main anomalies were noted. Firstly, nearly half of those falling into the ‘exceptional circumstance’ category were on bail at their final court appearance. Secondly, factors such as prior criminal record, number of <b>concurrent</b> <b>offences</b> and delay in finalising a case, exert a much stronger influence on the risk of bail refusal than the presumptions surrounding bail. Thirdly, the bail refusal risk was higher for those charged with offences where there was no presumption for or against bail than for those charged with offences involving a presumption against bail. Conclusion: The NSW Bail Act may need some simplification and clarification...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} prison on re-offending among offenders convicted of either non-aggravated assault or burglary. Method: The effect of prison on re-offending was examined by comparing time to re-conviction among 96 matched pairs of convicted burglars and 406 matched pairs of offenders convicted of non-aggravated assault. One member of each pair received a prison sentence, while the other received some form of non-custodial sanction. All offenders were matched on offence type, number of <b>concurrent</b> <b>offences,</b> prior prison experience, number of prior appearances in court and bail status at final appearance. Cox regression was used to control for age, age of first conviction, gender, race, plea, number of counts of the principal offence, legal representation and prior breach of a court order. In the case of non-aggravated assault an additional control was included: prior conviction for a violent offence. Results: Offenders who received a prison sentence were slightly more likely to re-offend than those who received a non-custodial penalty. The difference was just significant for non-aggravated assault but not significant for burglary. Conclusion: There {{is no evidence that}} prison deters offenders convicted of burglary or non-aggravated assault. There is some evidence that prison increases the risk of offending amongst offenders convicted of non-aggravated assault but further research with larger samples is needed to confirm the results...|$|E

40|$|This {{study shows}} {{the pattern of}} {{sentencing}} {{for a range of}} domestic violence offences in the NSW Local and District Criminal Courts, and identifies the characteristics which influence whether offenders guilty of domestic violence- related assault receive a sentence of imprisonment. Method: Data were sourced from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research’s recorded criminal incident database and Reoffending Database. Domestic violence-related offences finalised in NSW Local and District Courts between January 2008 and June 2009 were identified by reference to the original police report and the use of domestic violence-specific law part codes. A multivariable model was developed to identify the factors influential in the sentencing of domestic assault offenders. Results: Offenders found guilty of a domestic violence-related assault are more likely to receive a prison sentence if: the assault caused significant harm, the offender has a <b>concurrent</b> <b>offence</b> at the court appearance, a prior prison episode, a prior conviction for a violent offence, has breached an AVO in the previous two years, is male or Indigenous. Conclusion: Domestic violence appears before the courts in many forms, from the most serious assaults to property damage and offensive language. The penalties received for these offences are equally diverse. The factors which influence whether a domestic violence-related assault offender will be sentenced to prison generally reflect the severity of the offence and the criminal history of the offender...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares police-referred youth justice {{conferences}} (YJCs), court referred YJCs and Children’s Court matters on {{the time}} to finalisation, and assess the contribution of index offence- and/or offender-related characteristics as potential confounders. The study utilised data from the NSW Re-Offending Database (ROD) for three cohorts of young people: those with a court-referred YJC held in 2010 (C-YJC), those with a police-referred YJC held in 2010 (P-YJC), and those with a proven Children’s Court (CC) appearance finalised in 2010. Negative binomial regression models were fitted to determine index offence- and offender-related characteristics associated with time to finalisation. The C-YJC cohort had a significantly longer time to finalisation compared to the CC cohort and the P-YJC cohort, even after controlling for confounders. In addition, the CC cohort had a significantly longer time to finalisation compared to the P-YJC cohort. Older age, being Indigenous, having a case dealt with in a Metropolitan region, and having more <b>concurrent</b> index <b>offences</b> remained significant predictors {{of an increase in}} number of days to finalisation in the adjusted model. The findings suggest that police should be encouraged to refer eligible matters to a YJC given the time-related efficiency identified via this pathway. The findings suggest it may be appropriate to consider further revising the legislated time-frames as there may be legitimate reasons for why delays occur...|$|R
40|$|Of 81, 199 adult offenders, 26 % reoffended {{within two}} years of the index appearance. Aim To re-examine the Group Risk Assessment Model (GRAM) for {{predicting}} reoffending in adults given non-custodial sentences and to assess the accuracy of the model. Method Adult offenders given non-custodial sentences in 2011 were the cohort of interest. Reoffending within 24 months of the index appearance was measured using court data. Models predicting reoffending using personal, index offence and criminal history characteristics were undertaken using multivariate logistic regression and model fits were assessed. Model validity and reliability was also measured by applying the model estimates to sub-group data and to separate smaller cohorts. Results Of the 81, 199 adult offenders, 26 % reoffended {{within two years}} of the index appearance. The best model fit for GRAM 2 comprised age, gender, Indigenous status, number of <b>concurrent</b> <b>offences,</b> prior custodial sentence, prior proven offences and the index offence type. The internal and external validity of the model was strong, however application of the model to offenders from smaller geographical areas or to those with a prior history of prison or property offending should be undertaken with care. Application of the model for screening purposes should also be carefully considered. Conclusion The GRAM 2 {{has been shown to be}} a robust tool for predicting reoffending. Although reliable, model estimates and their applicability should be re-examined periodically...|$|E
40|$|All of {{clinical}} work {{also has a}} moral dimension since the purpose of health care is to help patients. The aim of this project is to understand how doctors deal with these moral dimensions {{of clinical}} work. The field of bioethics has largely emerged as a philosophically founded discipline, without taking into account how doctors already handle moral values as a tacit or implicit part of their clinical work. This has caused a gap between medical ethics and medical practice. This research contains data from two qualitative studies: observations and interviews with 17 general practitioners and hospital doctors, and observations of 101 video recorded patient consultations in hospital. The doctors focused exclusively on medical issues in the encounters, even if their patient’s worries {{could be related to}} more personal and existential parts of the patient’s life. Patients’ personal worries were systematically ignored by the doctors. In order to help their patients by the use of their biomedical knowledge of anatomy and bodily processes, the doctors often handled their patients as objects. However, for patients it is morally offensive to be rejected and treated as medical objects, and it might feel very unpleasant. The doctors, who often kept a good tone in the consultations, did not appear to recognise their <b>concurrent</b> moral <b>offence.</b> Our research suggests that these moral infringements might be unavoidable in medical work, but that doctors, nonetheless, ought {{to be aware of the}} distress they cause and how they can reduce it...|$|R
