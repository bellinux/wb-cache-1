The main floor featured a common {{office for the}} station master, signaling control, telegraphy and ticket sales, a room for cargo handling and a waiting room for passengers. The station master's apartment in the upper story consisted of four rooms and a kitchen. However, it had limited space due to roof angles and steep stairs. There was also a <b>cargo</b> <b>building</b> on the platform and the station featured six tracks at the time. In 1926 the station was manned by a station master, a clerk, a switcher, five telegraphists, six station workers and a journeyman.|$|E
25|$|Hamar {{received}} the railway's administration and became its operational center. The station {{was designed by}} Georg Andreas Bull and construction of the wooden buildings were subcontracted to Chr. Eriksen. The line opened on 23 June 1862. The station had limited facilities with shunting being done by horse. In its original configuration the station had three tracks, a main station building, a locomotive depot and a <b>cargo</b> <b>building.</b> Two tracks received a roof. All buildings were wooden, with the two-story main building a log house with paneling in Swiss chalet style. The upper story was used as housing. About forty people worked at the station from the opening.|$|E

A new route for Røros Line was built from Sluppen to Skansen, along {{the west side of}} Nidelva, and the old station taken into disuse after the Røros Line reached the central station on 24 June 1884.

500|$|As {{the only}} proper {{station on the}} line, Flekkefjord was built in brick in Art Nouveau. The two-story [...] {{building}} which was designed by Paul Armin Due had a ground floor with a ticket office, four offices and three waiting rooms. The second story was an apartment for the station master. Due chose to design the building symmetrically around the waiting room. It had arched widows and doors, curved corners and two round towers. This gave both a tight and soft form in organic interaction. It has been considered one of Due's best works of Art Nouveau. Beside the station there was a [...] single story restaurant building. In addition to a large main building, the station had a freight building, a wharf, a locomotive and wagon depot, and a loading area. There were four tracks past the station, in addition to two track to the cargo area. The <b>cargo</b> <b>building</b> had room for three wagons. The locomotive depot had places for six steam locomotives.|$|E
500|$|The Flekkefjord Line {{was planned}} {{as part of}} the Sørland Line, that would make Flekkefjord a station on the line between Oslo, Kristiansand and Stavanger. Instead, the route of the Sørland Line was chosen to {{traverse}} an inner route, and the Flekkefjord Line became a [...] branch line of the Sørland Line in 1944. As part of the construction, the Flekkefjord Line was converted in 1940–41 to standard gauge. The first standard gauge train, a NSB Class 18, operated on 8 August 1941. The large traffic during the reconstruction period caused so much damage to the wharf {{that it had to be}} taken out of service. The speed on the line was also reduced to , as the gauge conversion was done without changing the right-of-way profile. Dual gauge was kept until 1 March 1944. At the same time the four tracks at the station were reduced to three. The <b>cargo</b> <b>building</b> was also moved three metres. In June 1945, twelve people were employed at the station.|$|E

The tags {{are attached to}} the bodies of the trucks and readers are distributed in the <b>cargo</b> <b>buildings</b> and attached to weighs and the discharge platforms. PDAs with camera and support to a WiFi network are provided to the inspectors and access points are installed throughout the discharge area to allow effective confirmations of unload actions and the acquisition of pictures for future audit. Broadband radio equipments are used to establish efficient communication links between the weighs and <b>cargo</b> <b>buildings</b> which are usually located very far from each other in the field. A web application software was especially developed to enable robust communication between the equipments for efficient device management, data processing and reports generation to the operating personal. The system was deployed in a cargo station of a Brazilian seashore port. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed system...|$|R
