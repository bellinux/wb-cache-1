5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site.

On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the {{abdominal}} and joint pains. It is uncertain as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction.

5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E
