25|$|The {{tachograph}} was {{a device}} that monitors speed and driving and rest times. One {{of the way to}} record the information is the old method using a paper chart (analogue tachograph). The <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> is an electromechanical device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto a piece of paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto strip charts or circular charts. The tachograph is a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes. The drive mode is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion.|$|E
500|$|A binary-coded decimal {{time code}} began testing in 1960, and became {{permanent}} in 1961. This [...] "NASA time code" [...] was modulated onto a 1000Hz audio tone at 100Hz, sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated [...] "baaga-bong". The code was also described as {{sounding like a}} [...] "buzz-saw". On July 1, 1971, the time code's broadcast was changed to the present 100Hz subcarrier, which is inaudible when using a normal radio (but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a <b>chart</b> <b>recorder).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Chart</b> <b>recorders</b> {{are built}} in three primary formats. Strip <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> {{have a long}} strip of paper that is ejected out of the <b>recorder.</b> Circular <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> have a {{rotating}} disc of paper that must be replaced more often, but are more compact and amenable to being enclosed behind glass. Roll <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> are similar to strip <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> except that the recorded data is stored on a round roll, and the unit is usually fully enclosed.|$|R
50|$|In analog strip <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> such {{as used in}} electrocardiographs, electroencephalographs and polygraphs, {{galvanometer}} mechanisms {{were used}} to position the pen. Strip <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> with galvanometer driven pens may have a full scale frequency response of 100 Hz and several centimeters of deflection.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chart</b> <b>recorders</b> pre-dated {{electronic}} data loggers which have replaced them in many applications.|$|R
500|$|The DR {{incorporated}} a [...] "robot operator" [...] which would reset the knobs on the DU {{to complete a}} sequence of measurements at different wavelengths, just like a human operator would to generate results for a full spectrum. [...] It used a linear shuttle with four positions, and a superstructure to change the knobs. [...] It had a moving <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> to plot results, with red, green and black dots. [...] The price of recording spectrophotometers was substantially higher than non-recording machines.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, a {{computer}} data acquisition and control {{system would be}} a typical addition to complete the system. Instead of a <b>chart</b> <b>recorder,</b> continuous records of oxygen consumption and or carbon dioxide production are made {{with the assistance of}} an analog to digital converter coupled to {{a computer}}. [...] Software captures, filters, converts, and displays the signal as appropriate to the experimenter's needs. [...] A variety of companies and individuals service the respirometry community (e.g., Sable Systems, Qubit Systems, see also Warthog Systems).|$|E
2500|$|This {{raised the}} {{temperature}} of the heater to an estimated [...] A <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off, as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly, but no one noticed it at the time. Because the temperature sensor was not designed to read higher than the [...] thermostat opening temperature, the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank. The gas boiled off in hours rather than days.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1988 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaDigital-based linear-array <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> are {{replacing}} conventional stylus recorders in telemetry data stations everywhere. They offer {{advantages in}} virtually all respects, and are becoming indispensable. But because of the completely different writing method and technology employed, {{it is difficult to}} make completely analogous performance comparisons between analog and digital <b>chart</b> <b>recorders.</b> This has led to some confusion when replacing aging stylus recorders is contemplated. Objectives: Establish a set of universal, standardized performance characteristics for digital <b>chart</b> <b>recorders.</b> Introduce appropriate terminology, allowing valid, repeatable comparison of old and new systems...|$|R

2500|$|Gulf gravimeter: One of {{the last}} and most {{accurate}} pendulum gravimeters was the apparatus developed in 1929 by the Gulf Research and Development Co. [...] It used two pendulums made of fused quartz, each [...] in length with a period of 0.89 second, swinging on pyrex knife edge pivots, 180° out of phase. They were mounted in a permanently sealed temperature and humidity controlled vacuum chamber. Stray electrostatic charges on the quartz pendulums had to be discharged by exposing them to a radioactive salt before use. The period was detected by reflecting a light beam from a mirror {{at the top of}} the pendulum, recorded by a <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> and compared to a precision crystal oscillator calibrated against the WWV radio time signal. This instrument was accurate to within (0.3–0.5)×10−7 (30–50 microgals or 3–5nm/s2). It was used into the 1960s.|$|E

It {{was introduced in}} 1995 as a digital replacement for aging <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> and oscilloscopes that were widely used in undergraduate teaching laboratories. The advent of low cost personal computers meant that older analog technologies could be replaced with powerful and less expensive computerized alternatives.|$|R
50|$|The {{continuous}} inkjet (CIJ) method is used commercially for marking and coding {{of products and}} packages. In 1867, Lord Kelvin patented the syphon recorder, which recorded telegraph signals as a continuous trace on paper using an ink jet nozzle deflected by a magnetic coil. The first commercial devices (medical strip <b>chart</b> <b>recorders)</b> were introduced in 1951 by Siemens.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> is an {{electromechanical}} device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto {{a piece of}} paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto strip charts or circular charts. Chart recorders may be entirely mechanical with clockwork mechanisms, electro-mechanical with an electrical clockwork mechanism for driving the chart (with mechanical or pressure inputs), or entirely electronic with no mechanical components at all (a virtual <b>chart</b> <b>recorder).</b>|$|E

50|$|Data loggers vary between {{general purpose}} types {{for a range}} of {{measurement}} applications to very specific devices for measuring in one environment or application type only. It is common for general purpose types to be programmable; however, many remain as static machines with only a limited number or no changeable parameters. Electronic data loggers have replaced <b>chart</b> <b>recorders</b> in many applications.|$|R
50|$|When {{torque and}} speed signals are available, test {{data can be}} {{transmitted}} to a data acquisition system rather than being recorded manually. Speed and torque signals can also be recorded by a <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> or plotter.|$|E

5000|$|Depending on {{the source}} of current for the loop, devices may be {{classified}} as active (supplying or [...] "sourcing" [...] power) or passive (relying on or [...] "sinking" [...] loop power). For example, a <b>chart</b> <b>recorder</b> may provide loop power to a pressure transmitter. The pressure transmitter modulates the current on the loop to send the signal to the strip <b>chart</b> <b>recorder,</b> but does not in itself supply power to the loop and so is passive. Another loop may contain two passive chart recorders, a passive pressure transmitter, and a 24 V battery. (The battery is the active device). Note that a 4-wire instrument has a power supply input separate from the current loop.|$|E
