40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effects of inter-bar currents on inductionmotor starting performance and stray-load losses. The work is focused on theperformance differences between aluminium and copper <b>casted</b> <b>rotors.</b> A method to predict the stator current when starting direct-on-line isdeveloped. This includes modelling of skin-effect, saturation of the leakageflux paths and additional iron losses. The results are verified by measurements. An analytical model accounting for inter-bar currents is derived, andthe dependency of the harmonic rotor currents on the inter-bar resistivity isinvestigated. It is found that the inter-bar currents can have considerableeffect on motor starting performance and stray-load losses, the amount beingstrongly dependent on the harmonic content of the primary MMF. Based on measurements of inter-bar resistivity, the starting performanceof an aluminium and a copper <b>casted</b> <b>rotor</b> is simulated. The results indicatea higher pull-out torque of the aluminium rotor than for the equivalent copperrotor. This is rather due to an increase of the fundamental starting torque ofthe aluminium rotor, than due to braking torques from the space harmonicsin the copper rotor. The results are verified by measurements. It is foundthat the difference between the pull-out torques is even larger than calculatedfrom the model. Thereby, it can be concluded that the inter-bar currents havea considerable effect on motor starting performance. At rated speed the braking torques are larger in the aluminium rotor thanin the copper rotor. This is seen as increased harmonic joule losses in the rotorcage. Simulations have shown, that these losses can be as large as 1 % ofthe output power for the studied machine. QC 2010061...|$|R

The main aim of the current study is to replace the conventional <b>cast</b> iron <b>rotor</b> material with a lightweight alternative such as coated aluminium alloy. The main challenge has been to meet both the cost and functional demands of modern mass-produced automotive braking systems. A sensitivity analysis based on the Taguchi approach was carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the thermal performance of a typical candidate disc brake. Wrought aluminium disc brake rotors coated with alumina on the rubbing surfaces were determined to have the best potential for replacing the conventional <b>cast</b> iron <b>rotor</b> at reasonable cost. Optimisation of the structure was subsequently carried out using a genetic algorithm on the selected coated aluminium disc brake rotor. This determines the optimum thickness of the coating and the composition of the substrate based on selected criteria. Prototype aluminium disc brake rotors were coated with alumina using the Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) technique and the thermal performance of these lightweight rotors was investigated experimentally using a brake dynamometer. A high speed thermal imaging system was used to evaluate and measure the rubbing surface temperature of the coated brake rotors.

40|$|Stray {{load loss}} refers {{generally}} to {{the sources of}} induction machine loss not accounted for by typical calculations of primary or secondary copper loss, no load core loss, or friction and windage loss. Harmonic rotor bar currents from the non-sinusoidal distribution of the slotted stator winding contribute significant stray load loss. Rotor bars, especially on <b>cast</b> <b>rotors</b> for machines under fifty horsepower (37. 3 kW), can be skewed, helically twisted {{from one end to}} the other, to reduce loss, torque, and noise from alignment of rotor and stator slots and from harmonic rotor currents. Interbar currents flowing circumferentially through the laminations between skewed and non-insulated rotor bars can significantly increase stray load loss. Presented equations adjust the effective rotor resistance and skew factor of the extended per-phase induction machine equivalent circuit model in order to account for the impact of inter-bar currents. The average value of resistance between neighboring rotor bars significantly impacts calculations of rotor bar and inter-bar current and loss and has been determined for a number of measured rotors. Rotors fit into one of two distinct categories where either the bar-to-lamination contact resistance dominates the inter-bar resistance or the total resistance divides more equally between values of bar, lamination, and contact resistance. Performance calculations using the adjusted equivalent circuit model are verified theoretically against previous calculation methods and experimentally by comparison to measured test results including variations in rotor skew, conductor conductivity, and inter-bar resistance. (cont.) A number of different cast copper and aluminum five and ten horsepower test induction motors performed differently than originally predicted and variably between nominally identical machines. Inter-bar currents are part of the cause of both the variation and additional losses measured on these machines. The adjusted equivalent circuit equations improve estimations of motor performance and allow identification of means to increase machine efficiency by minimizing the stray load loss due to inter-bar currents. by Steven C.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of losses due to skewing in induction machines. Normally skewing is done in induction machines to reduce noise, torque ripples and selective harmonics on the rotor cage of the machine. Skewing also can increase the effect of inter-bar currents in the machine. Due to die <b>casting</b> of <b>rotor</b> bars in the rotor at high temperatures, a very low resistance path develops between rotor bars. This resistance is called inter-bar resistance.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The ideal {{squirrel}} cage motor should have a varying rotor resistance; large at standstill, and decreasing as the speed rises. Overseas - designed high impedance rotors try to fulfil these conditions - mostly used are double cage <b>rotors</b> and die <b>cast</b> aluminium <b>rotors.</b> However, in the South African coal-mining industry these rotors recorded high rate failures with heavy financial losses. As a result, {{the need for an}} alternative rotor type that was able to comply with basic conditions ignored before appeared on the market: • Higher reliability with extended life expectancy • Lower total ownership costs • Easy re-manufacturing with components available on the market • Specific performance stability at competitive price. Over the years, only two principles were tacitly accepted in designing {{squirrel cage}} rotors: 1. For a single cage rotor, in a circumferential direction around the rotor the squirrel cage bars are placed in the same cylindrical shell, with the same shape and same conductivity. 2. For a double cage rotor, the same rule as above applies; however, in the radial direction, the bars have different shapes and typically different conductivities. The Invention is based on a new principle, i. e. "in a circumferential direction around the squirrel cage rotor, squirrel cage bars may have different conductivities and same shapes, or different conductivities and different shapes”. Mixed Conductivity Fabricated Rotors (MCFR) are designed and manufactured based on this new principle, and are able to withstand the harsh South African mining conditions. Since patented, the invention has been materialised in a set of special rotors powering continuous miners of a reputable coal-mining house, which was spending about R 5 million annually on replacing specific imported die <b>cast</b> aluminium <b>rotors</b> only. Fully complying with the above-mentioned basic conditions, the patent offers a large variety of technical and economical advantages, increasing mining processes efficiency beyond expectations. The thesis describes the MCFR's design adaptability by altering the rotor design {{to meet the demands of}} a specific engineering application as a base line of drives design. The patent is part of the new South African trend of increasing processes efficiency. It offers large possibilities of designing dedicated motors with a positive impact on the South African economy. Some socio-economical advantages are worthy of considerable study: • Being locally manufactured, the MCFR may reduce the country's economical dependence. • Requiring no special expertise, the MCFR can be produced in any quantity and size without excessive investment. • The MCFR offers an alternative option (product interchangeability) on the market as well as sound competition (with export potential). • The patent ensures business sustainability conditions which diffuse financial constraints on motor manufacturers and end-users during the re-capitalisation process (very loaded in South African economic and industrial environment).

The fans became very effective energy saving appliances for residential and commercial use by supplementing expensive air conditioning with a cooling wind-chill effect. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the heat transfer coefficient, but do not lower temperatures directly.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesTwo magnesium/silicon {{aluminium}} alloys each reinforced with 20 vol. % SiC particulates have been worn against three different automobile friction linings (brake pads). Two of the friction linings {{are commonly used}} against <b>cast</b> iron brake <b>rotors</b> while the third has been formulated for use against aluminium MMC brake rotors. Wear processes at the interfaces of the specific rotor - pad combinations have been characterised through the analysis of friction traces {{and the use of}} optical and electron microscopy. Models on the interdependence of friction and wear, and models of wear mechanisms for aluminium MMCs and cast iron sliding against friction materials have been proposed and discussed. For an aluminium MMC sliding against an organic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are low and friction is constant due to the formation of a solid lubricant layer at the wear interface. When this MMC is worn against a semi-metallic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are extremely high due to two and three body abrasion which lead to subsurface delamination and early melt wear in the MMC. For an aluminium MMC developed for its use in automobile brake rotors sliding against a semi-metallic pad specifically formulated for its use against MMC brake rotors, wear rates at low loads are low although friction traces are irregular and fracture of the SiC particulates occurs at the lowest load and sliding velocity. This fracture of SiC is caused by the abrasive action of hard alumina particles within the pad. At high loads and sliding velocities cohesiveness of materials within the pad is poor and the wear rate of the MMC is extremely high. At the highest load/sliding velocity combination, the wear resistance of the MMC is inferior to that of its unreinforced matrix. If the structure and composition of friction linings are arranged correctly, the wear resistance and frictional performance of aluminium MMC brake rotors are superior to those of <b>cast</b> iron brake <b>rotors.</b> In addition, the lower density of aluminium MMCs provides for an economic advantage over cast iron with respect to efficient use of fuel, and fabrication expenses...|$|R

In spite of relatively large amount of publications addressing the creep-groan phenomena, there is not an universal solution addressing the engineering aspects of brake/vehicle design. In addition, Relevance of wear occurring in brake materials increased particularly with relation to the released chemicals and corresponding health and environmental hazards. It is well known that humidity can considerably modify the adhesion of rubbing counterfaces by creating menisci and increasing the contact area. The chemistry, morphology and phase composition of the friction layers (third body) generated on the friction surfaces could play a determining role when amounts of adsorbed water on brake surfaces is concerned. The friction layer is typically a complex mix of numerous materials and, as a rule, contains the agglomerated or sintered nanoparticles. Hence, quantum effects could further modify the adsorption of water. This work addresses the impact of humidity on wear and creep groan of two commercial brake material types: the so called i) 2 ̆ 2 non-asbestos organic 2 ̆ 2 (NAO) and the ii) 2 ̆ 2 semi-metallic 2 ̆ 2 (SM) brake materials rubbed against pearlitic gray <b>cast</b> iron <b>rotors</b> typically used in the passenger vehicles. The friction and wear tests were performed with the Universal Mechanical Tester (UMT) manufactured by Bruker and the wear surfaces/mechanisms were studied by using of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, and optical topography methods. The applied wear testing conditions were designed as a series of particularly designed drag tests and were performed at several different relative humidity levels ranging between 50...|$|R
