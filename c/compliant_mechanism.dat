Significant {{progress}} has been made in the area of design and analysis of multimaterial <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> What is now needed is a method to mass-produce such mechanisms economically. A feasible and practical way of producing such mechanisms is through multi-material molding. Devices based on <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> usually consist of compliant joints. Compliant joints in turn are created by carefully engineering interfaces between a compliant and a rigid material. This paper presents an overview of multi-material molding technology and describes feasible mold designs for creating different types of compliant joints found in multi-material <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> It also describes guidelines essential to successfully utilizing the multi-material molding process for creating <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Finally, practical applications for the use of multi-material molding to create <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Analysis and {{synthesis}} of <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{has recently been}} the subject of significant study in the research community. This focus has led to a number of design approaches for developing <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This paper describes the value of using the Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model (PRBM) to design <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for commercial products. Application of the PRBM is illustrated through the development of two parallel mechanisms: a bicycle derailleur and parallel-motion bicycle brakes. The PRBM allows <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to be modeled and analyzed as rigid-body mechanisms and significantly reduces the complexity of analysis. Mechanisms with straightforward properties are used to demonstrate the use of the PRBM to design commercially viable <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for required motion and force-deflection characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the design and {{prototyping}} of a compact external pipe-crawling device that aids the inspection of pipes in hazardous environments and areas that are inaccessible to humans. The novel aspect of the design is a <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> that is actuated using Ni-Ti-Cu shape memory alloy (SMA) wire and strip. The device consists of two rings that are attached to each other along the longitudinal axis of the pipe by three pairs of circumferentially arranged U-shaped SMA and spring steel (AISI 1080) strips. Each ring consists of a <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> and housing. The <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> transforms the circumferential motion to radial motion at three points that are in contact with the pipe. The design of this <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> is derived from a radially deployable linkage. The SMA wire attached to the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> and embedded within the housing with proper electrical isolation creates the circumferential motion for the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism.</b> When there is no actuation, the contact points of the compliant mechanisms of the two rings tightly hold the pipe. When an SMA wire of a ring is activated, that ring releases the grip on the pipe. At this time, the SMA strips are actuated to bring the rings closer together. After this, the first ring is de-activated to create the grip again. This is followed by releasing the grip on the second ring by the SMA wire activation. The spring steel strips, which are compressed during the SMA strip actuation, now extend back creating a displacement along the pipe. This cycle is repeated to create a...|$|E
40|$|Micro-motion devices may share {{a common}} {{architecture}} such {{that they have a}} main body of compliant material and some direct actuation elements (e. g., piezoelectric element). The shape of such a compliant material is designed with notches and holes on it, and in this way one portion of the material deforms significantly with respect to other portions of the material – a motion in the conventional sense of the rigid body mechanism. The devices of this kind are called compliant mechanisms. Computer tools for the kinematical and dynamic motion analysis of the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> are not well-developed. In this thesis a study is presented towards a finite element approach to the motion analysis of compliant mechanisms. This approach makes it possible to compute the kinematical motion of the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> within which the piezoelectric actuation element is embedded, as opposed to those existing approaches where the piezoelectric actuation element is either ignored or overly simplified. Further, the developed approach allows computing the global stiffness and the natural frequency of the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This thesis also presents a prototype <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a test bed for measuring various behaviors of the prototype mechanism. It is shown that the developed approach can improve the prediction of motions of the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> with respect to the existing approaches based on a comparison of the measured result (on the prototype) and the simulated result. The approach to computation of the global stiffness and the natural frequency of the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> is validated by comparing it with other known approaches for some simple mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Topology {{optimization}} {{has emerged}} as one of the key approaches to design <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> However, one of the main difficulties is that the resulted <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> often have de facto hinges. For this reason, a simple yet efficient formulation for designing hinge-free <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is developed and examined within a level set–based topology optimization framework. First, the conventional objective function is augmented using an output stiffness.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we review the world-wide study on micro-motion systems both from an {{academic}} and an industrial perspective. The {{objective of the}} review is {{to answer the following}} questions: (1) What are the limitations of technologies to develop a micro-motion device in terms of function, motion range, accuracy, and speed it can achieve? (2) What is any economic implication of these technologies? (3) What are future research directions? The micro-motion systems considered in this paper are classified into four kinds in terms of their motion ranges: (a) 1000 μm. This review concludes that the PZT actuation element integrated with the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> is the most promising technology which can achieve high accuracy (sub-nanometer) of all four kinds of motion ranges. This promise is further based on the amplification technology using the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> concept. The amplification mechanism is used to com-pensate the problem with a limited stroke of the PZT actuation element. The compliant amplification mecha-nism allows one to achieve a high resolution and high stiffness motion which does not compromise the loss of accuracy due to motion amplification. The PZT actuation element and the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> are both econom-ically viable. Future research direction should generally focus on the interface between the PZT actuation element and <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the reliability of the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> under cyclic deformation of com-pliant materials...|$|E
40|$|Piezo stack {{actuators}} {{have been}} widely adopted for the actuation of flexure hinge based micro-motion compliant mechanisms (or sometimes named stages). When fitting a Piezo stack actuators into a compliant mechanisms, normally no adhesive is applied but tightly fitted by pushing it into the slot (desired position). As the slot is normally designed to be slightly smaller than the Piezo stack actuator or a tightening mechanism could be used instead, by fitting the Piezo stack actuator into position, the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> is therefore slightly deformed and pre-load is resulted on the Piezo stack actuator. This paper presents the original investigation {{about the level of}} changes of <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> stiffness caused by tightly fitting Piezo stack actuator into the mechanism. Finite Element Analysis simulations were conducted on a particular one DOF flexure hinge based <b>Compliant</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and the results demonstrate the stiffness of a <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> would certainly be changed and the extend of change is dependent on how the Piezo stack actuator is fitted into the mechanism.

40|$|Continuum {{topology}} of continuous, monolithic <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{is designed}} for finite elastic deformation such that an output port moves in a desired direction when a specified force is applied through an input port. The pseudo-rigid body equivalent of <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (CMs) has been the conventional approach used by earlier researchers to synthesize and analyze <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Attempts at direct analysis from existing literature are predicted on such assumptions as static linearity or a few times geometric nonlinear conditions. These are justifiable in several situations where compliant systems {{have been successful in}} replacing materials with several moving parts. However, the application domain of <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is widening to dynamic environment where the deformations are relatively large. It is therefore necessary to consider nonlinearities resulting from geometry and hyperelasticity. In this paper, methods of continuum mechanics and nonlinear finite element method were deployed to develop model that could capture the behaviour of <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> A hybrid system of symbolic algebra (AceGEN) and a compiled back end (AceFEM) were employed, leveraging both ease of use and computational efficiency.
