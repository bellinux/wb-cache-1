40|$|The Greek {{word order}} {{is known to}} be {{extremely}} „free“. This work deals with Wackernagel’s law, regulating the placement of the enclitics in the sentence, and argues for a considerable regularity of the word order {{at the beginning of a}} sentence. Archaic Greek word order encodes prosodic units. The placement of the enclitics is seen as implemented by a complex system of parameters operating on several levels (phonology, syntax, pragmatics, semantics) and coordinating units of different scope. The research is based on the epic corpus and the oldest available epigraphic material. The words following Wackernagel’s law exhibit idiosyncratic distributional characteristics allowing to group them as ‚postpositives’. I have left open their classification either as accentological or as rhytmical clitics. The Greek exhibits rests of a system of binary pars, where an enclitic alternates with an accented pendant. Syntagmatically, the smallest structural units involving Wackernagel’s words are pq and pMq, with the pq-type dominating. Enclitics positioning within the meaningful text units is the topic of Chapter 2 : the study focuses on the complex interrelationship between the domain and the scope of the cliticization. In the epic language a placement within a non-predicative syntagma parallels a placement within a predicative syntagma. There are numerous cases of clitic placement within the domain of an upper-level predicative syntagma. More complicated is a split clause structure where there are at least two positions available for enclitics. This kind of clause structure is usually the result of pragmatic operations on its content. These configurations are interpreted as prosodically-driven. The Part II investigates enclitics clusterization rules. The complete collection of the enclitics clusters by Homer has first been studied in purely combinatorial terms: it has been proven that enclitics clusters are subject to the strong linearity principle („ranking rule“). Different meaning of equally-sounding postpositives is not a factor of the different orderings within enclitics clusters; this conclusion opposes my systematization to the previous systematizations. The ordering within clusters operates with lexemes, not with categories. However, there is a „left-periphery“ zone within the clusters that hosts elements ‚alien’ to the core set of the clustering enclitics. The contradictions to the established ranking rule are unnumerous; no factors accounting for the variation have been established, though a great part of cases has been shown to involve the indefinites and the particle τε, sharing the common etymology. The clusterization rules in split clauses do not represent a split of an original chain into two parts if the preposed material has scope other than a core clause. On the basis of the epigraphical evidence both dialect-internal and interdialectal variations of the clusterization rule have been established. The available evidence reveals the variation of the ordering of the three categories of the enclitics (modal particles, connective particles and indefinite pronouns) conditioned by the syntactical <b>context</b> (<b>clause</b> type). Cross-dialectally there have been established different systems of oppositions of the clause-type conditioned ordering. The variation factors are etymology and the protolanguage system of interchanging accented and enclitic counterparts...|$|E

Reading is also very important skill that we should consider in learning English, it becomes the basic foundation of academic skills because most subjects need the skills of reading. The success of teaching learning process cannot {{be separated from the}} role of reading. However, reading mastery is not easy to learn for the students in EFL because they should understand about words and sentences that they used in their prior knowledge which is becoming to be a good reader that focuses primarily on what them already knows about the topic in reading text. They may use morpheme, semantic, syntax and <b>context</b> <b>clause</b> to identify the meaning of unknown words in the text. So, linguistic category also {{plays an important role in}} reading. Therefore, the learners need to learn about the affixations as one of part in linguistic category, morpheme.). Affixes is defined as a closed class of grammatical elements within the word. They are bound morpheme and cannot occur on their own. A fair number of affixes change the word class of the root to which they are affixed. Affixation is very important to be learned by every learner who wants to study the content of English text, because it will help them todevelop student’s general understanding in reading text it isbecause every type of affixation while present different meaning. So the students will easily understand the meaning of unfamiliar words in the text. Having seeing such phenomenon, the writer found that mastering English is not easy if the students are lack of vocabulary, especially in affixation. This research aimed to find out the types of affixation found in the reading text of textbook used by the first grade of senior high school. The formulation of the research problem are: 1). what types of each affixation (derivational Affixes) are found in the textbooks used by the first grade of senior high school in Tulungagung? and 2) how are the frequencies of occurrence of each types of affixation (derivational Affixes) in the textbooks used by the first grade of senior high school. The purpose of this study are: 1) To know types of each affixation (derivational Affixes) are found in the reading text in English textbook for the first grade of senior high school in Tulungagung. And 2) To know the frequencies of occurrences of each type of affixation (derivational Affixes) in the reading text in English textbook for the first grade of senior high school in Tulungagung. Research methodology: 1) research design : the design use in this study is descriptive quantitative approach. 2) In this research, the population that was used by the researcher was all reading text in English textbook used by the first grade of senior high school in Tulungagung. 3) The sampling technique of this study is purposive sampling. 4) The sample of this study is 4 English textbook, they were consist 44 of reading text. 5) the research instrument was in the form of document, and 6) the data analysis. The result of this study are : 1) the writer found out there were two kinds of affixes. They were preffix and suffix. 2). There is prefixationof 20 prefixes of negative prefix and 18 prefixes of other prefix with various meaning. Then suffix of 3 suffixes verb formation, 58 suffixes of adverb formation, 99 suffixes of noun formation include noun derived from verb, noun derived from adjectives and nouns derived from other nouns.

The aims {{of this study are}} to identify the types of entailment, to describe the orders of entailment, and to explain the approaches to detect entailment uttered by the characters in The Da Vinci Code movie. This research employed descriptive qualitative method. Therefore, the data of this research were in the form of utterances performed by the characters in The Da Vinci Code movie, while the context of the data was monologues or dialogues between the characters. The source of the data was The Da Vinci Code movie and its transcript. The data were collected by selecting sentences containing entailment. The researcher conducted triangulation in order to establish the credibility of the data. The results revealed from the findings are mentioned as follows. (1) All types of entailment which are one-way entailment, two-way/mutual entailment, negative entailment, and metaphorical entailment are found in The Da Vinci Code movie. From the total 57 data, one-way entailment reaches the highest frequency because it is the simplest model of entailment, and it appears 26 times. Meanwhile, negative entailment, which appears 6 times, becomes the least one to occur. This type of entailment requires at least one negative sentence to formulate entailment, while the characters in the movie rarely perform negative sentences. (2) Each order of entailment is applied in the data sheet; they are background entailment and foreground entailment. Therefore, most of entailments found in the movie are ordered based on the foreground as it is applied 33 times, and is distributed into 28 stressing and 5 clefting. The existence of stressing and clefting supports the foreground order to acquire the highest position. (3) To detect entailment in The Da Vinci Code movie, the researcher employs <b>contexted</b> <b>clause</b> and <b>context</b> matching approaches. <b>Contexted</b> <b>clause</b> is employed 36 times out of 57 data, while context matching is employed {{in the rest of the}} data. The researcher tends to apply <b>contexted</b> <b>clause</b> more frequently rather than context matching since most of the entailments are interconnected in context.

A partition of the clauses generated during resolution refutation based on their syntactic structure is presented.

This work encompasses and expands upon previous work on question answering in a theorem proving paradigm, which began with the association of answers with proofs. A complete, formal definition of {{what is meant by}} answer in the context of resolution theorem proving is presented.

This definition of relevance is not in and of itself novel; rather, it {{is the way in which}} the set of relevant clauses is partitioned that provides the key to interpreting clauses as answers. The three answer classes identified are: specific, generic, and hypothetical.

Furthermore, it is found to be sensitive to the degree of the argument’s thematic/semantic function in the subordinate clause.

Kathol (2001) argues that German lacks ‘true’ p-gap constructions compared to English.

We probe whether the licensing strategies for p-gaps of a dominant L 2 (English) can affect an incompletely-acquired L 1 (German) {{that does not}} license such gaps and, if so, whether such strategies follow Engdahl’s hierarchy. The presence of p-gaps would support the work of Grosjean (2008), whose view predicts that English syntax may surface (i. e., ‘seep through’) in spoken German if English has become the dominant language for an individual. Our results support the theory of ‘grammatical seeping’, and our speakers in general behave {{in accordance with the}} predictions of Engdahl’s hierarchy. They produce p-gaps in English-to-German translations relatively frequently in manner clauses, often in temporal clauses and rarely in relative clauses. In temporal clauses we find considerable syntactic restructuring.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two types}} of causative construction in Spanish, referred to here as hacer 1 and hacer 2 constructions. Various properties of these constructions suggest that they should respectively be analyzed as involving ECM and object control. Notwithstanding, hacer 2 constructions contrast with uncontroversial object control constructions {{in terms of the}} object status of the causee, the constituency of the embedded clause, and the interpretation of indefinites. To resolve this paradox, this paper proposes that the hacer 1 /hacer 2 distinction follows from a fundamental difference in judgment types, whereby the embedded clause of an hacer 1 construction represents a THETIC judgment and that of hacer 2 a CATEGORICAL judgment. This is of interest because this distinction is not usually discussed in the <b>context</b> of embedded <b>clauses.</b> I argue that putative control properties of hacer 2 constructions are a consequence of the predication associated with categorical judgments.

40|$|THESIS 7070 The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to characterise the factors that {{underpin}} the syntactic and semantic valency of the Irish verb {{in terms of a}} functional approach that is sensitive to aspectuality in the Aktionsarten sense of Vendler (1967). Our concern is with the relationship between the semantic representation of a verbal predicate in the <b>context</b> of a <b>clause</b> and its syntactic expression through the argument structure of the verb. One of our intentions is to demonstrate that there are semantic motivations to syntax. We will defend the hypothesis that an account of semantic and syntactic valency requires the consideration of event structure as a vital mediating component. In particular, we claim that incorporating event structure into the semantic representation provides for a unified account of causation, reflexivity, and each of the passives of Irish. In articulating our hypothesis we will expand on the role of event structure at the syntax/semantic interface over a number of constructions (causatives, reflexives, personal passive, impersonal passive) to characterise the core participants in each. We will relate how the participants in the semantic representation find expression in the argument structure of the verb in the clause in the syntax...|$|R
5000|$|Though tense is not morphologically {{indicated}} in Tzeltal, {{the perfective aspect}} {{can be used in}} certain constructions to indicate or suggest location in time. In an independent clause, the perfective verb is almost always understood as having occurred in the past, but can signal either a recent or a distant past. It may correspond to the present tense if the terminating point of the event is understood as the present moment. For example, to announce ones immediate departure ("Im going (now)"), the verb meaning [...] "go" [...] would be marked for the perfective aspect, even though the social circumstances of such a locution would necessitate that the action not yet be complete. Further, the perfective aspect can indicate a past, habitual action, similar to the English [...] "used to" [...] or [...] "would" [...] ("We used to/would go to the park everyday"). In this construction, adverbs such as neel ("before") may additionally be used for clarity. Lastly, when a perfective clause is topicalized, it may be interpreted as a future factual; in the same <b>context</b> an imperfective <b>clause</b> would be interpreted as a conditional statement, with a lesser degree of factuality and punctuality.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} different kinds of preceding contexts on the processing of relative clauses. Through both a Chinese and an English version of an experiment, with native speakers recruited for each version, this study systematically compared the processing of relative clauses in a canonical, non-canonical, and “null” context in both Chinese and English and was the first to systematically examine three accounts of priming (the thematic pattern priming account proposed by Lin (2014), in addition to both the verb phrase constituent priming account and the syntactic position sequence priming account proposed by Fedorenko, Piantadosi, and Gibson (2012)) in relative clause processing in both Chinese and English. Results showed discrepancies between predictions from each priming account and the actual results. None of the three priming accounts could sufficiently explain the results in Chinese and English. Alternative possible explanations were suggested, including: (1) having a <b>context</b> makes relative <b>clause</b> reading more natural and frequency effects less obvious; (2) the NPs inside the RCs are primed by the original thematic roles or grammatical functions of same NPs in the critical context sentence; (3) an interplay of all three different kinds of priming in the processing of relative <b>clauses</b> in <b>context</b> may occur...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMichèle Monte {{deals with}} the use of si in non {{conditional}} dependant clauses. Based on a big corpus (press and essays), our research distinguishes three categories of si P clauses : topical clauses in which Q explains P, concessive ones in which Q limits P, and comparative ones where Q is compared with P. We explain these uses of si – which are not so marginal as it could seem – by the value of si in the system : we definite si as a morpheme that puts the allocutor in front of a choice he is invited to make although the <b>context</b> and the <b>clause</b> position already show the locutor's preference. In a second part we show how the dialogism works in each category : anticipating a counter-argument, bringing into use arguments belonging to the interdiscourse, resuming the locutor's speech (auto-reformulation). In a third part we insist on the argumentative interest of si in contexts where the locutor wants the interlocutor to think it is himself who validates the si P content. Thanks to its value in the system, si allows to benefit from elements belonging to the context while giving the idea their validation is still in doubt...|$|R
