40|$|Many {{species of}} tsetse flies are {{infected}} by {{a virus that}} causes salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) syndrome and the virus isolated from Glossina pallidipes (GpSGHV) has recently been sequenced. Flies with SGH have a reduced fecundity and fertility. Due to the deleterious impact of SGHV on G. pallidipes colonies, several approaches were investigated to develop a virus management strategy. Horizontal virus transmission is the major cause of the high prevalence of the GpSGHV in tsetse colonies. Implementation of a "clean feeding" regime (fresh blood offered to each set of flies {{so that there is}} only one feed per membrane), instead of the regular feeding regime (several successive feeds per membrane), was among the proposed approaches to reduce GpSGHV infections. However, due to the absence of disposable feeding equipment (feeding trays and silicone membranes), the implementation of a <b>clean</b> <b>feeding</b> approach remains economically difficult. We developed a new <b>clean</b> <b>feeding</b> approach applicable to large-scale tsetse production facilities using existing resources. The results indicate that implementing this approach is feasible and leads to a significant reduction in virus load from 10 (9) virus copies in regular colonies to an average of 10 (2. 5) and eliminates the SGH syndrome from <b>clean</b> <b>feeding</b> colonies by 28 months post implementation of this approach. The <b>clean</b> <b>feeding</b> approach also reduced the virus load from an average of 10 (8) virus copy numbers to an average of 10 (3) virus copies and SGH prevalence of 10 % to 4 % in flies fed after the clean fed colony. Taken together, these data indicate that the <b>clean</b> <b>feeding</b> approach is applicable in large-scale G. pallidipes production facilities and eliminates the deleterious effects of the virus and the SGH syndrome in these colonies...|$|R

40|$|After an {{accidental}} radioactive release leading to {{contamination of the}} food chain, countermeasures {{may be used to}} reduce the radiological health risk to the population and to bring social reassurance. This paper analyses public acceptance and consumer's behaviour for various countermeasures for contaminated milk as revealed by a recent public survey in Belgium. The survey instrument used was Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing. A simulated news bulletin was included for a fast and realistic briefing on the situation investigated. The results show that <b>clean</b> <b>feeding</b> of dairy cattle and disposal of contaminated milk are the preferred options in case of contaminations above legal norms. For contaminations below legal norms, normal consumption of milk seems better accepted than disposal. Nonetheless, the expressed consumer's behaviour reveals a precautionary tendency: the presence of radioactivity at some step in the food chain could lead to avoiding purchasing products from affected areas. Finally, public trust building is revealed as a key element of a successful countermeasure strategy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|Be sure to {{frequently}} <b>clean</b> the <b>feed</b> {{and water}} dishes. The {{amount of feed}} a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and {{on the availability of}} drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container {{to reduce the risk of}} the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} tsetse flies are {{infected}} with a virus that causes salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) symptoms associated with a reduced fecundity and fertility. A high prevalence of SGH has been correlated {{with the collapse of}} two laboratory colonies of Glossina pallidipes and colony maintenance problems in a mass rearing facility in Ethiopia. Mass-production of G. pallidipes is crucial for programs of tsetse control including the sterile insect technique (SIT), and therefore requires a management strategy for this virus. Based on the homology of DNA polymerase between salivary gland hypertrophy virus and herpes viruses at the amino acid level, two antiviral drugs, valacyclovir and acyclovir, classically used against herpes viruses were selected and tested for their toxicity on tsetse flies and their impact on virus replication. While long term per os administration of acyclovir resulted in a significant reduction of productivity of the colonies, no negative effect was observed in colonies fed with valacyclovir-treated blood. Furthermore, treatment of a tsetse colony with valacyclovir for 83 weeks resulted in a significant reduction of viral loads and consequently suppression of SGH symptoms. The combination of initial selection of SGHV-negative flies by non-destructive PCR, a <b>clean</b> <b>feeding</b> system, and valacyclovir treatment resulted in a colony that was free of SGH syndromes in 33 weeks. This is the first report of the use of a drug to control a viral infectio...|$|R
60|$|Just {{as the sun}} was setting, Bob {{returned}} from his fishing excursion. To Mark's surprise, he saw that the dingui floated almost with her gunwale-to, and he hastened down to meet his friend, who came ashore in a little bay, quite near the gate-way, and in which the rock did not rise as much like a wall as it did on most of the exterior of the reef. Bob had caught about a dozen fish, some of which were of considerable size, though all were of either species or varieties that were unknown to them both. Selecting two of the most promising-looking, for their own use, he threw the others on the rocks, where the pigs and poultry might give them a trial. Nor was it long before these creatures were hard at work on them, disregarding the scales and fins. At first the hens were a little delicate, probably from having found animal food enough for their present wants in the insects; but, long before the game was demolished, they had come in for their full share. This experiment satisfied the mariners {{that there would be no}} difficulty in furnishing plenty of food for all their stock, and for any length of time, Kitty excepted. It is true, the pork and the poultry would be somewhat fishy; but that would be a novelty, and should it prove disagreeable on tasting it, a little <b>clean</b> <b>feeding,</b> at the proper moment, would correct the flavour.|$|R
