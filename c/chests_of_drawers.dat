25|$|Along {{the side}} walls of the sacristy are two large {{valuable}} 17th-century <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> made of jacaranda and of rosewood overlaid with ebony and inlaid with ivory. The walls are almost completely covered with three rows of valuable paintings laid out in superimposed friezes up to the vaulted ceiling. The lowest row of twenty paintings, {{considered to be the}} most important, recounts incidents and miracles in the life of St. Francis Xavier, especially his travels to the Far East. They were executed by the 17th-century Portuguese Mannerist painter André Reinoso (ca. 1590-after 1641) and his collaborators. The cycle was completed in 1619, the year St. Francis Xavier was recognized as Blessed, and was part of a Jesuit propaganda program to promote his canonization (which finally occurred in 1622).|$|E
2500|$|Even {{during his}} lifetime, {{the more radical}} of his contemporaries, such as Alexander Herzen, {{dismissed}} his architecture as [...] "reactionary manifestation of the tyrant's rule". The Soviet authorities, labelling Thon's churches ugly <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers,</b> systematically destroyed {{as many of them}} as possible, including all his churches in St Petersburg and vicinity and the work of his life, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. The fall of the Soviet rule in 1991 brought about a renewed interest {{in the work of the}} Neo-Russian-Byzantine master.|$|E

Furniture making centers include Capacuaro and Comachuén, who make chairs, dining room sets and beds—and Arantepacua and Turícuaro, who make <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> and benches. Patzcuaro makes higher-end furniture in colonial and other antique styles. Erongarícuaro makes trunks {{and dining room}} sets and Tócuario is known for furniture made from Mexican walnut (parota) [...] [...] Cuanajo makes furniture in white pine such as cupboards, hairs, trunks, spoon holders and headboards.|$|E

2500|$|The Entrance Hall is {{in three}} bays. [...] It is {{decorated}} in neoclassical style with a marble floor, red porphyry Ionic columns and a geometric coffered, tunnel vaulted ceiling.

60|$|The men {{belonging}} to the carpenter's gang furnished another case in point. There were some six or eight allotted to this department. All the cruise they were hard at work. At what? Mostly making <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers,</b> canes, little ships and schooners, swifts, and other elaborated trifles, chiefly for the Captain. What did the Captain pay them for their trouble? Nothing. But the United States government paid them; two of them (the mates) at nineteen dollars a month, and the rest receiving the pay of able seamen, twelve dollars.|$|E
60|$|By degrees a {{fleet of}} boats and canoes were piled up {{with all kinds of}} {{household}} articles; ponderous tables; <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers,</b> resplendent with brass ornaments, quaint corner cupboards; beds and bedsteads; with any quantity of pots, kettles, frying-pans, and Dutch ovens. In each boat embarked a whole family, from the robustious burgher down to the cats and dogs and little negroes. In this way they set off across the mouth of the Hudson, under the guidance of Oloffe the Dreamer, who hoisted his standard on the leading boat.|$|E

They are preserved in the archives, among sundry old parchment deeds, in Dutch and English, bearing the seals of the early governors of the province.|$|E

60|$|It {{was a low}} four-poster, {{shelving}} downward in {{the centre}} like a trough, {{and the room was}} crowded with impracticable tables and exploded <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers,</b> full of damp linen. A graphic representation in oil of a remarkably fat ox hung over the fireplace, and the portrait of some former landlord (who might have been the ox's brother, he was so like him) stared roundly in, {{at the foot of the}} bed. A variety of queer smells were partially quenched in the prevailing scent of very old lavender; and the window had not been opened for such a long space of time that it pleaded immemorial usage, and wouldn't come open now.|$|E
60|$|As {{they were}} {{passing through a}} street in the City, not very far from Mrs Todgers's place of residence, Ruth checked Tom before {{the window of a}} large Upholstery and Furniture Warehouse, to call his {{attention}} to something very magnificent and ingenious, displayed there to the best advantage, for the admiration and temptation of the public. Tom had hazarded some most erroneous and extravagantly wrong guess in relation to the price of this article, and had joined his sister in laughing heartily at his mistake, when he pressed her arm in his, and pointed to two persons at a little distance, who were looking in at the same window with a deep interest in the <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> and tables.|$|E
60|$|The next morning, {{some of the}} bolder {{and more}} curious {{undertook}} to reconnoitre. All was quiet and lifeless at the Wild Goose. The door yawned wide open, and had evidently been open all night, for the storm had beaten into the house. Gathering more courage from the silence and apparent desertion, they gradually ventured over the threshold. The house had indeed the air of having been possessed by devils. Every thing was topsy-turvy; trunks had been broken open, and <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> and corner cupboards turned inside out, as {{in a time of}} general sack and pillage; but the most woful sight was the widow of Yan Yost Vanderscamp, extended a corpse {{on the floor of the}} blue-chamber, with the marks of a deadly gripe on the wind-pipe.|$|E

60|$|When he had {{had enough}} of this it {{occurred}} to Loveday that he might get into the house in spite of the locked doors; and by entering the garden, placing a pole from the fork of an apple-tree to the window-sill of a bedroom on that side, and climbing across like a Barbary ape, he entered the window and stepped down inside. There was something anomalous in being close to the familiar furniture without having first seen his father, and its silent, impassive shine was not cheering; it was as if his relations were all dead, and only their tables and <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> left to greet him. He went downstairs and seated himself in the dark parlour. Finding this place, too, rather solitary, and the tick of the invisible clock preternaturally loud, he unearthed the tinder-box, obtained a light, and set about making the house comfortable for his father's return, divining that the miller had gone out to meet him by the wrong road.|$|E
60|$|By this time, certain vans {{had arrived}} for the {{conveyance}} of the goods, and divers strong men in caps were balancing <b>chests</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> and other trifles {{of that nature}} upon their heads, and performing muscular feats which heightened their complexions considerably. Not to be behind-hand in the bustle, Mr Quilp went to work with surprising vigour; hustling and driving the people about, like an evil spirit; setting Mrs Quilp upon all kinds of arduous and impracticable tasks; carrying great weights up and down, with no apparent effort; kicking the boy from the wharf, whenever he could get near him; and inflicting, with his loads, a great many sly bumps and blows {{on the shoulders of}} Mr Brass, as he stood upon the door-steps to answer all the inquiries of curious neighbours, which was his department. His presence and example diffused such alacrity among the persons employed, that, in a few hours, the house was emptied of everything, but pieces of matting, empty porter-pots, and scattered fragments of straw.|$|E
