5|$|In March 1933, Marquis claimed squatter's {{right on}} a nearby piece of land. He opened his <b>Custer</b> Battle Museum in April {{and moved to the}} property. He began {{publishing}} his own pamphlets for sale at the museum and the <b>Custer</b> battlefield. Titles in 1933 were: Sketch Story of the <b>Custer</b> Battle, She Watched Custer's Last Battle, <b>Custer</b> Soldiers Not Buried, and Which Indian Killed <b>Custer?,</b> in 1934 Sitting Bull and Gall the Warrior, and in 1935 Two Days After the <b>Custer</b> Battle.|$|E

50|$|At 9:00 PM, still 8 mi {{south of}} Stanardsville, <b>Custer's</b> men bivouacked {{for about an}} hour and a half. 500 men mistakenly {{continued}} their retreat through the night, thus reducing <b>Custer's</b> force to 1,000 men. The next morning, March 1, <b>Custer's</b> men engaged Confederate forces in what became known as the Battle of Stanardsville. After that battle, <b>Custer's</b> men withdrew to their original pre-raid positions beyond Madison, arriving there by dusk that evening.|$|R
40|$|This article {{shows that}} {{underlying}} the Museyroom passage of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is {{an account of}} the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Joyce's passage touches on what motivated the battle, its Irish participants, its commanders, <b>Custer's</b> disagreements with his Crow scouts, Sitting Bull's prediction of <b>Custer's</b> failure, <b>Custer's</b> (purely fanciful) joking reply to Sitting Bull's prediction, <b>Custer's</b> home near Bismarck, ND, and his signature song. Other passages scattered throughout Finnegans Wake treat of casualties, a straggler, <b>Custer's</b> trumpeter, <b>Custer's</b> from-the-grave denunciations of his subordinates, and the burial of the dead. The famous "Three quarks for Muster Mark!" passage describes the desolation of Last Stand Hill. And Joyce's famous final paragraph contains {{an account of the}} legend of the narrow escape of <b>Custer's</b> Crow scout Ashishishe, who, at the battle's close, hides in the carcass of a horse before making his escape downriver. A brief look at Joyce's choice of names closes out the article...|$|R
50|$|<b>Custer's</b> {{expeditionary force}} {{contained}} cavalry regiments {{from at least}} two divisions of the Army of the Potomac's Cavalry Corps. A section of Parrot rifles from Battery E, 1st U.S. Artillery under First Lieutenant David Essex Porter accompanied <b>Custer's</b> column to provide artillery support. <b>Custer's</b> force totaled about 1,500 men.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Custer</b> Trail, {{named for}} General George Armstrong <b>Custer,</b> {{was created in}} 1917 along a series of roads between Grand Rapids and Ft. Wayne, Indiana that {{included}} the modern M-37. <b>Custer</b> commanded the Michigan Cavalry Bridge during the Civil War, and he was wildly popular in the state after the war. The road {{that bears his name}} never achieved that level of popularity. By 1930, the name had already fallen out of use.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, all of Marquis' {{works were}} out of print. However, the Wooden Leg {{narrative}} was reprinted as Wooden Leg: A Warrior Who Fought <b>Custer</b> in 1962 by the University of Nebraska Press. In 1967 Marquis' daughters published his collected pamphlets as <b>Custer</b> on the Little Bighorn. Part of his Cheyenne book was published as The Reminiscences of Four Indians and a White Soldier in 1973, and Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was reprinted in 1974.|$|E
5|$|<b>Custer</b> {{used his}} 2nd and 3rd (Capehart's) brigades {{for two more}} {{ineffective}} attacks. Finally, <b>Custer</b> made a rare night attack using his entire division. Strong moonlight reduced the risk of getting lost or misidentifying friendly and enemy soldiers. The night attack was successful, and Custer's division captured 24 to 30 artillery pieces. About 1,000 Confederates were taken prisoner, and 150 to 200 wagons were captured.|$|E
50|$|<b>Custer's</b> early {{development}} projects, southern rockers Cry of Love and <b>Custer's</b> own funk creation DAG, were both signed to Columbia {{in the early}} 1990s.|$|R
25|$|Devin's {{division}} {{had come}} up in support of <b>Custer's</b> division but had not been seriously engaged. Devin's troops relieved <b>Custer's</b> men along the road, where they set up defensive lines facing Appomattox Court House and Lynchburg. <b>Custer's</b> men {{then turned to the}} task of clearing the field before trying to sleep {{for the rest of the}} night.|$|R
25|$|In <b>Custer's</b> last stand, {{at the end}} of the battle, {{the extent}} of the soldiers' {{resistance}} to the Native Indian warriors indicated they had few doubts about their prospects for survival if they surrendered. In the end, the hilltop where <b>Custer's</b> remaining troops made their last stand made it impossible for <b>Custer's</b> men to secure a defensive position. Nevertheless, the soldiers put up their most dogged defence, and died fighting.|$|R
5|$|In early September Marquis went to Lame Deer for the Cheyenne annual fair. There, Willis Rowland {{helped him}} compile {{a list of}} elderly Cheyennes. Although the <b>Custer</b> {{battlefield}} was on the Crow Reservation, the Crow {{had been on the}} US side during the Great Sioux War of 1876, of which the <b>Custer</b> battle was a part, and so would have no eyewitnesses to the battle, everybody fighting with <b>Custer</b> having been killed. Back in Lodge Grass, Marquis made two important contacts. In November, he had his first meeting with Thomas H. Leforge. Leforge lived among the Crow and had been a scout and interpreter for General Gibbon in the 1876 war. Leforge would be the subject of the first book Marquis succeeded in publishing, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian. The second contact was William H. White, who was with the Second Cavalry under Gibbon. White would be the subject of <b>Custer,</b> Cavalry & Crows.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Marquis was {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of time on his research into the <b>Custer</b> battle. He now had a dozen Cheyenne informants, including Wooden Leg. With them, from June 1928, communicating mainly with sign language or through interpreters, he consulted maps and went on field trips to the battle site. He also corresponded with George Bird Grinnell, Generals Hugh L. Scott and Edward S. Godfrey, and with Custer's widow Elizabeth <b>Custer.</b> He also started loaning out some of his <b>Custer</b> memorabilia for exhibitions. Personal contacts during this period included Laton Alton Huffman, a well-known Montana frontier photographer, W.H. Banfill of the Billings Gazette, who wrote Western history articles, artist and author Will James, and James Willard Schultz, author and explorer.|$|E
5|$|When Lounsberry {{learned that}} a {{military}} column (including the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. George Armstrong <b>Custer)</b> would soon leave Fort Abraham Lincoln for the Montana Territory, he agreed to accompany <b>Custer</b> and provide news coverage. However, {{at the last minute}} Lounsberry's wife fell ill, so the editor asked Kellogg to take his place. Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover nothing more than a sensational military victory.|$|E

40|$|History professors {{have long}} portrayed <b>Custer’s</b> {{stand at the}} Little Bighorn River {{in terms of the}} {{managerial}} quirks and personality flaws of the central characters. The discussion in Evan Connell’s (1984) book, Son of the Morning Star, illuminates the Last Stand in terms of economic incentives. In this paper we argue that <b>Custer’s</b> legendary Last Stand offers economics instructors with an extraordinary opportunity to pique students’ interest in the public choice paradigm. <b>Custer’s</b> Last Stand, Public Choice Analysis, Economic Incentive...|$|R
50|$|<b>Custer's</b> mounted troopers {{burst from}} their wood {{position}} in a charge that scattered the Indian forces, who fell back upriver with <b>Custer's</b> troops in pursuit. They pursued them for nearly four miles but {{were never able to}} close on them sufficiently to engage them.|$|R
5|$|After {{splitting}} from SH-152 near Eakly, SH-58 heads {{north to}} an interchange with Interstate 40, then passes through Hydro. Nine miles (14.5 km) later, it terminates at the <b>Custer</b> County line {{to become a}} county road, which eventually connects to State Highway 54.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} that dispatch, the Battle of the Little Bighorn was fought, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} <b>Custer</b> and the 208 soldiers, scouts, and civilians riding with him, including Kellogg.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these three big names there was also Harry Carey, still a major star when he made several films for the studio in 1922–23. The other cowboy stars of FBO included Bob <b>Custer,</b> Bob Steele, and teenager Buzz Barton.|$|E
25|$|The {{assessment}} of <b>Custer's</b> actions during the American Indian Wars has undergone substantial reconsideration in modern times. Documenting {{the arc of}} popular perception in his biography Son of the Morning Star (1984), author Evan Connell notes the reverential tone of <b>Custer's</b> first biographer Frederick Whittaker (whose book was rushed out the year of <b>Custer's</b> death.) Connell concludes:These days it is stylish to denigrate the general, whose stock sells for nothing. Nineteenth-century Americans thought differently. At that {{time he was a}} cavalier without fear and beyond reproach.|$|R
50|$|Following the North American {{video game}} crash of 1983, Mystique {{was unable to}} stay in business. As a result, many of Mystique's {{intellectual}} properties, including <b>Custer's</b> Revenge, were sold off to the adult video game company Playaround. Under the ownership of Playaround, <b>Custer's</b> Revenge was re-branded as Westward Ho and given slight modifications to its original game-play. These alterations included simple aesthetic changes such as the darkening in color of the Native American woman's skin tone. Playaround also made a version of <b>Custer's</b> Revenge named General Retreat.|$|R

5|$|M-96 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} between King Highway and Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) east of downtown Kalamazoo. From this point, it follows King Highway over and then along the Kalamazoo River through a suburban residential area. The highway then follows Michigan Avenue east through Comstock {{and north of}} Morrow Lake. At Galesburg, M-96 turns northeast along Augusta Drive to Augusta, running through rural farmland. It turns eastward again, skirting the Fort <b>Custer</b> State Recreation Area and the Fort <b>Custer</b> National Cemetery. In Augusta, M-96 turns to follow Dickman Road to Battle Creek, passing north and east of the W. K. Kellogg Airport on Dickman and Helmer roads.|$|E
5|$|Mark Kellogg (March 31, 1831 – June 25, 1876) was a {{newspaper}} reporter killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Kellogg rode with George Armstrong <b>Custer</b> during the battle and was evidently {{one of the first}} men killed by the Sioux and Cheyenne. His dispatches were the only press coverage of <b>Custer</b> and his men {{in the days leading up}} to the battle. As {{a newspaper}} stringer whose reports were picked up around the country, Kellogg is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die in the line of duty.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{continued}} to display and loan out his <b>Custer</b> artifacts. He had been considering {{for some time}} making more permanent arrangements for his collection of objects and photographs. In July 1932, {{with the aid of}} a loan from his younger daughter, Octavia, he came to an arrangement with the manager of a <b>Custer</b> tourist camp in Hardin. Marquis was given a two-room cabin; he lived in one room, and the other was used to display the collection. The camp planned to build a gift shop and Marquis' museum was expected to attract customers to it.|$|E

The regulation M1860 saber or [...] "long knives" [...] were not carried by troopers upon <b>Custer's</b> order.|$|R

The last of these included an introduction and 26-page biography of Marquis by Thomas D. Weist. Weist remains {{the main source of}} published information on Marquis. In 2003 a new edition of Wooden Leg: A Warrior Who Fought <b>Custer</b> was published with an introduction by Richard Littlebear, Cheyenne writer, educator, and president of Chief Dull Knife College.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand the}} blast radius for {{ammunitions}} testing at Fort <b>Custer,</b> MDOT rerouted the BL I-94/M-37 to {{run along the}} southern and eastern edges of the airport in Battle Creek instead of following roads on the opposite sides. This change was completed in 2015.|$|E
