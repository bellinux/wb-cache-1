40|$|Electrical {{insulation}} {{has been}} described as the most important component of electrical equipment such as transformer, circuit breakers, vacuum interrupters and power cables. Above all, oil filled transformers are one of the basic elements of a power system. They are connected to a large number of customers via power transmission and distribution system. However, partial discharge and breakdown phenomenon by lightning surge has proved {{to be one of the}} major factors and weak point at the oil/pressboard (PB) interface. Besides, aged oil filled transformers are increasing trend, there is need for replacement of aged transformer. Especially, the life time of a transformer is mainly dependent on the life of solid insulation. To enhance competitiveness and cost reduction of transformer system, there is need for alternative conventional pressboard in terms of miniaturization and simplification of insulation structure in oil filled transformer. Besides, to improve of design electric field, dielectric strength as well as suppression of <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> occurrence, there is necessary to improve the insulation performance to prevent discharge phenomena. In this reason, a lot of work has been recently devoted to improve the dielectric properties of insulation by adding specific functional additives in to the solid polymer, GIS spacer as well as liquid oil. However, recently few studies have been focused on modifications of the insulating paper using various specific functional additives to improve dielectric and mechanical properties; it is because streamer propagation in oil is greatly affected by the presence of pressboard. Above viewpoints, this research work suggest the new coating method on pressboard surface by thin solid layer coating such as epoxy resin, Teflon coating and silica/epoxy nanocomposite to study discharge phenomena and behavior in transformer composite insulation system. In experiment, five kinds of specimens are used with different coating materials using rod-plane and needle-bar electrode configuration. The <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> properties of conventional pressboard in oil/pressboard composite insulation are compared with that of the solid layer coated pressboard newly in terms of discharge propagation length, discharge occurrence probability and dielectric properties. Besides, to clarify the effect of epoxy/silica nanocomposite, we investigated the <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> behavior using epoxy/silica nanocomposite plate with different silica filler loading and different nano silica size. Additionally, we investigated the <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> behavior using COMSOL Multiphysics 2 D model for simulation. In simulation, to understand the <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> phenomena in composite insulation system depending on solid insulation parameters such as work function and permittivity, <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> modelling and simulation have been investigated. The simulation is based on a system of coupled general expression of governing equations that contain the physics to model streamer development based on the hydrodynamic diffusiondrift including ionization, dissociation, charge recombination and electron attachment, combined with Poisson’s equation in dielectric liquids. The governing equations for solid pressboard insulation are composed of Gauss’s Law. All the results are reported and discussed. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 435 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 3 月 24 日九州工業大学平成 28 年...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of oil-pressboard interface {{has been associated}} with <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> in large power transformers. Creeping discharge or surface discharge is considered as a serious fault condition that can lead to catastrophic failure under normal operating conditions. The studies on this fault condition are normally on the inception and extinction voltage under AC voltages. Recently, there are interest on the white marks formation and leakage current during the surface discharges. On the other hand, most studies related to creepage discharges under lightning impulse (LI) voltages focused on the pre-breakdown streamer propagation. The use of LI voltages is important in standard material breakdown test such as multiple-level method in IEC 60060 - 1. This paper investigates the partial discharge (PD) behaviour in the bulk oil and at the oil-pressboard interface from accumulative effect of breakdown test by using different configurations of electrodes. A point-plane electrode is used to study the PD behaviour in the oil bulk, whilst two setup of needle-bar electrode, i. e. needle placed in parallel with the pressboard surface and needle place at an angle close to the horizontal of pressboard are used to study the <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> behaviour at the oil-pressboard interface. In addition, the PD behaviour under certain level of negative LI voltage that less than the statistical withstand voltage (SWV) is also studied by measuring the PD current using radio frequency current transformer (RFCT) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} characterization of discharges propagating over solid insulators immersed in mineral oil, under impulse voltages using a point-plane electrode arrangement. It's shown that the nature and {{the thickness of the}} solid insulator significantly influence the characteristics of <b>creepage</b> <b>discharge</b> and especially the final length Lf and the density of branches ρ. For a given thickness, Lf increases quasi-linearly with the voltage; it decreases when the thickness increases. So ρ increases with the dielectric constant of the solid insulator; it also increases when the thickness is reduced. This indicates the important role of the capacitive effect in the propagation mechanism. The main discharge is followed by a secondary one of opposite sign to that of the main discharge...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigation for {{the characterization of}} <b>creepage</b> <b>discharges</b> that initiate and propagate on the solid/air and solid/liquid interfaces under 60 Hz power frequency voltages, using electro-optical technique and a point-plane electrode system. Solid insulations tested were {{in the form of}} thick sheets as well as thin films that are commonly used in electrical high voltage apparatus such as transformers, switchgear, and cable terminations etc. These insulating solids included materials like,glass, 'perspex', polymers of varying molecular structures. The oil/solid insulation’s interface was formed using silicone oil. In all combinations investigated, the purpose was to investigate not only different modes of <b>creepage</b> (surface) <b>discharge</b> that emerge {{as a result of the}} application of high electric stress but also to establish any role of the molecular structure of liquid as well as air insulating mediums that are in direct interface with the solid. These results evaluate thin films of the polymers produced by Saudi Arabian Basic Industrial Company (SABIC) to determine their insulating characteristics so to adapt them for different electrical application...|$|R
40|$|<b>Creepage</b> <b>discharges</b> on oil {{impregnated}} pressboard {{is one of}} {{the most}} dangerous transformer insulation fault, which can cause the gas action even transformer housing cracking accident. “White spot” is creepage important phenomena in the process of insulation board along the surface, so it is necessary to study the insulation board along the surface of creepage “white spot” in the process of growth characteristics. This paper set up a insulating paper along the surface of creepage “white spot” in the process of growth characteristics of observation platform.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at the {{influence}} of the voltage waveform (lightning impulse, dc and ac) and hydrostatic pressure on the morphology and final length of creeping discharges propagating over solid / liquid insulating surfaces in a pointplane electrode arrangement. Different solid materials immersed in mineral oil are tested. It is shown that under ac and dc, the discharges do not present a radial shape as observed with the negative discharges under lightning impulse voltages. For a given solid sample, the final length Lf (i. e. the maximum extension) of discharges is longer with ac than with lightning impulse voltage and dc. The currents waveforms are similar to those observed in liquids. On the other hand, the length of discharge branches is reduced when the hydrostatic pressure is increased whatever the voltage waveforms and polarity. Lf increases quasilinearly with the voltage and decreases when the hydrostatic pressure is increased. And for given voltage and pressure, the thinner the solid sample and/or the higher its dielectric constant, the longer the discharges are, indicating the important role of capacitive effects in the propagation mechanisms of discharges.
