However, the first formal market, the Association of Stockbrokers in Hong Kong, was not established until 1891. The Association was renamed the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1914.A second exchange, the Hong Kong Stockbrokers' Association was incorporated in 1921. The two exchanges merged to form the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1947 and re-establish the stock market after the Second World War.Rapid growth of the Hong Kong economy led to the establishment of three other exchanges - the Far East Exchange in 1969; the Kam Ngan Stock Exchange in 1971; and the Kowloon Stock Exchange in 1972.Pressure to strengthen market regulation and to unify the four exchanges led to the incorporation of SEHK, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in 1980. The four exchanges ceased business on 27 March 1986 and the new exchange commenced trading through a computer-assisted system on 2 April 1986. Prior to the completion of the merger with HKFE in March 2000, the unified stock exchange had 570 participant organisations.Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited was incorporated in 1989. It created CCASS, the central clearing and settlement system, which started operating in 1992 and became the central counterparty for all CCASS participants.The clearing operation is based on the immobilisation of share certificates in a central depository. Share settlement is on a <b>continuous</b> <b>net</b> settlement basis by electronic book entry to participants' stock accounts in CCASS.

The “fluidification” of discrete systems is a classical relaxation technique that aims to avoid the state explosion problem. <b>Continuous</b> Petri <b>nets</b> {{are the result of}} fluidifying traditional discrete Petri <b>nets.</b> In <b>continuous</b> Petri <b>nets</b> the firing of a transition is not constrained to the naturals but to the non-negative reals. Unfortunately, some important properties, as liveness, may not be preserved when the discrete net model is fluidified. Therefore, a thorough study of the properties of <b>continuous</b> Petri <b>nets</b> is required. This paper focuses on the study of deadlock-freeness in the framework of mono-T-semiflow <b>continuous</b> Petri <b>nets,</b> i. e., conservative nets with a single repetitive sequence (T-semiflow). The study is developed both on untimed and timed systems. Topological necessary conditions are extracted for this property.

40|$|The {{discrimination}} {{of a risk}} {{prediction model}} measures that model’s ability to distinguish between subjects with and without events. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is a popular measure of discrimination. However, the AUC has recently been criticized for its insensitivity in model comparisons in which the baseline model has performed well. Thus, 2 other measures have been proposed to capture improve-ment in discrimination for nested models: the integrated discrimination improvement and the <b>continuous</b> <b>net</b> reclassification improvement. In the present study, the authors use mathematical relations and numerical simula-tions to quantify the improvement in discrimination offered by candidate markers of different strengths as measured by their effect sizes. They demonstrate {{that the increase in}} the AUC depends on the strength of the baseline model, which is true to a lesser degree for the integrated discrimination improvement. On the other hand, the <b>continuous</b> <b>net</b> reclassification improvement depends only on the effect size of the candidate variable and its correlation with other predictors. These measures are illustrated using the Framingham model for incident atrial fibrillation. The authors conclude that the increase in the AUC, integrated discrimination improvement, and net reclassification improvement offer complementary information and thus recommend reporting all 3 alongside measures characterizing the performance of the final model. area under curve; biomarkers; discrimination; risk assessment; risk factor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — State {{explosion}} {{problems in}} the analysis of discrete event dynamic systems have lead to relaxed views, fluidification in particular. Proceeding in that way continuous Petri nets have been defined. For infinite servers semantics, switching linear systems appear through the presence of minimum operators due to synchronizations. The analysis of the ODEs defining the semantics of those hybrid models suffers from two problems: the existence of the minimum operators and stiffness. In discrete models, an approximated way to deal with stiffness was to classify the transitions into immediate and timed (thus markings are divided into vanishing and tangible). Avoiding synchronizations (hence minimum operators) and removing immediate transitions at net level becomes a crucial issue for continuous Petri nets because timed <b>continuous</b> <b>net</b> models and ODEs are isomorphous. The application to an example taken from the literature illustrates our purpose and the computational advantages obtained.

This paper then concentrates on controllability under this semantics.

The positive inotropy gave way to a progressive decline in force development which was unrelated to the action of catecholamines and was not accompa-nied by the development of contracture.
