50|$|Work on {{the western}} {{highrise}} span was bid in October 1964 and commenced in 1965. It crosses a shipping channel, with an orthotropic main span that is 750 ft long (at the time, the longest girder span in the United States) and has a vertical clearance of 135 ft. The main span is flanked by two orthotropic back spans which are each 375 ft long, and there are seven orthotropic side spans on the approach to each back span. Each of these side spans are 292 ft long. Although these spans appear to be formed from continuous box girders, they consist of alternating anchor <b>spans</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>spans.</b> Anchor spans rest on top of two adjacent piers <b>and</b> <b>cantilever</b> over each side slightly, <b>and</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> are hung between the ends of two adjacent anchor spans.

50|$|Built in 1950, the Patton Bridge {{spans the}} Green River {{near the city}} of Auburn in King County, Washington. The bridge is a three-span {{cantilever}} with two anchor arms, two <b>cantilever</b> arms <b>and</b> a <b>suspended</b> section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State.The anchor arms <b>and</b> <b>cantilever</b> arms are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck. The concrete deck is fixed to the top flange plate of the girders with steel shear developers. Utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design; i.e., the bottom flange of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces.The Patton Bridge's anchor arms are 115 ft feet long, the cantilever arms are 50 ft long, <b>and</b> the <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> is 100 ft.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 Radio Frequency (RF) Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) {{switches}} {{have many}} advantages over semiconductor switches. Despite these advantages {{they are not}} implemented in reliability demanding space, defense and commercial applications because of reliability concerns. Although some failure modes have been identified so far, other failure modes are still under research. Electromigration, a well-known failure mechanism in interconnects, was recently recognized as a possible cause of failure in micro-switches. However, {{there have been no}} instances of electromigration studies in the literature. This thesis presents a preliminary study on the electromigration failure {{and its impact on the}} lifetime of MEMS switches. A simulation program that emulates the electromigration process was developed. Parametric studies were performed to study the impact of impact certain parameters on electromigration process. The combined effects of Joule heating and electromigration were analyzed. Unlike passivated interconnects, the micro-switch is <b>cantilevered</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspended</b> in an inert medium without encapsulation. The electromigration lifetime estimation program developed in this thesis is applicable to all such free structures. Joule heating has been demonstrated to be a key factor in the electromigration failure of micro-switches. Results showed that the electromigration process is very slow at the beginning. After a certain time, the resistance is found to increase exponentially, increasing the temperature of the strip drastically toward failure. The same trend is also observed in a gold micro-switch, but with much slower rate of electromigration degradation, indicating a longer lifetime...|$|R

5000|$|For the {{construction}} of the cantilevers, the BRIDGE_BUILDER system has been imported from Norway {{for the first time in}} India. An average cycle time of five days has been achieved here for segment construction, as against the accepted international average of seven days. FREYSSINET system has been adopted for pre-stressing. Careful detailing of reinforcement and a cable profile was necessitated to achiever good quality and to minimize construction time. In order to place concrete through dense reinforcement and cable assembly, use of super plasticisers has been made. For manufacture and placing of large volumes of high grade concrete, electronically controlled automatic ELBA batching plants along with concrete pumps, were imported from West Germany.

50|$|When {{commissioned}} in 1943, Howrah was the 3rd-longest {{cantilever bridge}} in the world, behind Pont de Québec (549 m) in Canada and Forth Bridge (521 m) in Scotland. It has since been surpassed by three bridges, making it the sixth-longest cantilever {{bridge in the}} world in 2013. It is a suspension type balanced cantilever bridge, with a central span 1,500 ft between centers of main towers <b>and</b> a <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> of 564 ft. The main towers are 280 ft high above the monoliths and 76 ft apart at the top. The anchor arms are 325 ft each, while the cantilever arms are 468 ft each. The bridge deck hangs from panel points in the lower chord of the main trusses with 39 pairs of hangers. The roadways beyond the towers are supported from ground, leaving the anchor arms free from deck load. The deck system includes cross girders suspended between the pairs of hangers by a pinned connection. Six rows of longitudinal stringer girders are arranged between cross girders. Floor beams are supported transversally on top of the stringers, while themselves supporting a continuous pressed steel troughing system surfaced with concrete.|$|R
50|$|Each span {{comprises}} 2No. riveted longitudinal {{steel deck}} girders, supporting riveted cross girders, {{which in turn}} support a reinforced concrete slab deck.

Each set of three spans consists of two simply supported end spans which continue as cantilevers approximately 1/5 span into the middle span. The central 3/5 span sections are simply supported drop in spans supported by halving joints. The main span is a structurally independent lifting span. The bearings are inset from the end lifting beams. Spans 1, 3, 5 and 7 are 24.994m c/c of bearings.

These measurements were performed from an oceanographic tower in the northern Adriatic Sea within the framework of the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (CoASTS) project, an ocean color calibration and validation activity. The data set collected includes spectral measurements of the in-water apparent (diffuse attenuation coefficient, reflectance, Q-factor, etc.) and inherent (absorption and scattering coefficients) optical properties, as well as the concentrations of the main optical components (pigment <b>and</b> <b>suspended</b> matter concentrations). Clear seasonal patterns are exhibited by the marine quantities on which an appreciable short-term variability (on the order of a half day to one day) is superimposed.

Conversely, continuous truss bridges rely on rigid truss connections throughout the structure for stability. Severing a continuous truss mid-span endangers the structure. However, continuous truss bridges do not experience the tipping forces that a cantilever bridge must resist, because the main span of a continuous truss bridge is supported at both ends.|$|R
