The experiments were conducted using a Perspex column of 70 cm in total height and 4 cm inner diameter, as a direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser.</b> The active column height throughout the experiments was 48 cm. Pentane vapour at three different initial temperatures (40 ℃, 43. 5 ℃ and 47. 5 ℃), {{was used as the}} dispersed phase while tap water at a constant temperature (19 ℃) was used as the continuous phase. Seven different dispersed phase mass flow rates and five different continuous phase mass flow rates were tested. The experiments considered the transient temperature distribution along the direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser,</b> the steady-state temperature distribution, the volumetric heat transfer coefficient, the heat transfer rate per unit volume and the holdup ratio. Also, the efficiency and capital cost of the direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser</b> were estimated, and the heat transfer of the three-phase direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser</b> during flooding was studied. Theoretical models describing the direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser</b> were developed. These models included the transient temperature distribution, the steady-state temperature distribution and the volumetric heat transfer coefficient. These models implicitly involved new derivations for the surface heat transfer coefficient, the two-phase bubble size, the relative velocity of two-phase bubbles, the drag coefficient and the added mass of the two-phase bubble. All expressions were derived analytically except for the transient temperature distribution along the condenser which was found numerically, using MATLAB. The results showed that the mass flow rate ratio has a significant effect on the heat transfer characteristics of the condenser, while the initial temperature of the dispersed phase has only a slight effect.

Solar energy is a promising low-grade energy resource that can be harvested and utilised in different applications, such solar heater systems, which are used in both domestic and industrial settings. However, the implementation of an efficient energy conversion system or heat exchanger would enhance such low-grade energy processes. The direct contact heat exchanger could be the right choice due to its ability to efficiently transfer significant amounts of heat, simple design, and low cost. In this work, the heat transfer associated with the direct contact condensation of pentane vapour bubbles in a three-phase direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser</b> is investigated experimentally.

The method of optimization of technological parameters of process based on nondiscrete-logical modeling and method of optimization by the multivariable design of experiments (steep ascension - Box-Wilson's method) is applied to solute the tasks, which have arisen. The metallographic researches of welding joints with microscopes MBS- 2 and MIM- 8 M used are applied. For recording of dynamics of the electrical parameters modification during welding the double-beam storage oscillograph C 8 - 11, equipped with four-channel commutator, was used; the oscillograms photographed by the camera "Zenit ET". Measurement of settling magnitudes by the indicator ICh- 10 was carried out. The experimental proving of known basic solutions for welding of conductors with elements of the hermetic electrical device is realized. Using the systems analysis with applications of logical functions, the nondiscrete-logical (NL) model of process of the <b>contact</b> spot <b>condenser</b> microwelding of solid and multifilament conductors with elements of the hermetic electrical device was developed by author for the first time. On the basis of NL-model the development of basic solutions and preliminary optimization of technological parameters of process of <b>contact</b> spot <b>condenser</b> microwelding of solid and multifilament conductors with elements of the electrical device and optimization by the multivariable design of experiments was realized, {{as a result of}} which the optimum conditions for all types of mounting joints of the electrical device are specified. The welding joints strenght raises 1. 2 times in comparison with NL-optimization. The regression equation, that adequately describes the gradient motion to the optimal factors' region and reflects the each factor's influence degree on the parameter of optimization in the investigated interval of the factors variation, was obtained. On parameter of optimization (welding joints tearing strength) the least influence has value of working capacitors, the greatest influence has compression force on electrodes and voltage of capacitors charging. The researches of welding process technological parameters influence on formation process of welded joints of conductors with elements of the hermetic electrical device on designed manual instruments and at approbation of the experimental-industrial equipment were carried out. The research of correlation of conductor settling with strength of welding joints, which has confirmed that the final settling value can serve as joints quality control parameter, was realized. On the basis of it the mode of automatic quality control of the welding joints was developed and the device of the welding joints automatic quality control on final settling value is tested.

Using a three-phase direct contact heat exchanger {{instead of a}} surface type exchanger, such as a shell and tube heat exchanger, potentially makes the process more efficient and economic. This is because {{of its ability to}} work with a very low temperature driving force, as well as its low cost of construction. In this study, an experimental investigation of the heat transfer efficiency, and hence cost, of a three-phase direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser</b> has been carried out utilising a short Perspex tube of 70 cm total height and 4 cm internal diameter. Only 48 cm was used for the direct contact condensation. Pentane vapour with three different initial temperatures (40 ℃, 43. 5 ℃ and 47. 5 ℃) was contacted with water with an inlet temperature of 19 ℃. In line with previous studies, the ratio of the fluid flow rates was shown to have a controlling effect on the exchanger. Specifically, the heat transfer efficiency increased virtually linearly with this ratio, with higher efficiencies also being observed with higher flow 2 rates of the continuous phase. The effect of the initial temperature of the dispersed phase was shown to have a lower order impact than flow rate ratio.

The benefits are no need for any solvent aside from the water naturally in the botanical material and {{a significant reduction in}} environmental impact for large scale production processes. However, the aerosol formed by the microwave energy applied to the plant material is inefficiently collected with common condensers. Air coming from the open ends of extraction systems creates the boundary layer effects for the condenser, which makes essential oil collecting inefficient. To solve this problem, the development of a direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser</b> is in development for the collection step. My research is to model the collision between the aerosol particles and the liquid droplets from the spray nozzles in the direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser.</b> The goal in this project is to improve the collection efficiency by increasing adequate collision between the two sorts of droplets. Through the use of the model program developed, the collection efficiency of direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser</b> will be improved to increase production oil. Based on our computation, a bigger oil droplet leads to a greater captured fraction of oil aerosol, while the bigger water droplet decreases the captured fraction with fixed volume flow rate of water.

A {{significant}} and increasing source of nutrients to freshwater and marine ecosystems is atmospheric deposition (AD), either as “wet deposition ” or as “dry deposition ” of particles and “gaseous exchange ” between {{the air and}} water. Three steps are involved in wet deposition: (i) the pollutants need to come into <b>contact</b> with <b>condensed</b> water in the atmosphere; (ii) the pollutants must be scavenged by the droplets; and (iii) it then has to start raining before the condensed water evaporates back into water vapor, thereby releasing the pollutants back into the air (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006).

In particular, graphene {{has been found}} to exhibit outstanding electronic and mechanical properties, as well as an unusual low-energy spectrum of Dirac quasiparticles giving rise to a fractional quantum Hall effect when freely suspended and immersed in a magnetic field.

50|$|Open or semi-open bath {{immersion}} cooling is a data center cooling technique that implies fully submerging servers in dielectric coolant fluid. It is called open or semi-open bath because servers are placed side-by-side in large tanks that function as baths. These baths operate at atmospheric pressure {{and allow the}} coolant fluid to be moved through the hardware components or servers submerged in it.Open Bath Immersion Cooling uses single-phase dielectric liquids. These liquids always remain in liquid state while operating. They never boil or freeze. The oil is usually pumped to an external heat exchanger where it is cooled thanks to heat exchange with a cooler water-circuit. A different approach uses natural convection as the driving force to circulate the oil through the servers. and a water cooled heat exchanger. This technique uses “open baths“ as there’s little (or no) risk of the coolant evaporating. In semi-open bath Immersion Cooling, a two-phase chemically engineered liquid is the working fluid. It literally boils thanks to its low boiling point and thus exists in both a liquid and gas phase. The system takes advantage of a concept known as “latent heat” which is the heat (thermal energy) required to change the phase of a fluid (in this case two-phase dielectric mineral oil). The oil is only cooled by boiling and thus remains at the boiling point (“saturation temperature”). Energy transferred from the servers into the two-phase oil will cause a portion of it to boil off into a gas (this is {{the second phase of}} the oil). The gas rises above the liquid oil level where it <b>contacts</b> a <b>condenser</b> which is cooler than the saturation temperature. This causes the vapoured oil to condense back into a liquid form and fall (rain) back into the bath.|$|R

More importantly, the physics behind the vapour condensation process in LCSs has not been thoroughly researched mainly due {{to the complexity of}} the phenomena involved. The present work focusses on providing detailed information of the condensation process within the LCS, which consists of a water cooled indirect <b>contact</b> <b>condenser.</b> In an effort to understand the mass transfer phenomena within the LCS, a numerical simulation was performed using the Eulerian approach. A multiphase multi-component model, with the condensable vapours and non-condensable gases as the gaseous phase and the condensed bio-oil as the liquid phase, has been created. Species transport modelling has been used to capture the detailed physical phenomena of 11 major compounds present in the pyrolysis vapours. The development of the condensation model relies on the saturation pressures of the individual compounds based on the corresponding states correlations and assuming that the pyrolysis vapours form an ideal mixture. After the numerical analysis, results showed that different species condense at different times and at different rates. In this simulation, acidic components like acetic acid and formic acids were not condensed as it was also evident in experimental works, were the pH value of the condensed oil is higher than subsequent stages. In the future, the current computational model can provide significant aid in the design and optimization of different types of LCSs...|$|E
40|$|The {{transient}} temperature distribution and volumetric {{heat transfer coefficient}} during the 16 inception of flooding in a three-phase bubble type direct <b>contact</b> <b>condenser</b> have been 17 experimentally investigated. The flooding mechanism and the factors affecting the onset of 18 flooding of the three-phase direct contact column are not considered. A short Perspex column 19 of 70 cm total height and 4 cm internal diameter utilising two immiscible fluids was studied. 20 Pentane vapour with initial temperatures of 40 °C, 43. 5 °C and 47. 5 ℃ was the dispersed phase 21 and tap water at a constant temperature (19 ℃) was the continuous phase. Only 48 cm of the 22 column {{was used as the}} active height and different mass flow rates of both phases were used. 23 The experimental results showed that the instantaneous temperature distribution along the 24 direct contact column tends to be uniform when the direct contact column is working under 25 flooding conditions. Furthermore, the volumetric heat transfer coefficient increases as the 26 dispersed mass flow rate is increased towards the flooding limit and remains constant along 27 the column height. In addition, the dispersed phase mass flow rate that leads to flooding 28 increased with increasing mass flow rate of the continuous phase. The initial temperature of 29 the dispersed phase did not have a considerable effect on the flooding inception limit under 30 the present experimental condition...|$|E
40|$|So far for {{producing}} ketupat done using boiling system open {{by using a}} regular steamer so much heat loss occurs due to his high consumption of fuel, to reduce the fuel consumption of the writers {{tried to make a}} prototype of a batch type boiling ketupat equipped with condenser. Purpose to condensation steam in boiling water so that it does not require the addition of water. Energy consumption in a way traditional ketupat boiling takes time for 4 hours for all processes with the same time as that of 285000 kJ/kg while using a prototype wave energy consumption i. e. batch type of 37341 kJ/kg for cooling fluid flow rate 5 lt/min, 37802 kJ/kg for cooling fluid flow rate 10 lt/min and 46100 Lt/min for the coolant flow rate 15 lt/min. Influence of flow rate of cooling fluid on the heat transfer coefficient is proportional, the greater the flow rate of cooling fluid then the greater the coefficient of heat transfer rates. This is due to the heat lost when still {{on the way to the}} condenser and heat lost due to <b>contact</b> between the <b>condenser</b> with outside air...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Deaeration of feed water== Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide {{are removed}} from the feed water by deaeration. Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) Deaerating heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct <b>contact</b> vent <b>condenser,</b> tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|R
40|$|Reducing the CO 2 -pollution, {{resulting}} from the combustion of fossil coal for energy production, is important to affect environmental changes. One way to achieve a reduction {{is to use the}} oxy-fuel technology. The technology uses O 2 and re-circulated flue gas during the combustion which results in a flue gas mainly consisting of CO 2. The flue gas could then be compressed and stored without environmental effects. A problem that follows from the compression is the risk of acidification in sensitive parts of the process. Acidification can occur because of reactions following from the <b>contact</b> of <b>condensed</b> water and sulphur- and nitrogen-oxides which are also present in the flue gas. This report compiles and evaluates the basis of a scientific unit with the purpose of exploring the possibilities of extracting impurities of SOx and NOx from the flue gases. The dimensions of the unit are based on basic conditions, defined for an existing oxy-fuel process at Chalmers, and on the results of computer modelling. The computer models simulates chemical reactions in a gas phase reactor and in a two-phase reactor where the extraction of impurities is achieved by absorption. In addition to this, a research on possible, compatible measuring tools is done. To create the right conditions for extracting the impurites the flue gas has to be compressed to between 10 and 16 bars and cooled down to a temperature of 40 ◦C. These conditions are necessary for oxidizing NO to NO 2 and other water-soluble nitrogen compounds, which reacts efficiently with water. The oxidation of NO to these nitrogen compounds occurs efficiently in a gas phase reactor of the size 10 liters and with residence time of 120 seconds. The final step is the extraction of the impurities where SOx and NOx are absorbed by water. The absorbtion occurs efficiently in a 10 liter twophase reactor at low temperatures and high pressures. To prevent acidification from occuring in sensitive parts of the process, it’s necessary to dry the flue gas before the compression, in order to minimize the condensate. A new system of measuring tools which are compatible with the type of measurements needed is required...|$|R
