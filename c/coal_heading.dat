5000|$|The branch's first {{customer}} was Wythemoor Colliery, east of Distington. It {{closed in}} 1886, a mere {{seven years after}} the branch opened, due to [...] "incompetent management". The colliery reopened in 1904 and wound coal until the 1920s, but the branch eastwards to Ullock Junction from the junction with the colliery siding closed in 1919, all <b>coal</b> <b>heading</b> westwards thereafter. The second customer was Distington Ironworks which ceased production in 1922, overtaken by technological progress in steelmaking. In 1888, for example, just one train a day ran out and back from Ullock Junction to Distington Ironworks, one train a day ran out and back from Parton to Bain's Siding and one train a day ran out and back from the coast to Distington Ironworks, meagre fare for the investment in infrastructure. Perhaps worse, commercially, was {{that the bulk of}} traffic to and from Distington Ironworks travelled on the rival CWJR, with only a meagre amount of pig iron travelling down {{the western part of the}} branch through Parton to Whitehaven.|$|E
40|$|Nebraska {{businesses}} and households are {{actively involved in}} the coal industry as energy producers and as transportation providers. Nebraska has seven coal-fired electric generation stations. There are 839 workers employed at these stations, or in positions at other locations which are directly tied to coal-fired electricity generation, with annual wages and benefits of approximately $ 87 million. The stations benefit the Nebraska economy by providing reliable, low cost energy utilized by Nebraska industries, agricultural producers, commercial {{businesses and}} households. In addition, many of these stations generate power that is “exported,” meaning that it is purchased by out of state customers. Such export activity creates an economic impact on the state economy. Collectively, the 7 stations export approximately 9. 6 percent of their output. These exports generate a direct economic impact of $ 55 million in output, $ 34 million in value added, $ 8 million in labor income and create 81 jobs in Nebraska. Multiplying this effect through the Nebraska economy generates a total economic impact of $ 77 million in output, $ 16 million in labor income and 246 jobs. This economic activity generates $ 4. 1 million in income, sales and property taxes. Much of the nation’s <b>coal</b> <b>heading</b> eastward passes through Nebraska. In addition, Nebraska is the home of the headquarters of Union Pacific railroad and hosts three sizable switching yards for that company as well as BNSF. Activity in all of these sectors creates economic impact in Nebraska. Coal-related rail activity directly generates $ 2. 9 billion in output, $ 1. 3 billion in value added, $ 745 million in labor income and creates 6, 750 jobs in Nebraska, as seen in the second section of the table. Multiplying this effect through the Nebraska economy generates $ 4. 8 billion in output, $ 1. 4 billion in labor income and 22, 600 jobs. This economic activity generates $ 137 million in income, sales and property taxes. Collectively, these two coal-related industries generate almost $ 4. 9 billion in output, over $ 1. 4 billion in labor income and more than 22, 800 jobs. This economic activity generates $ 142 million in income, sales and property taxes...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. {{underground}} {{coal miner}} faces a continuing hazard {{from the fall}} of roof. At the root of many injuries and fatalities are weak or defective roof strata. Throughout mining history, millions of miles of entry have provided exposure of every conceivable geologic roof hazard. This report describes the geologic origin, association, and potential danger from the most common hazards. Discussions of weak rock include drawrock, rider <b>coals,</b> <b>head</b> <b>coal,</b> stackrock, and stream valley effects. Discontinuities, or roof defects, are described including, clay veins, slickensides, joints, and paleochannels. A number of examples from U. S. coalfields are used to document geologic structure and associated hazards. Roof fall analysis is a methodology used by NIOSH for hazard recognition and prevention; its application and benefit to the industry are discussed...|$|R
