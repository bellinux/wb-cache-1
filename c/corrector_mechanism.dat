40|$|During {{image quality}} {{testing in the}} third and final thermal-vacuum test of the {{integrated}} WFC 3 instrument, an anomaly was discovered whereby the width and peak signal fraction of short exposure PSF images were observed to modulate for alternate exposures in a series. This behavior was traced to vibration of the UVIS shutter when its servo-control loop is enabled, which is believed to induce small (mas level) pointing jitter in the optics, most likely the pick-off mirror and the <b>corrector</b> <b>mechanism</b> (M 1) mirror. We present model computations of the effects of this vibration on several PSF parameters for a range of exposure times, wavelengths and (currently uncertain) degree of severity of the vibration expected on orbit. Only very short (< 10 s) exposures are likely to be significantly affected; this may be partially mitigated by obtaining such exposures using the better-performing side of the shutter...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{insertion}} of WFC 3 into the HST observatory during Servicing Mission 4, we aligned the UVIS and IR channels, independently, to the telescope early in the SMOV 4 instrument verification campaign. Using a variety of techniques, and accounting for the OTA temporal focus variation, we adjusted the instrument <b>corrector</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to optimize image quality. The IR channel alignment observations, analysis techniques and resulting adjustments are described herein; alignment of the UVIS channel is treated in a separate report...|$|R
