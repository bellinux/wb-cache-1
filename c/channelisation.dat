Flooding has historically been a problem and the Irwell has seen much modification along its course in Salford with some bends being removed, <b>channelisation,</b> and the construction of levees and bank reinforcements. Salford has expanded along the river valley to the north and south and on to higher ground on the valley sides at Irlams o' th' Height and Higher Broughton. Unconsolidated glacial deposits along the riverbank at Broughton have caused several landslides along the riverbank. The City Engineer's Department of the City of Salford recorded one such incident near Great Clowes Street in February 1882, and others in 1886, 1887 and 1888. In 1892 the road was propped with timber supports. The tram service along the road was discontinued in 1925, and the road closed to mechanically propelled vehicles in January 1926. Further slips saw the road closed completely in July 1933, and although no substantial movements have been recorded since 1948 slow subsidence around the Cliff continues to this day.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{soil erosion}} and {{landslides}} in its upper catchment {{have produced a}} silt yield of about 19m3/ha/year (10cuyd/acre/yr), {{one of the highest}} in the world. Of major tributaries, the Arun brings the greatest amount of coarse silt in proportion to its total sediment load. The river transports sediment down the steep gradients and narrow gorges in the mountains and foothills where the gradient is at least ten metres per km. On the plains beyond Chatra, the gradient falls below one metre per km to as little as 6cm per km as the river approaches the Ganges. Current slows and the sediment load settles {{out of the water and}} is deposited on an immense alluvial fan that has grown to an area of about 15000km2. This fan extends some 180km from its apex where it leaves the foothills, across the international border into Bihar state and on to the Ganges. The river has numerous interlacing channels that shift laterally over the fan from time to time. Without <b>channelisation,</b> floods spread out very widely. The record flow of 24200m3/s is equivalent to water a metre deep and more than 24km wide, flowing at one metre per second.|$|E

Into this canal the Gender now discharges. A further downstream section of the Gender between the canal and the Engelsbergen pond remains, but receives little water of the original stream.

40|$|International audienceIn recent decades, stream valleys {{have been}} profoundly {{modified}} by {{the construction of}} weirs and dams and by <b>channelisation.</b> <b>Channelisation</b> modifies the morphology of streams and induces changes in their energy regime and sediment transport capacity. These types {{of changes in the}} channel morphology have to be quantified to allow the implementation of management strategies to regulate sediment transfer. However, studies over an entire stream using historical comparisons remain scarce, and the associated uncertainties have not yet been resolved. In this study, the sedimentary response to <b>channelisation</b> on a medium time scale (42 years) of a French river known as the Ligoire is investigated. This river is the main channel of a small rural headwater catchment that has been channelised over 21 km. We have used the historical cross sections before and after <b>channelisation</b> and the current ones, and the objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to develop a methodology of cross section superposition and the associated uncertainties; (2) to quantify the erosion and aggradation processes in the bed and on the banks along the bed profile; and (3) to calculate a sediment budget for the entire stream and determine the relative contributions of the banks and the streambed to this budget. A comparison of the cross sections before and after the <b>channelisation</b> shows that the morphology of the stream has been completely altered: the main channel length was reduced by 10 %, the bankfull width was increased on average by 63 %, and the slopes were smoothed. A total of 60, 000 m 3 of sediments was excavated during the <b>channelisation</b> works. Our results indicate that erosion is the dominant process: over 63 % of its length, the streambed was incised by 0. 41 m on average; and over 60 % of its length, the banks were eroded by 0. 20 m on average. The successive patterns of erosion and deposition along the stream are the result of the cumulative effects of <b>channelisation</b> and of the presence of weirs and artificial knickpoints in the Ligoire channel. The vertical uncertainty of the elevation of the historical cross section is an important parameter for controlling the areas and sediment budget values. Using Monte Carlo methods, we found that 1000 sediment budgets from different profile shiftings are necessary to obtain a variation coefficient below 0. 1 %. The overall mean stream sediment budget for the period 1970 – 2012 is - 9358 ± 412 m 3, with 66 % originating from the banks and 34 % from the streambed. Relative to the Ligoire watershed surface, the stream sediment yield is 2. 71 ± 0. 12 m 3. km− 2. y− 1.

40|$|The Partido Stream {{is a small}} torrential {{course that}} flows into the marsh of the Doñana National Park, an area that was {{declared}} a World Heritage Site in 1994. Before 1981, floods occurred, and the stream overflowed onto a floodplain. As an old alluvial fan, the floodplain has its singular orography and functionality. Fromthe floodplain, several drainage channels, locally called caño, discharged into themarsh. The Partido Streamhad themorphology of a caño and covered approximately 8 km from the old fan to the marsh. The stream was straightened and channelised in 1981 to cultivate the old fan. This resulted in floods that were concentrated between the banks in the following years, which caused the depth of water and the shear stress to increase, thus, scouring the river bed and river banks.
