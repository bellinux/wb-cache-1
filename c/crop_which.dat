5|$|Historically, Bani Zeid's {{economy was}} {{dependent}} on the olive <b>crop,</b> <b>which</b> was supplied to soap factories in Nablus. Until the present day, olive trees cover most of the town's cultivable land. However, the residents of Bani Zeid today largely derive their income from employment in the civil service and private business. There {{are a number of}} archaeological sites in Bani Zeid, including the old town of Deir Ghassaneh, the manor of Sheikh Salih al-Barghouti and the maqam ("saintly person's tomb") of Sheikh al-Khawwas.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. Contemporary depictions show a large <b>crop,</b> <b>which</b> was {{probably}} used to add space for food storage and to produce crop milk. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the dodo and the solitaire was limited by the amount of crop milk they could produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
5|$|The Masons {{lived in}} a colonial Virginia that had few roads, as most {{commerce}} was carried on Chesapeake Bay or along the waters of its tributaries, such as the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. Most settlement took place near the rivers, through which planters could trade with the world. Thus, colonial Virginia initially developed few towns, since estates were largely self-sufficient, and could get what they needed without the need to purchase locally. Even the capital, Williamsburg, saw little activity when the legislature was not in session. Local politics was dominated by large landowners like the Masons. The Virginia economy rose and fell with tobacco, the main <b>crop,</b> <b>which</b> was raised mostly for export to Britain.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice <b>crop,</b> <b>which</b> would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{cultivation}} persisted {{only in the}} light, well-drained, and chalk-based soils of {{the north}} Essex countryside. The Essex town of Saffron Walden got its name as a saffron growing and trading centre; its name was originally Cheppinge Walden, and the culinary name change was effected to punctuate {{the importance of the}} crop to the townsfolk; the town's arms still feature blooms from the eponymous crocus. Yet as England emerged from the Middle Ages, rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron's use and cultivation. Puritanical partisans favoured increasingly austere, unadorned, and unspiced foods. Saffron was also a labor-intensive <b>crop,</b> <b>which</b> became an increasing disadvantage as wages and time opportunity costs rose. And finally, an influx of more exotic spices from the far East due to the resurgent spice trade meant that the English, as well as other Europeans, had many moreand cheaperseasonings to dally over.|$|E
5|$|One {{building}} at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3million (US$1.6million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security {{in the months after}} the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango <b>crop,</b> <b>which</b> was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75percent of the coconut trees and 75percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50percent.|$|E

25|$|The great {{majority}} of slug species are harmless to humans and to their interests, but {{a small number of}} species are serious pests of agriculture and horticulture. They can destroy foliage faster than plants can grow, thus killing even fairly large plants. They also feed on fruits and vegetables prior to harvest, making holes in the <b>crop,</b> <b>which</b> can make individual items unsuitable to sell for aesthetic reasons, and can make the crop more vulnerable to rot and disease.|$|E
25|$|Much of upland Georgia was {{developed}} as {{what became known}} as the Black Belt, named for the fertile soil. Planters brought or purchased many enslaved African Americans as workers for the labor-intensive crop. The leading Cherokee participated in the cultivation of cotton as a commodity <b>crop,</b> <b>which</b> soon replaced deer-skin trading as a source of wealth in the region. The first steamboat navigated the Coosa River to Rome in 1836, reducing the time-to-market for the cotton trade and speeding travel between Rome and New Orleans on the Gulf Coast, the major port for export of cotton.|$|E
25|$|In Sicily, where Saint Joseph is {{regarded}} {{by many as}} their Patron saint, and in many Italian-American communities, thanks are given to Saint Joseph (San Giuseppe in Italian) for preventing a famine in Sicily during the Middle Ages. According to legend, there was a severe drought at the time, and the people prayed for their patron saint to bring them rain. They promised that if he answered their prayers, they would prepare a large feast to honor him. The rain did come, {{and the people of}} Sicily prepared a large banquet for their patron saint. The fava bean was the <b>crop</b> <b>which</b> saved the population from starvation and is a traditional part of Saint Joseph's Day altars and traditions. Giving food to the needy is a Saint Joseph's Day custom. In some communities it is traditional to wear red clothing and eat a Neapolitan pastry known as a zeppola (created in 1840 by Don Pasquale Pinatauro in Napoli) on Saint Joseph's Day. Maccu di San Giuseppe is a traditional Sicilian dish that consists of various ingredients and maccu that is prepared on this day. Maccu is a foodstuff and soup that dates to ancient times which is prepared with fava beans as a primary ingredient.|$|E

25|$|Sweet {{potatoes}} {{became popular}} {{very early in}} the islands of the Pacific Ocean, spreading from Polynesia to Japan and the Philippines. One reason is that they were a reliable crop in cases of crop failure of other staple foods because of typhoon flooding. They are featured in many favorite dishes in Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and other island nations. Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and some other Asian countries are also large sweet potato growers. Sweet potato, also known as kelang in Tulu, is part of Udupi cuisine in South India. Uganda (the second largest grower after China), Rwanda, and some other African countries also grow a large <b>crop</b> <b>which</b> {{is an important part of}} their peoples' diets. The New World, the original home of the sweet potato, grows less than three percent (3%) of the world's supply. Europe has only a very small sweet potato production, mainly in Portugal. In the Caribbean, a cultivar of the sweet potato called the boniato is popular. The flesh of the boniato is cream-colored, unlike the more popular orange hue seen in other cultivars. Boniatos are not as sweet and moist as other sweet potatoes, but many people prefer their fluffier consistency and more delicate flavor.|$|E
