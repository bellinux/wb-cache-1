40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Microbial corneal {{infection}} {{is the most}} serious complication of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear. <b>Contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases are a recognised potential source of pathogens associated with corneal ulcers. METHODS [...] This survey established the incidence of protozoal, bacterial, and fungal <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case contamination in 101 asymptomatic daily wear cosmetic <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers from a domiciliary <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> practice. RESULTS [...] Eighty two (81 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases were found to be contaminated, with 19 (19 %) sterile. Of all <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases, 78 (77 %) grew bacteria, 24 (24 %) fungi, and 20 (20 %) protozoa. Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from eight (8 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases. Fifty six (55 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases yielded mixed bacterial contamination. This is the first <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case survey in which hydrogen peroxide disinfection was the major method of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> disinfection (75 % of subjects) and no home made saline was used. All the contaminating organisms were shown to possess the enzyme catalase that breaks down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. The polymicrobial nature of the biofilms found in many <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases is illustrated electron micrographically. CONCLUSION [...] Based on data from this and previous studies, the authors conclude with recommendations for <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers: (1) regular scrubbing of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case interior to disrupt biofilms; (2) exposure of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case to very hot water (> or = 70 degrees C) will kill Acanthamoeba contaminants; (3) allow <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case to air dry between uses; (4) if hydrogen peroxide dis{{infection is}} preferred, use a two step system; (5) replace <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case regularly...|$|R

However, other key {{sequences}} occurred in the studio. Because the fight scene between the Winchesters and Azazel at the climax was meant {{to take place in}} a secluded, forest-enclosed cabin, production built the set on a sound stage. Production designer Jerry Wanek felt the set was extremely important, as viewers would become uninterested if the forest looked fake.

5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E
5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens fabricator who sandwiched wrinkled tinfoil between two sclera <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous {{to the health of the}} actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.|$|E

Methods: Three vitreoretinal surgeons evaluated fundus visibility during vitrectomy on the images of five study materials used on the cornea: balanced saline solution, a viscoelastic agent, a vitrectomy <b>contact</b> <b>lens,</b> a rigid gas permeable (RGP) <b>contact</b> <b>lens,</b> and a soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens.</b> Fundus visibility was graded using the following scale: grade 1, unclear; grade 2, slightly unclear; grade 3, clear; and grade 4, very clear. Results: Respective scores for each material used during core vitrectomy and membrane removal were: balanced saline solution, 3. 3 / 3. 3; viscoelastic agent, 3. 8 / 3. 3; vitrectomy <b>contact</b> <b>lens,</b> 3. 3 / 4. 0; RGP <b>contact</b> <b>lens,</b> 4. 0 / 3. 9; soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens,</b> 1. 1 /not applicable.

5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had lost one of his <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Boycott {{appeared}} only intermittently in the Test team. A back injury forced him to miss half of the 1967 season, and an average of 32.40 against the Australians during the 1968 Ashes was unspectacular. Domestically, his injury also limited his contribution; however, he did hit five centuries before {{he was forced to}} stop playing in June 1968. Health problems with his spleen and trouble adjusting to wearing <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> meant that Boycott missed the tour of Pakistan in 1967–68, but he returned to the team by the summer of 1969, scoring 128 against the West Indies at Old Trafford, and another century at Lord's.

50|$|Increased corneal {{curvature}} is {{yet another}} change known to arise from long-term <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear; this increase in corneal curvature can {{be as much as}} 0.5 diopters greater than normal. Corneal surface irregularity and asymmetry are also caused by long-term <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear; these problems are sometimes correlated with astigmatism in <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers and are thought to be caused by hypoxia, surface molding, and chronic and mild trauma to the cornea from <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> use.|$|R

William Wyler {{originally}} wanted Heston for the role, but sought another actor after he moved Heston {{into the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur. Because both Boyd and Heston had blue eyes, Wyler had Boyd outfitted with brown <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> as a way of contrasting the two men. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired after two days of work because she could not cry on cue. Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott as Miriam, and she was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline, Wyler cast her as Tirzah.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Boycott {{continued}} to play in his spectacles, and later switched to <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> He feared his career would have ended had he not used such aids as his eyesight was poor. Boycott's initial appearances for Yorkshire failed to impress, and he was compared unfavourably to his main rival, John Hampshire. When Brian Close took over from Vic Wilson as captain of Yorkshire in 1963 he persuaded the committee to keep Boycott on, and was rewarded when, on 2 June 1963, Boycott scored 145 against Lancashire. His century was also part of a 249-run fourth wicket partnership which became a Yorkshire record. Boycott cemented {{his place in the}} Yorkshire XI in the 1963 season with successive scores of 76, 53, 49 not out and 50, and on 29 August made a century partnership in both innings of a match against Leicestershire with Ken Taylor. Boycott handed in his notice to the Ministry of Pensions that same year. After a brief loss of form he kept his place with scores of 62, 28 and 113 in the following matches. This second century again came against Lancashire, making Boycott the first Yorkshire cricketer to score his first two centuries in a Roses match, as the hotly contested Yorkshire versus Lancashire matches were termed.|$|E
5|$|Verbinski did {{not want}} an entirely romanticized feel to the film: he wanted a sense of {{historical}} fantasy. Most of the actors wore prosthetics and <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> Depp had contacts that acted as sunglasses, while Rush and Lee Arenberg wore dulled contacts that gave a sinister feel to the characters. Mackenzie Crook wore two contacts to represent his character's wooden eye: a soft version, and a harder version for when it protrudes. In addition, their rotten teeth and scurvy skin were dyed on, although Depp did have gold teeth added, which he forgot to remove after filming. Depp also used a genuine pistol which was made in 1760 in London, which the crew bought from a dealer in Connecticut. A number of swords were built for the production by blacksmith Tony Swatton. The crew spent five months creating the cavern in which Barbossa and the Black Pearl crew attempt to reverse their curse, filling it with five feet of water, 882 Aztec coins, and some gold paint on the styrofoam rocks for more impressions of treasure. The crew also built the fortress at Port Royal in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and Governor Swann's palace was built at Manhattan Beach. A fire broke out in September 2002, causing $525,000 worth of damage, though no one was injured.|$|E

Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

The tests used for tear stability were the tear break-up time (TBUT) test and a non-invasive tear break-up time (NITBUT) test; for tear quantity, the Schirmer test (ST) and a modified cotton thread test (CTT) were used. Measurements were taken before and after various periods of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear. Inconsistent changes in the pre-lens tear film (PLTF) stability were observed. There was no association between corneal staining and low PLTF stability. Soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear caused a significant initial transient decrease in the tear stability but no changes in tear quantity.
