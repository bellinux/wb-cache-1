De Candolle's system (1813) which was to predominate thinking {{through much of the}} 19th century used a similar general arrangement, with two subgroups of his Monocotylédonés (Monocotyledoneae). Lindley (1830) followed De Candolle in using the terms Monocotyledon and Endogenae interchangeably. They considered the monocotyledons to be a group of vascular plants (Vasculares) whose vascular bundles were thought to arise from within (Endogènes or endogenous).|$|E

40|$|Entrainment in {{flotation}} can {{be considered}} as a two-step process, including the transfer of the suspended solids {{in the top of the}} pulp region just below the pulp-froth interface to the froth phase and the transfer of the entrained particles in the froth phase to the concentrate. Both steps have a strong <b>classification</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The degree of entrainment describes the classification effect of the drainage process in the froth phase. This paper briefly reviews two existing models of degree of entrainment. Experimental data were collected from an Outokumpu 3 m(3) tank cell in the Xstrata Mt. Isa Mines copper concentrator. The data are fitted to the models and the effect of cell operating conditions including air rate and froth height on the degree of entrainment is examined on a size-by-size basis. It is found that there is a strong correlation between the entrainment and the water recovery, which is close to lineal. for the fines. The degree of entrainment decreases with increase in particle size. Within the normal range of cell operating conditions, few particles coarser than 50 mu m are recovered by entrainment. In general, the degree of entrainment increases with increase in the ail rate and decreases with increase in the froth height. Air rate and froth height strongly interact with each other and affect the entrainment process mainly via changes in the froth retention time, the froth structure and froth properties. As a result, other mechanisms such as entrapment may become important in recovering the coarse entrained particles. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the subject of {{preparation}} of persons with mental disabilities for employment. The employment of this focus group is relatively low, so I it find very important to ask why the situation is not good and, {{to try to find}} a way to make it better. One of the factors of high level unemployment may be the disharmony of the vocational preparation which is carried on at schools for pupils with mental disabilities, and the needs and expectations of employers. That is the reason why I have chosen the subject for my bachelor thesis. The first chapter of the thesis is concerned with the term mental disablement ? its definition, <b>classification,</b> <b>characteristic</b> signs and possible combination with other types of disablement. The second chapter deals with employment possibilities of people with mental disablement. The third chapter is concerned with vocational preparation of pupils with mental disablement. At the beginning I occupy myself with the system of special education at primary schools and secondary schools. Accentuated attention is dedicated to secondary schools for pupils with mental disablement ? practical schools and vocational schools. The next part includes the analysis of particular educational documents (general educational programmes) with a view to competences. The fourth chapter is composed of the description of the employment market or employers' needs and expectations. The intention of the thesis is to compare the vocational preparation at practical schools and vocational schools with the needs of the employers of people with mental disablement. The information on vocational preparation was obtained from general educational programmes for domain of education at annual practical schools, biennial practical schools and domain category E of vocational schools. Resources of specialized literature which {{deals with the}} needs of employers are scarce. Therefore, information was acquired especially from final reports of implemented projects and research projects, internet articles and published materials of civic associations which occupy themselves with the employment of people with mental disablement. The thesis proved that the vocational preparation and the needs of employers are basically in harmony. Disharmony was founded out only in area of mathematical competences. In spite of this result employers mentioned a few needs which are included in researched competences, but former vocational schools' pupils do not master them. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that the Bachelor thesis has theoretic character and is based on assumed educational results, not on their real appearance, which can be different. Employers have the most requirements concerning labour competence area, competences towards study and social and interpersonal competences. Practical schools and secondary vocational schools should focus on this area. Other requirements stated in the Bachelor thesis cannot be influenced by education, as they arise directly from the disablement character. It is connected with the discovery of the low level of knowledge concerning the target group and its employment possibilities. According to the Bachelor thesis results, the education at practical schools and vocational schools does not reflect the needs of labour market properly as the employers lack former pupils with right qualifications. This Bachelor thesis could serve as a basis for further research focusing on the relation between the vocational training of pupils with mental disablement and the requirements and expectations of the employers...|$|E
40|$|Expanded {{graphite}} {{has been}} applied widely in thermal insulation, adsorption, vibration damping, gasketing, electromagnetic interference shielding etc. It is made by intercalation of natural flake graphite followed by thermal expansion. Intercalation is a process whereby an intercalant material is inserted between the graphene layers of a graphite crystal. Exfoliation, a huge unidirectional expansion of the starting intercalated flakes, occurs when the graphene layers are forced apart by the sudden decomposition and vaporization of the intercalated species by thermal shock. Along with production methodologies, such as the intercalation process and heat treatment, the raw material characteristics, especially particle size, strongly influence {{the properties of the}} final product. This report evaluates the influence of the particle size of the raw material on the intercalation and expansion processes and consequently the properties of the exfoliated graphite. Natural crystalline flake graphite with wide particle diameter distribution (between dp = 80 and 425 µm) was divided into four size-range portions by sieving. Graphite was intercalated via perchloric acid, glacial acetic acid and potassium dichromate oxidation and intercalation procedure. 5. 0 g of graphite, 7. 0 g of perchloric acid, 4. 0 g of glacial acetic acid and 2. 0 g of potassium dichromate were placed in glass reactor. The mixture was stirred with n = 200 min– 1 at temperature of 45 °C during 60 min. Then it was filtered and washed with distilled water until pH~ 6 and dried at 60 °C during 24 h. Expansion was accomplished by thermal shock at 1000 °C for 1 min. The prepared samples were characterized by means of exfoliation volume measurements, simultaneous differential thermal analysis and thermo-gravimetry (DTA/TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), BET measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction indicated a change of distance between the graphene layers due to oxidation and repulsion of positively charged layers. The increased width and reduced height of diffraction peaks were a consequence of small-sized ordered domains. The intercalation is partial, intercalated layers are divided by a considerable number of non-intercalated layers. FTIR spectra revealed that dominant intercalating species is perchloric acid. Thermo-gravimetric analysis revealed that deintercalation occurs in the temperature interval between 150 and 300 °C and that a mass loss in this temperature interval is dependent on particle diameter, i. e. the intercalation is more intensive for greater particles. The fact that deintercalation proceeds as a one-stage process indicates the existence of only one intercalating specie. Additional mass loss at higher temperatures is a consequence of graphite oxidation. The particles with a higher amount of interlcalant showed greater expansion volumes as well as specific surface area. The fraction with greatest particle diameter (315 – 425 µm) showed expansion specific volume of v= 86 cm 3 g– 1. Weaker expansion of smaller particles is a consequence of intercalant thermal degradation gaseous products loss at the layer edges, as well as of lesser amount of intercalants due to their removal during washing. Adsorption-desorption isotherms of expanded graphite could be classified as type III, according to BDDT/IUPAC <b>classification,</b> <b>characteristic</b> for macro porous materials. Small variations in adsorption and desorption pressure for the same amount of adsorbed gas indicate that the macro pores are open. Specific surface area was calculated using BET equation and for sample 315 – 425 yields s = 36 m 2 g– 1. SEM micrographs revealed typical worm-like microstructure generated by exfoliation of graphene sheets. The areas of intense exfoliation forming typical pores, as well as less exfoliated sheets canbe observed...|$|E

Prirodni grafit s vrlo širokom raspodjelom veličina čestica (između dp = 80 i 425 µm) prosijavanjem je podijeljen na četiri veličinske klase. Uzorci su podvrgnuti procesu oksidacije i interkaliranja s kalijevim dikromatom, perklornom kiselinom i ledenom octenom kiselinom. Ekspanzija je provedena termošokiranjem pri 1000 °C u trajanju od jedne minute. Pripravljeni uzorci karakterizirani su mjerenjem ekspandiranog obujma, termogravimetrijskom analizom (TGA), rendgenskom difrakcijskom analizom (XRD), Fourier-transformiranom infracrvenom spektroskopijom (FTIR), BET apsorpcijsko-desorpcijskim izotermama i pretražnom elektronskom mikroskopijom (SEM). Rendgenska difrakcija i Fourier transformirana infracrvena spektroskopija ukazale su na to da dolazi do interkalacije te da je dominantna interkalirajuća vrsta perklorna kiselina. Termogravimetrijskom analizom utvrđeno je da do deinterkalacije dolazi u temperaturnom intervalu od 150 - 300 °C te da je gubitak mase u ovom temperaturnom intervalu ovisan o veličini čestica, odnosno da je interkalacija intenzivnija što su čestice grafita veće. Utvrđeno je i da čestice s više interkalanta više i ekspandiraju te imaju veću specifičnu površinu. Uzorak s najvećim promjerom čestica (dp = 315 - 425 µm) imao je nakon ekspanzije specifični obujam od v= 86 cm 3 g- 1 i specifičnu površinu od s= 36 m 2 g- 1.
