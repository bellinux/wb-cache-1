50|$|<b>Chip</b> <b>budding</b> {{can be done}} in mid- to late summer, {{unlike most}} {{grafting}} which takes place in the early spring. The bud will usually not begin growing until the following spring, though you can determine if the grafting succeeded before that by seeing whether the bud swells or shrivels. The next spring, all other shots than that from the scion bud are removed, which will then become the source for the new top of the plant.|$|E

40|$|Sugarcane shows reduced crop stand under {{relatively}} suboptimal conditions, {{the main}} reason for this is sensitivity of bud tissue to temperature fluctuations and salinity at sowing time. The aim of these studies was to explore the physiological, developmental and molecular changes occurring in the immature sugarcane buds under heat, cold and salt stresses, and possible role of proline and glycinebetaine in mitigating the changes in a time course manner during sprouting of nodal buds. All the stresses reduced bud fresh and dry weight, led to the generation of H 2 O 2, reduced the tissue levels of K+ and Ca 2 +, but enhanced the synthesis of osmolytes in a time course manner. Heat stress mainly produced oxidative damage and acted as a dehydrative force, whereas cold stress caused oxidative stress and slowed down the physiological activities. Salinity was the most damaging of all the stresses. The main effects of salinity were the accumulation of Na+ and Cl-, reduced tissue contents of Ca 2 + and K+ and enhanced synthesis of H 2 O 2 in the developing sugarcane bud. As for histological changes, all the stresses delayed and reduced the formation of new bud leaves and their expansion, which was mainly because of reduction in the number and area of mesophyll cells and poor development of vascular bundles. The pretreatment of <b>bud</b> <b>chips</b> with proline and GB effectively reduced stress effects being more effective under heat stress followed by cold stress and the least under salinity stress. As revealed from the correlation studies, although pretreatment with proline and GB appeared to have no direct role in stress tolerance, main effects were the reduced generation of H 2 O 2, improvement in the K+ and Ca 2 + nutrition and further enhancement in the levels of free proline, GB and soluble sugars under heat and cold stress. Under salt stress, the pretreatment reduced Na+ and Cl-, in addition to the observed effects under heat and cold stresses. Histological changes revealed that the pretreatment with osmoprotectants increased the mesophyll cell area leading to expansion in the bud leaves and led the development of elaborated vascular tissues. Of the two, GB was more effective than proline for all stress treatments but for different measured variables. Detailed studies on the molecular and metabolic responses indicated the enhanced expression of Asn, dehydrins, LEA and GAPDH genes, stronger accumulation of proline and alanine followed by glycine, glutamic acid and 5 -oxo-proline. Among the sugars, sucrose followed by diethylene glycol, fructose, glucose and glycerol, and nucleic acids, adenosine and uracil, as well as organic acids, aconitate, chlorogenate, ribonate_put, quinate, pipecolate, erythronate, GABA, glucoronate, gluconate, glucarate, glucoranate and octadecanoate showed accumulation at all temperature treatments and time periods. HCA and LVL revealed that out of 108 metabolites, chlorogenate, putrescine, octadecanoate, fructose, proline, glycine, sucrose, quinate, trans-aconitate, guanine, GABA and ethanolamine showed greater accumulation under high temperature. In crux, albeit all stresses deterred the transition of bud from immature to mature state, the salinity was the most damaging. In most cases, improvement produced by proline was greater than GB. Heat stress revealed distinct patterns of gene expression and metabolites synthesis. The correlation data showed that pretreatment with the osmoprotectants improved bud growth under stress regimes; the roles are indirect in improved Ca 2 + and K+ nutrition and reduced production of H 2 O 2. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that in low to moderately hot, cool and saline areas sugarcane bud sprouting can be improved by pretreatment of <b>bud</b> <b>chips</b> with the 20 mM levels of proline and GB and requisite crop stand can be achieve...|$|R

Os porta-enxertos foram avaliados durante nove meses com relação às variáveis: comprimento da planta, diâmetro do caule, número de folhas e área foliar. Cada procedimento de enxertia foi avaliado por 30 dias através da percentagem de pegamento. Os porta-enxertos produzidos nos tubetes maiores apresentaram-se mais desenvolvidos para todas as variáveis, todavia a percentagem de pegamento dos enxertos foi mais influenciada pelo método de enxertia do que pelo tamanho de tubete. A garfagem de topo em fenda cheia mostrou-se como o melhor método para a enxertia precoce, pois já aos três meses de idade dos porta-enxertos apresentou taxa de pegamento de 96, 69 %. O método de garfagem lateral em fenda cheia apresentou taxas semelhantes a partir dos cinco meses de idade dos porta-enxertos. O método de borbulhia apresentou baixo pegamento inicial (The {{objective}} of this work was to establish a protocol for early grafting in sugar apple seedlings developed in small capacity plastic tubettes {{as a substitute for}} the traditional grafting system that uses 12 months-old seedlings developed in plastic bags. The work was carried out with three budding/grafting methods (<b>chip</b> <b>budding,</b> split graft and side-stub graft) and four rootstocks ages (3, 5, 7 and 9 months). The rootstocks were evaluated for 9 months with regard to the following variables: length of the plant, diameter of stem, leaf number and leaf area. Each budding/grafting procedure was evaluated after 30 days and the percentage of union. The rootstocks produced in bigger tubetes showed to be more developed for all variables during the evaluated period. The success of the union did not vary between the two types of containers. The split graft revealed to be the best method as it presented a 96, 69 % union success in the early 3 month-old rootstocks. The method side-stub graft presented similar percentage rates from 5 months-old rootstocks. The <b>chip</b> <b>budding</b> method initially presented a low success union rate (< 50 %), but it increased at each new budding date and reached 80 % union success in 7 months-old rootstocks...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum) as a small, water-conserving landscape tree {{for the western}} United States {{is limited by the}} selection of superior accessions from a morphologically diverse gene pool and the ability to propagate wild plants in a nursery environment. Superior accessions were selected based primarily on red fall color. Aerial digital images taken during peak fall color in 2007 and 2008 were synchronized with flight global positioning system (GPS) track files using digital image editor software and visually compared with corresponding satellite images to determine the exact latitude and longitude of selected trees on the ground. Trees were physically located using GPS technology then visually evaluated for initial selection. Criteria included fall color, habitat, relative disease and insect resistance, bud quality, and plant form. From 56 observed trees of interest, six were selected for propagation. Through time-course experiments using multistemmed, bigtooth maple seedling rootstocks in a coppiced stoolbed, the optimum time for <b>chip</b> <b>budding</b> scions of wild accessions in northern Utah was determined to be July through mid-August. Further evaluation of accessions for use in the landscape industry is required...|$|E

The biological material consisted of cherry varieties: Daria, Superb, Van and Maria -first self-fertil variety created in our country and the vegetative rootstocks IP-C 4 and IP- C 7. As methods of grafting were experienced the cleft grafting and chip budding". "Ceraltin® product was applied in two bindings, before and after grafting. They followed the process of callusing, vascular connection and welding at the point of grafting. The subsequent increases of the grafted scions were monitored from early May until late October, by determining the grafting percentage of attachment and growth potential, and morphological and physiological indices of the thickness in grafting zone. Data revealed that in the product "Ceraltin® "variant, the thickening ratio in the grafting area between the symbionts was closer by unit, the vascular connections were made quickly to <b>chip</b> <b>budding.</b> Instead, in the cleft grafting, the callusing and welding processes were developed slowly over a period of two years, and were dependent on the thickness of the rootstock at the point of grafting, at all studied variants...|$|E
40|$|The walnut is {{classified}} as a strategic species for human nutrition and {{is included in the}} FAO’s list of priority plants. Walnut, (Juglans regia L.) propagation is more difficult, compared to most fruit species. Due to walnut heterozygosity, propagation by seeds does not lead to inheritance of all the characteristics of certain varieties. That is the reason why propagation technologies are being improved worldwide. The purpose of this experiment was to increase the success of inoculation of the walnut budding var. Franquete. Methods such as the patch budding and <b>chip</b> <b>budding</b> have been employed during the experiment. To establish the most appropriate season of inoculation, June budding on 28 June (with buds taken in the current season), autumn budding on 28 August (with buds taken in the current season) and spring budding on 28 May (with buds collected from the winter dormant period), were tested. As rootstocks for the June and August budding, the seedlings of Juglans regia L. of the current year's growth have been employed. For the spring inoculation the one year old scions have been used. Patch budding resulted the most successful method for walnuts. However, the success of the method of patch budding depends on the season of inoculation. An 80 % of successful inoculation was achieved by June budding (on 28 June). Furthermore, cutting off the leaf 20 days before the buds being taken for budding, led to even higher results reaching 87 % of successful inoculation. According to {{the results of the present}} study, the June budding of the patch method seems to be the best solution for the production of grafted young walnut trees...|$|E
