5|$|The {{following}} year, 1983, LeMond won the World Championship outright, {{becoming the}} first American rider to do so. LeMond's cycling talent—his overall strength, <b>climbing</b> <b>ability,</b> ability to ride a fast time trial and his capacity to recover quickly—all suggested LeMond would be an excellent prospect for the most demanding Grand Tours.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by the gaming press. It was praised for many of its elements, including the implementation of Cole's powers and <b>climbing</b> <b>ability,</b> and the game's content and mission structure. Reviewers commented on the repetitive nature of combat and enemies, limitations of the Karma system, and technical aspects in the graphical display. Infamous was compared to and contrasted with Radical Entertainment's Prototype, a video game released the following month which had many elements similar to Infamous, including exploration of an open world-style city by a protagonist with superpowers. The game was offered by Sony as a free download {{as part of their}} 'Welcome Back' program, after the 2011 PlayStation Network outage. A sequel, Infamous 2, was released on June 7, 2011. A third game designed specifically for PlayStation 4, titled Infamous Second Son, was released worldwide on March 21, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. It was easy to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same <b>climbing</b> <b>ability</b> that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E

5|$|Dallas {{became one}} of the best-known pilots of Sopwith Triplanes in the RNAS. He opened 1917 by setting an {{altitude}} record of 26,000feet in the Triplane while testing a prototype oxygen set; he endured frostbite and oxygen intoxication in the process. By now No.1 Wing's fighter squadron had been renumbered as No.1 Squadron RNAS, and had totally re-equipped with production Triplanes. It also shifted airfields from Veurne in Belgium to Chipilly in France, leaving behind RNAS control by transferring to No.14 Wing, 4thBrigade of the RFC. Formation flying became the order of the day, as the practice of fighter pilots soloing into combat dwindled. The last three weeks of March were also filled with Dallas's responsibilities for flight and gunnery testing. As British losses in the air began to mount during Bloody April, Dallas and his squadron moved airfields once again, to La Bellevue. They were thus positioned to take a prominent part in the subsequent Battle of Arras, where the intense aerial fighting saw Dallas add to his burgeoning score. The combat of 23April became {{known as one of the}} classic air battles of the war. Dallas and his wingman Thomas Culling took on a squadron-sized formation of 14German aircraft, having gained an altitude edge over their foes. The naval aces exploited this edge by making quick diving attacks from opposite sides, culminating in short bursts of machine-gun fire. Using the Triplane's superior <b>climbing</b> <b>ability,</b> they would then bob back up to position themselves for the next assault. In contrast to the usual hit-and-run tactics of most dogfights, the RNAS duo launched at least 20gunnery runs over 45minutes. The Germans were forced progressively lower, into disarray, and then chased back over their own lines. While they shot down three of the Germans, Dallas and Culling also achieved a more important outcome by blocking and then breaking up a determined enemy effort against the British ground offensive. The action led to the award of a Bar to the Distinguished Service Cross for Dallas, and a Distinguished Service Cross for Culling, which were gazetted on 29June.|$|E
25|$|The revised {{engine was}} {{reported}} to give the Mark D notably better acceleration, better <b>climbing</b> <b>ability</b> and lower fuel consumption in direct comparison with its predecessor. Reverse via the Dynastart unit became an option from October 1956 on the Deluxe models.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used rating systems in the United States are the Yosemite Decimal System and the Hueco V-scale bouldering grade. The current ranges for climbing routes are 5.0 for easy beginner routes to 5.15 being world class and V0 - V16, respectively. As the limit of human <b>climbing</b> <b>ability</b> {{has not yet been}} reached, neither grading system has a definite endpoint and is thus subject to revision.|$|E

25|$|On 5 August {{the camps}} along the Wady Fara were counted and small cavalry {{movements}} over Ain es Sir were noted, chased down an Albatros scout and returning over the Wady Fara machine gunned {{a column of}} infantry and some camels; these camps were harassed a few days later. A formation of six new Pfalz scouts was first encountered over Jenin aerodrome on 14 August when it was found they were inferior to the Bristol aircraft in <b>climbing</b> <b>ability</b> and all six were forced after aerial combat to land. Rumpler aircraft were successfully attacked on 16 and 21 August and on 24 August a determined attack by eight German aircraft on two Bristol Fighters defending the British air screen between Tul Keram and Kalkilieh was defeated and four of the enemy aircraft were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|After a rest day, {{the riders}} {{took in the}} Tour's hardest stage, and the last chance for the climbers to make the time gains they’d need before the final time trial. The race was thought to split up {{somewhat}} on the brutal Port de Larrau (14.7km climb at 8.1%), {{despite the fact that}} its summit came just 79km into the stage. The race dipped into Spain for some 50 kilometres at the summit, the fourth country visited in this year's Tour. From there, there was little reprieve for the riders, hitting the Alto Laza and the Col de la Pierre St Martin (14.2km climb at 5.2%) before descending {{to the start of the}} difficult, and very steep, first-category Col de Marie-Blanque (9.3km climb at 7.4%). The riders then climbed the infamous Col d'Aubisque (16.7km climb at 7%), which rewarded out-and-out <b>climbing</b> <b>ability</b> and punish the legs of all the major contenders.|$|E

500|$|LeMond's first {{professional}} victory came three months into his 1981 debut {{when he won}} a stage of the French Tour de l'Oise. He followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of Sergei Sukhoruchenkov, the 1980 Olympic road champion. The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race where LeMond placed third. The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault. LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault, as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him. Two weeks later Simon was assessed a 10-minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping. LeMond considered the race {{to have been a}} [...] "major steppingstone" [...] in his career. Said LeMond: [...] "It showed me that I had the kind of <b>climbing</b> <b>ability</b> that you need to win the top European stage races." [...] LeMond won a total of five races in his rookie season of 1981.|$|E
500|$|The {{presentation}} of Empire City was also {{considered to be}} a significant factor {{of the success of the}} game. The climbing and grabbing aspect was considered well done and avoided a [...] "frustration-fest" [...] that other games with precision jumping generally bring about, according to Miller. However, some reviewers noted that Cole's <b>climbing</b> <b>ability</b> was too touchy, with the character grabbing onto ledges too greedily, making it difficult to fine-tune jumps. In combination with Cole's other powers, Miller cited the game as having the [...] "most original city-traversal mechanics" [...] for an open-world game. The behavior of the city's population and how that was affected by the player's choice in Karma was also seen as a positive, and as a constant reminder of the game's setting. The game's story, particularly in the second half of the game, was considered to be strong, enhanced by {{presentation of}} the cut-scenes. However, the quality of these scenes was seen to negatively highlight the poor animation used for in-game generated cut-scenes and the quality of the voice work; Miller considered Cole's voice to be too gravelly for the character.|$|E
