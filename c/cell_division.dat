5|$|In euryarchaea the <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> protein FtsZ, {{which forms}} a {{contracting}} {{ring around the}} cell, and {{the components of the}} septum that is constructed across the center of the cell, are similar to their bacterial equivalents. In cren- and thaumarchaea, however, the <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> machinery Cdv fulfills a similar role. This machinery is related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery which, while best known for its role in cell sorting, also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell, suggesting an ancestral role in <b>cell</b> <b>division.</b>|$|E
5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through <b>cell</b> <b>division.</b> In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during <b>cell</b> <b>division.</b> Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

40|$|Chromosome {{alignment}} in {{the middle}} of the bipolar spindle is a hallmark of metazoan <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> When we offset the metaphase plate position by creating an asymmetric centriole distribution on each pole, we find that metaphase plates relocate to the middle of the spindle before anaphase. The spindle assembly checkpoint enables this centering mechanism by providing cells enough time to correct metaphase plate position. The checkpoint responds to unstable kinetochore-microtubule attachments resulting from an imbalance in microtubule stability between the two half-spindles in cells with an asymmetric centriole distribution. Inactivation of the checkpoint prior to metaphase plate centering leads to asymmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> and daughter <b>cells</b> of unequal size; in contrast, if the checkpoint is inactivated after the metaphase plate has centered its position, symmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> ensue. This indicates that the equatorial position of the metaphase plate is essential for symmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{somatic cells}} and also {{cells of the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are capable of {{undergoing}} {{a limited number of}} divisions. Reaching the division limit is referred to, apparently not very fortunately, as replicative aging. A common feature of S. cerevisiae cells and fibroblasts approaching the limit of <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> in vitro is attaining giant volumes. In yeast cells this phenomenon is an inevitable consequence of budding so it is not causally related to aging. Therefore, reaching a critically large cell volume may underlie the limit of <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> A similar phenomenon may limit the number of <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> of cultured mammalian cells.

5|$|Unlike in {{multicellular}} organisms, {{increases in}} cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, {{a form of}} asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8minutes. In <b>cell</b> <b>division,</b> two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.|$|E

40|$|Mechanisms that {{regulate}} neuron {{production in the}} developing mouse neocortex were examined by using a retroviral lineage marking method to determine the sizes of the lineages remaining in the proliferating population of the ventricular zone {{during the period of}} neuron production. The distribution of clade sizes obtained experimentally in four different injection-survival paradigms (E 11 -E 13, E 11 -E 14, E 11 -E 15, and E 12 -E 15) from a total of over 500 labeled lineages was compared with that obtained from three models in which the average behavior of the proliferating population [i. e., the proportion of cells remaining in the proliferative population (P) vs. that exiting the proliferative population (Q) ] was quantitatively related to lineage size distribution. In model 1, different proportions of asymmetric, symmetric terminal, and symmetric nonterminal <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> coexisted during the entire developmental period. In model 2, the developmental period was divided into two epochs: During the first, asymmetric and symmetric nonterminal <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> occurred, but, during the second, asymmetric and symmetric terminal <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> occurred. In model 3, the shifts in P and Q are accounted for by changes in the proportions of the two types of symmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> without the inclusion of any asymmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> The results obtained from the retroviral experiments were well accounted for by model 1 but not by model 2 or 3. These findings demonstrate that: 1) asymmetric and both types of symmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> coexist during the entire period of neurogenesis in the mouse, 2) neuron production is regulated in the proliferative population by the independent decisions of the two daughter cells to reenter S phase, and 3) neurons are produced by both asymmetric and symmetric terminal <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> In addition, the findings mean that cell death and/or tangential movements of cells in the proliferative population occur at only a low rate and that there are no proliferating lineages "reserved" to make particular laminae or cell types.

40|$|In plants, the {{generation}} of new cell types and tissues depends on coordinated and oriented formative <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> The plasma membrane-localized receptor kinase ARABIDOPSIS CRINKLY 4 (ACR 4) {{is part of a}} mechanism controlling formative <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> in the Arabidopsis root. Despite its important role in plant development, very {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanism with which ACR 4 is affiliated and its network of interactions. Here, we used various complementary proteomic approaches to identify ACR 4 -interacting protein candidates that are likely regulators of formative <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> and that could pave the way to unraveling the molecular basis behind ACR 4 -mediated signaling. We identified PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2 A- 3 (PP 2 A- 3), a catalytic subunit of PP 2 A holoenzymes, as a previously unidentified regulator of formative <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> and as one of the first described substrates of ACR 4. Our in vitro data argue for the existence of a tight posttranslational regulation in the associated biochemical network through reciprocal regulation between ACR 4 and PP 2 A- 3 at the phosphorylation level...|$|R
5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly.

Case (c) corresponds to a consistently large correlation between number of stem <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> and cancer risk and provides an interesting testable hypothesis, namely that controllable environmental factors and/or genetic traits impact both the cancer risks related to stem <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> and those that seem unrelated to stem <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> This requires to study conditional correlations, thus extending the unconditional correlation study of Tomasetti and Vogelstein (since no condition on separate groups or cohorts is imposed in their study).|$|R

We show that orientation of <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> in the wing requires planar polarization of an atypical myosin, Dachs. Our evidence suggests that Dachs constricts cell–cell junctions to alter the geometry of cell shapes at the apical surface, and that cell shape then determines the orientation of the mitotic spindle. Using a computational model of a growing epithelium, we show that polarized cell tension is sufficient to orient <b>cell</b> shapes, <b>cell</b> <b>divisions,</b> and tissue growth. Planar polarization of Dachs is ultimately oriented by long-range gradients emanating from compartment boundaries, and is therefore a mechanism linking these gradients with the control of tissue shape...|$|R

5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of <b>cell</b> <b>division.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Other {{important}} mechanisms {{fall under}} the category of asymmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions,</b> divisions that give rise to daughter cells with distinct developmental fates. Asymmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> can occur because of asymmetrically expressed maternal cytoplasmic determinants or because of signaling. In the former mechanism, distinct daughter cells are created during cytokinesis because of an uneven distribution of regulatory molecules in the parent cell; the distinct cytoplasm that each daughter cell inherits results in a distinct pattern of differentiation for each daughter cell. A well-studied example of pattern formation by asymmetric divisions is body axis patterning in Drosophila. RNA molecules are an important type of intracellular differentiation control signal. The molecular and genetic basis of asymmetric <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> has also been studied in green algae of the genus Volvox, a model system for studying how unicellular organisms can evolve into multicellular organisms.
