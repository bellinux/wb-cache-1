5|$|The Human Resources and Research and Development {{buildings}} were originally constructed around 1912 by the MacKay Copper Process Company. The property was acquired in 1923 by the Thermos Company following the foreclosure of the MacKay company. The Human Resources building {{was used by}} the enameling department until its conversion in 1948. The Research and Development building was previously the Engineering building. A one-story hipped frame gatehouse was <b>constructed</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s. The Carpenter Shop (Building 62) was <b>constructed</b> <b>in</b> 1926. The Thermos factory completed construction of a storage building in 1929 (Building 2) and another storage building in 1941 (Building 1). Glass House 1 (Building 5) was <b>constructed</b> <b>in</b> 1939 and incorporates a warehouse dating from 1930 into its construction. Glass House 2 was <b>constructed</b> <b>in</b> 1951 and is connected to the Manufacturing Building by a conveyor.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental <b>Constructs</b> <b>in</b> Mathematics Education is {{a unique}} sourcebook crafted from classic texts, {{research}} papers and books in mathematics education. Linked together by the editors' narrative, the book provides a fascinating examination of, and insight into, key <b>constructs</b> <b>in</b> mathematics education and how they link together. The choice of constructs is based on (some of) the many constructs which have proved fruitful in research and which have informed choices made by teachers. The book {{is divided into two}} parts: learning and teaching. The first part includes views about how people learn - from Plato to Dewey, as well as constructivism, activity theory and French didactiques. The second part includes extracts concerned with initiating, sustaining, and bringing to a conclusion learners' work on mathematical tasks. Fundamental <b>Constructs</b> <b>in</b> Mathematics Education provides access {{to a wide range of}} <b>constructs</b> <b>in</b> mathematics education, and will orient the reader towards important original sources...|$|R
