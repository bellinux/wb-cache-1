To me there is a perpetual delight in his way of saying things, and I cannot wonder that younger men try to catch the trick of it. The disappointing thing for them is that it is not a trick, but an inherent virtue. His style is, upon the whole, better than that of any other novelist I know; it is always easy, without being trivial, and it is often stately, without being stiff; it gives a charm to everything he writes; and he has written so much and in such various directions, that we should be judging him very incompletely if we considered him only as a novelist. His book of European sketches must rank him with the most enlightened and agreeable travelers; and it might be fitly supplemented from his uncollected papers with a volume of American sketches. In his essays on modern French writers he indicates his <b>critical</b> <b>range</b> and grasp; but he scarcely does more, as his criticisms in [...] "The Atlantic" [...] and [...] "The Nation" [...] and elsewhere could abundantly testify.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Connectivity is {{a crucial}} issue in {{wireless}} ad hoc networks (WANETs). Gupta and Kumar have shown that in WANETs using omnidirectional antennas, the <b>critical</b> transmis-sion <b>range</b> to achieve asymptotic connectivity is if nodes are uniformly and independently distributed in a disk of unit area. In this paper, we investigate the connectivity problem when directional antennas are used. We first assume that each node in the network randomly beamforms in one beam direction. We find that there also exists a <b>critical</b> transmission <b>range</b> for a WANET to achieve asymptotic connectivity, which corresponds to a critical transmission power (CTP). Since CTP {{is dependent on the}} directional antenna pattern, the number of beams, and the propagation environment, we then formulate a non-linear programming problem to minimize the CTP. We show that when directional antennas use the optimal antenna pattern, the CTP in a WANET using directional antennas at both transmitter and receiver is smaller than that when either transmitter or receiver uses directional antenna and is further smaller than that when only omnidirectional antennas are used. Moreover, we revisit the connectivity problem assuming that two neighboring nodes using directional antennas can be guaranteed to beamform to each other to carry out the transmission. A smaller <b>critical</b> transmis-sion <b>range</b> than that in the previous case is found, which implies smaller CTP.

40|$|Abstract — In mobile ad hoc networks, it {{is often}} more {{important}} to optimize for energy efficiency than throughput. In this paper, we investigate the effect of transmit range on energy efficiency of packet transmissions. We determine a common range for all nodes such that the average energy expenditure per received packet is minimized. In {{the first part of}} this paper, we consider stationary networks. We show that energy efficiency depends on various system parameters that includes path loss exponent of the channel, energy dissipation model and network offered load. In particular, when the path loss exponent is large, energy efficiency decreases when the transmit range increases. Hence, the network should be operated at the <b>critical</b> <b>range</b> that just maintains network connectivity. However, when the path loss exponent is small, operating at the <b>critical</b> <b>range</b> yields inferior throughput and energy efficiency. Our results show that energy efficiency is intimately connected to network connectivity. Three network connectivity regimes are identified as the transmit range of all nodes increases. In the second part, we examine the effect of node mobility on energy efficiency. We show that at normal offered load, an optimal transmit range exists such that energy efficiency is maximized. The optimal range turns out to be insensitive to node mobility, and is much larger than the <b>critical</b> <b>range.</b> We show that the energy expenditure can be reduced by 15 % to 73 % in different mobility scenarios, if the network is operated at the optimal range.
