25|$|Hamilton's Coppley Apparel Group {{is doing}} {{something}} rare in the Canadian clothing industry - adding jobs. The company plans to expand its employment by almost 200 jobs - about 30 per cent - starting with 50 additional jobs this year in 2007.

The new jobs follow exploding sales growth as the company uses computer-aided <b>custom</b> <b>tailoring</b> of suits that give struggling retailers a much-needed cash-flow boost. Coppley, which has been a fixture in downtown Hamilton for more than 150 years, pioneered a method of using a computer, a grid and a digital camera to do the work of a master tailor, producing made-to-measure suits in as few as seven days - work that used to take six weeks.|$|E

50|$|Forerunners to the {{organization}} included the Tailors' Progressive Union of America (TPUA) in the mid-1800s, as well as assemblies organized by the Knights of Labor. Very important was the tension between <b>custom</b> <b>tailors</b> (specializing in work done to order, usually higher-grade) and shop tailors (ordinary sewing of clothes made ready to wear). Regardless, {{there was little to}} no significant and unified tailors' union or movement before the 1880s. By then, shop tailors had begun to build more sophisticated organizations, which were then joined by <b>custom</b> <b>tailors,</b> a move which was vocally supported by John Brown Lennon, the future general secretary of the Journeymen Tailors' Union. A critical concern was the scabbing of <b>custom</b> <b>tailors</b> on shop tailors and vice versa during strikes, which could only be prevented by a more unified form of organization.|$|R

50|$|After 1889, the TPUA had {{declined}} in importance and {{attempts were made}} by shop tailors to join the JTU, which were rebuffed. In response, some shop tailors and other ready-made clothing workers started the United Garment Workers of America (UGWA) in 1891 and the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) in 1900. All three organizations were recognized by the AFL, causing significant tensions over jurisdiction. These clashes resulted largely in victory for the UGWA and diminished importance for the JTU, with the UGWA gaining jurisdiction over all non-custom-made clothing manufacture, with the JTU being limited to <b>custom</b> <b>tailoring</b> establishments, despite the wishes of its then-secretary, John Brown Lennon. In 1897, the JTU also lost jurisdiction over special-order <b>custom</b> <b>tailoring</b> to the UGWA and Custom Clothing Makers' Union or Special Order Clothing Makers' Union, whose AFL charter was denied.|$|E

40|$|Most {{enterprises}} in Nairobi's garment industry begin small and stay that way. Owners of businesses selected for intensive study consider weak demand {{to be the}} major barrier to growth. Current theories of industrial organisation identify two clearly different production models: Mass production, rooted in the advantages of scale economies; and flexible specialisation, a paradigm focusing on flexibility and innovation. Analysis of market relations in Nairobi's garment industry reveals not two, but five different types of firms: <b>custom</b> <b>tailors,</b> contract workshops, specialised small producers, minimanufacturers, and mass producers. Preliminary research indicates that some types can cope with weak and fluctuating demand better than others. Contract workshops, specialised small producers, mass producers capable of tapping external markets, and high quality <b>custom</b> <b>tailors</b> have the greatest potential for success, while low-to-medium quality <b>custom</b> <b>tailors,</b> mini-manufacturers, and mass producers tied to the domestic market have the least, The analysis {{has important implications for}} the shape of Kenyan industry, employment creation, and entrepreneurship. It also suggests that interventions by government and/or NGOs need to be targeted, not at small and medium-size, firms in general, but at the most promising types of producers...|$|R

50|$|Mass {{personalization}} {{is defined}} as <b>custom</b> <b>tailoring</b> by a company in accordance with its end users tastes and preferences.

The main difference between mass customization and mass personalization is that customization is the ability for a company to give its customers an opportunity to create and choose product to certain specifications, but does have limits.|$|E
