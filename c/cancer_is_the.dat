5|$|Breast <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> secondest common {{cancer in}} the world and the commonest amongst women, as well as being amongst the ten commonest chronic {{diseases}} of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life (Gronowski and Schindler, Table IV). Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. In 2016, breast <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> commonest cancer diagnosed amongst women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases, and worldwide accounts for one and a half million cases and over half a million deaths, being the fifth commonest cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. Geographic variation in incidence is the opposite of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide variance in case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fourth commonest cancer amongst women, {{particularly those}} of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, cervical cancer accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, {{pancreatic}} cancers of {{all types}} resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. Pancreatic <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fifth {{most common cause of}} death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth most common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis: after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 5% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} tumor.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> leading cause of cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cancer {{of unknown}} primary (CUP) <b>is</b> a fatal <b>cancer,</b> {{accounting}} for 3 - 5 % of all diagnosed cancers. Finding <b>the</b> primary site <b>is</b> important for therapeutic choices {{and we believe}} that <b>the</b> organ which <b>is</b> designated as <b>the</b> cause of death may give clues about the primary site. Methods: A total of 20, 570 patients with CUP <b>were</b> identified from <b>the</b> Swedish Family-Cancer Database. Causes of death - as reported in the death certificate - were investigated, analyzing reported metastatic sites and histological subtypes separately. Survival was compared with metastatic cancer with a known primary tumor. Results: An organ-specific <b>cancer</b> could <b>be</b> identified as a cause of death in approximately 60 % of all CUP patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated histology. In adenocarcinoma, lung <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most frequent cause of death (20 %), followed by pancreatic cancer (14 %), and ovarian cancer (11 %). Lung <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most common cause of death in patients with CUP metastases diagnosed in the nervous system (69 %), respiratory system (53 %), and bone (47 %), whereas ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most common cause of death when CUP <b>was</b> diagnosed in <b>the</b> pelvis (47 %) or the peritoneum (32 %). In CUP diagnosed in the liver, liver and pancreatic cancers accounted for 26 % and 22 % of deaths, respectively. Also in squamous cell CUP, lung <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most common cause of death (45 %). Conclusions: According to the causes of death, the primary site appeared frequently to <b>be</b> either <b>the</b> organ where CUP metastases were diagnosed or an organ which may <b>be</b> traced through <b>the</b> known metastatic patterns of different cancer types...|$|R

40|$|Importance - <b>Cancer</b> <b>is</b> among <b>the</b> leading {{causes of}} death worldwide. Current {{estimates}} of cancer burden in individual countries and regions are necessary to inform local cancer control strategies. Objective - To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 28 cancers in 188 countries by sex from 1990 to 2013. Evidence Review - The general methodology of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study <b>was</b> used. <b>Cancer</b> registries <b>were</b> <b>the</b> source for <b>cancer</b> incidence data as well as mortality incidence (MI) ratios. Sources for cause of death data include vital registration system data, verbal autopsy studies, and other sources. <b>The</b> MI ratios <b>were</b> used to transform incidence data to mortality estimates and cause of death estimates to incidence estimates. <b>Cancer</b> prevalence <b>was</b> estimated using MI ratios as surrogates for survival data; YLDs were calculated by multiplying prevalence estimates with disability weights, which were derived from population-based surveys; YLLs were computed by multiplying the number of estimated cancer deaths at each age with a reference life expectancy; and DALYs <b>were</b> calculated as <b>the</b> sum of YLDs and YLLs. Findings - In 2013 there were 14. 9 million incident cancer cases, 8. 2 million deaths, and 196. 3 million DALYs. Prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> leading cause for cancer incidence (1. 4 million) for men and breast cancer for women (1. 8 million). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> leading cause for cancer death in men and women, with 1. 6 million deaths. For men, TBL <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> leading cause of DALYs (24. 9 million). For women, breast <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> leading cause of DALYs (13. 1 million). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) per 100   000 and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) per 100   000 for both sexes in 2013 were higher in developing vs developed countries for stomach cancer (ASIR, 17 vs 14; ASDR, 15 vs 11), liver cancer (ASIR, 15 vs 7; ASDR, 16 vs 7), esophageal cancer (ASIR, 9 vs 4; ASDR, 9 vs 4), cervical cancer (ASIR, 8 vs 5; ASDR, 4 vs 2), lip and oral cavity cancer (ASIR, 7 vs 6; ASDR, 2 vs 2), and nasopharyngeal cancer (ASIR, 1. 5 vs 0. 4; ASDR, 1. 2 vs 0. 3).

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Information on <b>cancer</b> {{prevalence}} <b>is</b> either absent or largely {{unavailable for}} central European countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland cover {{a population of}} 13 million inhabitants. Cancer registries in these countries supplied incidence and survival data for 465 000 cases of cancer. The prevalence of stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate cancer, as well as skin melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined <b>was</b> estimated for <b>the</b> end of 1992. RESULTS: A large heterogeneity was observed within central European countries. For all cancers combined, estimates ranged from 730 per 100 000 in Poland (men) to 3350 per 100 000 in Germany (women). Overall <b>cancer</b> prevalence <b>was</b> <b>the</b> highest in Germany and Switzerland, and the lowest in Poland and Slovenia. In Slovakia, prevalence was higher than average for men and lower than average for women. This was observed for almost all ages. As shown by incidence data, breast <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most frequent malignancy among women in all countries. Among men, prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> leading malignancy in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and lung <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> major <b>cancer</b> in Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland. The Netherlands had a high prevalence of both prostate and lung cancer. Time-related magnitude of prevalence within each country and the variability of such proportions across <b>the</b> countries has <b>been</b> estimated and <b>cancer</b> prevalence <b>is</b> given by time since diagnosis (1 year, 1 - 5 years, 5 - 10 years, > 10 years) for each site. The weight of 1 -year prevalence (248 per 100 000 among men and 253 per 100 000 among women) was 10 years before), reflecting long-term survival, and number of people considered as cured from <b>cancer</b> <b>were</b> 490 per 100 000 for men and 1028 per 100 000 for women, with a range between 26...|$|R
25|$|Basal-cell {{skin cancer}} (BCC) usually {{presents}} as a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed {{skin of the}} head, neck or shoulders.

25|$|The {{number of}} new cases of head and neck cancers in the United States was 40,490 in 2006, {{accounting}} for about 3% of adult malignancies. 11,170 people died of their disease in 2006. The worldwide incidence exceeds half a million cases annually. In North America and Europe, the tumors usually arise from the oral cavity, oropharynx, or larynx, whereas nasopharyngeal cancer {{is more common in}} the Mediterranean countries and in the Far East. In Southeast China and Taiwan, head and neck cancer, specifically nasopharyngeal <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most common cause of death in young men.|$|E
25|$|Outcomes {{for breast}} cancer vary {{depending}} on the cancer type, extent of disease, and person's age.
