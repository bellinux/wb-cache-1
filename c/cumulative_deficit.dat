25|$|Successive {{years of}} drought from 1998–2002 had {{dramatically}} lowered water levels {{in all of}} the main reservoirs. 1998–1999 was the worst drought year in Israel for the past 100 years.

The winters of 2002–03 and 2003–04 were characterized by average and higher than average rainfall which led to a significant rise in the water level of the Sea of Galilee and in the collection of floodwater in catchment reservoirs. However, the country's aquifers have remained depleted.

While modern scientific climate and rainfall studies {{have been able to}} identify trends and even specific periods of drought in the region, oral and written records over the last millennium do not record famine in all places at all times of drought. One 1997 study, in attempting to map long scale rainfall records to historical accounts of famine in Northern Nigeria, concluded that “the most disruptive historical famines occurred when the <b>cumulative</b> <b>deficit</b> of rainfall fell below 1.3 times the standard deviation of long-term mean annual rainfall for a particular place.” The 1982 to 1984 period, for instance, was particularly destructive to the pastoral Fula people of Senegal, Mali and Niger, and the Tuareg of northern Mali and Niger. The populations had not only suffered in the 1968 to 1974 period, but the inability of many to rebuild herds destroyed a decade earlier, along with factors as various as the shift of political power to settled populations with independence in the 1960s, Senegalese-Mauritanian border relations, and Niger's dependence upon falling world uranium prices coinciding in a destructive famine.|$|E

Two major frailty models have been described in the literature. The frailty phenotype defines frailty as a distinct clinical syndrome meeting three or more of five phenotypic criteria: weakness, slowness, low level of physical activity, self-reported exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss. The frailty index defines frailty as <b>cumulative</b> <b>deficits</b> identified in a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Significant progress has recently been made in understanding the pathogenesis of frailty.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Studies {{exploring}} {{chronic alcoholism}} with event-related potentials (ERPs) have shown delayed latency and reduced amplitude of the P 300, a long-lasting positive potential reflecting decisional processing. This P 300 deficit in alcoholism is generally {{interpreted as a}} disturbance in central nervous system inhibition or in memory/attention. The present study aimed at identifying if this electrophysiological deficit is already present on earlier components, and advances a new hypothesis concerning {{the interpretation of the}} P 300 alteration. METHODS: Patients suffering from alcoholism and matched healthy controls had to detect, in an oddball paradigm, emotional faces among a succession of neutral faces. Behavioral performance and ERP data (recorded from 32 electrodes) were analyzed. RESULTS: In line with previous studies, data showed that alcoholism led to a P 300 deficit. Moreover, we observed {{for the first time that}} this deficit begins at earlier visual (P 100) and face-processing (N 170) stages, and we found high positive correlations between P 100, N 170 and P 300 for amplitude and latency values, suggesting <b>cumulative</b> <b>deficits</b> on the cognitive continuum. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the P 300 deficit observed in chronic alcoholism could be linked to earlier visuo-spatial deficits rather than being an impairment of the specific processes linked to the P 300. SIGNIFICANCE: These results call for reconsidering the interpretation of P 300 impairments at a fundamental and clinical level, and shows that earlier ERP components must be taken into account in future studies.

All children were aged 7 – 13 years at time of initial assessment, with no pre-diagnosis history of neurologic, developmental, or psychiatric disorder. Intellectual and educational abilities were evaluated twice: T 1, not less than 2 years post-treatment, and T 2, 3 years later.

Young adult (5 months) and aged (2 years) rats were examined after 8 weeks of streptozotocin-diabetes. Learning was tested in a Morris water maze. Synaptic plasticity was tested ex vivo, in hippocampal slices, in response to trains of stimuli of different frequency (0. 05 to 100 Hz). ¶Results. Statiscally significant learning impairments were observed in young adult diabetic rats compared with controls. These impairments were even greater in aged diabetic animals. In hippocampal slices from young adult diabetic animals long-term potentiation induced by 100 Hz stimulation was impaired compared with controls (138 vs 218 % of baseline). In contrast, long-term depression induced by 1 Hz stimulation was enhanced in slices from diabetic rats compared with controls (79 vs 92 %). In non-diabetic aged rats synaptic responses were 149 and 93 % of baseline in response to 100 and 1 Hz stimulation, compared with 106 and 75 % in aged diabetic rats. ¶Conclusion/interpretation. Both diabetes and ageing affect learning and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>deficits</b> in learning and synaptic plasticity in aged diabetic rats indicate that the effects of diabetes and ageing on the brain could interact. ...|$|R

METHODS: Caloric and protein intake and nutritional parameters were compared in 82 children in 2000 and 2003, respectively before and after the introduction of a NST. Predictive factors of a delay to achieve the SOCI were identified using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There was no difference in 2000 and 2003, respectively, regarding <b>cumulative</b> caloric <b>deficits</b> (19 +/- 15. 7 vs. 20. 7 +/- 14. 8 kcal/kg day), <b>cumulative</b> protein <b>deficits</b> (0. 26 +/- 0. 31 vs. 0. 22 +/- 0. 20 g/kg day), time to achieve a SOCI (7 vs. 7 days). Factors at admission associated with a delay to achieve a SOCI were a pediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score > 10 (hazard ratio 0. 58; 95 % CI 0. 44 - 0. 77), a CRP > 50 mg/L (hazard ratio 0. 49; 95 % CI 0. 35 - 0. 70), a fluid restriction (hazard ratio 0. 51; 95 % CI 0. 37 - 0. 71), and a weight for age > 3 rd centile (hazard ratio 0. 54; 95 % CI 0. 41 - 0. 72). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention of a NST has not modified significantly the nutritional management. In pediatric intensive care, many factors identified at admission are associated with impairing appropriate nutrition...|$|R
