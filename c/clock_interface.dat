40|$|Self-timed systems {{often have}} to {{communicate}} with their environment through a <b>clocked</b> <b>interface.</b> For example, off-chip memory may require clocking and this can reduce the benefits of self-timed design. This paper presents {{the design of a}} delay line which may be used to control the timing of an off-chip interface. Timing accuracy is maintained by periodically recalibrating against a low frequency reference clock. The design uses two delay lines so that one can be recalibrated while the other is in use. Recalibration is undertaken once each second; power consumption is low as the calibration circuitry is dormant most of the time. A particular implementation of the design is presented which is suitable for a standard cell or FPGA technology, together with experimental performance figures. The paper concludes with some remarks about possible applications in low-power synchronous design. 1...|$|R
40|$|Although {{seemingly}} {{simple and}} easy to design for, the moment of waking up and deciding on how long to snooze poses interesting design challenges.

This enables accurate high-level modeling of the behavior of the network fabric so that optimized network design, including placement and routing, can occur through high-level network synthesis tools. The chip also shows that when elastic interfaces are used at the boundary of clock synchronization points then efficient domain crossings can occur.
