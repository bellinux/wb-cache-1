40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we are {{interested}} in the algorithmic complexity of computing (dis) similarity measures between two genomes when they contain duplicated genes. In that case, there are usually two main ways to compute a given (dis) similarity measure M between two genomes G 1 and G 2 : the rst model, that we will call the matching model, consists in making a one-to-one correspondence between genes of G 1 and genes of G 2, {{in such a way that}} M is optimized. The second model, called the exemplar model, consists in keeping in G 1 (resp. G 2) exactly one copy of each gene, thus deleting all the other copies, in such a way that M is optimized. We present here dierent results concerning the algorithmic complexity of computing three dierent similarity measures (number of <b>common</b> intervals, <b>MAD</b> number and SAD number) in those two models, basically showing that the problem becomes NP-complete for each of them as soon as genomes contain duplicates. We show indeed that for <b>common</b> intervals, <b>MAD</b> and SAD, the problem is NP-complete when genes are duplicated in genomes, in both the exemplar and matching models. In the case of MAD and SAD, we actually prove that, under both models, both MAD and SAD problems are APX-har...|$|R

Chapter 1 provides a general introduction into the background of historical dyeing, the methods used to extract these natural dye compounds used and how synthetic dyes overtook natural dyes in the commercial world of dyeing. Chapter 2 introduces and discusses the research undertaken with one particular natural dyeing plant, Rubia tinctorum (<b>common</b> <b>madder).</b> Dyeing studies were all performed on wool, and explore the dyeing properties of the madder plant.

We examined the genetic interactions with four {{spindle assembly}} checkpoint genes to identify nonessential genes involved in chromosome segregation, {{to identify the}} individual roles of the spindle assembly checkpoint genes within the checkpoint, and to reveal potential complexity that may exist. We used synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis using spindle assembly checkpoint mutants mad 1, mad 2, mad 3, and bub 3. We found 228 synthetic interactions with the four spindle assembly checkpoint mutants with substantial overlap in the spectrum of interactions between mad 1, mad 2, and bub 3.

40|$|One unique {{feature of}} the {{prototype}} JC virus (JCV) (Mad 1) genome is the occurrence of a second TATA sequence within the early promoter region. A naturally occurring oncogenic variant of JCV (Mad 4) lacks this second TATA box. Several cell lines transformed by Mad 1, Mad 4 and simian virus 40 were characterized, in part to investigate whether the second TATA sequence is functional. S 1 nuclease mapping of early JCV gene transcription products revealed a major set of start sites <b>common</b> to both <b>Mad</b> 1 and Mad 4 mRNAs. In addition, asecond set of early transcripts was found exclusively in Mad 1 transformants, presumably positioned by the second TATA box.

40|$|Abstract: Seed {{dormancy}} is {{a mechanism}} that insures {{the survival of}} the species. Madder (Rubia tinctorum L.) seeds present low germination due to the high degree of seed dormancy. Different methods to overcome seed dormancy were compared: mechanical scarification (sanding), chemical scarification (dilution in concentrated sulfuric acid for 10, 15 or 20 minutes, dilution in hot water at 70 °C and 90 °C for 5 and 10 minutes, soaking of seed in gibberelic acid (0. 05 % GA), light (24 hour), pre chilling at 4 °C for 4, 6 or 3 10 week and germination test (control). According to results mechanical scarification (sanding), chemical scarification (treatment with acid for 15 minutes) and hot water were efficient in promoting germination. For practical purposes, mechanical scarification is highly recommended. Key words: <b>Common</b> <b>madder</b> rubia tinctorum L.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>madder</b> (Rubia tinctorum L.) {{produces}} anthraquinone pigments in its roots, one of {{them being}} alizarin (1, 2 dihydroxy anthraquinone) which {{has been used for}} dyeing textiles since 2000 B. C. Four madder genotypes were evaluated for their agronomic characteristics as well as for their industrial value in order to test this species domestication potential for the Mediterranean area and to assess its value as a new industrial dye crop. Pigments were separated from methanolic and ethereal extracts and quantified by HPLC. Good agronomic performance was observed in the different accessions of R. tinctorum which were tested. Root yield increased from young (5 months old) to mature plants (30 months old) reaching a mean value of 120 g plant- 1, which corresponds to a yield of 8 t ha- 1. Variation in yield capacity was observed among the different accessions. Young roots showed a higher alizarin content than 15 and 30 month old plants. However, the total amount of alizarin present in a plant increased from 181. 8 mg plant- 1 to 917. 8 mg plant- 1 in 5 to 30 month old plants. A range of variation in alizarin content was established for genetic differences within madder. Industrial assays demonstrated good performance when using a weight of dry powder which is 30 % of the weight of material to be dyed for dyeing cotton, wool and silk yarns.

40|$|Summary. Acne vulgaris, {{a common}} skin {{disorder}} speculated {{in the age}} group of 15 - 25 years begins with increased production of sebum followed by the attack of Propionibacterium acne (Kathryn et al). Most of the synthetic anti-acne drugs tend to exhibit mild to severe side effects along with peeling and darkening of skin, ultimately leading to social withdrawal. Hence, there arises a need to develop a safe and effective anti-acne formulation that would cure and also prevent recurrence of acne. Considering the fact that roots of R. cordifolia (Rubiaceae) are rich in anthraquinones characterized for their anti-inflammatory as well as wound healing property, (Singh, 2004) a gel formulation of anthraquinone rich fraction was developed and evaluated for its anti-acne potential using Cup plate diffusion method. A gel formulation containing 0. 1 % of anthraquinone rich fraction exhibited optimum anti-acne activity against P. acne, S. epidermidis, M. furfur (zone of inhibition- 28. 9, 20. 4, 24. 6 mm respectively) when compared with standard i. e. Clindamycin gel (zone of inhibition- 36. 7, 35. 3, 32. 7 mm respectively). Thus anthraquinone rich fraction in a gel formulation is proved to have a better potential in treating acne. Industrial relevance. Rubia cordifolia, often known as <b>Common</b> <b>Madder,</b> Indian Madder or Manjistha is highly recommended in skin diseases associated with edema and oozing (Yuangang Zu et al, 2010). The root powder was found to work well with ghee, for the medicament of acne. Used externally as a paste by itself or with honey, it heals inflammation and gives the skin an even tone and smoothness. Since the roots are claimed to be rich in anthraquinones, in this research work anthraquinone rich fraction from the roots R. cordifolia were extracted and formulated into an herbal gel and evaluated for its anti-acne activity. Topical gels are very useful as palliative products and prove to be economical and safe; hence it was decided to formulate a simple yet effective anti-acne gel of anthraquinone rich fraction of R. cordifolia with a carbomer as a best gelling agent. </p...|$|E
