40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to address the impact of product design changes on supply chain risk, and to {{identify}} the supply chain risk dimensions in the Chinese special-purpose vehicle (SPV) industry in the context of product design change. Design/methodology/approach: Case study methodology is adopted to describe the current situation of supply chain risk management in the Chinese SPV industry. Data are mainly collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews, and a <b>cause-effect</b> <b>diagram</b> is used to identify and summarize the internal and external risk dimensions of supply chain risk. Findings: This paper identifies both the internal and external supply chain risk from the perspective of the focal manufacturer in the SPV supply chain. At the level of the external supply chain, customer-required design change normally leads to risk in supply, delivery, and policy. Internally for the manufacturer, the risk dimensions are R&D, production, planning, information, and organization. All of these risk dimensions have their respective causes. Research limitations/implications: The risk identification of product design change in this paper is only meant to lay a foundation; further case studies should focus on the best practices and approaches of risk management and extend them to other industries. Practical implications: The current identification of the risk dimensions and their respective causes will help both practitioners and researchers to better understand supply chain risk in the context of product design change. The identified risk dimensions and <b>cause-effect</b> <b>diagram</b> provide practitioners with a risk framework and useful tools to recognize and identify their potential supply chain risks.

Because of the lack of analog systems and circumstances in historically studied sites, there is a likelihood of type III error. As a first step, the authors propose a decision key to aid managers and risk assessors in determining when and to what extent climate change should be incorporated. Next, when global climate change is an important factor, the authors recommend seven critical changes to ERA. First, develop conceptual <b>cause–effect</b> <b>diagrams</b> that consider relevant management decisions as well as appropriate spatial and temporal scales to include both direct and indirect effects of climate change and the stressor of management interest. Second, develop assessment end points that are expressed as ecosystem services. Third, evaluate multiple stressors and nonlinear responses—include the chemicals and the stressors related to climate change. Fourth, estimate how climate change will affect or modify management options as the impacts become manifest. Fifth, consider the direction and rate of change relative to management objectives, recognizing that both positive and negative outcomes can occur. Sixth, determine the major drivers of uncertainty, estimating and bounding stochastic uncertainty spatially, temporally, and progressively.

Relatively few studies have investigated the toxicological and environmental effects of exposure to naturally occurring NPs (NNPs) and man-made or engineered NPs (ENPs) that are known to have a wide variety of effects once taken up into an organism. A review of recent knowledge (between 2000 - 2010) on NP sources, and their behaviour, exposure and effects on the environment and humans was performed. An integrated approach was used to comprise available scientific information within an interdisciplinary logical framework, to identify knowledge gaps and to describe environment and health linkages for NNPs and ENPs. The causal diagram has been developed as a method to handle the complexity of issues on NP safety, from their exposure to the effects on the environment and health. It gives an overview of available scientific information starting with common sources of NPs and their interactions with various environmental processes that may pose threats to both human health and the environment. Effects of NNPs on dust cloud formation and decrease in sunlight intensity were found to be important environmental changes with direct and indirect implication in various human health problems. NNPs and ENPs exposure and their accumulation in biological matrices such as microbiota, plants and humans may result in various adverse effects. The impact of some NPs on human health by ROS generation was found {{to be one of the}} major causes to develop various diseases.

Aim of the current study is to study the production line of an aluminum alloy wheel manufacturing industry and to improve the quality of production using quality control tools. This study shows the systematic approach to find the root cause of a major defects in aluminium castings using defect diagnostic approach as well as cause and effect diagram. Casting defect analysis is carried out using techniques like historical data analysis, <b>cause-effect</b> <b>diagrams,</b> design of experiments and root cause analysis. Data from X-ray inspection (Radiographic Inspection) have been collected along with the production parameter data. Using check sheets data has been collected and all the defects have been studied. Using Pareto chart major defects in the aluminium castings were noted. The major defects for the rejections during production were identified as shrinkages, inclusions, porosity/gas holes and cracks. Each defect is studied thoroughly and the possible causes for the defects are shown in Fishbone Diagrams (Cause Effect Diagrams). As the shrinkages mainly occur due to lack of feedability during the fluid flow the stalk changing frequency is noted along with the shrinkages defects and a relation is drawn between them. As hydrogen forms gas holes and porosity in the aluminium castings the amount of hydrogen present in the molten metal is studied by finding specific gravity of the samples collected.

The paper starts out by presenting the objectives and components of the programme and the methods employed in the studies carried out thus far. After that, the main features and challenges of the forest governance process are presented. Moreover, it shows {{that in spite of}} the intention to promote co-management with participation of forest fringe communities, the prevailing mode of governance is still hierarchical, characterised by vertical relationships between the state and non-state actors in forest governance. Against this governance context, the authors perform a detailed analysis of the actors involved in forest governance and livelihoods, distinguishing between statutory, customary, market, civil society and hybrid governing structures. Actors use forest and tree resources for their livelihoods in various ways. A more detailed examination is carried out of the contribution of two major forest-related activities to rural livelihoods, namely non-timber forest product extraction and farming under the Modified Taungya System. The last part of the paper outlines different kinds of forest and tree-related conflicts that inevitably arise due to the multiple governing structures and wide variety of actors and their conflicting interests. The authors present three ‘fishbone’ or <b>cause-effect</b> <b>diagrams,</b> which clarify the kind and causes of such conflicts occurring, respectively, in (1) forest reserves, (2) off-reserve areas and (3) both forest and off-reserve areas.

In addition to increased number of detected causes, CED is visually more attractive and preferred by retrospective participants, even though it is somewhat harder to read and requires specific software tools...|$|E

In this study, ten influencing factors has been identiﬁed through an extensive literature review and expert opinion. A structural model and <b>cause–effect</b> relationship <b>diagram</b> was developed using decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method for the identification of CFs. The present study adopt a comprehensive and rigorous procedure to identify six CFs namely, top management support, Government support, feedback mechanism to facilitate learning from prior experiences, transparent and accountable supply chain, strategic planning, and mutual learning with other commercial organizations (COs). The developed framework provides a simple, effective and efficient way to enhance the utilization of IT in HSC and in large to improve the competencies and performance of HSC...|$|R
40|$|Construction labor {{productivity}} {{plays an}} important role in labor intensive projects. Therefore, increasing construction labor productivity is a vital task to decrease a project’s cost (time). The primary goal of this research is to investigate the feasibility of developing a comprehensive causal model that can predict construction labor productivity for various project’s situations, such as existence of “Adverse Weather,” “Changes,” “Working Overtime,” etc., while considering uncertainty. It is found that Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) is the best approach that can model causal relationships among different factors while considering uncertainty, simultaneously. ^ Developing a BBNs model requires to extract its structure and, for each node in the network, set up a “Conditional Probability Table. ” Extensive review of other scholars’ publications, regarding factors affecting construction labor productivity, allow us to extract <b>cause-effect</b> <b>diagrams</b> for each factor. These cause-effect networks are independent sub models that by applying various structures and parameters methodologies become a separate BBN. The final step of building the comprehensive model is to combine different sub models, which after 12 iterations and combining different sub models, the primary contribution of this research to the body of knowledge, which is developing the comprehensive model, is obtained. ^ The model can do a variety of queries about the effects of a single variable, or a subset of variables, on a hypothesis variable. The findings from these queries is another contribution of this research. In this research, the hypothesis variable is the probability of “High productivity. ” Various sensitivity analyses on the hypothesis variable reveals that for different network’s instantiations, the effects of similar variables are not the same. Also, it shows that the “Adverse Management Systems” can decline the probability of “High productivity,” whenever a project is in its perfect conditions, more than 70 %. However, when a project is in its worst conditions, it can increase the probability of “High productivity” for less than 10 %. From the main variables, “Stacking of Trades” has similar effects on the hypothesis variable with less severity. This research has wonderful applicability for project managers, cost estimators, and schedulers in their decision making process regarding costs and time of projects. ...|$|R

ABSTRACT The present work {{was developed in}} the deboning area of a meat products company, located in the city of Barquisimeto, Lara state, Venezuela, with the objective of evaluating the ergonomics of its workstations, due to musculoskeletal illnesses reported in some workers. In this sense, the data collection and analysis techniques used were: Direct observation, interviews, process flow chart, checklist and <b>cause-effect</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The level of dysergonomic risk was assessed using the Rapid Entire Body Assessment method (REBA), determining that the major causes of the mentioned pathologies were repetitive movements, manual work adopting forced postures, lack of rest periods, inadequate height of the work stations, and no mechanicals equipments for specific tasks, all this resulting in a high risk level for the employees. Consequently, in order to reduce these risks, a set of measures were recommended for its immediated application. Among these measures were: the installations of anti-fatigue carpets, implementation of resting periods, rotating schedules, redesign of workstations according to the anthropometric measures of the workers, training of personnel and installation of mechanical equipment to perform certain tasks.
