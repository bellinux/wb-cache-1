Their failure rate is also high in hostile scenario due to many reasons like breakdown of electronic circuitry or complete battery power exhaustion of devices or software counter fault in nodes or physical damage of actor nodes, etc. The most serious side effect may occur in the network when connected network converts into multiple sub-networks due to permanent failure of <b>cut-vertex</b> backbone actor nodes in the network.

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in the applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A set of sensor nodes is deployed in order to collectively survey an area of interest and/or perform specific surveillance tasks in some of the applications, such as battlefield reconnaissance. Due to the harsh deployment environments and limited energy supply, nodes may fail, which impacts the connectivity of the whole network. Since a single node failure (<b>cut-vertex)</b> will destroy the connectivity and divide the network into disjoint blocks, most of the existing studies focus on the problem of single node failure. However, the failure of multiple nodes would be a disaster to the whole network and must be repaired effectively. Only few studies are proposed to handle the problem of multiple <b>cut-vertex</b> failures, which is a special case of multiple node failures. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive solution to address the problems of node failure (single and multiple). Collaborative Single Node Failure Restoration algorithm (CSFR) is presented {{to solve the problem of}} single node failure only with cooperative communication, but CSFR-M, which is the extension of CSFR, handles the single node failure problem more effectively with node motion. Moreover, Collaborative Connectivity Restoration Algorithm (CCRA) is proposed on the basis of cooperative communication and node maneuverability to restore network connectivity after multiple nodes fail. CSFR-M and CCRA are reactive methods that initiate the connectivity restoration after detecting the node failure(s). In order to further minimize the energy dissipation, CCRA opts to simplify the recovery process by gridding. Moreover, the distance that an individual node needs to travel during recovery is reduced by choosing the nearest suitable candidates.

This is extremely desirable in dynamic networks. However, these algorithms may classify some nodes as critical while they are not indeed critical in a network-wide view. With limited information, this is unavoidable because {{it is almost impossible}} for a node to know the alternate paths across the network. However, the accuracy of determining non-critical nodes is 100 %. Considering the potential advantages of localized algorithms and the fact that RECRA prefers to engage non-critical nodes in recovery, such a category of approaches fits well and the reduced accuracy is not a major concern. Therefore, RECRA employs a localized <b>cut-vertex</b> detection procedure of[25] that only requires 1 -hop position information and executes on each node in a distributed manner.|$|E

30|$|Unfortunately, due to harsh {{deployed}} {{environments and}} limited battery power, actors may deplete energy fast. A sudden {{loss of a}} node may break network connectivity resulting in disjoint network components. Therefore, {{it is important to}} detect node failures and restore network connectivity as early as possible. Since WSANs are usually deployed far away from the control center and are operated autonomously and unattended, it is difficult and inefficient to control the restoring process in a centralized manner. Connectivity restoration therefore should be a distributed, localized, and self-healing process. In addition, a rapid connectivity restoration is desired {{in order to reduce the}} baneful influence of node failures. Moreover, the overhead such as the total travel distance and the total number of messages should be minimized considering the limited energy supply. The average travel distance should be considered as well because one node traveling too far will consume too much energy and may cause another network disconnection. A node failure disrupting network connectivity is called a cut vertex, which is difficult to identify in large-scale WSANs centralized and timely. Though there have been many distributed <b>cut-vertex</b> detection algorithms, they are time-consuming and resource-intensive. As a result, it is very challenging to restore network connectivity in a distributed, localized, and efficient manner.|$|E
