40|$|I {{examine the}} passage of {{alternative}} teacher <b>certification</b> <b>policies</b> in the states between 1975 and 2000 using event history analysis and supplementing the event history analysis with an ordinary least squares regression analysis {{of the strength of}} the alternative teacher <b>certification</b> <b>policies.</b> In order to test both teachers unions political strength external to state legislatures and teachers unions political strength internal to state legislatures, I use two variables to measure teachers union political strength. One variable measures the percentage of teachers in a state who work under union-negotiated contracts. The other variable measures the percentage of legislators in a state who list their non-legislative occupation as K- 12 education. Control variables include teacher shortages, per pupil spending, legislative professionalism, divided government, democratic governor, percentage of minority students, change in percentage of minority students, an electoral threat index, and a time counter. Although the event history model results were inconclusive with respect to the teachers union political strength variables, the policy strength model results reveal that states with large percentages of teachers who work under union-negotiated contracts are more likely than other states to pass weak alternative teacher <b>certification</b> <b>policies.</b> This result supports the notion that teachers unions operate in the education policy-making arena...|$|R

The research find that formulation process of <b>certification</b> <b>policy</b> utilize legal rational model with prominent value preference is teachers welfare increasing. The problems and controversies happened because the initial policy target is teacher candidates, not on-the-job teachers; indolence of policy formulation process; political-will to allocate certification budget, inconsistencies between operational rule to welfare increasing princip, and incomprehensive consideration on resources and anticipate consequences and policy risks. Based on the research findings, it’s recommended to Government to well regulate in formulate educational policies, and School Principal and Education Board in order that evolving an empowering mechanism of certified teachers.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years {{dedicated}} markets for halal meat {{have emerged in}} a number of European countries. While ethnic stores still constitute the major retail outlet for halal meat in most countries, ‘halal’ labelled meat and meat products are increasingly available in supermarkets and fast food restaurants. Market expansion has also facilitated the rise of new certification bodies, each with their own marketing strategies and interpretations of what constitutes authentic ‘halal’, who question the reliability of <b>certification</b> <b>policies</b> that allow the practice of stunning before slaughter. This paper offers a comparative analysis of these market trends and developments across four European countries. Based on research carried out during the EU funded Dialrel project, it draws attention {{to the ways in which}} EU legislation and WTO trade guidelines hinder attempts to standardize halal certification by giving equal weight to pre-stun and non-stun halal slaughter practices emanating from different regional schools of thought within Sunni Islam. Whilst recognising the impact of global politics on the identity claims of Muslim groups across Europe, the paper draws on Einstein's work on the ‘supply side’ theory of religion to demonstrate how the diverse halal practices evident in the marketing strategies of commercial and religious actors are now driving the rapid growth and development of halal meat markets across Europe...|$|R
40|$|Korea-China FTA {{negotiations}} were launched in earnest in May 2012. Elimination of technical {{barriers to trade}} (TBT) {{is one of the}} key issues in which the South Korean government is interested since technical barriers significantly affect trade between the two countries. Previous studies show that national standards and <b>certification</b> <b>policies</b> may act as TBT. In order to eliminate TBT, the World Trade Organization (WTO) obliges Members to observe the principles of non-discrimination and necessity, international standards, equivalence and mutual recognition, and transparency through the TBT Agreement. This paper derives policy implications for TBT negotiations of the Korea-China FTA from the analysis of Korea`s and China`s FTAs. These include: i) defining de facto mandatory standards as technical regulations; ii) including local government`s and non-government`s measures in the scope of application; iii) stipulating provisions of non-discrimination in the process of certification and accreditation; iv) discussing necessity requirements with respect to specific industries such as IT in the Korea-China FTA negotiations. In addition, it is of importance that the both countries bring to the table such issues as: v) determining and rejecting relevant international standards; vi) possible ways of signing a mutual recognition agreement (MRA); vii) transparency regarding the development and notification of technical regulations and standards...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} "welfare friendly" {{products}} increases as public conscience and perception on livestock production systems grow. The public and policy-makers demand scientific information {{for education and}} to guide decision processes. This paper describes some {{of the last decade}} contributions made by scientists on the technical, economical and market areas of farm animal welfare. Articles on animal welfare were compiled on the following themes: 1) consumer behavior, 2) technical and economical viability, 3) public regulation, and 4) private <b>certification</b> <b>policies.</b> Most studies on the economic evaluation of systems that promote animal welfare involved species destined to produce export items, such as eggs, beef and pork. Few studies were found on broilers, dairy cows and fish, and data regarding other species, such as horses, sheep and goats were not found. Scientists understand that farm animal welfare is not only a matter of ethics, but also an essential tool to gain and maintain markets. However, it is unfortunate that little attention is paid to species that are not economically important for exports. Studies that emphasize on more humane ways to raise animals and that provide economic incentives to the producer are needed. An integrated multidisciplinary approach is necessary to highlight the benefits of introducing animal welfare techniques to existing production systems...|$|R
40|$|Is it {{time for}} a major {{redesign}} in technology teacher education? The field of technology education has gone through considerable introspection and revision in recent years. Welty (2003) suggested {{that over the last}} twenty years, the recommended curriculum for the study of technology has evolved dramatically in response to a new emphasis on teaching design, the development of standards, and other new initiatives. Welty further stated that, In light of these advancements, technology teacher educators are being challenged to evaluate their technical curricula, to look beyond traditions in teacher education, to reflect on the nature of knowledge, and to update both technical and professional courses for undergraduate technology teacher education (p. 74). The convergence of new standards, accreditation requirements, research on teaching and learning, as well as new state <b>certification</b> <b>policies</b> have forced many technology teacher education programs to consider changes. In addition to these challenges, technology teacher education programs are facing unparalleled external problems. Some of these problems include shortages of entering pre-service teachers, program closures, and shortages of funding to support substantial programmatic adaptations. Pressure also comes from school administrators to maintain or reinstate traditional programs for students with limited abilities, from business and industry to focus on trade-specific courses, from community colleges to prepare students for post-secondary technical programs (Welty, 2003), and from professional associations to include courses related to pre-engineering, design, and technological literacy...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the transformation}} of the value chain of scientific information in response to concomitant changes in scientific research and education. The scientific communication market is described in terms of main driving forces and their interplay. These forces are the actor (author/reader), accessibility, content, and applicability pairs. Scientific communication is described in this article in terms of its four functions: registration, archive, awareness, and certification. The introduction of these forces and functions allows a structural analysis of the scientific communication market and allows us to discuss aspects of structural continuity in, e. g., describing the transformation from a paper-based system to communication in a digital environment. The developments are seen to emphasise the already existing autonomous development towards a “unified archive��?, lead us to review <b>certification</b> <b>policies</b> to include elements external to research and lead us to consider new structures for scientific communication, and publications. The new structures can be seen to result from the interactions in the market as modelled by the forces and the functions. The distinction between formal and informal communication is seen to become less useful. The need to review the structure and organisation of the market becomes evident, in particular if we consider communication during research and education as well. This leads us to speculate whether elements of the virtual organisation are of relevance...|$|R
