5000|$|... (5) The Virtues are {{subjected}} to a thorough discussion. As is proved in dogmatic theology, our soul receives in justification supernatural habits, not only the three Divine, but also the moral virtues (Trid., Sess. VI, De justit., c. vi; Cat. Rom., p. 2, c. 2, n. 51). These supernatural powers (virtutes infusoe) are joined to the natural faculties or the acquired virtues (virtutes acguisitoe), <b>constituting</b> <b>with</b> them one principle of action. It is the task of ascetics {{to show how the}} virtues, taking into account the obstacles and means mentioned, can be reduced to practice in the actual life of the Christian, so that love be perfected and the image of Christ receive perfect shape in us. Conformable to the Brief of Leo XIII, [...] "Testem benevolentiæ" [...] of 22 January 1899, ascetics insists that the so-called [...] "passive" [...] virtues (meekness, humility, obedience, patience) must never be set aside in favour of the [...] "active" [...] virtues (devotion to duty, scientific activity, social and civilizing labour) which would be tantamount to denying that Christ is the perpetual model. Rather, both kinds must be harmoniously joined {{in the life of the}} Christian. True imitation of Christ is never a brake, nor does it blunt the initiative in any field of human endeavour, but the practice of the passive virtues is a support and aid to true activity. Besides, it not rarely happens that the passive virtues reveal a higher degree of moral energy than the active. The Brief itself refers to Matt., xxi, 29; Rom., viii, 29; Gal., v, 24; Phil., ii, 8; Heb., xiii, 8 (cf. also Zahn, l. c., 166 sqq.).|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the jurists consider that the [...] "national interest" [...] is incompatible with the [...] "rule of law". Regarding this, Antonino Troianiello has said that national interest and a state subject {{to the rule of}} law are not absolutely incompatible:While the notion of state reason comes first as a theme of study in political science, it is a very vague concept in law and has never been an object of systematic study. This obvious lack of interest is due to a deliberate epistemological choice - a form of positivism applied to legal science; and as a result legal science affirms its autonomy regarding other social sciences while <b>constituting</b> <b>with</b> exactness its own object - law - in order to describe it. In doing so it implies deterministic causes which have an influence on its descriptive function. This method which puts aside state reason is not without any consequence: the fact that state reason is not taken into account by legal science is to be integrated within a global rejection of a description of law as presented in political science. A fundamental dynamic in modern constitutionalism, [...] "the seizure of the political phenomenon by law" [...] is all the more remarkable when it claims a scientific value, thus a neutrality aiming at preventing all objection. This convergence of legal science and constitutionalism has the tautological character of a rhetorical discourse in which law is simultaneously the subject and the object of the discourse on law. Having as a basis state reason, it allows a reflexion on the legitimacy of power and authority of modern Western societies; this in connexion with the representations which make it and which it makes [...] "state reason and public law."

The two crucial criteria (balance and contrast) explaining 57. 6 % of the variance was derived from the 25 graphic design works. In order to test the evaluating validity of graphic design works with the scores of balance and contrast, another set of 25 logo design works were evaluated with 21 designers in the two criteria and in a overall scores. A multiple linear regression analysis using the stepwise method was conducted to predict the design scores with the two crucial criteria. The result indicates that the regression equation has a highly predicting power to the design scores based on the two crucial criteria (R 2 = 0. 518) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{vegetative}} {{covering of}} the North American continent falls naturally into two great areas, forest and plain. At first {{thought it would}} seem that these were primary phytogeographical divisions, but a comparison with the vegetative covering of other continents proves the contrary. Considered as a phytogeographical feature, the North American forested area is an entity; from a floristic or formational standpoint, it may be analyzed into several distinct portions of widely separated relationship. The ground-tone of the great bulk of the North American forests is that of the forests of British North America, which are closely related to those of middle-north Europe and Siberia, <b>constituting</b> <b>with</b> them the northern realm of Drude and the sub-arctic region of Engler. Three great belts extend southward from this northern mass, each undergoing profound changes in type, and becoming differentiated into well-characterized regions. The floristic separation of these regions from the northern forest-region is so great that the relationship is always much less close than that existing between the floral covering of British America and that of northern Eurasia, and in one or two cases it practically disappears...|$|E
40|$|The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is {{a single}} astronomical {{instrument}} consisting of up to 64 12 m Antennae that can be relocated on more than 200 stations over an area of approximately 15 km across the Llano de Chajnantor plateau at 5000 m asl (the Array Operating Site or AOS) in the Chilean Atacama desert. Originally an equal partnership between Europe and North America, {{in cooperation with the}} Republic of Chile, ALMA has been recently extended to include the contribution of Japan that will provide an additional 16 -Antenna sub-array (ALMA Compact Array, ACA). The signal captured by each Antenna (in the range 30 - 950 GHz) is down-converted to a lower Intermediate Frequency (IF), digitized and transferred to the Technical Building, also at the AOS site, as a 120 Gbit/second data stream through one single Optical Fibre.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the distribution of sequences homologous to Bari- 1, a Tc 1 -like transposable element first identified in Drosophila melanogaster, in 87 species of the Drosophila genus. We have also isolated and sequenced Bari- 1 homologues from D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia, the species <b>constituting</b> <b>with</b> D. melanogaster the melanogaster complex, and from D. diplacantha and D. erecta, two phylogenetically more distant species of the melanogaster group. Within the melanogaster complex the Bari- 1 elements are extremely similar to each other, showing nucleotide identity values of at least 99. 3 %. In contrast, Bari- 1 -like elements from D. diplacantha and D. erecta are on average only 70 % similar to D. melanogaster Bari- 1 and are usually defective due to nucleotide deletions and/or insertions in the ORFs encoding their transposases. In D. erecta the defective copies are all located in the chromocenter and on chromosome 4. Surprisingly, while D. melanogaster Bari- 1 elements possess 26 -bp inverted terminal repeats, their D. diplacantha and D. erecta homologues possess long inverted terminal repeats similar to the terminal structures observed in the S elements of D. melanogaster and in several other Tc 1 -like elements of different organisms. This finding, together with the nucleotide and amino acid identity level between D. diplacantha and D. erecta elements and Bari- 1 of D. melanogaster, suggests a common evolutionary origin and a rapid diversification of the termini of these Drosophila Tc 1 -like elements...|$|E
