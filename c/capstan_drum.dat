40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{my personal}} {{contribution to the}} development of a hydraulic-based actuation system for a solar trough collector. The goal of this project was to design the actuation system using hydraulic actuators for a four meter solar collector prototype in Pittsfield, New Hampshire. After considering several hydraulic system architectures and conducting in-depth analysis into two of them, the idler pulley scheme was chosen. This mechanism uses a double rod end hydraulic actuator connected to wire rope wrapped around a <b>capstan</b> <b>drum</b> and an idler pulley. The model was optimized for mechanical performance, and it is expected to be a more cost effective option than the existing actuation system in New Hampshire once the controls equipment required to actuate the hydraulic cylinders for the new design is specified. by Juan Felipe Carrillo.

50|$|As {{reported}} by the local newspaper (as reported in The Colliery Guardian on 15 March 1926.) the six men were finishing work on the second shaft when their portable platform below ground collapsed. The Capstan engine which malfunctioned was powered by a two-cylinder engine; attached to each drum however on the Capstan engine were pawls or ratchets which should have prevented the Capstan engine slipping; and the inspected machinery {{was found to be}} in order; there was no evidence to prove mechanical failure or human aberration. At the coroner's inquest the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The given verdict had been largely influenced by a special report made regarding this accident by Mr H.M. Hudspeth, H.M. Divisional inspection for the Yorkshire division of mines. The conclusion he personally produced was that the engine driver accidentally put his level into the position for lowering scaffold while the <b>capstan</b> <b>drums</b> were held by the restraining pawls. It was his recommendation that pawls should not be used on worm driven capstan engines.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{block and}} tackle or capstan winch is common to handle line sets that have {{significantly}} unbalanced loads. Block and tackle sets use the mechanical advantage (e.g., 6 : 1) of multi-purchase blocks to enable a crew to manually raise an imbalanced line set. The standing block is secured at the grid level and the running block to the batten or arbor (whichever is overloaded). Where an engaging bar has been designed into the stage level locking rail, a portable electric capstan winch {{may be used to}} counteract an imbalanced counterweight line set. Pulling on (constricting) a rope wrapped a few times around the <b>capstan,</b> a <b>drum</b> spinning at a constant rate, generates enough traction (through friction) to tug the imbalanced load.|$|R

50|$|Philips, however, used an 'M-wrap' {{similar to}} that in VHS machines. Cables pulled pins along tracks in order to pull the tape into the {{transport}} path. This drive was large, heavy and very complex to produce, although having the head <b>drum,</b> <b>capstan,</b> audio/erase heads and the respective drive motors all mounted on a common base plate meant it was produced to high tolerances. Philips referred to this assembly as the ‘microworld’. Second and third generation Philips drives replaced the cable-pulled pins with a reliable lever mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to VHS, {{production}} costs {{were a big}} problem with Video 2000. For their second generation series Philips developed a completely new drive, with the tape pulled against the heads in an formation by pins on lever arms. This drive was very compact, with very high quality and (compared to VHS) very fast response times, but still had five direct drive motors (head <b>drum,</b> <b>capstan,</b> two belt drive and a threading and cassette compartment). Due to their compact nature, these last Philips drives were quite expensive to service but defects in the mechanism are quite rare, except for the rubber pressure roller which is easy to change.|$|R
