Fluorescein angiography has been crucial to Ophthalmology since the late 1950s. While OCT imaging has helped {{reduce the need for}} fundus photography and fluorescein angiography, nothing has been implemented that can replace these very important diagnostic tests. 1. <b>Computer-aided</b> <b>animation</b> and analysis of time series retinal images have been suggested to observer retinal conditions. The manufacturer of the MatchedFlicker, whose technology automatically aligns and registers two images of the same retina taken at different points in time thus generating a superimposed view which identifies any changes present between the two images. MatchedFlicker assists to improve both the speed and accuracy of image diagnostic evaluations, resulting in more effective workflow, more precise diagnosis and simplicity of recording. Studies have compared <b>computer-aided</b> <b>animation</b> and analysis of time series retinal images with photographic images in a number of retinal diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration and early screening of premature infant eyes for retinopathy. With results conclusively suggesting that computer aided animation provides a more accurate and earlier diagnosis including detection of glaucoma and screening of premature infant eyes for retinopathy.|$|R
40|$|The {{elevation}} of traditional craft {{practice as a}} form of resistance against technological development is a key attribute of the post-digital era. In this paper, I posit a sympathetic relationship between Chinese papercutting and computer art (CA). An arts-based research methodology will be applied to analyze the outcomes of an international community art project titled The Float. Undertaken between January and June 2015, it engaged over 100 young people in traditional Chinese craft workshops across Australia, Canada, China, and the USA. The project culminated in a series of exhibitions that emphasized humanity’s shared stewardship of the oceans. The artworks presented included both computer-assisted <b>animation</b> (<b>CAA)</b> and computer numerical control (CNC) cut paper. In this case study, the oftpolarized media of craft and CA were simultaneously engaged. Arts, Education & Law Group, Queensland College of ArtFull Tex...|$|R

Application of animation tools extends even to industry, education, trade and entertainment.

40|$|Abstract The paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} binary 2 D and 3 D object methamorphosis using a normalized morphological interpolation function and a mask. Comparing with the existing methods the proposed one has two important advantages: the normalization of the interpolation function and the new formulation of the interpolator. The first one allows obtaining steady and smooth transfomation of the area (volume) of the interpolated objects. The new formulation of the interpolator introduces a mask inside which the interpolation is performed. Owing to the the mask one can define the area inside which the interpolation is performed. The new kind of mask is also proposed- it {{is equal to the}} convex hull of both input objects. In the paper also two examples of the interpolaton of 2 D and 3 D objects are given. The method can be applied to image reconstrucion, {{as well as for the}} <b>computer-aided</b> <b>animations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{quadtree}} {{data structure}} is extensively used in representing 2 dimensional data in many applications like image processing, cartographic data processing. VLSI embedding, graphics, computer <b>animation,</b> <b>computer-aided</b> architecture, etc. The data structure employs the divide-and-conquer technique to recursively decompose the planar region. This paper addresses {{the problem of}} planar tessellation which yields the quadtree data structure. Arbitrary triangles and parallelograms {{have been used as}} basic cells and hyper-cellular structures corresponding to lower order k-gons have been shown to represent such data structures. Different tessellation schemes have been discussed using the notion of tessellation matrix. The performances of different tessellation schemes have been compared, introducing the concept of the neighbor-hood graph. 0 1987 Academic press. IX 1...|$|R
40|$|Polygonal meshes are {{ubiquitous}} in geometric modeling. They {{are widely used}} in many applications, such as computer games, <b>computer-aided</b> design, <b>animation,</b> and visualization. One of the important problems in mesh processing and analysis is segmentation, where {{the goal is to}} partition a mesh into segments to suit the particular application at hand. In this thesis we study structural-level mesh segmentation, which seeks to decompose a given 3 D shape into parts according to human intuition. We take the spectral approach to mesh segmentation. In essence, we encode the domain knowledge of our problems into appropriately-defined matrices and use their eigen-structures to derive optimal low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings to facilitate geometric analysis. In order to build the domain knowledge suitable for structural-level segmentation, we develop a surface metric which captures part information through a volumetric consideration. With such a part-aware metric, we design a spectral clustering algorithm to extract the parts of a mesh, essentially solving a global optimization problem approximately. The inherent complexity of this approach is reduced through sub-sampling, where the sampling scheme we employ is based on the part-aware metric and a practical sampling quality measure. Finally, we introduce a segmentability measure and a salience-driven line search to compute shape parts recursively. Such a combination further improves the autonomy and quality of our mesh segmentation algorithm...|$|R
30|$|As an {{integral}} part of computer human simulation, a three-dimensional (3 D) human modeling has always been one of the hot topics in computer graphic research. Computer human body modeling can construct a highly realistic virtual human body, which has been widely used in various fields, such as garment <b>computer-aided</b> design (CAD), <b>animation</b> production, and scene simulation, and has attracted the attention and research of many scholars. With the development of a three-dimensional scanning reconstruction technology and a three-dimensional human body modeling technology, the computer-aided three-dimensional garment design system is an integration and synthesis of three-dimensional human body measurements, dimension information extraction, apparel design, virtual fitting, animation simulation, and customization, sales, and display of the Internet. The computer-aided three-dimensional garment design system can realize the virtual review and inspection of garments before the formal formalization of garments, identify problems, and improve them in a timely manner. At the same time, it enhances user participation, reduces risks, shortens the design production cycle, and reduces cost.|$|R
30|$|Sixteen (12 men, 4 women) {{graduate}} student {{participants were recruited}} for the study (8 groups with 2 in each group). The participants’ ages ranged from 25 to 33. Important to the backgrounds of those {{graduate student}}s was their lack of any 3 D <b>computer-aided</b> drawing and <b>animation</b> experience, which practically eliminated experience-based bias. While selecting the subjects, a screening was conducted before the experiment in the format of a simple oral interview. All participants were pre-screened to ensure they had no sophisticated experience with CAD, VR, and MR applications. The modules for design review in the experiments were all taken from real construction industry designs and thus a proper level of complexity in the modules was ensured. These precautions can make the experience factor insignificant to bias the results. Furthermore, none of the participants had any known impairment in spatial cognition and reasoning, any brain damage, or eye (vision) problems that were not corrected by standard eyeglass prescription. It {{is important to note}} that there was no cross-over between participants in this experiment and the earlier experiment by Wang and Dunston (2008) comparing the MR approach to the paper-based method. Thus learning curve effects and related biases were avoided as well.|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of 3 D shape analysis, {{research}} in mesh segmentation {{has always been an}} important topic, as it is a fundamental low-level task which can be utilized in many applications including <b>computer-aided</b> design, computer <b>animation,</b> biomedical applications and many other fields. We define the automatic robust mesh segmentation (ARMS) method in this paper, which 1) is invariant to isometric transformation, 2) is insensitive to noise and deformation, 3) performs closely to human perception, 4) is efficient in computation, and 5) is minimally dependent on prior knowledge. In this work, we develop a new framework, namely the Center-Shift, which discovers meaningful segments of a 3 D object by exploring the intrinsic geometric structure encoded in the biharmonic kernel. Our Center-Shift framework has three main steps: First, we construct a feature space where every vertex on the mesh surface is associated with the corresponding biharmonic kernel density function value. Second, we apply the Center-Shift algorithm for initial segmentation. Third, the initial segmentation result is refined through an efficient iterative process which leads to visually salient segmentation of the shape. The performance of this segmentation method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various sets of 3 D shapes and different types of noise and deformation. The experimental results of 3 D shape segmentation have shown better performance of Center-Shift, compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods...|$|R
50|$|Nadin {{has opposed}} the {{viewpoint}} that tools that are extensions of human physical abilities, the computer {{should be considered}} {{an extension of the}} human mind. He founded the world’s first program in Computational Design in 1994 at the University of Wuppertal (Germany). Its purpose was twofold: 1. development of a theory of computational design; 2. the design of products and processes through digital means. These products and processes themselves integrate digital technology (they are embedded systems). Thus, the program’s long-term goal is the constitution of the world of ubiquitous computing. Nadin’s actual work in what was to become “computational design” started around 1985, with his appointment as Eminent Scholar in Art & Design Technology at the Ohio State University (Columbus). One of his major assignments there was to draw up a plan for a center in which research in the art and design possibilities of digital technology would serve as an intermediary between education and applications for art and industry. The result of his investigations was a broad plan entitled Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design. His plan was not limited to <b>computer-aided</b> design and <b>animation,</b> but extended to digitally aided visualization for the sciences, technology, medicine, education, as well as art and design. (OSU kept Nadin's title for the Center, but limited its activities to computer graphics and animation.) In 1999, Nadin and colleagues presented a framework for a design program to Stanford University.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{practice}} based Ph. D. in Fine Arts. The {{subject of the}} research deals with strategies of doubling {{as a means to}} explore the relation between what technology promises and the fantasy of the viewer/user. The visual material that constitutes my research attempts to raise, in various interrelated ways, a set of core questions regarding the nature of surface as receptacle of images and {{to take into account the}} filiation that new media partake of, namely that computer-aided art is seen as a subset of fine art. Indeed, the first line of enquiry is to address what constitutes the 'picture plane' of a computer screen. Interrogating the nature of the digital Image and Its relations to the viewer/user, my question is "how does <b>computer-aided</b> art (<b>animation,</b> video and interactive installation) address the connection between surface and image, particularly when digital manipulation is used to consistently postpone a totalising view of the image?" This includes the analysis of how static and dynamic states of the image are generated in (digital) art, or where the phenomenon of doubling raises questions about what kind of visual economy operates with respect to art that uses advanced technologies. I critically analyse these aspects occurring in work by artists, whose practice deals with certain modes of addressing the totalising view of an image, an image that appears virtually complete. As a practising artist, in terms of the media I choose to work with, doubling is enabled by providing a certain degree of Interactivity with the computer screen, giving the viewer the illusion of control over the production of the image. However, the illusory nature of this control is revealed by the systematic Incompleteness of the image being 'painted' on the screen. Apart from provoking and frustrating the desire for totalising visuality, the deliberate incompleteness of the images holds open questions of scale, animation, and the relationship of image to surface. Given the nature of the medium in which the moving images were created, the pieces share the potential for continuing the loop in which they play ad infinitum. But, as the cyclicity of the loops makes manifest, nearly all of them are also predicated on an ontological duality whereby the same object, the same entity, can transform into something phenomenally other through the permeable interplay between emergent and receding aspects inherent within it. So integral to image-forming I find this doubling that I have extended the theme to my own public Identity, by sometimes functioning under an alias, the name of Sissu Tarka.

40|$|In many {{applications}} of computer graphics {{it is necessary}} to model natural forms. Worlds populated with both familiar and exotic flora and fauna, for example, are commonplace in animated films and computer games. Modelling organic forms using traditional <b>computer-aided</b> design or <b>animation</b> tools, however, is often a tedious and time-consuming process, particularly when constructing forms that grow and develop large amounts of complexity from simple beginnings. Procedural modelling, an alternative to the traditional, or "manual", approach to geometric modelling, seeks {{to address the problem of}} model complexity. Under this approach, a user specifies a procedure [...] often with associated parameters and initial conditions [...] which the computer then executes in order to construct a model. Procedural modelling systems are capable of generating extremely complex structures, such as sprawling landscapes, cityscapes, and forests. If biological or organic shapes are to be modelled, it is natural to consider the processes that occur within biological development. Developmental systems, based on aspects of biological development, have emerged as a powerful technique for generating a rich variety of organic forms; however, there remains a number of forms that existing systems are unable to generate effectively. This thesis introduces the Simplicial Developmental System (SDS), a system capable of automatically generating developing organic forms that are difficult, or impossible, to create using existing methods. These forms can be characterised in natural language as "organic, smooth, soft, squishy, and modular". SDS integrates a number of elements, such as cellular behaviour, soft-body mechanics and morphogen diffusion. These elements operate on a unified, adaptive, geometric representation of volumetric form [...] the simplicial complex [...] that is embedded within a physically simulated environment. The thesis presents two instances of SDS: a system for generating 2 D forms with a triangular mesh representation, and a system for generating 3 D forms with a tetrahedral mesh representation. Modelling biological development on these representations raises a number of questions; for instance, how does the division of a cell modify the tetrahedral mesh? This research offers a solution to this and other technical challenges. The capabilities of SDS are exhibited in a number of experimental results presented in the thesis. These experiments demonstrate how SDS can be used to generate continuous sequences of developing organic forms. Two biological models of growth were successfully implemented in the 2 D system: limb bud development in chicken embryogenesis and antero-posterior segmentation in Drosophila melanogaster. Experiments with these models demonstrate how cells in SDS can coordinate their behaviour in order to generate higher-order structures and patterns. This thesis also presents a number of experiments performed with the 3 D system, demonstrating the effectiveness of SDS in automating the generation of complex 3 D geometric models with organic features such as smooth surfaces, modularity, environment-sensitivity, similarity with variation, and elastic deformation.
