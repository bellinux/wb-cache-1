60|$|After these {{apologies for}} the {{limitations}} of this essay, we may survey the backward track. We began by showing that savages may stumble, and have stumbled, on theories not inconsistent with science, but not till recently discovered by science. The electric origin of the Aurora Borealis (whether absolutely certain or not) was an example; another was the efficacy of 'suggestion,' especially for <b>curative</b> <b>purposes.</b> It was, therefore, hinted that, if savages blundered (if you please) into a belief in God and the Soul, however obscurely envisaged, these beliefs were not therefore necessarily and essentially false. We then stated our purpose of examining the alleged supernormal phenomena, savage or civilised, which, on Mr. Tylor's hypothesis, help to originate the conception of 'spirits.' We defended {{the nature of our}} evidence, as before anthropologists, by showing that, for the savage belief in the supernormal phenomena, we have exactly the kind of evidence on which all anthropological science reposes. The relative weakness of that evidence, our need of more and better evidence, we would be the very last to deny, indeed it is part of our case. Our existing evidence will hardly support any theory of religion. Anyone who is in doubt on that head has only to read M. Réville's 'Les Religions des Peuples Non-Civilisés,' under the heads 'Mélanésiens,' 'Mincopies,' 'Les Australiens' (ii. 116-143), when he will observe that this eminent French authority is ignorant of the facts about these races here produced. In 1883 they had not come within his ken. Such minute and careful inquiries by men closely intimate with the peoples concerned, as Dr. Codrington's, Mr. Hewitt's, Mr. Man's, and the authorities compiled by Mr. Brough Smyth, were unfamiliar to M. Réville, Thus, in turn, new facts, or facts unknown to us, may upset my theory. This peril is of the essence of scientific theorising on the history of religion.|$|E

A questionnaire consisting of 41 questions was mailed to 10 [*] 000 adults randomly selected from the electoral roll of Mie prefecture, Japan in January 2007. The questionnaire asked the subjects about demand for CAM practice at hospitals, types of CAM therapy to be provided and associated reasons. Sociodemographic characteristics, perceived health status, experience and purpose of CAM use, and information resource for CAM were also surveyed. Completed answers were collected from 2824 (28. 6 %) respondents. Two thousand and nineteen (71. 5 %) of the respondents demanded CAM practice at hospitals with the most likely reason of “patients can receive treatment under the guidance of a physicians". The three most popular CAM therapies were Kampo, acupressure/massage/Shiatsu and acupuncture/moxibustion. The demand was positively associated with gender, ages of 40 – 59 years, annual household incomes of 5 – 7 million yen, occupation of specialist and technical workers and sales workers and poor health status.

30|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate, {{more than}} 80 % of the {{population}} of the developing countries rely on conventional plants for initial health care (Mulat et al. [2013]). Only in Asia, medicinal plant has a big impact on economy and primary health care. There are approximately 6, 500 species used for <b>curative</b> <b>purpose</b> in Asia. Bangladesh has a fertile with reputable inheritance of herbal medicines among the countries in South Asia. In Bangladesh, almost 500 medicinal species are assessed, and 250 species are used for preparation of traditional medicine. In addition, a large amount of pharmaceutical raw materials including medicinal plants and semi-processed plant are used. The majority of these plants have not yet been studied for their pharmacological and toxicological bioactivities (Rajaei et al. [2012]; Karki et al. [1999]; Uddin et al. [2011]). Presently, thrombolytic drugs like urokinase (UK), alteplase, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and streptokinase (SK) are widely used as clinical thrombolytic agents. Nowadays, streptokinase and urokinase are used in developing countries due to their reasonable price, but these drugs are coupled with side effects which lead to anaphylactic reaction, hemorrhage, and systemic fibrinolysis. As a result of immunogenicity, multiple treatment of streptokinase is restricted in a given patient (Sherwani et al. [2013]; Dewan et al. [2013]). Traditional plants are relatively safe for use to treat different types of diseases, including various traditional plants that have thrombolytic, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and antithrombotic activities which are successfully applied for therapeutic purposes (Das et al. [2013]). Present phytochemical research scientists have isolated hundreds of bioactive chemical compounds, for example aconitine, acronycine, compounds from Amaryllidaceae plants, bisindole, camptothecine, cephalotaxus, colchine, ellipticine, emtine, phenanthroquinolizidine, and pyrrolizidine, which are ascertained cytotoxic against tumor cells (Geoffrey et al.

40|$|Nowadays, {{radiotherapy}} {{has become}} an integral part of the treatment regimen in various malignancies for <b>curative</b> or palliative <b>purposes.</b> Ionizing radiation interacts with biological systems to produce free radicals, which attack various cellular components. Radioprotectors act as prophylactic agents that are administered to shield normal cells and tissues from the harmful effects of radiation. Melatonin has been shown to be both a direct free radical scavenger and an indirect antioxidant by stimulating antioxidant enzymes and suppressing prooxidative enzymes activity. In addition to its antioxidant property, there have also been reports implicating antiapoptotic function for melatonin in normal cells. Furthermore, through its antitumor and radiosensitizing properties, treatment with melatonin may prevent tumor progression. Therefore, addition of melatonin to radiation therapy could lower the damage inflicted to the normal tissue, leading to a more efficient tumor control by use of higher doses of irradiation during radiotherapy. Thus, it seems that, in the future, melatonin may improve the therapeutic gain in radiation oncology treatments. Â© 2014 Ehsan Mihandoost et al...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Pelvic exenteration {{requires}} complete resection of {{the tumor}} with negative margins {{to be considered a}} <b>curative</b> surgery. The <b>purpose</b> of this review is to assess the optimal preoperative evaluation and surgical approach in patients with recurrent cervical cancer to increase the chances of achieving a curative surgery with decreased morbidity and mortality in the era of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: Review of English publications pertaining to cervical cancer within the last 25 years were included using PubMed and Cochrane Library searches. RESULTS: Modern imaging (MRI and PET-CT) does not accurately identify local extension of microscopic disease and is inadequate for preoperative planning of extent of resection. Today, only half of pelvic exenteration procedures obtain uninvolved surgical margins. CONCLUSION: Clear margins are required for curative pelvic exenterations, but are poorly predictable by pre-operative assessment. More extensive surgery, i. e. the infra-elevator exenteration with vulvectomy, is a logical surgical choice to increase the rate of clear margins and to improve patient survival following surgery for recurrent cervical carcinoma...|$|R

The <b>purpose</b> {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effects of YJHD on SGC 7901 /VCR gastric cancer cells and to elucidate the possible mechanism of action. First, the effects of a low dose of YJHD in combination with chemotherapeutic agents on SGC 7901 /VCR cells were assessed using the CCK- 8 assay and flow cytometry, and the effects of YJHD on genes and proteins involved in drug resistance (MDR 1, MRP, TUBB 3, STMN 1, and TS) were evaluated. Furthermore, transfection of SGC 7901 /VCR cells with siRNAs targeting these genes inhibited their expression, and the efficacy of vincristine against the cells was dramatically improved in vitro when these genes were silenced. These results demonstrate that low-dose YJHD inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, reversed MDR, and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro by downregulating P-gp, MRP, TUBB 3, and STMN 1 expression. MDR can be reversed by siRNAs targeting genes involved in MDR, and this strategy for cancer treatment should be evaluated in future studies...|$|R

Patients-Methods: Patients with primary or recurrent colorectal cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis were included in the study. Clinical variables were correlated to survival, recurrence, hospital mortality, and morbidity. Results: From 2000 - 2010, 28 patients underwent 33 cytoreductive operations. The hospital mortality and morbidity rate was 9. 1 % and 45. 5 % respectively. The overall 5 -year and median survival time was 29. 2 % and 19 months respectively. The extent of peritoneal carcinomatosis (p = 0. 0003) and the completeness of cytoreduction (p = 0. 0002) were related to survival.
