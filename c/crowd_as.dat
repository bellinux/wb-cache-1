5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet <b>crowd,</b> <b>as</b> a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano's {{departure}} enraged the <b>crowd,</b> <b>as</b> he did {{not explain}} what had happened, and the people feared a betrayal. Demands for Cisneros' immediate resignation replaced those for an open cabildo. The people finally settled down and dispersed when Saavedra intervened {{to say that the}} claims of the Infernal Legion were supported by the military.|$|E

Having had no funding, Omar competed in loose fitting equipment donated by the Sudanese team, but despite finishing in last place, the media coverage of her meant that she was cheered loudly by the <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> she finished.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{returned}} to Melbourne {{for the fifth}} Test, where Woodfull scored 102 and 35 {{in front of his}} home <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> Australia won by five wickets. It {{was the first time that}} Woodfull had played in a winning Test, after ten matches. He hit three centuries in the series, with 491 runs at 54.56 despite which Australia lost the Ashes 4–1. Woodfull ended the entire season with 854 runs at 85.40.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the club}} has had notable defeats from 2000–01 onwards, crowds have {{continued}} to be healthy. During the 2005–06 season, home attendances (that is, given attendances minus away support) increased slightly on the season before, helped by a 10,006 crowd against Carlisle {{on the final day}} of the season. That game in particular attracted a large <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> the town of Stockport supported its team at Edgeley Park. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from the Football League for the first time, an embarrassment as the team has competed continuously in the Football League since 1900. Stockport eventually drew the game with Carlisle and survived the drop, while Carlisle themselves gained the league championship.|$|E

He was, however, beaten by the Mercedes-Benz of Manfred von Brauchitsch at the Avusrennen (the yearly race at the AVUS track). Von Brauchitsch drove a privately entered SSK with streamlined bodywork, and beat Caracciola's Alfa Romeo, which finished in second place. Caracciola was seen by the German <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> having defected to the Italian team and was booed, while von Brauchitsch's all German victory drew mass support.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{negotiations}} {{were about to}} recommence at around 1:30 pm, chaos broke out as the impatient and angry crowd stormed the outer courtyard of the Bastille, pushing toward the main gate. Confused firing {{broke out in the}} confined space and chaotic fighting began in earnest between de Launay's forces and the revolutionary <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> the two sides exchanged fire. At around 3:30 pm, more mutinous royal forces arrived to reinforce the crowd, bringing with them trained infantry officers and several cannons. After discovering that their weapons were too light to damage the main walls of the fortress, the revolutionary crowd began to fire their cannons at the wooden gate of the Bastille. By now around 83 of the crowd had been killed and another 15 mortally wounded; only one of the Invalides had been killed in return.|$|E

On 11 May 2013 Rehman won the Hong Kong FA Cup through a 1–0 victory over last year finalist Sun Pegasus FC. On 26 May 2013 Rehman helped Kitchee beat Tuen Mun 3–0 in the final of the play-off to ensure his teams passage into the AFC Cup 2014. Rehman played fifteen league games for the club during the 2012/13 season, which was followed by six appearances in the next season.|$|E

5|$|Surprisingly, Schneider {{was traded}} to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, {{reinstating}} Luongo in the starting position for the 2013–14 NHL season. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, chose rookie Eddie Läck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} a Pinfalls Count Anywhere {{match for the}} WWE Championship, as John Cena defended against The Great Khali. Khali had control {{for most of the}} contest, {{performing}} a spin kick and a leg drop onto Cena. The contest went into the <b>crowd,</b> <b>as</b> Khali hit Cena with a television monitor. Cena gained the advantage, swinging the boom camera by the crew set into Khali. Cena attempted to perform the FU, but Khali blocked it with his elbow. Khali regained the upper hand, scoop slamming Cena onto a crane. Cena fought back while on the crane and performed an FU to Khali off the crane onto the arena floor. Cena got the pinfall and the victory.|$|E

He climbs the stairs and stands and faces the <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> The Olympian is still being played. After a minute, he lights the gas powered Olympic rings that connect with the Olympic cauldron. The flame is lit to the cheers from the crowd. The athlete and judges oaths are taken and a children's chorus appears. They perform ode to joy.|$|E
5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
5|$|At 8:00 on {{the morning}} of the Test, there was a storm to the south of London but the rain did not reach Lord's, which was located in the north of the English capital. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to {{complete}} a maiden. The debutant Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and he removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Hutton at short fine leg from a short delivery to leave Australia 3/1. Barnes tried to knock the ball through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton. Coxon bowled from very close to the wickets and left substantial footmarks just outside the right-hander's leg stump in an area ideal for a leg spinner. Although he was not of particularly fast pace, Coxon ran in vigorously and landed heavily after a pronounced delivery stride, making a significant impact on the surface. Bradman received a loud, positive reception from the <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the <b>crowd</b> <b>as</b> he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and the ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the <b>crowd.</b> <b>As</b> of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} {{a majority of}} the houses on Wisteria Lane, Paul announces that he plans to open a halfway house for ex-convicts on the street. A protest against his plan escalates into a violent riot and Susan is trampled by the unruly <b>crowd.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Susan loses a kidney and learns that her second kidney is deformed and she is at severe risk of renal failure. Susan reluctantly agrees to undergo dialysis while waiting for a transplant. After Paul throws her out, Beth submits paperwork indicating that in the event of her death, her kidney would be given to Susan, and then commits suicide. Despite initial refusal, Paul allows the operation to move forward and he and Susan reconcile. After discovering that Paul has been depressed following Beth's suicide, Susan begins cooking meals for him with the assistance of Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Beth's mother and Martha Huber's sister, who secretly adds antifreeze to the food in an effort to kill him. Paul nearly dies {{as a result of the}} poisoned food. Unaware that Felicia is helping prepare his meals, Paul has Susan arrested for attempting to kill him. Eventually, Susan is released, Paul confesses to the murder of Martha Huber, and Felicia presumably dies in a car crash while fleeing town. Susan and her family move back onto Wisteria Lane. During a dinner party, Gabrielle's former stepfather, Alejandro (Tony Plana), who raped her during her childhood, attempts to harm Gabrielle until her husband, Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) kills him. Susan, Lynette, and Bree agree to help cover up the crime.|$|E

40|$|The eects {{of adult}} {{crowding}} on two components of fitness were studied in {{three sets of}} Drosophila mela-nogaster populations, subjected to life-stage-specific, density-dependent natural selection in the laboratory for over 50 generations. Three days of crowding, early in adult life, were observed to increase mortality signifi-cantly during the episode of <b>crowding,</b> <b>as</b> well as decrease subsequent fecundity. Populations selected for adaptation to high adult densities suered significantly lower mortality during episodes of adult <b>crowding,</b> <b>as</b> compared to populations selected specifically for adaptation to larval <b>crowding,</b> <b>as</b> well as control populations typically maintained at low larval and adult densities. Moreover, populations adapted to larval crowding seemed to be adversely aected by adult crowding {{to a greater extent}} than the controls, raising the possibility of trade-os between adaptations to larval and adult crowding, respectively. Preliminary evidence suggests that the populations adapted to adult crowding may have evolved a propensity to stay away from the food medium, which is where most deaths occur when adults are crowded in culture vials...|$|R
