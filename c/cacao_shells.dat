40|$|The {{devolatilization}} is {{the basic}} step of thermochemical processes and requires a fundamental characterization. Three biomass residues (rice husks, olive cake, <b>cacao</b> <b>shells)</b> are studied here in a thermogravimetric (TG) balance. The effect of the heating rate (HR) is evaluated in the range 5 - 100 K/min providing significant parameters for the fingerprinting of the fuels. Kinetics are obtained by applying traditional isoconversional methods. The activation energy as function of the conversion reveals the multi-step nature of the biomass devolatilization. Although average values allow the reactivity of different fuels to be compared, a first order reaction model can hardly predict the biomass devolatilization. A VEB (Variable activation Energy model for Biomass devolatilization) model is; developed, basing {{on the results of}} the kinetic analysis.

40|$|Data on biomass chars {{obtained}} Under conditions {{similar to}} those of practical applications (high heating rate and low residence time) are required for co-combustion and gasification plants. A methodological procedure is developed and applied to two biomass fuels (<b>cacao</b> <b>shells</b> and olive cake) for producing high heating rate chars and characterizing their reactivity and morphology after the first steps of devolatilization. Different chars are produced in a drop tube reactor (rapid pyrolysis) by varying the nominal temperature and the residence time. Oxidation in air is performed to compare typical temperatures and kinetic parameters and evaluate the effect of the operating conditions on char reactivity. A detailed SEM analysis allows to assess the structural variations during the pyrolysis and detect the main phenomena (softening, swelling. melting, formation of bubbles). A quantitative morphological Study is also performed to provide size and shape (important for biomasses) distributions Of the parent fuel and the chars. These data are more significant than average values in advanced model to correctly simulate the fluid dynamic behaviour of each dimensional class of particles in large scale furnaces and gasifiers and predict a more reliable residence time of the particles.

40|$|Biochar (BC) {{application}} to soil suppresses emission of nitrous- (N 2 O) and nitric oxide (NO), but the mechanisms are unclear. One {{of the most}} prominent features of BC is its alkalizing effect in soils, which may affect denitrification and its product stoichiometry directly or indirectly. We conducted laboratory experiments with anoxic slurries of acid Acrisols from Indonesia and Zambia and two contrasting BCs produced locally from rice husk and <b>cacao</b> <b>shell.</b> Dose-dependent responses of denitrification and gaseous products (NO, N 2 O and N 2) were assessed by high-resolution gas kinetics and related to the alkalizing effect of the BCs. To delineate the pH effect from other BC effects, we removed part of the alkalinity by leaching the BCs with water and acid prior to incubation. Uncharred <b>cacao</b> <b>shell</b> and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were also included in the study. The untreated BCs suppressed N 2 O and NO and increased N 2 production during denitrification, irrespective of the effect on denitrification rate. The extent of N 2 O and NO suppression was dose-dependent and increased with the alkalizing effect of the two BC types, which was strongest for <b>cacao</b> <b>shell</b> BC. Acid leaching of BC, which decreased its alkalizing effect, reduced or eliminated the ability of BC to suppress N 2 O and NO net production. Just like untreated BCs, NaOH reduced net production of N 2 O and NO while increasing that of N 2. This confirms the importance of altered soil pH for denitrification product stoichiometry. Addition of uncharred <b>cacao</b> <b>shell</b> stimulated denitrification strongly due to availability of labile carbon but only minor effects on the product stoichiometry of denitrification were found, in accordance with its modest effect on soil pH. Our study indicates that stimulation of denitrification was mainly due to increases in labile carbon whereas change in product stoichiometry was mainly due to a change in soil pH...|$|R

40|$|Paper is universal. We {{interact}} with {{it every day}} in a multitude of different forms, and it meets almost {{an infinite number of}} purposes. This exhibition looks to the future. It seeks to explore how paper and print can meet new demands, create new innovations and combine with digital platforms to create new opportunities. It spans re-invention of existing uses and explores new paper products and services. From super-rigid structures, the capacity to insulate against extreme noise or temperatures, combining the physical and digital and creating web-connected capacitive touch pages or smart packaging that links to your mobile phone, Paper Evolutions offers potential paper forms that could emerge in the near and distant future. Provided by both the COST Action Network and the PAPER Breakthroughs exhibition, the 16 exhibits demonstrate a number of themes. These include exploring the physical-digital world and how paper can find a place and offer new value in a digital ecosystem. Examples include packaging that incorporates sensors and unique combinations of paper and audio/ visual media that create novel user experiences or immersive environments. We also present here a strong thread of paper for social good. These include products or prototypes that provide environmental benefit or complement health and wellbeing. We also explore how natural fibres and eco-friendly materials such as <b>cacao</b> <b>shells</b> or biodegradable sensors could be used as or within paper-based products. As you’ll see, some examples span some or all of these themes, some are located firmly within their chosen field. All try to innovate with what is possible. By looking beyond the areas of digital and print alone we stress the relevance of paper fibres {{for a wide range of}} social issues, demonstrating that innovation can come from unexpected (cross-sector) areas. For example, the inclusion of cardboard items are not simply about beautiful design but they emphasize the strength and flexibility of the material and hence the ability to replace commonly used plastic, foam or steel in production chains. This is relevant for engineering and architecture as well as for ICT and the 3 D printing movement.

40|$|Biomass – Integrated {{gasification}} {{fuel cell}} (B – IGFC) systems represent an interesting {{field of research}} due to their high overall efficiency and low emissions. The system studied is composed by a biomass updraft gasifier, a high temperature gas-cleaning unit (GCU) and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The aim of this thesis is the improvement of a B – IGFC system, through higher efficiency and lower costs, by acting mainly on the GCU operating temperature and components. This study is focussed {{on the possibility of}} increase the HCl reactor temperature and reduce the costs of the tar reformer; in order to do so, the downstream SOFC have to tolerate larger concentration of HCl and tar into the syngas stream. The experimental campaign concerned three set of tests in which a Ni-GDC cell was fed with syngas and different concentrations of the contaminants, HCl and tar, separately or together. The model tar chosen was acetic acid, because it is the most abundant species in the updraft gasifier produced gasses. The concentrations (dry basis) tested were 17 – 41 – 82 – 128 g/Nm 3 for tar and 3, 4 – 20 – 50 ppm for hydrogen chloride. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of both contaminants together were examined, testing a constant tar content of 41 g/Nm 3 and an increase concentration of HCl equal to 3, 4 – 20 – 50 ppm. Further objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility of internal acetic acid reforming, evaluate the effect of hydrogen chloride on cell performance and on tar reforming. All the experiments were carried out under a constant current density of 68 mA/cm 2, at about 800 °C and feeding the cell with simulated wet syngas (9, 5 % H 2; 12, 6 % CO; 9, 5 % CO 2; 1, 3 % CH 4; 30, 3 % N 2; 36, 8 % H 2 O). The results revealed that tar injection led to higher immediate cell performance due to internal tar reforming, lower degradation rates and it has been demonstrated that the cell exposed to 128 g/Nm 3 of acetic acid had stable operation, for overall two days of test. Thus, since the cell can internally reform the whole load of tar produced by the updraft gasifier, the tar reformer can be removed from the system. The HCl set of test shown that the tolerance limit in the tested conditions was 3, 4 ppm, indeed, the higher concentrations resulted in voltage drop and higher cell degradation rates. This outcome lead to two possibilities: a) increase the HCl reactor temperature up to 600 °C, which implies higher thermal efficiency and a lower water content in the syngas needed to avoid carbon deposition; or b) remove the HCl clean-up step, but then limiting the choice of the feedstock to biomass with low chlorine content, such as paper residue sludge or <b>cacao</b> <b>shells.</b> In addition, lower H 2 O content into syngas stream means higher cell performance due to the higher fuel concentrations and lower cost, derived for the evaporation of water and the system for the injection of steam. Once the two contaminants were fed together into the SOFC, it was observed positive synergistic effect, which led to lower cell degradation rates in comparison with the set of test with HCl only. In conclusion, the aim of this thesis has been achieved through a redefinition of the tolerance limits for tar and HCl, inside a SOFC, allowing the removal of the external tar reformer and an increase in HCl reactor temperature or the possibility of remove it, when feedstock with low chlorine content are used...|$|E

For example, a typical 25 g baker's chocolate bar would be enough to bring about symptoms in a 20 kg dog. Of course, baking chocolate is rarely consumed directly due to its unpleasant taste, but other dark chocolates' canine toxicities may be extrapolated based on this figure.
