In addition to initialize, the usual constructor {{to create new}} objects, it has two methods: one to override the <=> <b>comparison</b> <b>operator</b> (so Array#sort can sort by age) {{and the other to}} override the to_s method (so Kernel#puts can format its output). Here, attr_reader is an example of metaprogramming in Ruby: attr_accessor defines getter and setter methods of instance variables, but attr_reader only getter methods. The last evaluated statement in a method is its return value, allowing the omission of an explicit return statement.|$|E

5000|$|The {{three-way}} <b>comparison</b> <b>operator</b> for {{numbers is}} spelled [...] in Perl, Ruby, Groovy, PHP and Ceylon, and {{is called the}} spaceship operator because it reminded Randal L.

5000|$|Comparison of programmer-defined {{data types}} (data types {{for which the}} {{programming}} language has no in-built understanding) may {{be carried out by}} custom-written or library functions (such as [...] mentioned above), or, in some languages, by overloading a <b>comparison</b> <b>operator</b> - that is, assigning a programmer-defined meaning that depends on the data types being compared.

50|$|When {{implementing}} a three-way comparison where a three-way <b>comparison</b> <b>operator</b> or method is not already available, {{it is common}} to combine two comparisons, such as A = B and A < B, or A < B and A > B.

25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference between}} atoms and lists was that atoms were immutable and unique.

40|$|All <b>comparison</b> <b>operators</b> {>, ≥, <, ≤, =} are exact. In {{order to}} {{determine}} the sign of a real number x the data type first computes a rational number q such that |x| ≤ q implies x = 0 and then computes an approximation of x of sufficient precision to decide the sign of x. The user may assist the data type by providing a separation bound q.|$|R
5000|$|As an example, an {{ordered set}} (of type [...] ) {{requires}} a total ordering on the elements (of type [...] ) {{in order to}} function. This can be evidenced by a constraint , which defines a <b>comparison</b> <b>operator</b> on the elements. However, there can be numerous ways to impose a total order. Since set algorithms are generally intolerant {{of changes in the}} ordering once a set has been constructed, passing an incompatible instance of [...] to functions that operate on the set may lead to incorrect results (or crashes). Thus, enforcing coherence of [...] in this particular scenario is crucial.|$|E

The problem of optimal location and sizing of capacitor banks for losses reduction and voltage profile flattening in medium voltage (MV) automated distribution systems is a difficult combinatorial constrained optimization problem which is deeply studied in literature. In this paper, the efficiency of the proposed Crowded <b>Comparison</b> <b>Operator,</b> CCO 1, is compared to the efficiency of another Crowded <b>Comparison</b> <b>Operator,</b> CCO 2, whose definition derives from the constraint-domination principle proposed by Deb et al.
