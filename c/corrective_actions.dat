5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} <b>corrective</b> <b>actions.</b> After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E

25|$|A renewed {{interest}} on the site's importance in the 1980s was sparked by the visit to the site by the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1970. This led {{to the protection of}} the complex's remains as a national monument in 1987, through the national heritage legislation. A landscape project over a part of the site and a series of restoration works were initiated in the 1990s. The lack of a formal conservation plan or a methodical archaeological approach have call into question the site's historic authenticity. 2001 was a landmark year for the site. The Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund was established to manage the site directly. Its responsibilities include overseeing the excavations and implementing <b>corrective</b> <b>actions</b> on restorations that were haphazardly done since the 1990s. Among the previous preservation works that are being reversed are the landscape project, the hospital building's roof installation, which unfortunately used modern materials, the use of native lime mortar technique in the reconstruction and maintenance of the remaining stone walls, and devising an archaeological strategy to document finds and discoveries, as well as to safeguard the existing artifacts. The objective of the conservation efforts is for the site to regain its appearance in the 1860s. The site's name was officially changed to Aapravasi Ghat that same year. The name change was not without controversy. Although it was meant to reflect the Hindu Indian majority of indentured laborers, the use of the Hindi translation swept away the myriad of other ethnic and religious populations that also passed through the Immigration Depot.|$|E

Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives (CAAs) appropriate for the closure of <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit (CAU) 322, Areas 1 and 3 Release Sites and Injection Wells, Nevada Test Site, Nevada, under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit 322 consists of three <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Sites (CASs) : 01 - 25 - 01, AST Release (Area 1); 03 - 25 - 03, Mud Plant AST Diesel Release (Area 3); 03 - 20 - 05, Injection Wells (Area 3). <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit 322 is being investigated because existing information on {{the nature and extent}} of potential contamination is insufficient to evaluate and recommend <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives. The investigation of three CASs in CAU 322 will determine if hazardous and/or radioactive constituents are present at concentrations and locations that could potentially pose a threat to human health and the environment. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives in the <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> decision document...|$|R
40|$|This <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Decision Document/Closure Report (CADD/CR) {{has been}} {{prepared}} for <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit (CAU) 410 : Waste Disposal Trenches, Tonopah Test Range, Nevada, {{in accordance with the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit 410 consists of five <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Sites (CASs) : TA- 21 - 003 -TANL; 09 - 21 - 001 -TA 09; TA- 19 - 002 -TAB 2; TA- 21 - 002 -TAAL; and 03 - 19 - 001. The CADD and CR have been combined into one report because no further action is recommended for this CAU. The <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative recommended for CAU 410 is Clean Closure; therefore, no <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> or <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> plan is required. No use restrictions are required to be placed on this CAU because the investigation showed no evidence of remaining soil contamination or remaining debris/waste upon completion of all investigation activities...|$|R
40|$|This <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Decision Document (CADD) {{has been}} {{prepared}} for the Area 9 Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Landfill (<b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit [CAU] 453) {{in accordance with the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) of 1996. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit 453 is located at the Tonopah Test Range (TTR), Nevada, and is comprised of three individual landfill cells located northwest of Area 9. The cells are listed as one <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Site (CAS) 09 - 55 - 001 - 0952. The landfill cells have been designated as: � Cell A 9 - 1 � Cell A 9 - 2 � Cell A 9 - 3 The purpose of this CADD is to identify and provide a rationale for the selection of a recommended <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative for CAU 453. The scope of this CADD consists of the following tasks: � Develop <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> objectives. � Identify <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative screening criteria. � Develop <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives. � Perform detailed and comparative evaluations of the <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives in relation to the <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> objectives and screening criteria. � Recommend and justify a preferred <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative for the CAU. In June and July 1997, a <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> investigation was performed that consisted of activities set forth in the <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Investigation Plan (CAIP) (DOE/NV, 1997). Subsurface investigation of the soils surrounding the cells revealed no contaminants of concern (COCs) above preliminary action levels. The cell contents were not investigated due to the potential for live UXO. Details concerning the analytical and investigation results can be found in Appendix A of this CADD. Based on the potential exposure pathways, the following <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> objectives have been identified for CAU 453 : � Prevent or mitigate human exposure to subsurface soils containing COCs, solid waste, and/or UXO. � Prevent adverse impacts to groundwater quality. Based on the review of existing data, future land use, and current operations at the TTR, the following alternatives have been developed for consideration at the Area 9 UXO Landfill CAU: � Alternative 1 - No Further Action � Alternative 2 - Closure in Place by Administrative Controls � Alternative 3 - Closure in Place by Capping � Alternative 4 - Clean Closure by Removal The <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives were evaluated based on four general <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> standards and five remedy selection decision factors. Based on the results of this evaluation, Alternative 2, Closure in Place by Administrative Controls, was selected as the preferred <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative. The preferred <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative was evaluated on its technical merits, focusing on performance, reliability, feasibility, and safety. The alternative was judged to meet all requirements for the technical components evaluated and to represent the most cost-effective <b>corrective</b> <b>action.</b> The alternative meets all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site and will reduce potential future exposure pathways to the contents of the landfill. During <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> implementation, this alternative will present minimal potential threat to site workers. However, appropriate health and safety procedures will be developed and implemented...|$|R
