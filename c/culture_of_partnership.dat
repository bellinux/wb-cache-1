It was an anomaly among private schools in Washington, D.C., for much of its history because of Mrs. Seldin's then-controversial beliefs about integration, creating a socioeconomically diverse population, and her decision to offer a year-round program and extended hours to serve working parents. Although the name Montessori was rarely used in describing Barrie during those years, the program was heavily influenced by Maria Montessori's philosophy and program, including practical life, integrated learning and project-based collaborative learning, multiple age class groups, and a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> between students, parents, and staff.|$|E

50|$|A power {{structure}} is an overall system of influence relationships between any individual {{and every other}} individual within any selected group of people. A description of a {{power structure}} would capture {{the way in which}} power or authority is distributed between people within groups such as a government, nation, institution, organization, or a society. Such structures are of interest to various fields, including sociology, government, economics, and business. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like fairness or efficiency, as in a hierarchical organization wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a dominance hierarchy in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a dominator culture, the opposite of an egalitarian <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership.</b> A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure {{is often referred to as}} being the Establishment.

The SCS is a 35 -item Likert, and the Likert is ranged from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The survey factored into six dimensions of school culture: Collaborative Leadership, Teacher Collaboration, Professional Development, Unity of Purpose, Collegial Support, and Learning Partnership. The school <b>culture</b> factor <b>of</b> Learning <b>Partnership</b> subscale was found to have a significant linear regression with Math, Reading, and Writing AIMS scores by analyzing the data from 1, 120 teachers from a sample of 56 public elementary schools.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Curriculum and InstructionJeong-Hee KimPrecollege science {{education}} in the United States has virtually always been influenced by university scientists to one degree or another. Partnership models for university scientist – school district collaborations are being advocated to replace outreach models. Although the challenges for such partnerships are well documented, the means of fostering successful and sustainable {{science education}} partnerships are not well studied. This study addresses this need by empirically researching a unique scientist-educator partnership between a university and a school district utilizing case study methods. The development <b>of</b> the <b>partnership,</b> emerging issues, and multiple perspectives of participants were examined {{in order to understand}} the <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>partnership</b> and identify means of fostering successful science education partnerships. The findings show the partnership was based on a strong network of face-to-face relationships that fostered understanding, mutual learning and synergy. Specific processes instituted ensured equity and respect, and created a climate of trust so that an evolving common vision was maintained. The partnership provided synergy and resilience during the recent economic crisis, indicating the value <b>of</b> <b>partnerships</b> when public education institutions must do more with less. High staff turnover, however, especially of a key leader, threatened the partnership, pointing to the importance of maintaining multiple-level integration between institutions. The instrumental roles of a scientist-educator coordinator in bridging cultures and nurturing the collaborative environment are elucidated. Intense and productive collaborations between teams of scientists and educators helped transform leading edge disciplinary science content into school science learning. The innovative programs that resulted not only suggest important roles science education partnerships can play in twenty-first century learning, but they also shed light on the processes of educational innovation itself. Further, the program and curriculum development revealed insights into areas of teaching and learning. Multiple perspectives of participants were considered in this study, with student perspectives demonstrating the critical importance of investigating student views in future studies.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} of the 21 st century for the health-care professionals is to provide care for the ever-expanding population of people with renal-failure. Patient numbers are rising and specialist nurses, who are the pivotal factor in haemodialysis units, are becoming increasingly scarce. In this context it has become essential to understand the dynamics and functioning of haemodialysis units. The aim of this research project is to increase understanding {{of the lives of}} patients and carers by uncovering the <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> haemodialysis units. Ethnography, from the naturalistic paradigm, is a holistic study <b>of</b> <b>culture,</b> developed out <b>of</b> classical philosophy. This study examines the entire social world of the dialysis unit. It describes the ethnographic journey made over twenty-four months' research in two different dialysis units. The participants were amongst patients and carers from these two units. The fieldwork, which facilitated data collection, was based on a participatory process of observation, interviews and participant feedback. These data were analysed into domains and themes using Spradley's Research development sequence (1980) and the reflexive process. Through the theme-based analysis used during the research and writing of this ethnographic study an emergent theory <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> in care became apparent. Such a theory contributes to our understanding <b>of</b> the <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the dialysis unit. Uncovering the <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> dialysis units will not prevent the increase in numbers of people needing Renal Replacement Therapy.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} reforms to fitness to practice procedures, within preparatory programmes for nurses and midwives, and the implications for public and patient protection. Background: Professional regulation has seen considerable reform across all health care professions. Higher Education Institutions providing preparatory programmes are required to demonstrate procedures which ensure students are of good health and character {{in order to ensure}} public safety. Method: A critical review and evaluation of fitness to practice systems, operating in one large school of nursing and midwifery delivering a wide range of programmes, was undertaken using a case study approach. Findings: The review revealed the need for effective collaborative management of fitness to practice panels within achievable timescales and complimentary and responsive communication processes. Good technical support was required to achieve a student friendly, confidential, on-line self-declaration process, with complementary procedures for effective follow-up, to ensure emerging issues were addressed in a timely manner. Conclusion: Public protection and confidence are high priorities. Case studies are vital to develop good practice, but effective systems challenge available resources. The processes reported contributed positively to a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> and transparency where self monitoring becomes inculcated into the students’ behaviour, leading to early recognition of the importance of high professional standards...|$|E

40|$|Background The recent Vision for Sport in Wales (2010) {{encompasses}} a fresh {{approach to the}} delivery of sport in Wales. It prioritises a new partnership approach to sport and physical activity development that brings together the public, private and voluntary sectors. At present, wide scale coordinated partnership approaches remain in their relative infancy. Aim To evaluate the potential efficacy <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> approaches in this context. Methods A qualitative approach was adopted to explore the perceptions and experiences of principal stakeholders (n = 3) within the Welsh sporting system Findings Data analysis revealed a range <b>of</b> perceived <b>partnership</b> advantages including; shared costs / risks, greater coordination and opportunities for learning. Perceived disadvantages included the potential for conflict, lack of clarity and burn-out. Barriers to partnership efficacy included historical issues for example, conflict, lack of trust {{and a lack of}} fit between the Vision and the <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> sport and non-sport organisations. Perceived facilitators included high level commitment to the Vision, local leaders and outcome-led funding. Using the partnership readiness framework it was possible to identify 9 principal factors which highlighted the present strength <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> approaches in sports development.

Demonstrating that war among human beings and between the sexes is not divinely or biologically ordained, and that the ‘masculine’/androcratic model {{is not the only}} social and cultural option we have, the author searches in our past (also archaeological) for instruments to build a better future, a new and different civilisation, able to resist fundamentalisms and barbarity and establish an equitable and peaceful relationship between different ethnicities and genders.

40|$|Title. The use of {{conversational}} analysis: nurse–patient {{interaction in}} communication disability after stroke. Aim. This paper {{is a report}} of a study to explore how nursing staff and patients with aphasia or dysarthria {{communicate with each other}} in natural interactions on a specialist stroke ward. Background. Nursing staff often talk with patients in a functional manner, using minimal social or affective communication. Little nursing research has been carried out with patients who have communication difficulties. Conversational analysis, used in other healthcare settings, is a way to explore these interactions in depth in order to gain further understanding of the communication process. Method. An observational study was carried out in 2005 and the data were 35 · 5 hours of videotape recording and field notes with 14 nursing staff and five patients with aphasia or dysarthria. The recordings were analysed using conversation analysis. Findings. Nursing staff controlled the conversations by controlling the topic and flow of conversations, creating asymmetry in all interactions. Patients had very little input because of taking short turns and responding to closed questions. These behaviours are related to the institutional context in which they occur. Conclusion. In rehabilitation, the focus for interaction may be thought to be patient goals, worries or plans for the future, but in this study nursing staff controlled the conversations around nursing tasks. This may be because {{they do not have the}} confidence to hold conversations with people with communication problems. Nursing staff need to receive training to reinforce communication rehabilitation programmes and to engage more fully with patients in their care, but also that a wider institutional <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> is developed on stroke wards...|$|E
40|$|Background: Understanding and {{promoting}} a positive culture of patient safety within neonatal intensive care units (NICU) has been to shown to decrease threats to patient safety. Parents {{are an integral part}} of the NICU culture, yet little is known about how they perceive patient safety and what role they would find meaningful and appropriate for engaging in safety promotion activities in the NICU. Therefore the purpose of this study was to determine how neonatal parents conceptualize patient safety and their role within the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Methods: Using an ethnographic qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews and field observations of parent interactions within the NICU were conducted from January to November 2014. A purposive sample of twenty-two neonatal parents from a large tertiary NICU was selected for interviews. Data were initially coded according to parent perceptions from interview transcriptions and observed parent interactions. A content analysis of the coded data revealed themes relevant to the study aims. Exemplars of these themes were verified as congruent with the analysis through peer debriefing. Results: A model of parent involvement in NICU patient safety was developed. To neonatal parents, safe care was evidenced by the presence, intention and respect of clinicians and staff in their actions. Patient safety was characterized by adherence to security and infection control procedures, interactions with their baby, and effective communication with parents. Parents saw their role as advocate, caregiver, decisionmaker, learner and guardian in partnership with clinicians to promote safe care. Conclusions: This model of parent involvement could inform practice and further research about patient safety in the NICU. Parents provided valuable insight impacting the assessment and further study of NICU safety culture. Promoting a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> between clinician and parents was integral to parents engaging in actions to promote safe care for their infants...|$|E
