5|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
5|$|The lighter-colored pink zone, {{located on}} the inside of the red zone, {{contains}} a mixture of chiodectonic acid, beta-carotene and <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> dihydrate, the red and white mixture of the chiodectonic acid and the <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> giving rise to the characteristically lighter color.|$|E
5|$|The {{elliptical}} brown-colored flecks, {{which can}} be observed in both the red and pink zones of the thallus, are made of confluentic acid and <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> monohydrate. The monohydrate is thought to be a more chemically stable metabolic byproduct of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> dihydrate; the function of confluentic acid in the brown flecks is unclear.|$|E

This thin (30 – 100  μm) orange-brown layer, rich in <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalates,</b> <b>calcium</b> {{phosphates}} and iron oxides [32] is well-adhered to the marble surface and often encountered on many Classical and Roman monuments.|$|R
30|$|The {{abundant}} calcite {{found in}} plant ashes mostly {{derives from the}} initial thermal decomposition of the intra- and extracellular <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalates</b> whewellite and weddellite that occur in most organs and tissues of plants [18, 19]. Calcium carbonate is found originally in cell walls and as cellular mineral as well, although in smaller amounts than the <b>oxalates</b> [10]. The <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalates</b> have recurrent shapes, the most common being equant to short prismatic crystals, round polycrystalline druses, elongated fibrous crystals known as raphides and styloids, and aggregates of submicrometric crystallites, called crystal sand [10, 19].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to caracterize ergastics {{substances}} in stem of the Socratea exorrhiza (Mart.) H. Wendl., according {{to the point of}} view of the scanning electron microscopy. The histochemical analyses were carried with in natura samples from in the island of the Cumbu, Pará. The lugol was used to evidence the presence of starch grains; phenol crystals to silica; and acid clorídrico 10 % + acid ascetic glacial, to crystals of <b>calcium’s</b> <b>oxalate.</b> The scanning electron microscopy showed triangular, ellipse and ellipsoidal starch grains, over there of <b>calcium’s</b> <b>oxalate</b> and silica crystals...|$|R
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|The kidney {{toxicity}} of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and {{is caused by}} a direct cytotoxic effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to glyoxylic acid and finally to oxalic acid. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The most significant effect is accumulation of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to oliguric or anuric acute kidney failure. The rate-limiting step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid. Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death. When broken down by the body it results in glycolic acid and oxalic acid which cause most of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the ability to perform this test.|$|E

50|$|These woodrats collect {{debris in}} natural crevices, and {{abandoned}} man-made structures when available, into large, quasistructures {{for which the}} archaeologists' term 'midden' has been borrowed. Middens consist of plant material, feces, and other materials which are solidified with crystallized urine. Woodrat urine contains large amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate and <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalates</b> due to the high oxalate content {{of many of the}} succulent plants upon which these animals feed.|$|R
5|$|Most stones form {{due to a}} {{combination}} of genetics and environmental factors. Risk factors include high urine calcium levels, obesity, certain foods, some medications, calcium supplements, hyperparathyroidism, gout and not drinking enough fluids. Stones form in the kidney when minerals in urine are at high concentration. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the ureter), cystolithiasis (in the bladder), or by what they are made of (<b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate,</b> uric acid, struvite, cystine).|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E

50|$|Some oxalates can {{be found}} in nature and the most known {{naturally}} occurring oxalates are whewellite and weddellite, which are <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalates.</b> Magnesium oxalate has been found naturally near Mill of Johnston which is located close to Insch in northeast Scotland. The naturally occurring magnesium oxalate is called glushinskite. The magnesium oxalate was found at the lichen and rock interface on serpentinite. It was found in a creamy white layer which was mixed in with the lichen fungus. A scanning electron micrograph of samples taken showed that the crystals had a pyramidal structure with both curved and striated faces. The size of these crystals ranged from 2 to 5 μm.|$|R
5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely interwoven hyphae (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E
5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E
25|$|Bladder stones or uroliths {{are common}} in dogs. The stones form in the urinary bladder in varying size and numbers {{secondary}} to infection, dietary influences, and genetics. Types of stones include struvite, <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate,</b> urate, cystine, calcium phosphate, and silicate. Struvite and <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> stones {{are by far the}} most common.|$|E
25|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> is {{the most}} common {{component}} of kidney stones. Early investigators isolated oxalic acid from wood-sorrel (Oxalis). Members of the spinach family and the brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts) are high in oxalates, as are sorrel and umbellifers like parsley. Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% oxalic acid, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) contains <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalate</b> crystals. Similarly, the Virginia creeper, a common decorative vine, produces oxalic acid in its berries as well as oxalite crystals in the sap, in the form of raphides. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates.|$|E

30|$|The {{combination}} of results from non-invasive analyses, microscopic observations of marble samples prepared as cross sections, ATR-FTIR and micro-Raman techniques {{indicate that the}} brown colour (under visible illumination) and the strong fluorescence (under UV illumination) of {{the bulk of the}} stone correspond to areas in which <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalates</b> was detected inside the marble. Moreover, this latter information is consistent with the initial FLIM measurements, which suggested changes within the marble below the surface. Therefore, all the results confirmed that the discolouration is not a superficial film, but rather a phenomenon affecting the marble structure.|$|R

The evaluted material consists of an aggregate of analytical results from extracted urinary stones from the Veterinary clinic Vltava, in the period from January 30, 2008 to September 12, 2011. The effect of administration of specialised clinical diets for urolithiasis was evaluated on the basis of case histories of sample patients with proven struvite urolithiasis and an occurence of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalates</b> and urates. The analysed aggregate of laboratory results of tested urinary stones has shown that besides a high incidence of struvite, the frequency of occurence of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxalates</b> increases as well. In this analysis even up to an identical percentage with struvite occurence at 44, 44 % (that is, 24) analysed concrements. A link has been established with overal greater proneness of males to the formation of urinary stones. In the patient group with analysed majority percentage of whewellite, only 12, 5 % of the analysed aggregate were females. Considering the widely varied pedigrees of analysed patients, incidence of urolithiasis is expected with ever greater frequency even in dogs not predisposed by breed and crossbreeds. Specialised clinical diets are employed in the treatment and prevention of certain types of urinary stons with high success rate, which adjust the urine environment and thus reduce the risk of occurence of urinary stones.
