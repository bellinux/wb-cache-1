The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but nothing was to <b>come</b> <b>of</b> it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E

5|$|An {{arrangement}} was negotiated whereby al-Adil was to administer Aleppo {{in the name}} of Saladin's son al-Afdal, while Egypt would be governed by al-Muzaffar Umar {{in the name of}} Saladin's other son Uthman. When the two sons were to <b>come</b> <b>of</b> age they would assume power in the two territories, but if any died, one of Saladin's brothers would take their place. In the summer of 1183, after ravaging eastern Galilee, Saladin's raids there culminated in the Battle of al-Fule in the Jezreel Valley between him and the Crusaders under Guy of Lusignan. The mostly hand-to-hand fighting ended indecisively. The two armies withdrew to a mile from each other and while the Crusaders discussed internal matters, Saladin captured the Golan Plateau, cutting the Crusaders off from their main supplies source. In October 1183 and then on 13 August 1184, Saladin and al-Adil besieged Crusader-held Karak, but were unable to capture it. Afterward, the Ayyubids raided Samaria, burning down Nablus. Saladin returned to Damascus in September 1184 and a relative peace between the Crusader states and the Ayyubid empire subsequently ensued in 1184–1185.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, {{intending}} to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered {{the war against}} Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would <b>come</b> <b>of</b> it and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar's letters home under the title Trusty and Well Beloved, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something {{he had been doing}} more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, Ballad of Ensign Joy, was published later that year.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Brezhnev {{years and}} the lengthy interregnum that followed, the {{generation}} which had <b>come</b> <b>of</b> age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced {{by men and women}} for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would <b>come</b> <b>of</b> age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania. Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.|$|E
5|$|The Blade started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage {{shifted to the}} AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to step in to support the work of the Blade. The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to <b>come</b> <b>of</b> age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade, followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade. In the later part of the century, coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community.|$|E
