50|$|DHL Global Forwarding was {{appointed}} by the Indian government {{to carry out a}} pilot run under the agreement. The first cargo truck {{to take advantage of the}} motor vehicle agreement was flagged off from Kolkata on 1 November 2015. The truck travelled 640 km to reach Agartala via Dhaka. Prior to the signing of the BBIN Motor Vehicle Agreement, the truck would have had to travel 1550 km through Indian territory to reach Agartala. Officials cited this as an example of the time and cost savings that the BBIN Motor Vehicle Agreement would bring. In August 2016, Bangladesh dispatched a truck carrying garments from Dhaka to New Delhi as part of a trial run of the agreement. The truck received an electronic permit to enter Indian territory through an online web-based system. Instead of having to undergo customs clearance and formalities as it would prior to the agreement, the truck was fitted with an electronic seal with a GPS tracking device. The truck was then inspected for <b>custom</b> <b>clearance</b> at New Delhi, rather than at the border.|$|E

Although custom transit indeed safeguards the goods on the way, it actually complicates the <b>custom</b> <b>clearance</b> formalities and increases the transaction cost of the international trade. Therefore, simplifying custom transit procedures could bring benefits to China export business, which contributes to approximately 12...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to develop a rigorous economic geography model for predicting changes in the location of population and industries across regions {{in the process of}} economic integration. The IDE Geographical Simulation Model (IDE-GSM) has been developed for two major objectives: (1) to determine the dynamics of locations of population and industries in East Asia in the long term, and (2) to analyze the impact of specific infrastructure projects on the regional economy at sub-national levels. The basic structure of the IDE-GSM is introduced in this article and accompanied with results of test analyses on the effects of the East West Economic Corridor on regions in Continental South East Asia. Results indicate that border costs appear to play a big role in the location choice of populations and industries, often a more important role than physical infrastructures themselves.

30|$|The strong {{incidence}} on the CPI and the accelerating inflation rates {{moved the}} government to intervene actively. Initially, in March 2005, government carried out a price agreement {{with the private sector}} attempting in vain to curb the price rise; in August, it imposed a minimum slaughter weight for live animals with objective to increase the supply of heavier animals; in November, the target was to restrict foreign sales, elevating export taxes to 15 %, and eliminating the export reimbursements of indirect taxes (5 %). In January 2006, an export registry system (ROE) 1 was created. The government office in charge of administering the system (ONCCA) 2 was given the power to extend an export authorization for each shipment, as a precondition to the <b>custom</b> <b>clearance.</b> Delays and arbitrary objections were later used as means to interfere and discourage operations. Furthermore, in March 2006, beef exports were initially banned for 180  days. Later on, a quantitative restriction policy was implemented, forcing beef packers to export only domestic market surpluses.|$|E
40|$|The {{dry port}} concept {{is based on}} a seaport {{directly}} connected with inland intermodal terminals where shippers can leave and/or collect their goods in intermodal loading units as if directly to the seaport. The seaport and the inland terminals, here denoted dry ports, are connected with high capacity traffic modes, such as rail, rather than only with road. Apart from transhipment that a conventional inland intermodal terminal provides, services like storage, consolidation, depot, maintenance of containers and <b>custom</b> <b>clearance</b> are usually available at dry ports as well. The hypothesis is that a carefully applied dry port concept can shift freight volumes from road to more energy efficient traffic modes that are less harmful to the environment and reduce road congestion in a seaport. The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe the dry port concept and to identify and categorize existing and potential dry ports for the port of Gothenburg, Sweden. The benefits of the dry port implementation are defined from the perspectives of the actors involved such as seaports, rail and road operators, shippers, local authorities and the society as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a unique}} feature of air cargo {{transshipment}} {{data in the}} Northeast Asian region, this paper identifies the critical factors that determine the transshipment route choice. Taking advantage of the variations in the transport characteristics in each origin-destination airports pair, the paper uses a discrete choice model to describe the transshipping route choice decision made by an agent (i. e., freight forwarder, consolidator, and large shipper). The analysis incorporates two major factors, monetary cost (such as line-haul cost and landing fee) and time cost (i. e., aircraft turnaround time, including loading and unloading time, <b>custom</b> <b>clearance</b> time, and expected scheduled delay), along with other controls. The estimation method considers the presence of unobserved attributes, and corrects for resulting endogeneity by use of appropriate instrumental variables. Estimation results find that transshipment volumes are more sensitive to time cost, and that the reduction in aircraft turnaround time by 1 hour would be worth the increase in airport charges by more than $ 1000. Simulation exercises measures the impacts of alternative policy scenarios for a Korean airport, which has recently declared their intention to be a future regional hub in the Northeast Asian region. The results suggest that reducing aircraft turnaround time at the airport be an effective strategy, rather than subsidizing to reduce airport charges...|$|E
