40|$|The final {{most common}} pathway for the {{majority}} of coronary artery disease is occlusion of a coronary vessel. Under normal conditions, antithrombin III (AT III), protein C, and protein S as an active protein C cofactor, are natural anticoagulants (hemostatic control) that balances procoagulant activity (thrombin antithrombin complex balance) to prevent thrombosis. If the condition becomes unbalanced, natural anticoagulants and the procoagulants can lead to thrombosis. Thirty subjects with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were studied for the incidence of antithrombin III (AT III), protein C, and protein S deficiencies, and the result were compare to the control group. Among patients with ACS, the frequency of distribution of AT-III with activity < 75 % were 23, 3 % (7  of 30), and only 6, 7 % (2 of 30) in control subject. No one of the 30 control subject have protein C activity deficient, in ACS with activity < 70 % were 13, 3 % (4 of 30). Fifteen out of the 30 (50 %) control subjects had protein S activity deficiency, while protein S deficiency activity < 70 % was found 73. 3. % (22 out of 30). On linear regression, the deterministic coefficient of AT-III activity deficiency to the development ACS was 13, 25 %, and the deterministic coefficient of protein C activity deficient to the development of ACS was 9, 06 %. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for AT-III <b>without</b> protein S deficiency expected to {{contribute to the development of}} vessel disease was 45 %. On discriminant analysis, protein C activity deficiency posed a risk for ACS of 4, 5 greater than non deficient subjects, and AT-III activity deficiency posed a risk for ACS of 3, 5 times greater than non deficient subjects. On binary logistic regression, protein S activity acted only as a reinforcing factor of AT-III activity deficiency in the development of ACS. Protein C and AT III deficiency can trigger ACS, with determinant coefficients of 9, 06 % and 13, 25 % respectively. Low levels of protein C posed a greater risk of ACS than low levels of AT III. Protein S deficiency was a reinforcing factor on AT-III deficient to development of ACS. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> of AT-III <b>without</b> protein S deficiency expected to give single vessel disease was 45 %, and 9, 5 % for the development of triple vessel disease.

40|$|The ActiGraph {{accelerometer}} {{is commonly}} used to measure physical activity in children. Count <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> are needed when using accelerometer data to determine the time a person spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity. For the GT 3 X accelerometer no <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for young children have been published yet. The aim {{of the current study}} was thus to develop and validate count <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for young children. Thirty-two children aged 5 to 9 years performed four locomotor and four play activities. Activity classification into the light-, moderate- or vigorous-intensity category was based on energy expenditure measurements with indirect calorimetry. Vertical axis as well as vector magnitude <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were determined through receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with the data of two thirds of the study group and validated with the data of the remaining third. The vertical axis <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 133 counts per 5 sec for moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 193 counts for vigorous activity (VPA) corresponding to a metabolic threshold of 5 MET and 233 for VPA corresponding to 6 MET. The vector magnitude <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 246 counts per 5 sec for MVPA, 316 counts for VPA - 5 MET and 381 counts for VPA - 6 MET. When validated, the current <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> generally showed high recognition rates for each category, high sensitivity and specificity values and moderate agreement in terms of the Kappa statistic. These results were similar for vertical axis and vector magnitude <b>cut-off</b> <b>points.</b> The current <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> adequately reflect MVPA and VPA in young children. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>points</b> based on vector magnitude counts did not appear to reflect the intensity categories better than <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> based on vertical axis counts alone...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Waist {{circumference}} (WC) <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> {{specific to}} sub-Saharan Caucasians {{do not exist}} with which to identify metabolic syndrome. Neck circumference (NC), as an additional measure, was previously {{found to be a}} worthy identifier of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the aim was to determine NC and WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to our Caucasian cohort, to confirm baseline <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> and {{to determine whether or not}} WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to this cohort differed from the Joint Interim Statement (JIS) WC guidelines. Design, subjects and setting: A target population study, nested in a prospective cohort, was assessed and included 90 and 96 Caucasian men and women aged 24 - 65 years from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda Municipality District, North West province. Outcomes measures: Anthropometric and fasting biological markers for metabolic syndrome, e. g. systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein, were obtained. Results: <b>Cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were determined with the use of a receiver operating characteristic. With the use of cohortspecific WC cut-offs, metabolic syndrome prevalence did not change. WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 96 cm for men and 88 cm for women. NC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 42 cm and 35 cm, for men and women, respectively. Conclusion: WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to these Caucasians differed to those from the JIS guidelines, but corresponded with the baseline findings of the prospective cohort. From a clinical perspective, we cautiously suggest the application of NC, rather than WC, as an anthropometric measure of metabolic syndrome in women as it was a stronger predictor of metabolic syndrome and is not influenced by menopausal status per se.

40|$|Purpose: Diseases {{characterized}} by a continuous trait can be defined by setting a <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for the disease measure in question, accepting some misclassification. The 97. 5 th percentile is commonly used as a <b>cut-off</b> <b>point.</b> However, {{it is unclear whether}} this percentile is the optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> {{from the point of view}} of risk-factor analysis. The optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for risk-factor analysis can be found with a statistical method that minimizes the effect of misclassification. We applied this method to glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Here, the continuous trait is the cup-disc ratio. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal cup-disc ratio <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for risk-factor analysis in population-based epidemiology. Methods: All participants in the population-based Rotterdam Study underwent intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, assessment of the cup-disc ratio with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) and visual field testing. In the statistical method, the cup-disc ratio (the continuous trait) and the IOP (a major risk factor) were independent variables and glaucomatous visual field loss (the true glaucoma endpoint) the dependent variable in a logistic regression model. The optimal cup-disc ratio <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> was found by minimizing the influence of IOP in this model. Variability of the approach was assessed by using a bootstrap resampling technique. Results: Of 2444 included participants, 93 had glaucomatous visual field loss. The median optimal cup-disc ratio <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> was the 97. 0 th percentile with a 95 % central range from 95. 5 to 98. 5.

40|$|A WHO expert {{consultation}} {{addressed the}} debate about interpretation of recommended body-mass index (BMI) <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for determining overweight and obesity in Asian populations, and considered whether population-specific <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for BMI are necessary. They reviewed scientific evidence that suggests that Asian populations have different associations between BMI, percentage of body fat, and health risks than do European populations. The consultation concluded {{that the proportion of}} Asian people with a high risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is substantial at BMIs lower than the existing WHO <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for overweight (⩾ 25 kg/m 2). However, available data do not necessarily indicate a clear BMI <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for all Asians for overweight or obesity.

The consultation also agreed that the WHO BMI <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> should be retained as international classifications.

40|$|In the literature, {{a variety}} of anthropometric {{indicators}} for abdominal obesity have been suggested. The criteria for their selection vary, {{and they have been}} justified mainly on the basis of being correlated with other risk factors, with morbidity and mortality, or to be predictors of the amount of visceral fat. Many of the studies, however, suffer from methodological limitations: they are based on a small number of subjects, often derived from cross-sectional data, based on indirect measurement of risk, or the indicators are complicated to interpret biologically or difficult to use in a public health context. The literature lacks a systematic evaluation of the proposed indicators taking into account possible differences between genders, age categories and ethnic groups and different diseases and mortality. Similar considerations relate to the <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> based on the indicators of abdominal obesity. The suggested <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for waist-hip ratio have been based on rather arbitrary criteria, and the studies where <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for waist circumference have been suggested have methodological shortcomings as well, such as being based on cross-sectional data and arbitrary <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for other variables. It is also a reason for concern that so far all suggested <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for abdominal obesity have been based on results obtained in Caucasian populations. Moreover, they are based on assessment of risk and their appropriateness in the use of intervention has not been evaluated. Therefore, no consensus about the appropriateness of the different <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> has been reached.

We performed secondary analyses on the Lung Health Study dataset. 4045 smokers aged 35 - 60 years with mild-to-moderate obstructive pulmonary disease were subdivided into categories based on presence or absence of obstruction according to both FEV 1 /FVC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points.</b> Post-bronchodilator FEV 1 decline served as the primary outcome to compare subjects between the categories. 583 (14. 4 %) subjects were nonobstructed and 3230 (79. 8 %) subjects were obstructed according to both FEV 1 /FVC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points.</b> 173 (4. 3 %) subjects were obstructed according to the fixed <b>cut-off</b> <b>point,</b> but not according to the LLN <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> ("discordant" subjects). Mean+/-SE post-bronchodilator FEV 1 decline was 41. 8 +/- 2. 0 mL. year(- 1) in nonobstructed subjects, 43. 8 +/- 3. 8 mL. year(- 1) in discordant subjects and 53. 5 +/- 0. 9 mL. year(- 1) in obstructed subjects (p< 0. 001). Our study showed that FEV 1 decline in subjects deemed obstructed according to a fixed criterion (FEV 1 /FVC < 0. 70), but non-obstructed by a sex- and age-specific criterion (LLN) closely resembles FEV 1 decline in subjects designated as non-obstructed by both criteria. Sex and age should be taken into account when assessing airflow obstruction in middle-aged smokers...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Actionable {{questionnaire}} is an 8 -item tool {{to screen}} patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) for neurogenic bladder problems, identifying {{those patients who}} might benefit from urological referral and bladder-specific treatment. The original scoring yields a total score of 0 to 24 with <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 6. A simplified scoring, yielding a total score of 0 to 8 with <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 3, has been developed in urogynaecological patients, but has not been investigated in MS. Methods: One-hundred-and-forty-one MS patients completed the Actionable on two occasions. We compared the test performance of the simplified scoring with <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 3 with that of <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 2, using the original scoring with <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 6 as a gold standard. The following measures were calculated: True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and Accuracy. The associations between positive test result and urological treatment, and bladder-specific drug treatment were calculated. Results: For <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 3 the outcomes (Test 1, Test 2) were: TP 43. 26 %, 40. 88 %; TN 29. 79 %, 32. 85 %; FP 0. 00 %, 0. 00 %; FN 26. 95 %, 26. 28 %; Sensitivity 0. 62, 0. 61; Specificity 1. 00, 1. 00; PPV 1. 00, 1. 00; NPV 0. 53, 0. 55; Accuracy 0. 73, 0. 74; and for <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 2 : TP 59. 57 %, 59. 85 %; TN 26. 95 %, 31. 39 %; FP 2. 84 %, 1. 46 %; FN 10. 63 %, 7. 30 %; Sensitivity 0. 85, 0. 89; Specificity 0. 90, 0. 96; PPV 0. 95, 0. 98; NPV 0. 72, 0. 81; Accuracy 0. 87, 0. 91. Cut-off 3 completely prevented FP outcomes, but wrongly classified 26 % of the patients as negative (FN). Cut-off 2 reduced the FN to 7 - 10 %, with low FP values (2. 84 - 1. 46 %). With cut-off 2, the percentage of patients screened positive was higher in the Progressive group (75. 00 %) than in the Relapsing Remitting group (56. 25 %) (P = 0. 0331), which {{was not the case}} with cut-off 3. Only a positive test according to the original scoring was associated with both urological treatment (P = 0. 0119) and bladder-specific medication (P = 0. 0328). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in MS patients the simplified Actionable scoring is more accurate with <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 2 than with <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> 3, especially by substantially reducing FN outcomes; and that in MS the original Actionable scoring seems preferable...|$|R
