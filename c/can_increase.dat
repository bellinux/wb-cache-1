5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so. Profits from crops <b>can</b> <b>increase</b> from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option would}} be to {{implement}} fiscal devaluation, based on an idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931. According to this neo-Keynesian logic, policy makers <b>can</b> <b>increase</b> the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employer's social security contributions, while offsetting the loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption (VAT) and pollution, i.e. by pursuing an ecological tax reform.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake {{tends to}} be moist due to the liquid content present in the apple sauce. However, using a chunky-style apple sauce {{can result in a}} cake with less moisture, {{compared}} to using standard apple sauce.

High levels of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones <b>can</b> <b>increase</b> the heart rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.|$|E

5|$|Many {{types of}} {{reinforcement}} <b>can</b> <b>increase</b> wall strength, such as plastic or wire mesh and reinforcing rods of steel or fiberglass or bamboo.

5|$|Other {{potentially}} damaging materials include non-archival quality cardboard, card, paper, {{cotton and}} cork, {{all of which}} give off acidic vapors over time. PVC and polyurethane plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and give off acidic vapors with time.

There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that <b>can</b> <b>increase</b> the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures.
