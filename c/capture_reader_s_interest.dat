40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to describe and present consumer complaint responses through the <b>Reader</b> <b>s</b> Letter column in Kompas. com. In collecting the data, the researcher uses secondary data from documentation of complaints taken from the online version of <b>Reader</b> <b>s</b> Letters of Kompas daily newspaper ([URL] or Kompas. com). A total of 168 complaint letters were analyzed during the period December 2011 to April 2012.

Based on this study, companies in Indonesia seem not to place importance on responding to consumer complaints as less than 2 % of companies were eager to reply to the complaints in the same column of <b>Reader</b> <b>s</b> Letter, and only 6 % of complaints were resolved based on the sample data.

In a play where the notion of moral superiority is as elusive as its protagonists, the character that best engages the reader and informs his/her perception of the play is not a queen or an emperor, but a simple soldier only. Enobarbus is a character who straddles not only the Alexandrian and Roman worlds, but also the realm between play and audience, text and reader. An understanding of him is essential to a thorough critical consideration of Antony and Cleopatra.

This research aims to determine the correlation of the intensity of parent – child communication, the intensity of communication with peer groups, an girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early. The method which is used in this research is the quantitative with positivistic approach. This research used The Reasoned Action Theory and The Reference Group Theory. This research is using non probability samling technique. The population in this research is girls age 10 - 16 in Indramayu district. While the sample is 60 respondens. The data is analyzed with the aid of SPSS aplication with Pearson correlation test. The result of this research indicate there is correlation between the intensity of parent – child communication and girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early with significance value is 0, 001 and Pearson correlation value is - 0, 434. It means the correlation 2 ̆ 7 s power of the intensity of parent – child communication and girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early is medium with not unidirectional. So, if the intensity of parent – child communication is high, then girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early is low. If the intensity of parent – child communication is low, then girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early is high. And also there is correlation between the intensity of communication with peer groups and girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early with significance value is 0, 006 and Pearson correlation value is 0, 353.

During this period, leftists committed 81 percent of the terrorism-related murders of U. S. citizens. In the 1970 s, leftists began targeting U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests,</b> including military personnel. By 1980, the left had killed ten Americans. Although severely crippled following Turkey's 1980 coup, Devrimci Sol-the most prominent group-re-emerged in 1990 and dramatically increased attacks against U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests</b> during the Gulf War, perpetrating 75 percent of all terrorist-related U.

Although devastating Turkish security operations and an internal group schism following the Gulf War drastically reduced the organization's violent activities, the late 1990 s witnessed Devrimci Sol's renewed interest in targeting the U.

The thesis explains leftist development and violence against U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests,</b> suggesting Turkey's rapid modernization and the resulting instability provided fertile ground for the extreme left's emergence. By the 1970 s, following periods of increased political liberalization, the rise of Marxist-Leninist ideology coupled with government intolerance to opposition groups elevated terrorism to the sole perceived avenue of change.

40|$|The authors offer {{evidence}} that U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate policy {{has an important}} influence in the determination of credit spreads on emerging market bonds over U.

Their analysis improves on the existing literature and understanding by addressing the dynamics of market expectations in shaping views on interest rate and monetary policy changes and by recognizing nonlinearities in the link between U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates and emerging market bond spreads, {{as the level of}} interest rates affect the market's perceived probability of default and the solvency of emerging market borrowers.

The nonparametric model exhibits greater out-of-sample forecast accuracy than that of the linear predictors for most U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate series.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{stressed}} the role of movements in U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates and country spreads in driving business cycles in emerging market economies. At the same time, country spreads have been found to respond to changes in both the U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate and domestic conditions in emerging markets. These intricate interrelationships leave open a number of fundamental questions: Do country spreads drive business cycles in emerging countries or vice versa, or both? Do U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates affect emerging countries directly or primarily through their effect on country spreads? This paper addresses these and other related questions using a methodology that combines empirical and theoretical elements. The main findings are: (1) U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate shocks explain about 20 percent of movements in aggregate activity in emerging market economies at business-cycle frequency. (2) Country spread shocks explain about 12 percent of business-cycle movements in emerging economies. (3) About 60 percent of movements in country spreads are explained by country-spread shocks. (4) In response to an increase in U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates, country spreads first fall and then display a large, delayed overshooting; (5) U. S. -interest-rate shocks affect domestic variables mostly through their effects on country spreads. (6) The fact that country spreads respond to business conditions in emerging economies significantly exacerbates aggregate volatility in these countries. (7) The U. S. -interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks identified in this paper are plausible {{in the sense that they}} imply similar business cycles in the context of an empirical VAR model as they do in the context of a theoretical dynamic general equilibrium model of an emerging market economy.
