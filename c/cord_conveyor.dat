It will bring tremendous hazards for coal mine production. Twelve time domain features of joints signals, broken wires signals and abrasion signals for steel <b>cord</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt were extracted with weak magnetic detection system. The algorithm of combining rough set based on information entropy with multi-class SVMν − based on binary tree was proposed to classify the three categories signals. The experiment results show that rough set reduction algorithm based on information entropy can effectively achieve feature reduction and classification speed of multi-class SVMν − classification algorithm based on binary tree can be improved by rough set feature reduction without changing classification accuracy...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the noise of a defect {{electromagnetic}} signal of the steel <b>cord</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt used in coal mines, a new signal noise reduction method by combined use of the improved threshold wavelet and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is proposed. Firstly, the denoising method based on the improved threshold wavelet is applied to reduce the noise of a defect electromagnetic signal obtained by an electromagnetic testing system. Then, the EMD is used to decompose the denoised signal and then the effective Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) is extracted by the dominant eigenvalue strategy. Finally, the signal reconstruction is carried out by utilizing the obtained IMF. In order to verify the proposed noise reduction method, the experiments are carried out in two cases including the defective joint and steel wire rope break. The experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper obtains the higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for the defect electromagnetic signal noise reduction of steel <b>cord</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts...|$|E
40|$|Belt {{conveying}} systems {{operating with}} steel <b>cord</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts are used {{extensively in the}} mining and minerals processing industries to transport bulk material. An accurate analysis of the belt tension distribution {{along the length of}} the system is essential to ensure reliable and efficient operation. An important consideration in the tension analysis is the evaluation of the motion resistances of the system. The motion resistances that occur {{along the length of the}} conveyor are known as the main resistances and, for a horizontal conveyor include the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotational resistance of the idler rolls and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. Generally, the indentation rolling resistance component is the major contributor to the motion resistance of long horizontal belt conveyors. This paper will discuss the development of a pseudo 3 -dimensional viscoelastic finite element analysis to calculate the indentation rolling resistance of steel <b>cord</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts. A unique aspect of this model is the ability to incorporate into the viscoelastic rolling contact problem the influence of the steel cords and the variable rubber properties throughout the thickness of the belt. These parameters play a significant role in determining the contact pressure distribution at the belt and idler roll interface and the apparent bottom cover thickness, and therefore the indentation rolling resistance...|$|E
40|$|Solving {{problems}} {{connected with}} damaging {{a conveyor belt}} at the transfer points is conditioned by knowing laws of this phenomenon. Acquiring the knowledge on this phenomen is possible to be gained either by experimental research or by the numerical model GEM 22, which enables to determine the distribution of stresses and strains in a suitably selected cross-section of a conveyor belt. The paper begins by defining the problem, determining the boundary model conditions and continues by modelling the dynamic force acting on the conveyor belt. In the conclusions of the paper there are given table and graphical results of the numerical modelling aimed at solving the problems connected with the damaging of a conveyor belt. By numerical modelling, {{in this case the}} finite element method, in the given way can be realized the parametric studies with changing values of input parameters, especially: - stretching force, - thickness of cover layers of the conveyor belt and strain properties of the rubber, - parameters of the steel <b>cord</b> of the <b>conveyor</b> belt...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{indentation}} rolling resistance of steel <b>cord</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt and compares the results with those for fabric reinforced conveyor belt. Due to the steel cables imbedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution between the belt and a conveyor idler roll is not uniform. The fluctuating pressure {{means that a}} two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model - which is suitable {{for the analysis of}} fabric belt - cannot be readily applied to the analysis of steel cord belt. To cope with this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor idler. The pressures determined by the finite element analysis are compared with experimental results found with the Tekscan pressure measurement system, and the reaction loads are used in the two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model developed by Wheeler [2]. The results from Wheeler's model are summed to determine an overall indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pseudo {{three dimensional analysis}} to predict the indentation rolling resistance of belt conveyors. Conventional methods used to analyse the indentation rolling resistance problem typically assume a bottom cover of uniform thickness bonded to a rigid substrate with no consideration of the carcass properties. This work aims to analyse {{the influence of the}} carcass construction and configuration for steel <b>cord</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts and predict the influence on the indentation rolling resistance. Due to the presence of steel cords embedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution at the interface between the belt and a conveyor idler roll is not uniform. To solve this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor idler roll. The reaction loads are then used in a two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to determine the indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt. This paper investigates the influence of the conveyor belt carcass and bottom cover properties on the resulting stress distribution throughout the belt and consequently on the indentation rolling resistance. The influence of the steel cord diameter and pitch, applied load, bottom cover thickness and strain rate is investigated. A finite element method is detailed for the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the belt. A range of carcass configurations is investigated and experimental verification of the calculated stress distribution undertaken using a Tekscan™ pressure measurement system...|$|E
