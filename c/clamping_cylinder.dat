40|$|Abstract. Pile {{clamping}} mechanism with hydraulic static pile driver has advantages of convenient for the design, improvement and use. The maximum transmission pile {{driving force of}} pile {{clamping mechanism}} of hydraulic static pile driver was analyzed. The static forces of pile clamping mechanism and prefabricated pile were researched and analyzed. The contact between prefabricated pile and pile clamping jaws under pile driving was investigated. It was revealed that when the force of pile <b>clamping</b> <b>cylinder</b> is small, the contact between prefabricated pile and pile clamping jaws under pile driving can be considered that between the elastic inner cylindrical surface and the axis parallel elastic outer cylindrical surface. When the force of pile <b>clamping</b> <b>cylinder</b> is large, the prefabricated pile contacted with pile clamping jaws under pile driving can be considered the hollow thick-wall cylinder subjected to uniformly distributed external pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for depalletizing and/or picking up pliable flat sack bundles not collected by auxiliary means. The device comprises a gripper unit and a mobile bottom-support part and a <b>clamping</b> <b>cylinder</b> to grip the parts to be raised. The gripper unit has a first holding-down clamp which is lowered onto the parts to be raised, and a second holding-down clamp which is placed form-fitting on the parts lying below. A contact gap is thus created for the bottom support element arranged in the second holding-down clamp and movable relative to the latter. The bottom support element leaves {{the area of the}} second holding-down clamp during the travel movement and supports the parts from below whereby it is in form-fitting contact with the lower parts during the entire travel movement. After the travel movement, a <b>clamping</b> <b>cylinder</b> is placed on the parts to be raised. It grips the parts together with the bottom support element...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} at Linköping University and SAAB Aerostructures, Linköping, and focuses on the automation of flexible fixturing in machining applications. At Linköping University a project called "Koofix" is conducted with support from Strategiska stiftelsen and several manufacturing industries including SAAB Aerostructures. The purpose of this project {{is to develop a}} more cost-effective, flexible, technique for fixation of workpieces during processing and assembly. Fixtures are an important part during the machining process, especially if you process the parts with high accuracy. Today a large number of fixtures are used at SAAB and they would prefer {{to reduce the number of}} fixtures by using flexible fixtures instead. SAAB uses one fixture for each article and this result in a high fixture cost and it also takes time to design and construct a new fixture. There are several advantages with using a flexible fixture such as that you can process workpieces with different length, height and thickness in the same fixture. Bigger workpieces takes time to fasten in the fixture because the machine operator must tighten the clamps by hand. By automating the fixture with for example grippers or <b>clamping</b> <b>cylinders</b> the set time would be reduced because the clamping process is automatic. In this report there is also a mapping of various flexible fixture components such as grippers, <b>clamping</b> <b>cylinders</b> and linear units. These components are quite common today in the processing industry and are also used in fixtures. The idea of flexible components is to provide a more flexible and automated fixture then the currently used at SAAB. These components were also linked to a concept idea and based on this idea, several concepts were sketched. The result of the concept idea was two concepts that were generated in the CAD program CATIA. The first concept uses grippers for the clamping process and for additional flexibility the grippers can also be rotated with rotary actuators. Linear units are used to automatically position the beams to reduce the set time. The second concept uses <b>clamping</b> <b>cylinders</b> and rotary grippers to clamp the workpiece. Beams are positioned by an operator, but linear units could also be used in this concept as well. Finally, the concepts were evaluated according to a method from Ullman with a so called decision matrix. The concept that fulfilled the criteria best was concept 1, which uses grippers and linear units. Another method that was used from Ullman was a QFD (Quality Function Deployment) chart and this chart shows the design requirements that are important and that should be fulfilled. The components that are presented in this report have not been tested. This could be a suggestion in an upcoming work to test these components. For example the pneumatic linear units with passive or active brake could be tested to make sure that the braking force is sufficient...|$|R
40|$|The {{elasticity}} equations {{have been}} solved to an arbitrary {{degree of precision}} for a thick-walled orthotropic cylinder, subject to axisymmetric loading. The theory is directly applicable to a layered composite material where each layer is orthotropic in character. The solution proceeds by representing the deformations of the cylinder wall as a power series in a non-dimensional radial parameter. By introducing a generalized stress resultant and a generalized stiffness for the material, a series of coupled second order differential equations in the coefficients of the deformation series results. These have been solved using a generalized eigenvalue technique for an infinitely long cylinder, a simply held cylinder, and a rigidly <b>clamped</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The solution {{has been shown to}} reduce to standard shell solutions for thin cylinders. A thick-walled filament wound test specimen is also detailed that when fabricated and pressurized, would experimentally verify the refined theory developed...|$|R

40|$|For example, {{when the}} bolted Joint in pipe {{arrangement}} {{is subjected to}} water hammer, its energy is essentially prescribed and the force acted on the bolt is consequently determined, depending {{on the condition of}} the joint. This means that the joints with different allowable energy could be designed even if generated external forces are equal. In this paper, the initial tightening forces (named, “Optimum initial tightening force Fopt") under which the allowable energy in the joint have maximum value are derived for two different types of bolted joint and compared with the experimental results. As the result, obtained conclusions are summarized as follows (1) In the range of low residual pressure on the bearing surfaces, the bolted joint with O-ring (Type 2) can absorb more energy than the joint with thin <b>clamped</b> <b>cylinder</b> (Type 1). (2) In the range that required residual pressure exceeds a certain value, Type 1 is superior to Type 2 in energy absorption.

40|$|Fluid-elastic instabilities arise {{due to the}} {{coupling}} of structural motion and fluid flow. In the specific case of a <b>clamped</b> <b>clamped</b> <b>cylinder</b> in axial flow, it will buckle at a sufficiently high flow velocity and start to flutter at even higher flow velocities. This dynamic behavior is of importance to nuclear reactor core design, undersea pipe lines and devices for energy harvesting. In this contribution, the fluid forces and the dynamics of a flexible clamped-clamped cylinder in turbulent axial flow are computed numerically. In contrast to present analytical approaches, this numerical model does not require to tune parameters for each specific case or to obtain coefficients from experiments. To provide insight in the way viscous fluid forces affect the dynamics of a cylinder in axial flow, fluid forces are computed on rigid inclined cylinders, mimicking the damping force experienced by the same cylinder moving perpendicular to the axial flow. The computations showed the existence of two different flow regimes. Each regime {{gave rise to a}} different lift force behavior, which will also influence the damping of the coupled system. Furthermore it is shown that the inlet turbulence has a non negligible effect on these forces and thus on the dynamics of the cylinder. Next, the dynamics of a flexible <b>cylinder</b> <b>clamped</b> at both ends in axial water flow are computed by means of a methodology developed earlier. The results are successfully compared with dynamics measured in experiments available in literature. Computationally {{it was found that the}} cylinders natural frequency decreases with increasing flow velocity, until it loses stability by buckling. The threshold for buckling is in quantitative agreement with experimental results and weakly nonlinear theory. Above this threshold, the amplitude of the steady deformation increases with increasing flow speed. Eventually, a fluttering motion is predicted, in agreement with experimental results. It is also shown that even a small misalignment (1 degrees- 2 degrees) between the flow and the structure can have a significant impact on the coupled dynamics...|$|R

Using certain dynamic considerations together with the Lagrange multipliers method, this is achieved by suitably coupling a certain number of different normal modes of vibration of the corresponding simply supported cylinder Hence, an approximate solution, which however is practically very close to the exact three-dimensional solution, is finally obtained by appropriately increasing either the number of the coupled vibration modes or the number of fixed circles on a clamped edge...|$|R
50|$|Longer {{and deeper}} dives require a {{greater amount of}} {{breathing}} gas, in turn requiring higher filling pressure, a larger cylinder or multiple cylinders. A large diameter cylinder tends to move the diver's center of mass further from the centreline, making them unbalanced in the water, and a higher pressure cylinder has a similar effect, also reducing the buoyancy of the diver, due to the thicker metal required for strength. Cylinder length is also limited by ergonomic considerations {{in proportion to the}} height of the diver. A single cylinder also presents a critical single point of failure for the breathing gas supply. Multiple-tank configurations include downstream manifolded twins, with a single regulator, independent or separate doubles which are two <b>cylinders</b> <b>clamped</b> to a backplate, but without a manifold, side mount cylinders, or upstream manifolded twins, with two complete regulator sets, which may have an isolation valve.|$|R
