5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its <b>complexity,</b> <b>and</b> uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E

5|$|Beauty Revealed was {{completed}} {{during a period}} of popularity of portrait miniatures, a medium which had been introduced in the United States in the late 18th century. By the time Goodridge completed her self-portrait, miniatures were increasing in <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> vibrance. The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History describes Beauty Revealed as a play on the eye miniatures which were then popular as tokens of affection in England and France, but not common in the US. Such miniatures allowed portraits of loved ones to be carried by their suitors without revealing the sitters' identities.|$|E

It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of <b>complexity,</b> <b>and</b> as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have adapted}} to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social <b>complexity,</b> <b>and</b> unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E

Unto the Locust features heavier, faster and more complex riffs by both Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel, influenced by classical music, and supported by fast and complex drum patterns by Dave McClain. This is also the first Machine Head's record to include blast beats.|$|E

40|$|Klapper [1] {{showed that}} there are binary {{sequences}} of period q 1 (q is a prime power p, p is an odd prime) with the maximal possible linear complexity q when considered as sequences over GF (2), while the sequences have very low linear complexities when considered as sequences over GF (p). This suggests that the binary sequences with high GF (2) linear <b>complexities</b> <b>and</b> low GF (p) linear complexities are note secure in cryptography. In this note we give some simple constructions of the binary sequences with high GF (2) linear <b>complexities</b> <b>and</b> low GF (p) linear complexities. We also prove some lower bounds on the GF (p) linear complexities of binary sequences and a lower bound {{on the number of}} the binary sequences with high GF (2) linear <b>complexities</b> <b>and</b> low GF (p) linear complexities...|$|R
5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem <b>complexity,</b> <b>and</b> a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E
5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{also worked}} {{together}} as executive producers on the animated television series, , {{due to their}} involvement with the live action movies.

He felt that while Prime was sophisticated, there were concerns that it was leaving younger viewers behind because of its <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> intensity.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> order in the natural world.

5|$|The <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> {{scope of}} {{aboriginal}} assimilation and acculturation on Taiwan {{has led to}} three general narratives of Taiwanese ethnic change. The oldest holds that Han migration from Fujian and Guangdong in the 17th century pushed the Plains Aborigines into the mountains, where they became the Highland peoples of today. A more recent view asserts that through widespread intermarriage between Han and aborigines between the 17th and 19th centuries, the aborigines were completely Sinicized. Finally, modern ethnographical and anthropological studies have shown a pattern of cultural shift mutually experienced by both Han and Plains Aborigines, resulting in a hybrid culture. Today people who comprise Taiwan's ethnic Han demonstrate major cultural differences from Han elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the {{requirement}} for a new long-range, high-speed, vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense. In response, the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> difficulties {{of being the first}} tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{designs in}} Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations.

The <b>complexity</b> <b>and</b> variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.|$|E
