50|$|Within the {{numerical}} systems of CNC programming {{it is possible}} for the code generator to assume that the controlled mechanism is always perfectly accurate, or that precision tolerances are identical for all cutting or movement directions. This is not always a true condition of CNC tools. CNC tools with a large amount of mechanical backlash can still be highly precise if the drive or cutting mechanism is only driven so as to apply cutting force from one direction, and all driving systems are pressed tightly together in that one <b>cutting</b> <b>direction.</b> However a CNC device with high backlash and a dull cutting tool can lead to cutter chatter and possible workpiece gouging. Backlash also affects precision of some operations involving axis movement reversals during cutting, such as the milling of a circle, where axis motion is sinusoidal. However, this can be compensated for if the amount of backlash is precisely known by linear encoders or manual measurement.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{multiscale}} simulation study {{was carried out}} in order to gain in-depth understanding of machining mechanism of nanometric cutting of single crystal copper. This study was focused on the effects of crystal orientation and <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> on the attainable machined surface quality. The machining mechanics was analyzed through cutting forces, chip formation morphology, generation and evolution of defects and residual stresses on the machined surface. The simulation results showed that the crystal orientation of the copper material and the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> significantly influenced the deformation mechanism of the workpiece materials during the machining process. Relatively lower cutting forces were experienced while selecting crystal orientation family { 1 1 1 }. Dislocation movements were found to concentrate in front of the cutting chip while cutting on the (1 1 1) surface along the ½ 110 <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> thus, resulting in much smaller damaged layer on the machined surface, compared to other orientations. This crystal orientation and <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> therefore recommended for nanometric cutting of single crystal copper in practical applications. A nano-scratching experiment was performed to validate the above findings...|$|E

The <b>cutting</b> <b>directions</b> of { 110 }< 001 >, { 110 }< 1 - 10 >, and { 111 }< 1 - 10 >, whose minimum UCT is relatively small, have better surface qualities {{compared to the other}} <b>cutting</b> <b>directions.</b> The surface quality gets worse when the UCT is similar as the minimum UCT for <b>cutting</b> <b>directions</b> of { 100 }< 001 > and { 100 }< 011 >. The surface generation quality also relates to the contact length which reflects the interaction of the workpiece and the flank face of cutting edge.|$|R

The <b>cutting</b> <b>directions</b> of { 100 }[*]<[*] 011 >, { 110 }[*]<[*] 001 >, and { 110 }[*]<[*] 1 – 10 [*]>[*]are beneficial to obtain a better surface quality.|$|R

30|$|Similar to {{simulation}} results obtained with <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> of { 100 }< 011 >, dislocations moving along { 111 } planes are not initiated at the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> of { 110 }< 1 - 10 > {{as shown in}} Fig.  6 a. However, a shearing boundary on which different kinds of dislocations such as perfect dislocations, Shockley partial, and stair-rod dislocations initiate and move along it during cutting process. The shearing boundary starts {{at the tip of}} the stagnation region to the free surface with a shearing angle of 27 ° as shown in Fig.  6 b. The displacement vectors of atoms on this boundary also change abruptly. Unlike the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> of { 100 }< 011 >, the chip does not transform to polycrystalline.|$|E
30|$|The {{compression}} strain normal to the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> near {{the cutting edge}} increased with increasing cutting angle, and it remained to some extent as residual strain. On the other hand, the tensile strain normal to the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> induced by the fore-split recovered soon after the cutting. However, the tissue adjacent to the fore-split should have been separated along intercellular layers, which means that those cells might be no longer bonded together.|$|E
30|$|The {{material}} {{characteristics such as}} size effect {{are one of the}} most important factors that could not be neglected in cutting the material at nanoscale. The effects of anisotropic nature of single crystal materials in nano-cutting are investigated employing the molecular dynamics simulation. Results show that the size effect of the plastic deformation is based on different plastic carriers, such as the twin, stacking faults, and dislocations. The minimum uncut chip thickness is dependent on <b>cutting</b> <b>direction,</b> where even a negative value is obtained when the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> is { 110 }< 001 >. It also determines the material deformation and removal mechanism (e.g., shearing, extruding, and rubbing mechanism) with a decrease in uncut chip thickness. When material is deformed by shearing, the primary shearing zone expands from the stagnation point or the tip of stagnation zone. When a material is deformed by extruding and rubbing, the primary deformation zone almost parallels to the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> and expands from the bottom of the cutting edge merging with the tertiary deformation zone. The generated surface quality relates to the crystallographic orientation and the minimum uncut chip thickness. The cutting directions of { 110 }< 001 >, { 110 }< 1 - 10 >, and { 111 }< 1 - 10 >, whose minimum uncut chip thickness is relatively small, have better surface qualities compared to the other <b>cutting</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{classical}} {{example of}} chatter prone machining is the boring operation. Turning under conditions with high vibrations in {{the cutting tool}} deteriorates the surface finish and may cause tool breakage. Severe noise is also {{a consequence of the}} high vibration levels in the boring bar. Active control is one possible solution to the noise and vibration problem in boring operations. In boring operations the boring bar usually have vibration components in both the cutting speed and the <b>cutting</b> depth <b>direction.</b> The introduction of the control force in different angles in between the cutting speed and the <b>cutting</b> depth <b>directions</b> have been investigated. Furthermore, control path estimates produced when the active boring bar was not in contact with the workpiece and during continuous cutting operation are compared. Experimental results indicate that the control force should be introduced in the <b>cutting</b> speed <b>direction.</b> Although the vibrations are controlled in just the <b>cutting</b> speed <b>direction</b> the vibrations in the <b>cutting</b> depth <b>direction</b> are also reduced significantly...|$|R
30|$|The {{variations}} of hardness and Young's modulus of the machining-induced surface with various <b>cutting</b> <b>directions</b> along different crystal orientations are calculated. The hardness of the machining-induced surface along [ī 00] and [ī 01] is 9.25 and 11.16 GPa by Equations  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, respectively, and {{the elastic modulus}} is 117.7 and 126.46 GPa, respectively. The machining-induced surface along [ī 00] has lower hardness than the machining surface cutting along [ī 01] by about − 17.1 %, and the elastic modulus has no significant disparity (about 6.9 %). The comparison demonstrates {{that they are in}} excellent agreement with the anticipation that the cutting force along the different <b>cutting</b> <b>directions</b> on the same surface is not the same. Larger cutting force causes more severe damage in the subsurface, leading to more changes of the properties of the machined surface.|$|R

Samples of the materials were irradiated with different neutron fluences. The Magnetic Barkhausen Emission was measured using stabilised flux mode, i. e., control of the magnetic flux within the sample to compensate for leakage and variations on the flux. The samples were carefully identified according to position and the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> within the steel forging block.

40|$|Cutting-induced {{plasticity}} {{can lead}} to elevated uncertainties in residual stress measurements made by the contour method. In this study plasticity-induced stress errors are numerically evaluated for a benchmark edge-welded beam to understand the underlying mechanism. Welding and cutting are sequentially simulated by finite element models which have been validated by previous experimental results. It is found that a <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> normal to the symmetry plane of the residual stress distribution {{can lead to}} a substantially asymmetrical back-calculated stress distribution, owing to cutting-induced plasticity. In general, the stresses at sample edges are most susceptible to error, particularly when the sample is restrained during cutting. Inadequate clamping (far from the plane of cut) can lead to highly concentrated plastic deformation in local regions, and consequently the back-calculated stresses have exceptionally high values and gradients at these locations. Furthermore, the overall stress distribution is skewed towards the end-of-cut side. Adequate clamping (close to the plane of cut) minimises errors in back-calculated stress which becomes insensitive to the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction.</b> For minimal constraint (i. e. solely preventing rigid body motion), the plastic deformation is relatively smoothly distributed, and an optimal <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> (i. e. cutting from the base material towards the weld region in a direction that falls within the residual stress symmetry plane) is identified by evaluating the magnitude of stress errors. These findings suggest that cutting process information is important for the evaluation of potential plasticity-induced errors in contour method results, and that the <b>cutting</b> <b>direction</b> and clamping strategy can be optimised with an understanding of their effects on plasticity and hence the back-calculated stresses...|$|E

The anisotropic nature of the material which partly determines the stagnation region also influences the side flow due to the different deformation mechanism under the action of the tool edge. At different <b>cutting</b> <b>directions,</b> the size of the side flow has a great difference which would finally affect the machined surface quality.
