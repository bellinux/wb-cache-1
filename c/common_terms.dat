5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier <b>common</b> <b>terms</b> based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E

In culinary terminology, a fruit is usually any sweet-tasting plant part, especially a botanical fruit; a nut is any hard, oily, and shelled plant product; and a vegetable is any savory or less sweet plant product. However, in botany, a fruit is the ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds, a nut {{is a type of}} fruit and not a seed, and a seed is a ripened ovule.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{seems to}} commit two fallacies {{when trying to}} define virtue. He either defines it using some form of the word itself, or he defines it using other words that call for {{definitions}} and explanations themselves. Eventually, Meno is led to confess his shortcomings {{as he tries to}} define the enigmatic term (the Socratic method is the mechanism that brings about this confession). Socrates claims that a definition of virtue must consist of <b>common</b> <b>terms</b> and concepts that are clearly understood by those in the discussion.|$|E
25|$|The IBSA {{economic}} ministers met in New Delhi in March 2005 {{and agreed}} on a mechanism to identify and eliminate non-tariff barriers which impede mutual trade.

It has been decided to promote cooperation in the SME sector. For this purpose, <b>common</b> <b>terms</b> of reference have been developed which can aid in development of this sector.

25|$|The Göktürk rulers {{originated}} from the Ashina clan, who were first attested to 439. The Book of Sui reports {{that in that}} year, on October 18, the Tuoba ruler Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei overthrew Juqu Mujian of the Northern Liang in eastern Gansu, whence 500 Ashina families fled northwest to the Rouran Khaganate {{in the vicinity of}} Gaochang. Peter Benjamin Golden points out the possibility that the khaghans of the Turkic Khaganate, the Ashina, were themselves originally Indo-Europeans (possibly Iranian peoples) who later adopted the Turkic language but continued to use titles from their earlier Indo-European languages. German Turkologist W.-E. Scharlipp points out that many <b>common</b> <b>terms</b> in Turkic are Iranian in origin.|$|E
25|$|According to the OECD, Finland's {{job market}} is the least {{flexible}} of the Nordic countries. Finland increased job market regulation in the 1970s to provide stability to manufacturers. In contrast, during the 1990s, Denmark liberalised its job market, Sweden moved to more decentralised contracts, whereas Finnish trade unions blocked many reforms. Many professions have legally recognized industry-wide contracts that lay down <b>common</b> <b>terms</b> of employment including seniority levels, holiday entitlements, and salary levels, usually {{as part of a}} Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement. Those who favor less centralized labor market policies consider these agreements bureaucratic, inflexible, and along with tax rates, a key contributor to unemployment and distorted prices. Centralized agreements may hinder structural change as there are fewer incentives to acquire better skills, although Finland already enjoys one of the highest skill-levels in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{specificity}} of bird calls {{has been used}} extensively for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams. <b>Common</b> <b>terms</b> in English include words such as quack, chirp and chirrup. These are subject to imagination and vary greatly; a well-known example is the white-throated sparrow's song, given in Canada as O sweet Canada Canada Canada and in New England as Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody (also Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick?). In addition to nonsense words, grammatically correct phrases have been constructed as likenesses of the vocalizations of birds. For example, the barred owl produces a motif which some bird guides describe as Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all? with the emphasis placed on you.|$|E

25|$|An {{effective}} fast bowler {{needs to}} be able to hold a consistent line and length, or in <b>common</b> <b>terms,</b> to be accurate. In this context, line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing. Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler. The faster the bowler, the harder it is to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed can make up for the shortfall. Fast bowlers who also manage to be accurate can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath and South African pace bowler Shaun Pollock.|$|E
25|$|The bending curve isn't easily {{described}} by terms. However, some rod & blank manufacturers try to simplify things towards their customers by describing the bending curve by associating {{them with their}} action. The term fast action is used for rods where only the tip is bending, and slow action for rods bending from tip to butt. In practice, this is misleading, as top-quality rods are very often fast-action rods, bending from tip to butt. While the so-called 'fast-action' rods are stiff rods (with absence of any action) which end in a soft or slow tip section. The construction of a progressive bending, fast action rod is more difficult and more expensive to achieve. <b>Common</b> <b>terms</b> to describe the bending curve or properties which influence the bending curve are: progressive taper/loading/curve/bending/..., fast taper, heavy progressive (notes a bending curve close to progressive, tending to become fast-tapered), tip action (also referred to as 'umbrella'-action), broom-action (which refers to the previously mentioned stiff 'fast action'-rods with soft tip). A parabolic action {{is often used to}} note a progressive bending curve, in fact this term comes from a series of splitcane fly rods built by Pezon & Michel in France since the late 1930s, which had a progressive bending curve. Sometimes the term parabolic is more specific used to note the specific type of progressive bending curve as was found in the Parabolic series.|$|E
