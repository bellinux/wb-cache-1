5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At <b>cruising</b> speeds much slower than maximum speed, {{turbines}} were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines.

5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed to the British Waterways Board on 1 January 1963, {{and for the first}} time in over 100 years, it was managed by an {{organisation}} which was not under railway control. The Transport Act 1968 classified all waterways under the jurisdiction of British Waterways into commercial, <b>cruising</b> and remainder waterways. All of the remaining Shropshire Union network was designated as <b>cruising</b> waterway, with the potential for leisure use. By that time there was little commercial traffic. The branch to the River Dee at Chester had been unused since 1932–34, with the demise of steel traffic from Shotton steelworks to Ellesmere Port, and long distance carrying of tar from Ellesmere Port to the Midlands had ended in 1957–58.|$|E

50|$|A common {{practice}} in the <b>cruise</b> industry in listing <b>cruise</b> ship transfers and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient <b>cruise</b> line of the sale, transfer, or new order.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} {{the relative importance}} of six influential factors in <b>cruise</b> customers’ decision-making process such as: <b>cruise</b> vacation price, <b>cruise</b> duration, distance from the <b>cruise</b> port, itineraries, environmental friendliness of <b>cruise</b> line and <b>cruise</b> online reviews. The decision on which influencing factors to select was made based on the review of literature. The complexity of <b>cruise</b> customers’ decision-making process for these six attributes with several levels was examined with Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) Analysis. CBC was selected due to its realistic approach to purchase decisions, in the form of trade-offs. The online survey collected data anonymously. The survey was distributed through Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk) platform. Only 450 <b>cruise</b> customers, who had experienced a <b>cruise</b> vacation before were eligible to participate in the study. The {{purpose of the study was}} to discover {{the relative importance of}} the influencing factors to gain more insights about <b>cruise</b> customers. The findings of the study showed that online reviews were the most influential attribute for <b>cruise</b> customers in their <b>cruise</b> decision, followed very closely by the environmental friendliness of the <b>cruise</b> line. The next influential factor was the duration of the <b>cruise</b> vacation which was followed by distance from the <b>cruise</b> port, <b>cruise</b> itinerary and <b>cruise</b> vacation price. The best and the worst <b>cruise</b> vacation profile were generated from CBC analysis. The findings of this study provide some insights with regard to <b>cruise</b> customers’ importance about influencing factors when deciding on a <b>cruise</b> vacation...|$|R

40|$|Two-sided {{markets are}} characterised by the {{presence}} of an intermediary and two groups of end-users. In the <b>cruise</b> market, <b>cruise</b> lines may play the role of intermediaries to connect the two end-users, viz. <b>cruise</b> passengers and <b>cruise</b> ports. Our research explored whether the <b>cruise</b> industry can be regarded as a two-sided market, starting with a theoretical modelling. The findings show that <b>cruise</b> lines might be hybrid intermediaries, selling their own ship-based products and services, while offering also a platform to enable the transaction between <b>cruise</b> passengers and <b>cruise</b> ports. This particular business model of a quasi-two-sided market is also reflected in the pricing scheme of <b>cruise</b> industry, whereby <b>cruise</b> ports charge an entry fee from <b>cruise</b> lines and port dues from <b>cruise</b> passengers. We illustrate an empirical analysis {{on the basis of the}} <b>cruise</b> market in Japan, and it provides a preliminary clue that the behaviours of <b>cruise</b> ports and <b>cruise</b> lines are consistent with our theoretical framework. The results are not convincingly significant due to data limitations, hence, the concept of a ‘two-sided market’ in the <b>cruise</b> industry call for further empirical research...|$|R
