50|$|<b>Chromogen</b> is a {{substance}} {{which can be}} readily converted into dye or other coloured compound.

40|$|For the {{chromogenic}} {{visualization of}} immunohistochemical enzymatic reaction products, {{only a limited}} series of different enzymatic activities and <b>chromogens</b> are available. Consequently, combinations of two <b>chromogens</b> for double immunohistochemical staining are even more limited for visual assessment. The recent introduction of spectral imaging allows unmixing of multiple immunohistochemically stained tissue samples for the exclusive observation of colocalization and quantitative measurement of individual staining components. Because unmixing is based on spectral characteristics, multiple immunohistochemistry is no longer dependent on <b>chromogens</b> showing a high visual contrast. Although this allows greater flexibility for combining <b>chromogens</b> in multiple staining applications, it also appears that some <b>chromogens</b> do not have excellent spectral and microscopic properties. The present work {{provides an overview of}} currently applied <b>chromogens</b> for single and multiple immunohistochemistry. (The J Histotechnol 33 (1) : 31 - 40, 2010...|$|R
40|$|Most marine snails of {{the family}} Muricidae produce in the hypobranchial gland a viscous {{secretion}} containing, besides mucus and biologically-active compounds, minute amounts of <b>chromogens.</b> These <b>chromogens</b> develop enzymatically and {{under the influence of}} light and oxygen into a purple pigment known variously as "Tyrian Purple", "Royal Purple" or shellfish purple. In the hypobranchial gland the enzyme purpurase is kept apart from the <b>chromogens,</b> so that no pigments are formed under normal conditions. The <b>chromogens</b> together with the enzyme can be obtained from Plicopurpura pansa (Gould, 1853) by "milking" without harming the animals. Different species of muricids produce different pigments, depending on the number and concentration of different <b>chromogens</b> and on the varying light intensity and oxygen availability during pigment formation. The main pigment obtained from the hypobranchial gland from muricids contains indigoids. The "ink" of P. pansa is mainly 6, 6 ´-dibromindigo with smaller amounts of 6 -bromoindigo and 6, 6 '-dibromoindirubin, similar to that of Murex brandaris...|$|R
40|$|A {{colorimetric}} carbonate {{procedure for}} {{the determination of}} uric acid has been modi-fied to include incubation of serum with uricase to destroy uric acid. Residual non-urate <b>chromogens</b> are subtracted from total <b>chromogens</b> to obtain the concentration of “true ” uric acid. Result obtained by the carbonate and the uricase-carbonate methods were in good agreement. The mean concentration of nonurate <b>chromogens</b> in serum is approximately 2 % of the true uric acid values. Recovery of uric acid added to serum is essentially quantitative. Formaldehyde markedly inhibits uricase activity and interferes with recoveries. The uricase-carbonate method is applicable to hemolytic serum and to serums from patients with uremia or those receiving high doses of salicylate in which excess concentrations of nonurate <b>chromogens</b> may be encountered. C OMPA 1 USON of enzymatic and colorimetric methods of allalysiS for uric acid has revealed the presence of variable amounts of nonurate chromo-gens in serum and urine (1 - 6). The reported collcentrations of these <b>chromogens,</b> expressed as uric acid, are of tile order of 0. 1 - 2. 0 mg. / 100 ml. of serum. Even greater values may be expected in the serum of patients receiving high maintenance doses of salicyiate (7). Efforts to eliminate interfering reducing substances have included preaikaiinizationi of serum (8, 9); alkaline incubation of protein-free filtrates (io); and incubation of untreated serum for 90 mm. at 56 #{ 176 }(ii). The latter technic was claimed to permit specific estimation of uric acid by a carbonate procedure without treatment by uricase. It {{has been suggested that}} a major portion of the nonurate <b>chromogens</b> is ascorbic acid (ii, 12). One objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate further the specificity of the carbonate method for the determination of uric acid in serum...|$|R

40|$|Brief {{reduction}} of bilirubin with dilute sodium amalgam {{was shown to}} give <b>chromogens</b> containing both vinyl and ethylidene beta-substituents. Acid-catalysed rearrangement of these <b>chromogens</b> with bilirubin or mesobilirubin and subsequent dehydrogenation gave a range of new violins containing unconjugated ethylidene and vinyl substitutents. Rearrangements between mesobilirubinogen, bilirubin and mesobilirubin gave dihydrobiliviolins, mesobiliviolins, biliverdins, dihydrobiliverdins and mesobiliverdins of the IIIalpha, IXalpha and XIIIalpha series. In this way 30 compounds were prepared, purified by t. l. c. as dimethyl esters, and characterized by n. m. r., mass and electronic spectroscopy, and by chemical interconversion and degradation...|$|R

50|$|Creatinine must be {{determined}} in plasma or serum and not whole blood because erythrocytes contain considerable amounts of noncreatinine <b>chromogens.</b> To minimize {{the conversion of}} creatine to creatinine, specimens must be as fresh as possible and maintained at pH 7 during storage.|$|R

50|$|Animals are {{incapable}} of making their own carotenoids and thus rely on plants for these pigments. Carotenoproteins are especially common among marine animals. These complexes {{are responsible for the}} various colors (red, purple, blue, green, etc.) to these marine invertebrates for mating rituals and camouflage. There are two main types of carotenoproteins: Type A and Type B. Type A has carotenoids (<b>chromogen)</b> which are stoichiometrically associated with a simple protein (glycoprotein). The second type, Type B, has carotenoids which are associated with a lipo protein and is usually less stable. While Type A is commonly found in the surface (shells and skins) of marine invertebrates, Type B is usually in eggs, ovaries, and blood. The colors and characteristic absorption of these carotenoprotein complexes are based upon the chemical binding of the <b>chromogen</b> and the protein subunits.|$|E
5000|$|... “Not only do albinoes thus {{carry the}} {{determinants}} (genes) for pattern, {{but it has}} been known for some time that they also carry gametically, but never visible somatically, the determinants (genes) for either the ferment (enzyme) or the <b>chromogen</b> (substrate) for one or more colours. L. Cuénot was the first to show this for albino mice.” ...|$|E
25|$|Artifacts such as hemolysis, lipemia, and icteremia {{can also}} affect accuracy. Hemolysis {{releases}} Jaffe-reacting <b>chromogens</b> and therefore will falsely increase results.

50|$|There are {{two general}} methods for the {{measurement}} of urea nitrogen. The diacetyl, or Fearon, reaction develops a yellow <b>chromogen</b> with urea, and this is quantified by photometry. It has been modified for use in autoanalyzers and generally gives relatively accurate results. It still has limited specificity, however, as illustrated by spurious elevations with sulfonylurea compounds, and by colorimetric interference from hemoglobin when whole blood is used.|$|E
50|$|The {{detection}} of glucose by test strips {{is based on}} the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase. This enzyme catalyses the oxidation of glucose by atmospheric oxygen to form D-glucono-δ-lactone and hydrogen peroxide. A second linked reaction, mediated by a peroxidase, catalyses the reaction between the peroxide and a <b>chromogen</b> (a substance that acquires colour after a chemical reaction) to form a coloured compound that indicates the glucose concentration.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{tests for}} blood use the pseudoperoxidase {{activity}} of hemoglobin to catalyze a reaction between the heme component of both hemoglobin and myoglobin and the <b>chromogen</b> tetramethylbenzidine {{to produce and}} oxidized <b>chromogen,</b> which has a green-blue colour. Reagent strip manufacturers incorporate peroxide, and tetramethylbenzidine, into the blood testing area. Two colour charts are provided that correspond to the reactions that occur with hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria and hematuria (RBCs). In the presence of free hemoglobin/myoglobin, uniform colour ranging from a negative yellow through green to a strongly positive green-blue appears on the pad. In contrast, intact red blood cells are lysed {{when they come in}} contact with the pad, and the liberated hemoglobin produces an isolated reaction that results in a speckled pattern on the pad. Reagent strip tests can detect concentrations as low as five red blood cells per microliter; however, care must be taken when comparing these figures with the actual microscopic values, because the absorbent nature of the pad attracts some of urine. The terms trace, small, moderate, and large or trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ are used for reporting.|$|E
40|$|GREAT DEAL OF WORK {{has been}} done in an effort to {{increase}} the accuracy with which the creatinine present in blood can be measured. Until recent years the emphasis has been on increasing the specificity of the picric acid method originally described by Jaff#{ 233 }(1), with im-proved colorimetry (2 - 4), by varying the deproteinizing procedure (5 - 7), or by removing false <b>chromogens</b> (8, 9). The desirability of performing the analyses on plasma in order to eliminate the large quantities of noncreatinine <b>chromogens</b> present in red cells was ap-preciated early and has been recommended as standard practice (10). Methods employing a reactant other than picric acid have offered no special advantage in the past (11, 12), but recently such a method of high specificity has been described by Van Pilsum (13).

40|$|Three {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} visible spectrophotometric methods (A, B, and C) {{have been developed}} for the quantitative estimation of mesalamine in bulk drug and pharmaceutical dosage forms. Methods were based on the formation of colored <b>chromogens,</b> which were measured at 552 nm, 440 nm, and 494 nm, respectively.

50|$|Color is a {{sensation}} caused when white {{light from a}} source such as the sun is reflected off a pigment on the surface. The pigment selectively reflects certain wavelengths of light while absorbing others. A dye {{can be considered as}} a substance that can be fixed to a material that has these properties. The colour it reflects is defined by the structure of the molecule, and particular the parts of the <b>chromogen</b> molecule called the chromophore group.|$|E
5000|$|An {{auxochrome}} (Greek αὐξάνειν auxánein: [...] "to increase" [...] and χρῶμα chrōma: [...] "colour") is a {{group of}} atoms attached to a chromophore which modifies the ability of that chromophore to absorb light. They themselves fail to produce the colour; but when present along with the chromophores in an organic compound intensifies the colour of the <b>chromogen.</b> Examples include the hydroxyl group (-OH), the amino group (-NH2), the aldehyde group (-CHO), and the methyl mercaptan group (-SMe).|$|E
50|$|Digoxigenin (DIG) is a steroid found {{exclusively}} in the flowers and leaves of the plants Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata. It {{is used as a}} molecular probe to detect DNA or RNA. It can easily be attached to nucleotides by chemical modifications. DIG molecules are often linked to uridine nucleotides; DIG-labeled uridine (DIG-U) can then be incorporated into RNA probes via in vitro transcription. Once hybridisation occurs in situ, RNA probes with the incorporated DIG-U can be detected with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. To reveal the hybridised transcripts, alkaline phosphatase can be reacted with a <b>chromogen</b> to produce a coloured precipitate.|$|E

5000|$|Recent advancements in {{modified}} porous nano-crystalline {{films have}} enabled {{the creation of}} electrochromic display. The single substrate display structure consists of several stacked porous layers printed {{on top of each}} other on a substrate modified with a transparent conductor (such as ITO or PEDOT:PSS). Each printed layer has a specific set of functions. A working electrode consists of a positive porous semiconductor (say Titanium Dioxide, [...] ) with adsorbed <b>chromogens</b> (different <b>chromogens</b> for different colors). These <b>chromogens</b> change color by reduction or oxidation. A passivator is used as the negative of the image to improve electrical performance. The insulator layer serves the purpose of increasing the contrast ratio and separating the working electrode electrically from the counter electrode. The counter electrode provides a high capacitance to counterbalances the charge inserted/extracted on the SEG electrode (and maintain overall device charge neutrality). Carbon is an example of charge reservoir film. A conducting carbon layer is typically used as the conductive back contact for the counter electrode. In the last printing step, the porous monolith structure is overprinted with a liquid or polymer-gel electrolyte, dried, and then may be incorporated into various encapsulation or enclosures, depending on the application requirements. Displays are very thin, typically 30 micrometer, or about 1/3 of a human hair. The device can be switched on by applying an electrical potential to the transparent conducting substrate relative to the conductive carbon layer. This causes a reduction of viologen molecules (coloration) to occur inside the working electrode. By reversing the applied potential or providing a discharge path, the device bleaches. A unique feature of the electrochromic monolith is the relatively low voltage (around 1 Volt) needed to color or bleach the viologens. This can be explained by the small over- potentials needed to drive the electrochemical reduction of the surface adsorbed viologens/chromogens.|$|R
50|$|Similar assays allows {{to monitor}} glucose levels in fermentation, bioreactors, and to control glucose in vegetal raw {{material}} and food products. In the glucose oxidase assay, the glucose is first oxidized by glucose oxidase to produce gluconate and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then oxidatively {{coupled with a}} <b>chromogen</b> to produce a colored compound which may be measured spectroscopically. For example, hydrogen peroxide together with 4 amino-antipyrene (4-AAP) and phenol {{in the presence of}} peroxidase yield a red quinoeimine dye that can be measured at 505 nm. The absorbance at 505 nm is proportional to concentration of glucose in the sample.|$|E

5000|$|... “ Before we can {{inquire into}} {{the cause and}} meaning of {{albinism}} {{it will be necessary}} first to consider the nature of pigmentation. It has recently been ascertained that the coloration of certain sponges is due to the interaction of an oxydizing ferment (enzymes), tyrosinase, upon certain colourless chromogenic substances. In 1901, Otto v. Furth and Hugo Schneider showed that a tyrosinase could be obtained from the blood of certain insects, and, acting upon a <b>chromogen</b> present in the blood, converted it into a pigmentary substance of melanin-like nature. Hans Przibram also extracted a tyrosinase from the ink-sac of Sepia, and, causing it to act upon a watery solution of tyrosin, obtained a black pigment. From the blood of Bombyx mori, V. von Ducceshi has also obtained a tyrosinase.|$|E

50|$|Some {{examples}} of substrates used (also known as <b>chromogens)</b> are AEC (3-Amino-9-EthylCarbazole), or DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine). Use {{of one of}} these reagents after exposure to the necessary enzyme (e.g., horseradish peroxidase conjugated to an antibody reagent) produces a positive immunoreaction product. Immunocytochemical visualization of specific antigens of interest can be used when a less specific stain like H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) cannot be used for a diagnosis to be made or to provide additional predictive information regarding treatment (in some cancers, for example).|$|R

Ammonium is also an interferent; if the sample is plasma, care needs to be taken that ammonium heparin has not been used as an anticoagulant.
