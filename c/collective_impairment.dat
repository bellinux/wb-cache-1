40|$|Abstract Mass Health Damage ? the Emergency Medical Service Operating Procedure when in Terrain The {{bachelor}} work {{topic is}} the procedure of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) during the mass health damage. Though it concerns the EMS procedures only, {{we should not}} forget {{the work of the}} other integrated rescue forces, e. g. the Police, and the Firemen squad. The cooperation of these is quite usual during the mass health damage intervention, and good-working emergency system guarantees the effective dealing with the emergency states. For the best dealing though, the emergency medical rescuers are very important to orienteer in the concrete event issues. The theory concerns the complex issues of the mass health damage. At the very beginning, the main terms such as emergency state are defined. A short excursion to the history of the Disaster Medicine proceeds. There we can trace the very first procedures of the pre-hospital care during the war conflicts, and the first aid steps which are still up-to-date in today?s practice. Because of the out-standing significance of the good-working cooperation within the emergency system, the part of the work concerns the emergency system itself. Next chapters deal with the real operating procedures of the EMS at the field of the mass health damage and with the injuries sorting methods. The practice was focused on the mapping of the practical knowledge of the rescuers, concerning the mass health damage. The survey was realized quantitatively, using anonymous questionnaires. The data was collected from February till April 2013. The basic research aggregate for the data-collecting were the members of EMS working at the position of medical rescuer, branch Southern-Bohemian. The research questionnaires were spread electronically, and in pencil-paper form, too. There were 150 questionnaires sent in total, 76, 6 % came back, it means 115 were filled in the proceeding research evaluation. The respondents were informed about the research aim and the rule of anonymity before inquiring. The questionnaires consisted of 20 closed one-choice questions. Questions 1 to 6 were only formal, serving the closer knowledge of the respondent. Questions 7 to 20 were to find about the respondent?s knowledge concerning the issues of the mass health damage. Those we used for the next verifying of the hypothesis. It says that the members of EMS have sufficient knowledge of the mass health damage procedures. The data we gained were subsequently assessed, each question was evaluated separately and the data was put into the graphs and tables. These show bot, the relative and the absolute frequency of gained answers. The defined hypothesis was statistically evaluated using the Chi test. The resulting level of significance rejected the null hypothesis and thus confirmed the hypothesis H 1, which says that awareness of emergency medical services crews on the procedures for <b>collective</b> <b>impairment</b> of health is sufficient. The aim of the bachelor?s work was to map the procedures and knowledge concerning the mass health damage. The respondents were the medical rescuers. This aim was fulfilled. The statistic evaluation of the questioning and the confirmed hypothesis show on the fact, that the medical rescuers have the basic knowledge concerning the mass health damage procedures...|$|E
