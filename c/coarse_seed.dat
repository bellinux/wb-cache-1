40|$|Measurements of Crystal Size Distribution (CSD) within {{industrial}} gibbsite precipitation {{plants are}} difficult and generally not available online. Data from laboratory sampling provides infrequent measurements of CSD {{that is not}} frequent enough for online control purposes. More commonly available physical measurements include temperature and density of individual precipitation vessels, mass flow rates of seed crystals, and feed conditions such as alumina concentration, caustic concentration, and volumetric flow. A neural network based estimator is constructed from data generated from a first principles model of an industrial gibbsite precipitation circuit. The inputs to the estimator include readily available online measurements along with simulated laboratory sampled CSD measurements. The estimator predicts characteristic information about number, surface and mass distributions. The neural network estimator is employed at key locations in a typical industrial gibbsite precipitation circuit to provide estimation of fine seed and <b>coarse</b> <b>seed</b> CSD, final precipitator output CSD, and classified product CSD. These estimations can be readily used in a control scheme that aims to improve plant yield and product CSD...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems in computer vision is point set registration. Point set registration finds use in many important applications and in particular can be {{considered one of the}} crucial stages involved in the reconstruction of models of physical objects and environments from depth sensor data. The problem of globally aligning multiple point sets, representing spatial shape measurements from varying sensor viewpoints, into a common frame of reference is a complex task that is imperative due to the large number of critical functions that accurate and reliable model reconstructions contribute to. In this thesis we focus on improving the quality and feasibility of model and environment reconstruction through the enhancement of multi-view point set registration techniques. The thesis makes the following contributions: First, we demonstrate that employing kernel density estimation to reason about the unknown generating surfaces that range sensors measure allows us to express measurement variability, uncertainty and also to separate the problems of model design and viewpoint alignment optimisation. Our surface estimates define novel view alignment objective functions that inform the registration process. Our surfaces can be estimated from point clouds in a datadriven fashion. Through experiments on a variety of datasets we demonstrate that we have developed a novel and effective solution to the simultaneous multi-view registration problem. We then focus on constructing a distributed computation framework capable of solving generic high-throughput computational problems. We present a novel task-farming model that we call Semi-Synchronised Task Farming (SSTF), capable of modelling and subsequently solving computationally distributable problems that benefit from both independent and dependent distributed components and a level of communication between process elements. We demonstrate that this framework is a novel schema for parallel computer vision algorithms and evaluate the performance to establish computational gains over serial implementations. We couple this framework with an accurate computation-time prediction model to contribute a novel structure appropriate for addressing expensive real-world algorithms with substantial parallel performance and predictable time savings. Finally, we focus on a timely instance of the multi-view registration problem: modern range sensors provide large numbers of viewpoint samples that result in an abundance of depth data information. The ability to utilise this abundance of depth data in a feasible and principled fashion is of importance to many emerging application areas making use of spatial information. We develop novel methodology for the registration of depth measurements acquired from many viewpoints capturing physical object surfaces. By defining registration and alignment quality metrics based on our density estimation framework we construct an optimisation methodology that implicitly considers all viewpoints simultaneously. We use a non-parametric data-driven approach to consider varying object complexity and guide large view-set spatial transform optimisations. By aligning large numbers of partial, arbitrary-pose views we evaluate this strategy quantitatively on large view-set range sensor data where we find that we can improve registration accuracy over existing methods and contribute increased registration robustness to the magnitude of <b>coarse</b> <b>seed</b> alignment. This allows large-scale registration on problem instances exhibiting varying object complexity with the added advantage of massive parallel efficiency...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Ki- 67 is {{a nuclear}} protein that is {{expressed}} at {{all phases of}} the cell cycle except the resting phase. This study is a clinicopathologic observational case report that aims {{to report on the}} cell proliferation rates, as measured by the Ki- 67 antigen, in two enucleated retinoblastoma eyes. METHODS: One unilateral familial (mother with unilateral disease - patient 1) and one unilateral sporadic retinoblastoma (patient 2) patients were submitted to enucleation without previous treatment. The tumor cell proliferation rate was assessed by the Ki- 67 antigen labeling index (stained cells / 100 cells) in five different fields of the tumor. RESULTS: Patient 1 was 23 months old and the tumor was exophytic with associated neovascularization of the iris; patient 2 was 6 years old and the tumor was endophytic with <b>coarse</b> vitreous <b>seeds.</b> Both enucleated eyes presented optic nerve with free surgical margins. Positive Ki- 67 cell index in patient 1 varied from 75 to 90 (MD ± SD: 79. 5 ± 6. 61) and in patient 2 from 38 to 60 (MD ± SD: 46. 6 ± 8. 2). CONCLUSIONS: The familial retinoblastoma, besides the earlier age presentation, showed 45. 8 % more Ki- 67 positive cells than the same stage sporadic one. This proliferation rate may explain the earlier presentation age of the tumor in the inherited disease...|$|R

This study characterizes two coffees from distinct origins and evaluates the influence that several conditions of production and post-harvest technology hold over the final product. The study includes physical and chemical characterization of Fogo Island and East Timor coffees, on a few parameters: weight of 100 grains, grain size, defects, ash, phenols, global acidity, caffeine, trigonelline and chlorogenic acids. It was also evaluated the sensory profile and the effect of roasting on the variation of volume, mass, color, defects, moisture and pH. One can conclude that most of the samples can be classified in the higher categories for exportation due to high mass values (17. 1 to 20. 3 g/ 100 <b>seeds),</b> <b>coarse</b> grains (17 - 20 sieves) and low number of defects. For sensory analysis, it is concluded by PCA that it is related to the physical and chemical characterization, highlighting the correlation between high ash content, low pH and acidic taste...|$|R
40|$|Optimum seeding depth is {{essential}} to attain the maximum production potential of a cultivar. To {{examine the effect of}} various planting depths in coarse and fine aromatic rice under direct seeding, pot and field studies were executed at University of Agriculture, Faisalabad during kharif 2012. Experiment was comprised of two rice cultivars viz., super basmati (fine aromatic rice) and KSK- 133 (coarse rice) which were sown at various seeding depths viz., 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm using randomized complete block design (RCBD) under factorial arrangement of treatments replicated three times. Results indicated that stand establishment attributes were statistically affected by seeding depth. Increasing seeding depth resulted in low performance of all the yield related parameters. At seeding depth of 3 cm, leaf area indices, leaf area duration, crop growth rate, total dry matter accumulation and net assimilation rate of coarse and fine rice were improved. Likewise, significantly higher yield and its related components were recorded, when crop was sown at seeding depth of 3 cm. This treatment furnished kernel yields of 5. 08 and 4. 23 t ha- 1 in coarse and fine aromatic rice, respectively, which were significantly higher than rest of treatments. Furthermore, at same depth kernel quality was also improved in terms of lower number of sterile, opaque and chalky kernels. Nonetheless, Water absorption ratio was also higher in these kernels. As for kernels protein content concerned it was decreased with increasing seeding depth. It is concluded that sowing at seeding depth of 3 cm for direct <b>seeded</b> <b>coarse</b> and fine rice cultivars is beneficial in terms of better stand establishment, normal growth, higher yield and improved quality of rice crop...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Terminaliaivorensis A. Chev. is an {{important}} tropical timber species but poor germination and inadequate silvicultural information are important factors militating against its regeneration. A study {{on the effects of}} four sowing media on germination and early seedling growth of T. ivorensis was assessed at the Forest Nursery of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management University of Port Harcourt Port Harcourt Nigeria. The experiment was arranged in a completely Randomized Design CRD with three replicates. Viable seeds were sown into germination trays filled with four sowing media Topsoil sawdust fine sand and <b>coarse</b> sand. Fifty <b>seeds</b> were sown into each germination tray. Data were collected on germination percentage and early seedling growth parameters involving seedling height collar diameter and monthly leaf production. Analysis of variance was used to analyze the data collected. Means separation were carried out using the Least Significant Difference LSD. The result revealed that germination percentage was significant at 5 level of probability. The highest germination percentage was recorded for treatment B sawdust which had 50. 67 amp 6161717. 90 while treatments A topsoil and D coarse sand had 35. 33 amp 616179. 62 and 30 amp 6161713. 99 respectively. The least was treatment C fine sand which had 22 amp 6161710. 84. There was significant difference at 5 level of probability in seedling height and collar diameter but was not significant in leaf production. The highest mean height was recorded in treatment A topsoil which has 16. 13 amp 616170. 80. Treatments B sawdust D coarse sand C fine sand had 14. 02 amp 616170. 37 7. 75 amp 616170. 47 and 6. 79 amp 616170. 99 respectively. The result showed that the highest diameter growth was recorded for treatment A topsoil which has 4. 13 amp 616170. 53. Treatments D coarse sand B sawdust and C fine sand had 3. 67 amp 616170. 57 3. 47 amp 616170. 48 and 3. 43 amp 616170. 52 respectively. Leaf production in T. ivorensiswas not significant between the treatments. The study has shown that the germination percentage ofT. ivorensis improved significantly with sowing media especially sawdust and topsoil.
