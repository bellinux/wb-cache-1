5|$|Some {{commentators}} noted further influences from {{comic book}} literature. Adams likened Cohle to {{the protagonist of}} Alan Moore's The <b>Courtyard</b> <b>and</b> drew parallels with Grant Morrison's The Invisibles for the show's brief exploration of M-theory with one of Cohle's monologues. ComicsAlliance and New York columnist Abraham Riesman cited Top 10 as {{the inspiration for the}} season finale based on dialogue from the episode's closing scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} originally formed {{part of a}} {{range of}} buildings running {{along the side of the}} outer <b>courtyard,</b> <b>and</b> would have controlled access to the institution, as well as symbolising its power and status. The Anglo-Scottish border was also still dangerous in the 15th century, and many monasteries in the area, like Wetheral, had protective fortifications.|$|E

A sculpture garden surrounds the outside of the Barnett building. Various other pieces are on display inside the museum.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the site}} of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river Tyburn, which still flows below the <b>courtyard</b> <b>and</b> south wing of the palace. Where the river was {{fordable}} (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included Edward the Confessor and his queen consort Edith of Wessex in late Saxon times, and, after the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror. William gave the site to Geoffrey de Mandeville, who bequeathed it to the monks of Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, {{as was the case}} when the buildings were connected by a <b>courtyard</b> <b>and</b> protected by a common fence.|$|E

5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner <b>courtyard</b> <b>and</b> to clear the main house from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E
5|$|Opening onto Rue Saint-Honoré {{with a large}} portal, {{the south}} wing was the hotel's main building; like the east wing, it is well-preserved. To {{the left of the}} portal is an area which {{previously}} served as a stable. The ground floor has a large room opening onto the <b>courtyard</b> <b>and</b> another, smaller room. The first floor consists of three rooms: two small rooms and a garderobe. During the eighteenth century, it was recorded that the top floor had two chambres de bonne.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre is {{slightly}} askew of the Historic Axis (Axe historique), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins {{on the east}} in the Louvre <b>courtyard</b> <b>and</b> runs west along the Champs-Élysées. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the Paris Commune revealed that the Louvre was slightly askew of the Axe despite past appearances to the contrary. The Louvre {{can be reached by}} the Palais Royal– Musée du Louvre Métro or the Louvre-Rivoli stations.|$|E

5|$|A quadrangular castle, Bodiam {{is roughly}} square-shaped. This type of castle, {{with a central}} <b>courtyard</b> <b>and</b> {{buildings}} against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle {{has been described by}} military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E
5|$|As {{they make}} their way to the tower, Nicholai disappears and is presumed dead, while Nemesis corners the {{remaining}} members of the group on the cable car headed to the tower. Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing the car to crash into the tower's main <b>courtyard</b> <b>and</b> separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the T-Virus. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock Tower. Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, {{is relatively small}} and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but {{the expansion of the}} Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the <b>courtyard</b> <b>and</b> to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E
