5|$|The first aerial {{photographs}} {{were taken in}} 1858 by the balloonist Nadar; in 1860 James Wallace Black took the oldest surviving aerial photographs, also from a balloon. As photographic techniques made further progress, {{at the end of}} the 19thcentury some pioneers placed cameras in unmanned flying objects. In the 1880s, Arthur Batut experimented with kite aerial photography. Many others followed him, and high-quality photographs of Boston taken with this method by William Abner Eddy in 1896 became famous. Amedee Denisse equipped a rocket with a <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> parachute in 1888, and Alfred Nobel also used rocket photography in 1897.|$|E

5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had {{seen some of the}} very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important {{he thought it would be}} for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E
5|$|Herb Hunter {{arranged}} {{for a group of}} All-Stars, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Earl Averill, Charlie Gehringer, Jimmie Foxx and Lefty Gomez, to tour Japan playing exhibitions against a Japanese all-star team. Despite the fact that Berg was a mediocre, third-string catcher, he was invited at the last minute to make the trip. Among the items Berg took with him to Japan were a 16-mm Bell & Howell movie <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> letter from MovietoneNews, a New York City newsreel production company with which Berg had contracted to film the sights of his trip. When the team arrived in Japan, he gave a welcome speech in Japanese and also addressed the legislature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> computer to build with children's blocks.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{copyright}} restrictions, {{the access}} to {{the full text of}} this article is only available via subscription. In this paper, we address the problem of internal calibration of <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> inertial measurement unit (IMU). The internal calibration of <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> IMU requires the determination of the relative orientation and displacement between the <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> the IMU. Although the problem of orientation estimation is well studied, and there exists simple algorithms for it, current displacement estimation techniques require very special data collection setups or particular sensor movements. We propose a novel method for estimating the displacement between the <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> IMU. Our method has a very simple data collection step and involves the solution of linear equations only. Experimental results with real data show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

5|$|Mooppanar, {{a wealthy}} {{landowner}} based in Thanjavur, had purchased a Williamson 35 mm <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> printer in England. R. Nataraja Mudaliar, then an automobile dealer in Madras, bought the equipment from {{him at a}} price of less than 2,000. Nataraja Mudaliar developed a passion for moving pictures after watching the films of Dadasaheb Phalke. During the administration of Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, cinematographers from Britain were filming a documentary on him. Nataraja Mudaliar met Stewart Smith, one of the cinematographers {{who worked in the}} documentary, and learned about the basics of photography in film-making through him. This eventually led to Nataraja Mudaliar establishing his production house, India Film Company. He brought together some of his business associates, who invested in the production house, and established South India's first film studio in 1915 on Miller's Road, Purasawalkam, Madras.|$|E
5|$|Peter Jackson {{was nine}} years old when he first saw the 1933 film, and was in tears in front of the TV when Kong slipped off the Empire State Building. At age 12, he {{attempted}} to recreate the film using his parents' Super 8 mm film <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> model of Kong made of wire and rubber with his mother's fur coat for the hair, but eventually gave up on the project. King Kong eventually became his favorite film and was the primary inspiration for his decision to become a filmmaker as a teenager. He read books about the making of King Kong and collected memorabilia, as well as articles from Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson paid tribute to the 1933 film by including Skull Island as the origin of the zombie plague in his 1992 film Braindead.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

25|$|His style {{combined}} {{traditional and}} modern motifs. Alonge took portraits outdoors {{with a large}} format, glass plate <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> locally made studio backdrop. Using kerosene lanterns, he developed the glass plate negatives at night and contact printed the images on gaslight paper. Reading instruction booklets from Kodak and Ilford, he taught himself to mix his own chemicals and use sunlight to develop his prints. In 1940, Alonge began to retouch, sepia tone, and hand-color his photographs. When electricity came to Benin in 1945, {{he was able to}} take studio portraits and develop his photos indoors. Alonge's first camera was a Kodak Brownie; later, he used a Rolleiflex and other 35 mm cameras, and finally high-speed film.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of excavations, {{beginning}} in the early months of 2004, Dr. Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, from UNAM Institute of Geophysics, determined with the help of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and a team of some 20 archaeologists and workers the approximate length of the tunnel and the presence of internal chambers. They scanned the earth under the Ciudadela, returning every afternoon to upload the results to Gómez’s computers. By 2005, the digital map was complete. The archaeologists explored the tunnel with a remote-controlled robot called Tlaloc II-TC, equipped with an infrared <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> laser scanner that generates 3D visualization to perform three dimensional register of the spaces beneath the temple. A small opening in the tunnel wall was made and the scanner captured the first images, 37 meters into the passage.|$|E
