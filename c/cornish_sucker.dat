50|$|Lepadogaster purpurea (Bonnaterre, 1788; <b>Cornish</b> <b>sucker)</b> is one {{of three}} species of Lepadogaster. L. purpurea was once synonymous with Lepadogaster zebrina, but has since been {{classified}} as its own species as L. zebrina has been discovered to be more synonymous with L. lepadogaster. This species of Lepadogaster is found normally off the western coast of Portugal. L. purpurea differs from other Lepadogaster species in that it behaves in a much more passive manner. For example, studies have shown that L. purpurea was less active in its habitat and spent more time inside its shelter rather than interacting with other fish and swimming around. L. purpurea also has different swim patterns than the other Lepadogaster species. L. purpurea generally swims at a much slower pace and doesn't make quick movements like the shore clingfish.|$|E
