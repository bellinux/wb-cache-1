25|$|In 1983 the airport, renamed Belfast International, was {{regularly}} accommodating {{the largest}} civil {{aircraft in service}} and with the installation of new technology was capable of all weather operations. In 1985 passenger numbers reached 1.5 million and BMI went into competition with British Airways on the Heathrow service. Further developments to the terminal occurred throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. A new Executive Aviation Terminal was opened in 1987 and the new <b>cargo</b> <b>centre</b> opened in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Its decline {{really began}} in the 1960s, as {{mechanisation}} and computerisation gradually usurped the bumboat's role in the shipping industry. In September 1983, the government opened a modern, high-tech <b>cargo</b> <b>centre</b> in Pasir Panjang. This led to the rapid demise of Boat Quay's river trade, as the highly mechanised container port replaced the laborious and hazardous lighter system. Therefore, during the mid-1980s, after all the trading companies had moved out and the lighters removed, Boat Quay was devoid of activity, with the river deserted.|$|E
2500|$|Amidst {{the major}} {{consolidation}} of the airline industry, China Southern in April 2000 started dedicated cargo services from Shenzhen using a Boeing 747-200F (which was quickly upgraded to the Boeing 747-400F) wet-leased from Atlas Air. To capitalise on the economic growth of the Pearl River Delta region (which includes Hong Kong), the carrier constructed a dedicated <b>cargo</b> <b>centre</b> in Shenzhen. [...] Successful operations prompted an order for two Boeing 747-400Fs the following year. The airline by now had commenced operations to Sydney and Melbourne.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{original}} main runway 13/31 (which is now 12/30) served the airport well, its alignment (NW-SE) had {{the disadvantage of}} suffering from severe crosswinds, {{and the other two}} minor runways were very short and could not be readily extended, so movements were transferred to a new runway (07/25, which has since become 06/24) in an addition completely outside {{the original}} airfield boundary. This runway, completed in 1977, is [...] in length, and was able to take all modern airliners including Concorde. A new terminal was built alongside the runway to cater for the additional traffic.

50|$|There was a hurried {{examination}} of even more marginal storage sites, {{but the situation}} was overtaken by actual events. By early 1942 German raids were markedly less threatening than anticipated, thus {{the need for the}} additional protection of underground storage was no longer paramount, indeed the sites came to be regarded as expensive white elephants. The method of supply of ammunition was soon changed, with supplies moving directly from the factories to the Forward Ammunition Depots, cutting the underground stores out of the system and relegating them to stores for obsolete stock and chemical weapons, holding points for very large <b>cargoes,</b> and repair <b>centres.</b> Three large new surface sites were also established at Gisburn and Wortley in Yorkshire, and Longparish/Harewood Forest in Hampshire. Longparish was designed to hold 40,000 tons of ammunition and the other sites 25,000 tons each.|$|R
