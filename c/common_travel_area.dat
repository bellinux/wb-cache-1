5|$|Because the UK is {{not part}} of the Schengen Area, and because Belgium and France are not part of the <b>Common</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Area,</b> all Eurostar {{passengers}} must go through border controls.

25|$|The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland {{were the}} only EU members which, prior to the 2004 enlargement, had not signed the Schengen Agreement.

40|$|This chapter’s {{objective}} is to reflect on existing and impending challenges to European Union (EU) public law from both a constitutional and an administrative angle. The background to such an overview is that the EU law has radically changed in the past decades. Next to several Treaty amendments enlarging the scope of EU policies, the EU has grown substantially in size. European administrative law has evolved over time and has become an important factor shaping the reality of policy implementation in the EU. At the same time, EU public law remains complex due to the EU’s ‘variable geometry,’ according to which in some policy areas, such as for example the monetary Union, not all EU Member States participate, whilst in others, such as for example the <b>common</b> visa and <b>travel</b> <b>area,</b> non-EU Member States are involved. In this chapter I argue that the evolving nature of European integration through law has both a constitutional law and administrative law context. Challenges for the future development of quantity as well as quality of policies {{in the area of}} integration arise from both aspects. I will try to outline ten of the, in my view, most pressing challenges...|$|R

The most common clinical manifestations of fly larvae infestation include inflammatory and allergic reactions. Ear, eye and respiratory tract infestations are not uncommon and the human botfly Dermatobia hominis is the most recognised causative organism.

25|$|Prior to post-World War II, {{both states}} {{mutually}} recognised each other's entry visas for foreigners. However, in 1952 changes to UK law rescinded this arrangement.

25|$|Most {{transport}} operators permit {{passengers to}} travel within the <b>Common</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> without a passport, although Ryanair require all passengers {{to carry a}} passport or a national identity card. In 2014 a private member's bill was put before the Irish parliament which proposed to prohibit transport operators from requiring {{the production of a}} passport for travel within the <b>Common</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Area,</b> but it was not passed. Photo ID is required for Irish or British citizens travelling by air at the minimum. The Irish government in October 2015, started issuing passport cards and are the same size as national identity cards from other EU countries, which are accepted by all transport operators but the issuing of a passport card requires the holder to already have a conventional passport book.|$|E

These take place before passengers board the train, so officials from the UK Border Force are stationed in France and Belgium, with their French counterparts stationed in the UK.|$|E

25|$|The UK {{has some}} opt-outs from EU policies. One is the opt-out from the Schengen Area, meaning there are full {{passport}} checks for travellers from other EU countries except the Republic of Ireland, {{which is part}} of the <b>Common</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> (CTA) with the UK. The Scottish government proposed that an independent Scotland should remain outside the Schengen Area and join the CTA, ensuring that no passport controls would be needed at the Anglo-Scottish border. Nicola Sturgeon commented that an independent Scotland would negotiate with the EU to have the same visa arrangements as the UK has.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, five {{member states}} of the then European Economic Community signed the Schengen Agreement on the gradual {{dropping}} of border controls between them. This treaty and the implementation convention of 1990 {{paved the way for}} the creation of the Schengen Area. Implemented in 1995, by 1997 all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Agreement. The Amsterdam Treaty, which was drafted that year, incorporated Schengen into EU law, while giving Ireland and the UK an opt-out permitting them to maintain systematic passport and immigration controls at their frontiers. The wording of the treaty makes Ireland's opt-out from eliminating border controls conditional on the <b>Common</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> being maintained.|$|E
25|$|Ireland and the United Kingdom are {{the only}} parts of the European Union not obliged to join the Schengen free-travel area. The Crown Dependencies, which are outside of the EU, are not members either. Instead, a <b>Common</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> exists between the two states and the Crown Dependencies. The Common Travel Areas is not founded on any formal {{agreement}} between Ireland and the United Kingdom and is not provided for in legislation. Instead, it is an informal arrangement between the states. When the Schengen Area was incorporated into the European Union through the 1992 Amsterdam Treaty, the first formal recognition of the Common Travel areas was made though an annexed protocol exempting their obligations to join.|$|E

Switzerland was subsequently allowed to participate in the same manner in 2008. Liechtenstein joined the Schengen Area on 19 December 2011.

25|$|Today, Irish and British {{citizens}} are accorded equivalent reciprocal rights and entitlements (with {{a small number}} of minor exceptions) and a <b>Common</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> exists between Ireland, United Kingdom, and the Crown Dependencies. The British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference acts as an official forum for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on matters of mutual interest generally, and with respect to Northern Ireland in particular. Two other bodies, the British–Irish Council and the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly act as a forum for discussion between the executives and assemblies, respectively, of the region, including the devolved regions in the UK and the three Crown dependencies. Co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, including the execution of common policies in certain areas, occurs through the North/South Ministerial Council. In 2014, the UK Prime Minister David Cameron, and the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny described {{the relationship between the two}} countries as being at 'an all time high'.|$|E
25|$|According to the Home Office, {{he arrived}} in Britain on 13 March 2002, on a six-month visitor's visa. After its expiry, he applied to stay on as a student, and was granted {{permission}} to remain until 30 June 2003. The Home Office said it had no record of any further correspondence, but added: 'We have seen a copy of Mr Menezes' passport, containing a stamp apparently giving him indefinite leave {{to remain in the}} UK. On investigation, this stamp was not one that was in use by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate on the date given.' This was denied by the family of Menezes; and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw stated that he believed Menezes was living in the UK legally, but had no precise information to confirm this. Immigration records show that Menezes entered the Republic of Ireland from France on 23 April 2005. There are no records to show the exact date that he returned to the UK; however, under the <b>Common</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> system, a foreign citizen entering the UK through the Republic of Ireland has an automatic right to remain for three months. Therefore, Menezes was lawfully in the UK on the day he was killed, even if the stamp in his passport recording indefinite leave to remain had been a forgery.|$|E
