40|$|OBJECTIVE: Comparing {{in human}} semen samples with low initial quality, {{the effects of}} 2 {{techniques}} of cryopreservation and dilution/centrifugation after thawing on the spermatic motility and vitality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semen samples from 15 oligo and/or asthenozoospermic individuals assisted in the infertility sector of a tertiary hospital were obtained through masturbation. The samples were divided into 2 portions of equal volume, and diluted (1 : 1; v/v) with the <b>cryoprotector</b> containing glycerol (Test yolk buffer). One portion was frozen through the technique of liquid nitrogen vapor with static phases (group I - GI), while the other was frozen through a programmable biological freezer with linear speed (Planer, Kryo 10, series III) (group II - GII). The following parameters were assessed before freezing and after thawing: percentage of spermatozoa with progressive motility (Prog%) and percentage of live spermatozoa (Vit%). After defrosting, Prog% was assessed before and after removal of <b>cryoprotector</b> diluent, in different time intervals (zero, 3 h, and 24 h). The statistical analysis has been accomplished by using the non-parametric tests of Wilcoxon and Friedman. RESULTS: There was significant reduction of Prog% and Vit% from before freezing to after defrosting in both groups, I and II (p < 0. 001). Values of Prog% and Vit% were not statistically different between groups, after thawing. It has been observed {{a significant reduction in}} Prog% among portions frozen with the automated technique after dilution and centrifugation for removal of <b>cryoprotector</b> (p = 0. 006). After <b>cryoprotector</b> removal, Prog% has been kept unaltered, in both groups, during the first 3 hours of incubation, although being superior in group I (p = 0, 04). There was a significant decrease in Prog% after 24 hours of incubation, in both groups (p < 0, 01). CONCLUSION: For human semen samples with low initial quality, freezing through vapor technique or through the automated technique showed to be equivalent in regarding recovery of live spermatozoa with progressive motility. The effects of dilution and centrifugation to remove the <b>cryoprotector</b> had a negative impact only in samples frozen through the automated technique. In both techniques, progressive motility is kept constant during the first 3 hours after thawing and removal of the <b>cryoprotector,</b> but is drastically diminished by the end of an incubation period of 24 hours.

40|$|Oocyte {{cryopreservation}} {{has become}} an integral part of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). The aim of our study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of penetrating and non-penetrating <b>cryoprotector</b> agents used in oocyte cryopreservation media. We exposed mature and immature mice oocytes to different concentrations of cryoprotectors (penetrating and non-penetrating). As penetrating cryoprotectors we used glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1, 2 propandiol, in concentrations of 1. 5 moles L - 1, 3 moles L - 1, 5 moles L - 1, 7 moles L - 1. As non-penetrating cryoprotectors we used sucrose, trehalose and Ficoll 70 in concentration of 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. The oocytes were exposed to cryoprotective solutions for 3, 5 and 10 minutes after which were subjected to in vitro fertilization procedure. Our result showed that 15 % non-penetrating cryoprotectors and 3 moles L - 1 penetrating <b>cryoprotector</b> has no effect on in vitro fertilization rates of oocytes, when the exposure time did not exceed 5 minutes. Ficoll 70 cannot be used in controlled freezing of the oocytes since the exposure of oocytes more than 5 minutes is impairing the fertilization process.

40|$|Ice {{formation}} in model biological membranes is studied by SAXS and WAXS {{in the presence}} of cryoprotectors: dimethyl sulfoxide and glycerol. Three types of phospholipid membranes: DPPC, DMPC, DSPC are chosen for the investigation as well-studied model biological membranes. A special cryostat is used for sample cooling from 14. 1 C to - 55. 4 C. The ice formation is only detected by WAXS in binary phospholipid/water and ternary phospholipid/cryoprotector/water systems in the condition of excess solvent.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} these studies was to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} cryoselection of carp sperm of multiple age groups depending on the quality of thawed sperm after modification of the composite cryoprotective medium, which was used for the dilution of native sperm before freezing. Methodology. Coenzyme B 12 (cobamamide), blood plasma of Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio), which was subjected to natural cold-acclimation, and purified protein antifreeze tmAFP isolated from larval mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), which also was subjected to natural cold-acclimation, were sued as modifiers. Findings. The results of the study demonstrated that qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the defrosted sperm, results of the incubation, rearing of embryos and larvae of Nyvky scaled carp (NLC), as well as fish culture parameters of produced young-of-the-year depended from on the composition of cryoprotective medium. The best results were demonstrated for the experimental groups, obtained {{with the use of the}} cryoprotective solution supplemented with purified antifreeze protein tmAFP. The larvae obtained from the sperm cryopreserved with the addition of cryoprotective medium TmAFP had better resistance to dehydration, surpassing the experimental groups obtained from the modifiers of Prussian carp plasma and cobamamide. There is a consolidation in the action of the related extracellular <b>cryoprotectors,</b> which were isolated from the cold-resistant organisms. And carp produced with their used demonstrated better performance during their rearing. The fact can be established that the manifestation of cryoselective effect depends on the integrity of sperm hereditary material and does not depend on the effect of extremely low temperatures on the cell membranes. Originality. There were the first experiments, where Prussian carp plasma and antifreeze protein tmAFP were used as extracellular <b>cryoprotectors.</b> Practical value.

40|$|The study {{provides}} a comprehensive overview on different stabilization techniques for liposomal formulations. The {{selection of the}} appropriate technology for a particular formulation can thereby be based on several considerations.

Another advantage of spraying-based technologies is the possibility to combine the liposome formation step and the drying step within the same process. It {{is a prerequisite for}} the selection of the stabilization technique that the integrity of the liposomes is preserved with the incorporated drug after the process. Spray-drying is related to a thermal stress for the formulation but only for a short time. For heat labile drugs processes with low process temperatures, e. g. freeze-drying, spray freeze-drying, inert-spray drying or supercritical drying are most adequate.

40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) {{are one of the}} most interesting cell types for tissue engineering, cell therapy, basic scientific research, and drug screening. Fast advancement in these areas requires the availability of large amounts of safe and well-characterized hESCs from hESC banks. Therefore, optimized freezing protocols, allowing the cryopreservation of large amounts of hESC without direct contact with liquid nitrogen, need to be established. In this study, 6 different <b>cryoprotector</b> combinations [dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol, and hydroxyethylstarch (HES) ] combined with 2 different application methods were screened with the VUB 01 cell line, to establish a new slow-freezing protocol with high recovery rates and a good expansion capacity. Our best conditions were confirmed in 4 other hESC lines: H 1, H 9, 181, and UGent 2. To our knowledge, this is the first time that HES is evaluated as a <b>cryoprotector</b> for hESCs. The use of 5 % DMSO + 5 % HES combined with a new detachment protocol leads to efficient hESC cryopreservation. This protocol involves treating the hESC colonies with cell dissociation solution, a mild dissociation solution uncommonly used for hESC culture. A recovery ratio ranging from 45. 5 % to 168. 2 % was obtained, and these were significantly different from the other tested conditions (Student's t-test, P < 0. 05).

The D 2 O isotope substitution of H 2 O or partial substitution of water by organic solvents (ethylene glycol, glycerol, propylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide) causes {{the appearance of a}} fast, nanosecond component of P+ reduction, the result of an increased probability of recombination of the primary ion-radical products P+I− → PI. The effect is accompanied by a noticeable slowing down of electron transfer from photoreduced bacteriopheophytin to the primary quinone acceptor QA. The effect of the organic solvents, known as <b>cryoprotectors,</b> is correlated with their degree of hydrophobicity, i. e. the ability to penetrate the RC protein and interact with bound water and protein hydrogen bonds. The conclusion drawn from the data is that the dielectric relaxation processes through which the intermediate energy levels of the carriers in the PIQA system are lowered to levels necessary for the stabilization of the photochemically separated charges proceed with the involvement of protons of the nearest water-protein surrounding of the RC pigments and electron transport cofactors...|$|R

40|$|Cationic solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} (SLNs) {{have recently}} been suggested for non-viral gene delivery as a promising alternative to the liposomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the possibility to obtain re-dispersible cationic SLNs after a freeze-drying process in the absence of lyo- and/or <b>cryoprotectors.</b> The physical-chemical characteristics of cationic SLNs and their ability to bind gene material were investigated before and after the freeze-drying. To perform this study three samples of cationic SLNs, based on stearic acid, Compritol or cetylpalmitate, were prepared and characterized by PCS (photon correlation spectroscopy) and AFM (atomic force microscopy). The results indicated that solely the re-dispersed sample of stearic acid (SLN-SA) became very similar in terms of size and morphology to the fresh prepared sample, although it displayed a sensible reduction of the zeta potential (from 39. 2 to 23. 3 mV). By both the DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) and the ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis) determinations, the reduction of the zeta potential was ascribed to the loss of the cationic lipids from the particle surface due to the rearrangement of the stearic acid lattice after the freeze-drying. Finally, the gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that SLN-SA re-suspended in PBS are unable to complex the DNA, while the SLN-SA re-dispersed in water displayed the same ability to bind DNA as the fresh prepared sample. We can conclude that cationic SLNs, based on stearic acid, retain the ability to complex DNA even after the freeze-drying in the absence of lyo- or cryoprotectors; thus, the powder form of this sample represents an attractive candidate to be investigated as in vivo DNA vector formulation...|$|R

40|$|The work aims {{to provide}} {{evidence}} on the viability of Lactobacillus spp. and a spore form of Bacillus subtilis from nonprocessed bacteria to coated dosage forms (i. e., mini-tablets, pellets, and their coated forms). Lactobacillus spp. were cultivated overnight in MRS broth (10 (9) cfu/mL) and B. subtilis spores were produced on plate count agar (107 cfu/mL) for 2 weeks. Bacteria and spores were freeze-dried in skim milk enriched with glycerol. The cakes were further processed into tablets (2. 5 mm diameter) by direct compression with or without microcrystalline cellulose and inulin. Pellets (1 - 1. 4 mm diameter) were produced by extrusion-spheronization of bacterial and spore suspensions with microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, inulin, and skim milk. Both tablets and pellets were film coated. The properties of the dosage forms, particularly the bacterial viability, were evaluated immediately after production and throughout storage for 6 months at 4 degrees C. The study has shown that for an adequate stabilization of the bacteria a protective matrix (e. g., skim milk) and <b>cryoprotectors</b> (e. g., glycerol) must be present at early stages of bacterial de-hydration. Tabletting had a less deleterious effect (2 log units) on bacteria when compared to pelletization (in some cases 3 log units). Enteric coating (15 %, w/w) of either tablets or pellets {{did not affect the}} viability of the bacteria.

40|$|Iron oxide-containing {{magnetic}} nanoparticles (MNPs) {{have certain}} advantages over currently used contrast agents for tumor imaging by {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) as they offer the possibility of functionalization with ligands and tracers. Functionalized MNPs also {{may be used for}} targeted tumor therapy. In the current study nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) with incorporated hydrophilic (NH 4) 2 Ce(IV) (NO 3) 6 -γ-Fe 2 O 3 particles (CAN maghemite particles) for medical imaging were produced and characterized. For this purpose CAN maghemite particles were incorporated into an rHSA matrix to yield rHSA-NPs. The resulting NPs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, photon correlation spectroscopy, and atomic absorption. The sizes of the manufactured NP were 170 ± 10 nm, and the zeta-potential was - 50 ± 3 mV. The NPs remained stable when stored after lyophilization with sucrose 3 % [w/v] as a <b>cryoprotector.</b> They showed pro-inflammatory properties without cell and animal toxicity in vivo and were highly contrasting in MRI. In conclusion, this report introduces novel rHSA NP with favorable properties containing iron oxide for detection by MRI. status: publishe...|$|E

Firstly, sperm motility rate, motility time, density and spermatocrit were appraised to characterize the sperm quality of the lane snapper. The effect of three extenders with distinct ionic compositions and pH values combined with seven concentrations of <b>cryoprotector</b> dimethylsulfoxide (0; 2. 5; 5. 0; 7. 5; 10. 0; 12. 5 e 15. 0 %), five cooling rates (110, 90, 60, 45 e 30 °C &# 8211;min), nine equilibration time (1; 2, 5; 5; 10; 15; 20; 25; 30 e 60 minutes) e five dilutions ratio (1 : 1; 1 : 3; 1 : 6; 1 : 10 e 1 : 20) on the sperm motility rate and motility time were analyzed.

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} freezing on chondrocytes maintained in culture, aiming {{the establishment of a}} cell bank for future application as heterologous implant. Chondrocytes extracted from joint cartilage of nine healthy New Zealand White rabbits were cultivated and frozen with the <b>cryoprotector</b> 5 % dimethylsulfoxide for six months. Phenotypic and scanning electron microscopy analyses were carried out to identify morphological and functional differences between fresh and thawed cells. After enzymatic digestion, a total of 4. 8 x 10 (5) cells per rabbit were obtained. Fresh chondrocytes showed a high mitotic rate and abundant matrix was present up to 60 days of culture. Loss of phenotypic stability was notable in the thawed chondrocytes, with a low labeling of proteoglycans and weak immunostaining of type II collagen. The present study showed important loss of chondrocyte viability under the freezing conditions. For future in vivo studies of heterologous implant, these results suggests that a high number of cells should be implanted in the host site in order to achieve an adequate number of viable cells. Furthermore, the chondrocytes should be implanted after two weeks of culture, when the highest viability rate is foun...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{conservation}} constitutes {{essential part of}} the general strategy for the conservation and the exchange of genetics resources in the entire world. It offers the possibility to store a great number and variety of samples in a reduced area. It guarantees the sanity of the samples and it increases the exchange of plant materials. Two conservation methods in vitro exist, whose use varies in dependence of the duration that requires the storage; the method of minimum growth is used with more frequency to conserve a little time, while, the cryopreservation guarantees the in vitro conservation for long periods of time. In particular, the cryopreservation has been applied in many species for the conservation of pollen, meristems, apexes, zygotic embryos, somatic embryos and cellular suspensions. Two groups of techniques in the cryopreservation are recognized: the classic techniques based on the partial chemical dehydration and the programmed freezing and the new techniques based on the vitrification that consist on the change from the liquid state to a vitreous denominated intermediate state and that it avoids the formation of glasses of ice responsible for the mechanical damage to the cellular membranes during the freezing. It is known that the membranes of the vegetable cells can be damaged by the action of different biophysical and biochemical factors and they need a special chemical protection during the cycle of freezing-unfreezing with treatments <b>cryoprotectors</b> with substances of a heterogeneous group of compounds that have great affinity for the water and that to certain concentrations they are not toxic. Some basic aspects of plant germplasm in vitro conservation and the main results decribed by the national and international scientific community about in vitro conservation of different plant species are sumarized in this research.

40|$|To direct {{stem cell}} fate, a {{delicate}} control of gene expression through small interference RNA (siRNA) {{is emerging as}} a new and safe promising strategy. In this way, the expression of proteins hindering neuronal commitment may be transiently inhibited thus driving differentiation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which secrete tissue repair factors, possess immunomodulatory properties and may differentiate towards the neuronal lineage, are a promising cell source for cell therapy studies in the central nervous system. To better drive their neuronal commitment the repressor Element- 1 silencing transcription (REST) factor, may be inhibited by siRNA technology. The design of novel nanoparticles (NP) capable of safely delivering nucleic acids is crucial in order to successfully develop this strategy. In this study we developed and characterized two different siRNA NP. On one hand, sorbitan monooleate (Span(®) 80) based NP incorporating the cationic components poly-l-arginine or cationized pullulan, thus allowing the association of siRNA were designed. These NP presented a small size (205 nm) and a negative surface charge (- 38 mV). On the other hand, lipid nanocapsules (LNC) associating polymers with lipids and allowing encapsulation of siRNA complexed with lipoplexes were also developed. Their size was of 82 nm with a positive surface charge of + 7 mV. Both NP could be frozen with appropriate <b>cryoprotectors.</b> Cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency at different siRNA doses were monitored by evaluating REST expression. An inhibition of around 60 % of REST expression was observed with both NP when associating 250 ng/mL of siRNA-REST, as recommended for commercial reagents. Span NP were less toxic for human MSCs than LNCs, but although both NP showed a similar inhibition of REST over time and the induction of neuronal commitment, LNC-siREST induced a higher expression of neuronal markers. Therefore, two different tailored siRNA NP offering great potential for human stem cell differentiation have been developed, encouraging the pursuit of further in vitro and in vivo in studies...|$|R

Posteriormente as aves foram desafiadas com Salmonella Enteritidis, visando determinar a eficácia dos tratamentos em relação à quantidade de bactérias viáveis da microbiota que foi maior aos 90 dias (10, 58 Log 10 UFC/ml), quando as aves foram tratadas com sacarose, e menor aos 290 dias, quando tratadas com glicerol (7, 73 Log 10 UFC/ml). No tempo zero, todas as aves apresentaram Salmonella (100 %) quando tratadas com DMSO e glicerol, com colonização cecal de 4, 9 e 5, 2 Log 10 UFC/g do conteúdo cecal, respectivamente; aos 360 dias nenhuma ave foi infectada, independente do tratamento. A microbiota cecal, independente de tratamento, sempre determinou menor quantidade de S. Enteritidis em qualquer um dos parâmetros pesquisados, quando comparada com a das aves não tratadas. O congelamento em nitrogênio líquido foi eficaz na manutenção da viabilidade da microbiota cecal até 360 dias. One-day-old broiler chicks {{were treated}} with cecal microbiota cultivated under aerobiose conditions, frozen during 90, 200, 290 and 360 days and associated with different <b>cryoprotectors</b> such as sucrose, trehalose, DMSO and glycerol.

The quantity of infected birds was 100 % in 0 time, when the cecal colonization by S. Enteritidis was 4. 9 and 5. 2 log 10 CFU/g of cecal content, respectively treated with DMSO and glycerol. No bird was infected at 360 days, irrespectively of the treatment. In all treatments, the cecal microbiota always determined a lesser quantity of S.
