For this mission, the brigade was assisted by the 479th Field Artillery Brigade, which handled ground exercises. As part of a new training routine, the brigade trained the 34th Infantry Division's aviation units at Fort Rucker, spending a longer time training the unit because it continued to train the brigade as it mobilized and prepared to deploy. Other units trained with the Division, but none through the entire mobilization process. This process used new and never-before-used facilities to streamline training exercises.

40|$|Ferula assa-foetida L. is an {{important}} industrial and medicinal plant of Iran which is mainly distributed in arid and semi-arid areas of Khorasan province in north east of the country. Gum of this plant is widely used in pharmacological industry. This plant is endangered because of more harvesting and unsustainable harvesting methods. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of different cutting methods (conventional, cut of crown part, concave and surface) and <b>times</b> of <b>cutting</b> (5, 10 and 13 times) on gum yield of this species in its wild habitat in Mazar region in Bajistan. The treatments were studied under a factorial experiment which was arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications. Results showed significant differences among <b>cutting</b> methods and <b>times</b> of harvesting. Yield of gum was affected by times of harvesting and the highest yield was obtained in 10 <b>cutting</b> <b>times.</b> The highest and lowest gum yields were obtained in concave method with 10 <b>cutting</b> <b>times</b> (25. 24 g/plant) and superficial method with 5 <b>cutting</b> <b>times</b> (2. 02 g/plant), respectively.

Karoon cultivar was studied during 1995 - 1996 at Ramin Agricultural Research and Educational Center, University of Shahid Chamran, Ahwas, by using a split plot design in randomized complete block with 4 replications. Main plots were assigned to five levels of N fertilizer (45, 90, 135, 180 and 225 kg N/ha) as urea fertilizer and subplots to three cutting times (no cutting, cutting forage at early stem elongation without removing reproductive meristem and cutting forage {{in the middle of}} stem elongation with cut reproductive meristem). The effects of N rates and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> on grain yield were significant. Maximum yield was obtained with 281. 6 g/m 2 when crop plants received 90 kg N/ha and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> at early stem elongation and minimum yield was obtained (158. 2 g/m 2) with 45 kg N/ha and cutting forage in the middle of stem elongation. Interactive effect of levels of N and <b>cutting</b> <b>time</b> on spike number per m 2, grain number in spike and grain weight were significant. Among yield components, spike number and grain weight showed the highest sensitivity to both.
