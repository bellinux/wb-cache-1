40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with clinical studies on a new method of chromo-endoscopy with Brilliant <b>Blue</b> (<b>Food</b> <b>Blue</b> No. <b>1)</b> (abbreviated as BB). In the indirect method, the pretreatment consists of an intramuscular injection of 4 mg of Butropium bromide, followed by the patient swallowing a solution of BB and then a second injection of Butropium, after which an endoscopic examination is performed. In the direct method, the pretreatment consists of an intramuscular injection of Butropium followed by the patient swallowing a pretreatment solution without BB. In the latter method, a 0. 05 % BB solution is sprayed over the gastric mucosa through a cannula during the endoscopic observation. The following conclusions were obtained. Most of the cancerous lesions of the mucosal and submucosal type appeared reddened, whereas most of the bases of benign ulcers and erosions appeared blue. Thus, this method proved to be useful in the differential diagnosis of gastric cancer and benign gastric ulcer or erosion. In addition, its usefulness was enhanced by such features as brightness of viewing, good visualization of the mucosal surface through the dye solution and excellent quality of photographs. The indirect method proved to be superior to the direct method. The optimum concentration of BB dye in the indirect method was 100 mg per 120 ml for the pretreatment solution. BB dye appeared green in solutions containing more than 70 mEq/l of hydrogen ions, both in vitro and in vivo. It appeared green in stomachs with maximal acidity of 98 ± 27 mEq/l (n= 25), and appeared blue in those with maximal acidity of 33 ± 28 mEq/l (n= 13) (p< 0. 005). The above-mentioned amount of BB dye used for this procedure is within the acceptable daily intake determined by WHO in 1969 for BB as food colour...|$|R

40|$|Solubilities of red 153, (3 -[[4 -[[5, 6 (or 6, 7) -dichloro- 2 -benzothiazolyl]azo]phenyl]ethylamino]propanenitrile), an azo compound, and {{disperse}} <b>blue</b> <b>1</b> (1, 4, 5, 8 -tetraaminoantraquinone) in supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} (SC CO(2)) were measured at T = (333. 2 to 393. 2) K over the pressure range (12. 0 to 40. 0) MPa by a flow type apparatus. The solubility of red 153 (0. 985. 10 (- 6) to 37. 2. 10 (- 6)) in the overall region of measurements {{is found to be}} significantly higher than that of disperse <b>blue</b> <b>1</b> (1. 12. 10 (- 7) to 4. 89. 10 (- 7)). The solubility behavior of disperse red 153 follows the general solubility trend displayed by disperse dyes with a crossover pressure at about 20 MPa. On the other hand, <b>blue</b> <b>1,</b> which is a disperse anthraquinone dye, exhibits unexpected behavior not recorded previously there is no crossover pressure at the temperature and pressure ranges studied, and the dye's solubility at T = 333. 2 K practically does not increase with pressure. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous measurements of <b>blue</b> <b>1</b> solubility in SC CO(2) reported in the literature. The experimental data were correlated by using the Soave Redlich Kwong equation of state (EoS) with the one-fluid van der Waals mixing rule, and an acceptable correlation of the solubility data for both dyes was obtained...|$|R
5|$|In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, {{children}} are shown cards {{and asked to}} sort them based on two different dimensions (e.g. by color, such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) simultaneously into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow <b>foods,</b> <b>blue</b> animals and <b>blue</b> <b>foods).</b> This task {{appears to be more}} difficult as research has shown that seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions simultaneously. These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these two dimensions simultaneously. This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven.|$|R

30|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>1</b> {{has been}} clearly {{identified}} as phthalocyanine blue from both its characteristic UV–Vis-NIR reflectance profile [25, 27] and Raman pattern [27] (Fig.  6 a, b). Interestingly, UV–Vis-NIR reflection (Fig.  6 a) and fluorescence (not shown) {{reveal that the}} signals of phthalocyanine blue are always associated {{with the presence of}} ZnO, besides barium sulfate highlighted by FTIR. These findings along with the visual appearance of the <b>blue</b> <b>1</b> paints (as a thick lines originating from the direct application from tube) suggest that the mixture is a commercial formulation rather than an intentional addition/mixture by the artist.|$|R
