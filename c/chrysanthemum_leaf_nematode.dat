50|$|Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Black currant nematode, Chrysanthemum foliar nematode, <b>Chrysanthemum</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>nematode,</b> Chrysanthemum nematode, Chrysanthemum Foliar eelworm) is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode. It {{was first}} scientifically described in 1890 in England. This nematode {{has a wide}} host range. Among the most important species affected are Chrysanthemums and strawberries. A. ritzemabosi is a migratory foliar feeding nematode. It can feed both ectoparasitically and endoparasitically, with the later causing the most significant damage. When adequate moisture is present, this nematode enters the leaves and feeds from inside the tissue. Typical damage is characterized by necrotic zones between the veins of the leaves. Its lifecycle is short; only ten days from egg to mature adult. A single female can lay as many as 3,500 eggs. This pest {{can be difficult to}} control. Host plant resistance, hot water treatments, and predatory mites are recommended.|$|E

An E. chrysanthemi mutant with directed deletions or insertions in genes pehX, pelX, pelA, pelB, pelC, and pelE, which encode exo-poly-α-d-galacturonosidase, exopolygalacturonate lyase, and four isozymes of pectate lyase, respectively, was constructed by the marker exchange of a cloned pehX::TnphoA fragment into E. chrysanthemi CUCPB 5010, a Δ(pelA pelE) Δ(pelB pelC) :: 28 bp Δ(pelX) Δ 4 bp derivative of strain EC 16. This mutant, E. chrysanthemi CUCPB 5012, no longer caused pitting in a standard pectate semisolid agar medium used to detect pectolytic activity in bacteria. Nevertheless, the mutant still macerated leaves of chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium), although with reduced virulence. The mutant was found to produce significant pectate lyase activity in rotting chrysanthemum tissue and in minimal media containing chrysanthemum extracts or cell walls as the sole carbon source. Activity-stained, ultra-thin-layer isoelectric focusing gels revealed the presence in these preparations of several pectate lyase isozymes with pIs ranging from highly acidic to highly alkaline. Sterile culture fluids containing these isozymes were able to macerate <b>chrysanthemum</b> <b>leaf</b> tissue. Unlike the products of the pelA, pelB, pelC, and pelE genes in E. chrysanthemi EC 16, these plant-inducible pectate lyase isozymes were not produced in minimal medium containing pectate.

40|$|Many horticultural crops (food and ornamental) are {{produced}} year-round in greenhouses at high latitudes, where the limited availability of natural sunlight restricts plant production during {{large parts of}} the year. To enable year-round plant production supplemental light is necessary to enhance photosynthesis, the primary process that drives growth and production. It is therefore not surprising that during the last two decades most of the research effort related to light in greenhouse horticulture has been directed towards optimizing the supplemental light use efficiency for photosynthesis, with emphasis on light intensity, duration and since recently also on light quality. For a long time, high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps were the preferred lamps for supplemental lighting. Nowadays, Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are gaining importance, mostly because of their potentially higher energy efficiency. Another important, less-well known attribute of LEDs is the much better possibility to control light quality. Besides the effect on photosynthesis, light quality also influences plant morphological and developmental processes, mostly mediated by a set of blue, red and far-red photoreceptors (i. e., cryptochromes, phototropins and phytochromes). Several of these processes, such as for instance internode and petiole elongation growth and leaf expansion have a direct impact on productivity via plant photosynthesis as mediated by light interception. Light quality can also induce leaf deformations and epinasty, which can negatively influence biomass production via reduced light interception. In ornamental crops, such as <b>chrysanthemum,</b> <b>leaf</b> deformations can have severe negative impact on the final ornamental value. Other important effects of light quality involve the development of stomatal density and the control of stomatal aperture, which both attribute to stomatal conductance and therefore potentially influence productivity, while also the leaf hydraulic resistance is influenced by light quality. This paper will overview some plant morphological and developmental processes that are influenced by light quality and are important for plant production in protected environments...|$|R
50|$|Ultra low volume (ULV) fogging {{machines}} are cold fogging machines that use {{large volumes of}} air at low pressures to transform liquid into droplets that are dispersed into the atmosphere. This type of fogging machine can produce extremely small droplets with diameters ranging from 1-150 µm. ULV {{machines are}} used for applying pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, sterilizers, and disinfectants amongst other chemicals. The size of the droplet is very important as each application has an optimal droplet size. The optimum droplet sizes are between 5 and 20 µm for flying insects, 20 to 40 µm for <b>leaf</b> <b>nematodes</b> and 30 to 50 µm for fungi.Low volume refers to the low volume of carrier fluid that is required with these types of machines. The droplets that are created are of such a small size that less carrier for the formulation is required to cover the required surface area. The best way to {{understand the concept of}} using less formulation to cover a larger surface area {{is to look at the}} mathematical side of the scenario. In the case where the diameter of a droplet is reduced to half its original size then the amount of droplets that can be formed from the same volume of formulation will increase eightfold. If the droplet diameter is reduced to 10 percent of its original size, then the amount of droplets that can be formed will increase a thousandfold. In this way the droplet diameter determines the amount of droplets that will form.|$|R
40|$|Timely {{detection}} of western flower thrips(WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), {{is important to}} help prevent economic damage to crops. Coloured traps are commonly used for thrips monitoring and their efficacy can be markedly improved {{with the addition of}} semiochemicals such as methyl isonicotinate (MI). However, the behavioural response of thrips to these compounds is poorly understood. In leaf / petal disc laboratory experiments the effect of MI on adult female WFT was examined with respect to walking and take-off behaviour. Clean air or air with MI was blown over the leaf / petal discs at an angle of 30 _ via a glass pipette connected to a wash bottle containing a cotton dental roll with or without a defined amount of MI. At airspeeds of 0. 6 – 1. 2 m s) 1 and at doses of 1, 10, 50, 100, and 1000 ll (equivalent to indicative concentrations of 1. 7, 4. 5, 7. 3, 8. 8, and 14. 9 ngMI l) 1 air blown over the leaf discs),WFT spent a greater proportion of time walking on <b>chrysanthemum</b> <b>leaf</b> discs in the presence of MI than the non-attractive thrips compound b-caryophyllene or clean air. Western flower thrips showed a dose-dependent take-off response to the thrips attractant MI, but not to b-caryophyllene (virtually no take-off). At 100 ll of MI (8. 8 ng l) 1 air), WFT spent a greater proportion of time walking on host plant tissue than in clean air, depending on plant disc substrates. Furthermore, WFT took off more often from plant discs exposed to an air current containing MI than from those exposed to clean air. Western flower thrips exposed to MI took off at a similar rate from chrysanthemum leaves, chrysanthemum flower petals, and sweet pepper leaves, but much less readily from bean leaves. The results show that MI stimulates walking and take-off behaviour for adult femaleWFT under these experimental conditions and these responses are dose-dependent and mediated by the host plant. These results are placed in the context of previous research on the behavioural response of thrips to semiochemicals and their implications for thrips pestmanagement are discusse...|$|R

40|$|Chrysanthemum {{chlorotic}} mottle viroid (CChMVd, genus Pelamoviroid, family Avsunviroidae) {{has been}} reported to infect chrysanthemum (Dendranthema x grandiflorum). CChMVd was first reported in 1967 in the cultivar Yellow Delaware in New York State, USA (Dimock et al. 1971). Presence of CChMVd has previously been recorded, based on the symptoms and bioassay, in India (Singh et al. 1978). Karnataka State of India is the prominent chrysanthemum-growing region, with 19, 161 ha cultivated under this crop and accounting for more than 40 % of country’s flower production. During late summer 2010 (May and June), chrysanthemum leaves with yellow-green mottling and chlorotic spots were noted, indicating the possible association with CChMVd in Karnataka. Total RNA was extracted using a 2 % CTAB buffer from leaf samples of symptomatic plants (Adkar-Purushothama et al. 2013). For the detection of CChMVd, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using PIII/PIV as described previously (De la Peña et al. 1999). PCR products of the expected sizes (∼ 398 to 401 bp) were cloned and sequenced. BLAST analysis of the obtained sequences confirmed the presence of CChMVd in Karnataka. In order to estimate the incidence of CChMVd, the same RT-PCR assay was performed on 80 randomly selected <b>chrysanthemum</b> <b>leaf</b> samples of four different cultivars (Redgold, Bangalore, Sarval, and CO- 1) collected from four chrysanthemum-growing districts of Karnataka. A PCR product of the size expected for CChMVd was detected in 8 of 80 samples analyzed, accounting for the infection incidence of 10 %. To identify the prominent CChMVd variants, 10 clones obtained from the four representative samples were sequenced. To confirm the sequence of the primer regions, an additional set of primers CCh 1 /CCh 2 were used for RT-PCR (Hosokawa et al. 2005) with high-fidelity LA-Taq polymerase (Takara-Bio, Japan). Alignment of all 40 sequences revealed the presence of at least two major sequence variants of CChMVd: CChMVd-Ind- 1 (GenBank Accession No. KP 262531) and CChMVd-Ind- 3 (KP 262533). Both the sequence variants had UUUC sequences (nucleotide position 82 to 85) in the tetraloop of the CChMVd, which is often associated with induction of symptoms in susceptible chrysanthemum cultivars (De la Peña et al. 1999). CChMVd-Ind- 1 was found to differ from CChMVd-Ind- 3 by 17 nucleotide substitutions. BLAST analysis of CChMVd-Ind- 1 showed 98 % sequence identity with the CChMVd strain reported from Spain (GenBank Accession No. FJ 647515) and from Himachal Pradesh state of India (FN 646404), whereas CChMVd-Ind- 3 showed 96 % sequence identity with CChMVd strain W 2 - 4, isolated from China (HQ 891014). To our knowledge, this is the first molecular evidence for the presence of CChMVd infecting chrysanthemum in Karnataka State, India. The high degree of sequence diversity reported in the Karnataka isolates of CChMVd will help to clarify the evolution of this viroid and its possible threat to important crops...|$|R

40|$|Biopesticides {{are a good}} {{alternative}} to the synthetic pesticide. Both leaves and fruit of neem plant {{are known to have}} bitter taste having fungicidal, insecticidal and nematicidal properties. Azadirachtin, chemically a tetranorterpenoid component of neem acts on the mitotic cells and blocks the microtubule polymerization. Certain activities of genes and proteins are also altered by azadirachtin. As a botanical insecticide azadirachtin is effective against many biological processes. It may cause a reduction in feeding habit, suspend the molting process, larvae and pupae death and also cause sterility in the emerging adults, this all depend on the given dose. Apart from azadirachtin, many other components of neem also have insecticidal properties. Among them are saponins that are found to have antimicrobial activity that inhibits moulds and protecting plant from attack of insects. Likewise Nim 80 and Neemas are also neem products that produce the insecticidal activity. In addition Parker oil TM is also effective insecticide which is a commercial product. There is a maximum weight loss when azadirachtin and NPV are used in combination. Commercial neem formulation has been assayed for the control of pine weevil in forestry, against rice <b>leaf</b> folder, root-knot <b>nematodes</b> and P. xylostella. Azadirachtin-A is extremely sensitive to the presence of sunlight different mechanisms have been used to increase its photo stability...|$|R
40|$|Tomato {{plants were}} inoculated with Meloidogyne incognita at initial populations (Pi) of 0, 1, 10, 50, 100, and 200 (x 1, 000) eggs per plant and {{maintained}} in a growth chamber for 40 days. Total fresh biomass (roots + shoots) at harvest was unchanged by nematode inoculation with Pi of 1 x 10 ⁵ eggs or less. Reductions in fresh shoot weight with increasing Pi coincided with increases in root weight. Total fresh biomass declined with Pi above 1 x 10 ⁵ eggs, whereas total dry biomass declined at Pi above 1 x 10 ⁴ eggs. The greatest reduction percentages in fresh shoot biomass induced by root-knot nematodes {{occurred in the}} stem tissue, followed by the petiole + rachis; the least weight loss occurred in the leaflets. Although biomass varied among shoot tissues, the relationship between biomass of various shoot tissues and Pi was described by quadratic equations. The linear and quadratic coefficients of the equations (stem, petiole + rachis, or leaflets on Pi) did not differ among tissues when calculations were based on standardized values. Meloidogyne incognita-infected plants had thinner leaves (leaf area/leaf weight) than did uninfected plants. Reductions in leaf weight and <b>leaf</b> area with <b>nematode</b> inoculation occurred at nodes 5 - 15 and 4, 6 - 14, respectively. Losses in plant height and mass due to nematodes reflected shorter internodes with less plant mass at each node...|$|R
40|$|Peanut or {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea L.) is second, behind soybean, in the world’s legume oilseed market. In 2012, global {{production was}} 41. 2 metric tons {{from an area}} of 24. 7 million hectares (FAOSTAT, 2014). Yield of peanut under stressed environments is an ultimate goal of improvement for enhanced production as it is usually susceptible {{to a range of}} abiotic and biotic stresses, such as drought, tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), early leaf spot (ELS) and late <b>leaf</b> spot (LLS), <b>nematodes,</b> rust, and aflatoxin contamination (Guo et al., 2012 a). However, cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid (2 n= 4 x= 40) with a large genome, which greatly complicates interpretation of genomic data compared with the diploid wild relatives (2 n= 2 x= 20) (Guo et al., 2013). It is difficult to transfer alleles from wild species to cultivated peanuts (Simpson, 1991). For the last ten years, extensive efforts in the area of peanut genomics have resulted in a large number of genetic and genomic resources such as mapping populations, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), a wide range of molecular markers, transcriptome and proteomics (Guo et al., 2013; Katam et al., 2014; Varshney et al., 2013). These genetic and genomic resources have been successfully used to construct genetic maps, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of traits of Author's personal copy 164 Peanuts Peanuts, First Edition, 2016, 163 - 207 interest, and to conduct marker-assisted selection and association mapping for peanut improvement (Pandey et al., 2014 a) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimate}} of the genetic parameters associated with processing (fresh-cut) traits, including root length (RL), is crucial for carrot breeding programs in tropical areas. The cultivar Alvorada is an important germplasm due to its resistance to <b>nematodes,</b> <b>leaf</b> blight, heat-tolerance, and high carotenoid content. Seventy-four 'Alvorada' half-sib progenies were evaluated {{during the summer of}} 2005 in the Federal District, Brazil, in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Thirteen competitive plants in each block were randomly selected and evaluated and/or classified for RL and for number of leaves (NL), leaf length (LL), root tip type (RT), root mass (RW), crown shape (CS), root diameter (RD), and xylem diameter (XD). The Pearson's correlation coefficients and the heritability values were estimated for all traits. The path analysis was also used considering the RL trait as dependent variable. The heritability for RL ranged from 12 to 44 %. For the other traits, the values ranged from 3 % (RD) to 79 % (LL). Phenotypic and genotypic correlations among all traits were low to intermediate. Path analysis indicated positive direct relationship between RL and RW, whereas RD and XD displayed negative direct effect on RL. Longer roots had narrow diameter and narrow XD. Recurrent selection based upon either half-sib or S 1 families would be more effective than mass phenotypic recurrent selection in increasing RL and to develop populations expressing multiple desirable processing traits in tropical-adapted carrot germplasm...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{next-generation}} sequencing and genotyping technologies have enabled generation of large-scale genomic {{resources such as}} molecular markers, transcript reads and BAC-end sequences (BESs) in chickpea, pigeonpea and groundnut, three major legume crops of the semi-arid tropics. Comprehensive transcriptome assemblies and genome sequences have either been developed or underway in these crops. Based on these resources, dense genetic maps, QTL maps {{as well as physical}} maps for these legume species have also been developed. As a result, these crops have graduated from ‘orphan’ or ‘less-studied’ crops to ‘genomic resources rich’ crops. This article summarizes above mentioned advances in genomics and genomics-assisted breeding applications in the form of marker-assisted selection (MAS) for hybrid purity assessment in pigeonpea; marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) for introgressing QTL region for drought-tolerance related traits, Fusarium wilt (FW) resistance and Ascochyta blight (AB) resistance in chickpea; late leaf spot (LLS), <b>leaf</b> rust and <b>nematode</b> resistance in groundnut. We critically present the case of use of other modern breeding approaches like marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) and genomic selection (GS) to utilize the full potential of genomics-assisted breeding for developing superior cultivars with enhanced tolerance to various environmental stresses. In addition, this article recommends the use of advanced- backcross (AB-backcross) breeding and development of specialized populations such as multi-parents advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) for creating new variations that will help developing superior lines with broadened genetic base. In summary, we propose the use of integrated genomics and breeding approach in these legume crops to enhance crop productivity in marginal environments ensuring food security in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Seven-day-old {{seedlings}} of two cultivars (Cristalina and UFV ITM 1) of Glycine max were inoculated with 0, 3, 000, 9, 000, or 27, 000 eggs of Meloidogyne incognita race 3 or M. javanica {{and maintained}} in a greenhouse. Thirty days later, plants {{were exposed to}} ¹⁴CO₂ for 4 hours. Twenty hours after ¹⁴CO₂ exposure, the root fresh weight, <b>leaf</b> dry weight, <b>nematode</b> eggs per gram of root, total and specific radioactivity of carbohydrates in roots, and root carbohydrate content were evaluated. Meloidogyne javanica produced more eggs than M. incognita on both varieties. A general increase in root weight {{and a decrease in}} leaf weight with increased inoculum levels were observed. Gall tissue appeared to account for most of the root mass increase in seedlings infected with M. javanica. For both nematodes there was an increase of total radioactivity in the root system with increased levels of nematodes, and this was positively related to the number of eggs per gram fresh weight and to the root fresh weight, but negatively related to leaf dry weight. In most cases, specific radioactivities of sucrose and reducing sugars were also increased with increased inoculum levels. Highest specific radioactivities were observed with reducing sugars. Although significant changes were not observed in endogenous levels of carbohydrates, sucrose content was higher than reducing sugars. The data show that nematodes are strong metabolic sinks and significantly change the carbon distribution pattern in infected soybean plants. Carbon partitioning in plants infected with nematodes may vary with the nematode genotype...|$|R
