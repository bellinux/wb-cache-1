40|$|Scales of fishes are {{remarkable}} structures. Much {{information can}} be obtained about the growth history and longevity of individual fish by close examination of their scales or other bony structures. On the population level, also, age and growth is an excellent index to well being. Scales are bony structures that grow shingle-like from pockets within the skin. Scales are covered with a very thin, outer layer of skin called the epidermis. Among Michigan fishes there are basically two kinds of scales: the ctenoid scale found on spiny-rayed fishes such as bass, sunfish, perch, and walleye; and the <b>cycloid</b> <b>scale</b> found on soft-rayed fishes such as trout, suckers, and northern pike (Figure 9. 1). The ctenoid scale has small, sharp projections (ctenii) which give a rough texture to spiny-rayed fish. The <b>cycloid</b> <b>scale</b> lacks ctenii; thus soft-rayed fish tend to be smooth textured. Scales start to form when a fish is about an inch long. The number of scales covering the body remains constant throughout life, and in general, scale growth is proportional to fish growth. As the scale grows, circuli (ridges) form on the edge. Circuli form a concentric pattern {{over the course of}} a year that is related to environmental and growth conditions. During the colder months, when fish eat little and growth ceases, the circuli are crowded together and may be incomplete. In the spring, when feeding and growth resume, new circuli form that are spaced further apart. Also, the first new circul...|$|E

50|$|Both <b>cycloid</b> and ctenoid <b>scales</b> are overlapping, {{making them}} more {{flexible}} than cosmoid and ganoid scales. Unlike ganoid scales, they grow in size through additions to the margin. The scales of some species exhibit bands of uneven seasonal growth called annuli (singular annulus). These bands {{can be used to}} age the fish. Most ray-finned fishes have ctenoid scales. Some species of flatfishes have ctenoid scales on the eyed side and <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales</b> on the blind side, while other species have ctenoid scales in males and <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales</b> in females.|$|R

The "Platform Goby", Chriolepis prolata, is distinguishable from all other western Atlantic species currently assigned to the genus Chriolepis and the morphologically similar genus Varicus in having pelvic-fin rays one through four branched, the fifth (innermost) pelvic-fin ray unbranched and relatively long (longer than the second ray to longer than all other pelvic-fin rays); most lateral body scales ctenoid, extending anteriorly in a wedge to a level anterior to the first dorsal-fin insertion or nearly to the pectoral-fin axil, with two or more rows of small <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales</b> extending anteriorly to near the pectoral-fin axil, <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales</b> along the bases of the dorsal and anal fins, and no scales on the belly; and the first two anal-fin pterygiophores inserted anterior to the first haemal spine.

50|$|Fish of {{this species}} are usually deep-bodied, {{flattened}} sideways, and somewhat circular or rounded, with blunt noses and small mouths with weak teeth. Some other characteristics of this fish are the absence of ventral fins, one long, continuous dorsal fin, long pectoral fins, and tiny, <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales.</b> The tail fin is nearly {{as long as the}} dorsal fin and deeply forked. The American butterfish is similar in appearance to its close relative, the harvestfish (Peprilus alepidotus), but can be distinguished by its much lower dorsal and tail fin.|$|R
50|$|Grass Gobies {{can grow}} up to 25 cm long. The head crown, nape, throat, belly and base of the {{pectoral}} fins are covered by <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales</b> and the gill covers are nacked.

50|$|Reaching a {{standard}} length of 7 cm, the Port Jackson glassfish has a silver and semi-transparent body and head covered with large <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales.</b> It has a short deeply-notched dorsal fin and forked tail fin.

The Port Jackson glassfish also has a lateral line running the length of its body, while that of its relative is partial.|$|R
50|$|Scales.—The {{forepart}} of the head, the interorbital space, {{the margins}} of the opercula and the bases of the pectorals are naked.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the scales of}} barfin plaice (Liopsetta pinnifasciata), which depends on the size and sex of the fish. Methods: The samples were collected in Peter the Great Bay (Sea of Japan) during 2011 – 2014 aboard research vessels and at observation posts of Pacific Scientific Research Fisheries Center. In total, 155 specimens of barfin plaice were analyzed and 2 110 scales were investigated using MBS- 10 binocular microscope.

40|$|Abstract – The {{normal and}} lateral line <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales</b> of a cyprinid fish Capoeta damascina (Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1842) have been {{subjected}} to the scanning electron microscopy technique in order to study their detailed structure. The scales have the general morphological characteristics of the <b>cycloid</b> <b>scales.</b> In the normal scale located below the dorsal fin, the focus lies towards the anterior region and is covered by reticulate or honeycomb form structures with few mucous pores. There is a clear-cut demonstration between the anterior and posterior region. In the posterior section, the scale has several rows of pigmented granules (tubercles) with different shapes from round to oval, semi-oval and even oblong structure. On the dorsal side, the anterior circuli bear teeth-like structures called lepidonts which help the scale in firm attachment to the skin. The circuli may also have calcium projections. The lateral line scale has a canal which characteristically lies along the anterior-posterior axis, slightly towards the posterior part with two anterior and posterior openings. The anterior opening is wider than the posterior opening and is hidden by an evelike extension cantilevered over it. Based on the obtained results it could be concluded that the shape and size of lepidonts on the circuli crest and also the pattern of reticulate or honeycomb form structures in the focus region may provide reliable taxonomic tools...|$|R
