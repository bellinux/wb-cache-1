40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluid flow {{modeling}} {{in continuous}} <b>casting</b> <b>tundish</b> {{is a normal}} procedure when designing or modifying a tundish. Both physical and mathematical modeling are used for this task, but mathematical modeling is becoming more popular because of advances in computer hardware and software development and because the effect of natural convection is difficult {{to take into account}} in physical modeling. This research focuses on tuning and validation of a commercial CFD package to be used in tundish simulations using physical modeling and plant trials. After physical modeling with a 1 / 3 scale water model was made, simulations of the water model were conducted first using a tundish with no flow modifiers and then to further test the tuned model two different flow modifier designs were simulated. To investigate how modeling works in the actual process, plant trials were made and simulation of a full scale tundish with steel was conducted. Experiments and simulations were done in steady state and in transient casting conditions. Different turbulence models and other important model variables were studied. 1...|$|R

40|$|To further remove mini-size {{nonmetallic}} inclusions {{and improve}} surface quality {{of stainless steel}} slab at No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Company Limited, the flow field and temperature profile of molten stainless steel in an asymmetrical T-type single-strand continuous <b>casting</b> <b>tundish</b> with a capacity of 18 - 20 tons have been investigated by both hydrodynamic and mathematical simulations. The influences of height for low-wall of turbulence inhibitor, dam height, weir depth, distance between dam and weir, submerged depth of ladle shroud and casting speed on flow field in the tundish have been studied in a 1 : 3 reduced scale hydrodynamic model. The streamlines, velocity vector fields and temperature profiles are also mathematically simulated. The hydrodynamic modelling results indicate that height for low-wall of turbulence inhibitor, dam height and weir depth are three important structural parameters on flow field of molten stainless steel in the tundish. The optimization of the three parameters can improve dispersed plug zone and reduce dead zone effectively. Changing casting speed can improve turbulent flow, and thus reduce dead zone of molten stainless steel in the tundish. As a result, five groups of optimized structural parameters of the tundish have been recommended, which can reduce volume fraction of dead zone down to 15 - 30 % and increase volume fraction of dispersed plug zone to more than 20 %. In addition, it is verified that the optimized groups of structural parameters of the tundish can maintain their advantage at different casting speeds in a narrow range. The mathematical modelling results suggest that heat losses around the tundish {{must be considered in}} order to accurately simulate the streamline, velocity vector field and temperature profile. The calculated temperature drop of molten stainless steel between inlet and outlet of the tundish is about 4. 4 K; the maximum temperature drop in the whole tundish is about 10 K, The modification of flow filed by changing structural parameters of the tundish can slightly affect temperature profile of molten stainless steel in the tundish.

40|$|Mathematical {{models have}} been {{developed}} to predict the removal of alumina inclusions from molten steel in a continuous <b>casting</b> <b>tundish,</b> including the effects of turbulent collisions, reoxidation, flotation, and removal on the inclusion size distribution. The trajectories of inclusion particles are tracked through the three-dimensional (3 -D) flow distribution, which was calculated with the K-ε turbulence model and includes thermal buoyancy forces based on the coupled temperature distribution. The predicted distributions are most consistent with measurements if reoxidation is assumed {{to increase the number of}} small inclusions, collision agglomeration is accounted for, and inclusion removal rates are based on particle trajectories tracked through a non-isothermal 3 -D flow pattern including Stokes flotation based on a cluster density of 5, 000 kg/m 3, and random motion due to turbulence. Steel samples should be taken from as deep as possible in the tundish near the outlet and several residence times after the ladle is opened, in order to best measure the Al 2 O 3 concentration entering the submerged entry nozzle to the mold. Inclusion removal rates vary greatly with size and with the presence of a protective slag cover to prevent reoxidation.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of inclusion removal from liquid steel by gas bubbling and bubble attachment in the tundish is complex {{due to the}} great number of variables involved, and {{it is even more}} difficult to study because of the turbulent flow conditions. The main objective of this work is to analyze and improve the understanding of the alumina inclusion removal rate by bubble attachment and by gas bubbling fluid dynamics effects. The results show that the inclusion collection probability mainly depends on the attachment mechanism by collision. This parameter was determined by calculating the induction time, which is shorter when the rupture time and the formation time of a stable three phases contact (particle/liquid/gas) are ignored than when it is fully considered, affecting the attachment probability. In addition, to achieve acceptable inclusion removal, a smaller bubble diameter is required, such as 1 [*]mm. This consideration is almost impossible to achieve during tundish operation; a more realistic bubble diameter around 10 [*]mm is employed, resulting in a very inefficient inclusion removal process by bubble attachment. Nevertheless, in a real <b>casting</b> <b>tundish</b> the inclusion removal rate employing argon bubbling is efficient; is mainly due to the fluid flow pattern changes rather than bubble attachment. Consequently, it is imperative to consider the summation of both removal mechanisms to compute a better approximation of this important operation...|$|R
