Holdsworth cites a 1313 case in which the counsel. Toudeby for the defendant pleaded no allegation <b>of</b> <b>bailment,</b> but Scrope, the counsel for the demandant (plaintiff), replied that, if the defendant carried off the chattels and a writ was brought to recover them, it was no answer to say that the chattels had not been bailed to the plaintiff. Still the case turned on the question <b>of</b> <b>bailment.</b> [...] In 1343, the defendant was driven to a traverse in these terms: “We tell you that the horse did not come into our keeping, nor do we detain the horse, as he counts.” [...] In 1410, both counsel agreed that an action of detinue lay whether the chattel was bailed or whether the defendant found it in the road. The plea simply amounted to an assumption that the chattels had come {{into the hands of the}} defendant (devenerunt ad manus), and were wrongfully withheld from the plaintiff.|$|R

Rachel Magdalene, have applied such insights from the law and literature school to the reconstruction of aspects of legal practice, including perspectives on its flaws and efficacy, in ancient Israel and Judah. References to law in literature may reflect legal practice realistically, but they may also serve to critique, to warn, and to advocate for a more just or moral option. This paper explores narratives featuring David in the Book of Samuel with an eye toward the Covenant Code’s law <b>of</b> <b>bailment</b> in Exodus 22 : 6 - 14. The law <b>of</b> <b>bailment</b> treats scenarios in which one person leaves property, such as goods or animals, in the care of another person for temporary safekeeping. Through repeated allusions to the institution <b>of</b> <b>bailment,</b> the David story offers a window into the social background of this law.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} the doctrines {{that support the}} notion of ‘transferable deposit’ as the historical explanation to ‘bank money’. It discusses the medieval practice <b>of</b> <b>bailment</b> <b>of</b> money as the ancestor of the bank deposit, {{and the emergence of}} the modern legal doctrine of the bank deposit from the medieval <b>bailment</b> <b>of</b> money. As a legal concept, the <b>bailment</b> <b>of</b> money denotes the delivery of money for a particular, or in effect, any given purpose. Where the purpose was not carried out, inasmuch as the bailee was not obligated to keep the specific coins separately, he was not liable to the bailor for the money in detinue. The chapter connects this notion to the modern monetary system where both ‘central-bank money’ and ‘commercial-bank money’ are in the form of credit to a bank account and the extinguishment of one debt, and the creation of another, facilitate a legal basis for the ‘transferable deposit’ and its use as ‘bank money’...|$|R
