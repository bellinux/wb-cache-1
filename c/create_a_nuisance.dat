This snail was {{purposely}} introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s.

50|$|Americans {{generate}} about 285 million scrap tires per year. Many {{states have}} regulations {{as to the}} number of scrap tires that can be held on site, due to concerns with dumping, fire hazards, and mosquitoes. In the past, millions of tires have been discarded into open fields. This creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes, since the tires often hold water inside and remain warm enough for mosquito breeding. Mosquitoes <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> and may increase the likelihood of spreading disease. It also creates a fire danger, since such a large tire pile is a lot of fuel. Some tire fires have burned for months, since water does not adequately penetrate or cool the burning tires. Tires have been known to liquefy, releasing hydrocarbons and other contaminants to the ground and even ground water, under extreme heat and temperatures from a fire. The black smoke from a tire fire causes air pollution and is a hazard to down wind properties.|$|E

50|$|Coincidentally, at {{approximately}} {{the same time that}} Calabresi and Melamed postulated their Rule 4 as an additional approach to the Polluter / Resident problem, an Arizona state supreme court decision independently illustrated the practical application of the “Rule 4” approach in deciding a case that had come before the court. In Spur Industries, Inc. v. Del E. Webb Dev. Co., 494 P.2d 700 (Ariz. 1972), Del Webb, an Arizona real-estate developer developing a retirement community, sued for an injunction against Spur Industries, a pre-existing feedlot owner whose activities resulted in an alleged nuisance to the encroaching retirement community (causing Del Webb difficulties in selling properties close to the feedlot). In handing down its decision, the Arizona state supreme court ruled that Spur Industries’ activities did <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance,</b> but Del Webb had come to the nuisance and brought its unwitting retirees along with it. Balancing the various factors in the case, including the fact that Del Webb but not Spur Industries could have foreseen the nuisance problem {{and the fact that the}} residents of the retirement community had been dragged to the nuisance unwittingly, the court ruled that Spur Industries would be forced to move, but that Del Webb had to indemnify the business for its troubles.|$|E
5000|$|The circus {{was created}} in 1812 on an area which was {{originally}} part of Finsbury Manor, having existed since 1527, on which the second Bethlem Royal Hospital had stood since 1675. The original houses, the last of which were demolished in 1921, were intended for merchants and gentlemen, but were soon broken up internally and leased for solicitors and other professions. The gardens, featuring a circuit of lime trees, were developed by William Montague to the specifications of the architect George Dance the Younger in 1815. In 1819 the London Institution moved into [...] "ingeniously planned and elegantly detailed" [...] premises designed by William Brooks {{at the north end}} of the circus; it closed in 1912 and the buildings were used for the University of London until their demolition in 1936.The circus was opened as a public park in the early 20th century, under powers granted to the City of London Corporation in the City of London (Various Powers) Act 1900. The gardens had previously been a private space for the use of the freeholders or lease-holders of the surrounding buildings, who objected to their compulsory purchase, fearing that their use by the public would <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> which would lower the value of their property. The campaign to make them a public space was led by Alpheus Morton, deputy-Alderman for Farringdon Without and a member of the Corporations' Streets Committee, and the circus became known with the Corporation as [...] "Morton's Park".|$|E

So, the neighbours began to wonder about the girls and the songs which the lady sang in glory.. It became a big news in 2002 and later the house was locked. Now Kundanbagh House is a deserted property with no electricity supply.===Different Views=== Similar to many haunted places, the story of Kundanbagh haunted house is a much debated one. Some firmly say that the story was created to stop other people from buying it. Many say that it is haunted and they have had some strange experiences. One resident of a nearby locality said that he and his friend met with an accident in front of the Kundanbagh House gate. He said it was weird that his bike's headlight switched off as soon as he entered that lane. His friend who happen to come from the opposite side came and crashed into him because even his bike's headlight got switched off as he came near.

ABSTRACT: Water is the resource that sustains all life on earth and {{is a key element}} of sustainable development. It is essential if human beings are to enjoy healthy and safe lives or realize social and economic development. Water pollution occurs when a body of water is adversely affected due to the addition of large amounts of materials to the water. Water pollution means such contaminations of water or such alteration of the physical, chemical or biological properties of water likely to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> or render such water harmful to public health or safety. Present study deals with the study of the pollution levels of Kshipra river at Bherugarh, Ujjain. There are many small scale textile, dyeing and printing industries in this locality. In these industries many chemicals, dyes, detergents, waxes, starch and cellulose are used. These industrial effluents are directly thrown in the river without prior treatment. Due to this effluent, river water gets polluted hence this water becomes unfit for drinking, bathing and even washing purposes. The physicochemical study of river indicates that river water is highly polluted. All parameters showed higher values than the prescribed standard values...|$|E
40|$|Calabresi and Melamed began a {{scholarly}} revolution {{by showing that}} legal entitlements have two readily distinguishable forms of protection: property rules and liability rules. These two archetypal forms protect an entitlement holder 2 ̆ 7 s interest in markedly different ways—via deterrence or compensation. Property rules protect entitlements by trying to deter others from taking. Liability rules, on the other hand, protect entitlements not by deterring but by trying to compensate the victim of nonconsensual takings. Accordingly, the compensatory impetus behind liability rules focuses on the takee 2 ̆ 7 s welfare—making sure the sanction is sufficient to compensate the takee. The deterrent impetus behind property rules, however, focuses on the potential taker 2 ̆ 7 s welfare—making sure the sanction is sufficient to deter the taker. Thus, disgorgement and prison terms exemplify traditional property rule remedies, while expectation and other compensatory damages fall squarely within the liability rule camp. Viewing liability rules as a distinct category of entitlement allowed Calabresi and Melamed to identify a missing category in the way courts resolved nuisance disputes. Consider the classic, if somewhat idealized, <b>nuisance</b> dispute between <b>a</b> single 2 ̆ 2 Polluter 2 ̆ 2 and a single 2 ̆ 2 Resident 2 ̆ 2 who is discomforted by the pollution. Prior to One View of the Cathedral, courts traditionally chose from among three categories of judgment: Rule 1 : the court issues an injunction against the Polluter; Rule 2 : the court finds the Polluter has <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> but permits pollution to continue provided the Polluter pays damages; or Rule 3 : the court finds the Polluter has not <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> and permits pollution to continue without restriction...|$|R

3000|$|The precautionary {{principle}} (Caroline Aeberli) The {{precautionary principle}} {{is a way}} of dealing with scientific uncertainty, based on available scientific knowledge, the degree of uncertainty and societal values (e.g. legal or political assessments). In Switzerland, the precautionary principle is anchored in the Federal Constitution (BV) and the Environmental Protection Act (USG). The aim of the USG is to protect people, animals and plants, as well as their biotic communities and habitats, from harmful effects or nuisances. Pursuant to art. 1 paragraph 2 of the USG, “In keeping with the precautionary principle, […], impacts which could become harmful or <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> are to be limited at an early stage”. The precautionary principle also applies in further decrees, inter alia in the Water Protection Act (GSchG) and the Chemicals Act (ChemG), or at ordinance level, for example, in the Plant Protection Product Ordinance (PSMV). The precautionary principle is chiefly underpinned by the concept of avoiding or limiting incalculable risks. It creates a safety margin (in Swiss legal terms) taking the uncertainties vis-à-vis the longer-term effects of environmental pollution into account. 2 The precautionary principle can be applied in the form of measures even when there is not yet any concrete danger, and it is intended to be effective where scientific uncertainty still exists. This principle is meant to provide preventive protection against risks as well as environmental protection focused on the long term (“prevention instead of cure”).

40|$|Unmanned {{aircraft}} systems (UAS) will {{be required}} to equip with sense-and-avoid (SAA) systems in order to fulfill the regulatory requirement to remain “well clear ” of other air traffic. This study investigates the effects that different well-clear metrics have on the rate of well-clear violations and evaluates the distribution of distances between aircraft at a well-clear violation in high-altitude enroute airspace. The first analysis determines the predicted rate at which violations of well clear would occur between UAS and manned aircraft operating under instrument flight rules, indicating the frequency with which a sense-and-avoid system would <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> alert. This analysis is done both with and without an algorithmic model of air traffic control (ATC) separation provision services. The second analysis determines the relationship between time-based well-clear metrics and the range at which the violation would occur, a relationship that may inform the required SAA surveillance range and the frequency with which violations would occur despite ATC separation standards still being maintained. The analyses are carried out using a fast-time simulation capability of the entire US air traffic system over a single day, including 3000 UAS and more than 50, 000 manned aircraft. Results indicate that, without any separation provision, a UAS would encounter a manned aircraft with a range tau (defined as the ratio of the relative range to range rate) of 60 seconds only every six hours. Approximately 75 % of such encounters would occur outside the ATC separation standard of 5 nmi. I...|$|E

People whose properties had more frogs were more likely to take action to reduce their numbers, but also attitudes toward the coqui were less negative when people had grown used to having to share their properties with the frogs. For those who cannot cope psychologically, we found it would be possible to manage properties to reduce densities but only when leaf litter and low shrubs were completely removed from near a home.
