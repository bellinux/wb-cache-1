50|$|He {{began his}} career as a trainee with Manchester United, but he never played for the first team. So he joined Huddersfield Town in 1987 by then manager Steve Smith. But in October 1987 he was {{replaced}} by Malcolm MacDonald into what is widely recognised as the club's worst ever season. Kirkham was to play only a minor role in the tragedy though, his only appearance came from the substitutes bench in a 2-1 home defeat by Ipswich Town on 8 April 1988, he replaced Peter Ward. With relegation confirmed a month later MacDonald was sacked and assistant, Eoin Hand took <b>charge.</b> <b>Hand</b> then sent him on loan to Waterford United in October 1988 http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1988/1022/Pg015.html#Ar01500.

50|$|Shaped charge {{technology}} {{was developed in}} the US into a shaped <b>charge</b> <b>hand</b> grenade for use by infantry, effective at defeating up to 60 mm (2.4 in) of vehicle armor. The grenade was standardized as the M10. However, the M10 grenade weighed 3.5 lb (1.6 kg), was difficult to throw by hand, and too heavy to be launched as a rifle grenade. The only practical way to use the weapon was for an infantryman to place it directly on the tank, an unlikely means of delivery in most combat situations. A smaller, less powerful version of the M10, the M9, was then developed, which could be fired from a rifle. This resulted {{in the creation of a}} series of rifle grenade launchers, the M1 (Springfield M1903), the M2 (Enfield M1917), the M7 (M1 Garand), and the M8 (M1 Carbine). However, a truly capable anti-tank weapon had yet to be found, and following the lead of other countries at the time, the U.S. Army prepared to evaluate competing designs for a more effective man portable anti-tank weapon.|$|E
40|$|The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) {{presents}} {{the statement of}} nuclear incidents at nuclear installations published under the Health and Safety Commission's powers derived from section 11 of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. INCIDENT 02 / 4 / 1. Harwell (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority) On 6 November 2002 during operations in a glove box in B 220, the over pressure alarm sounded. The operators evacuated and shortly afterwards the airborne activity monitors also sounded. The building emergency arrangements for airborne activity alarms was initiated to ascertain the source and to manage the operations. An investigation by UKAEA confirmed that a release of Americium 241 into the working area had occurred at a quantity in excess of Schedule 8 column 4 of the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRRs). A number of personnel have received intakes including the two operators and the health physics personnel who attended the event. The highest dose (up to 6 mSv.) was received by the Health Physics <b>charge</b> <b>hand.</b> UKAEA placed an embargo {{on the use of}} similar systems and have completed their own management investigation and produced an internal report. It concludes that the likely cause of the event was over-pressurisation of the vacuum equipment used in the process. The report also highlights improvements required to the ventilation system in the laboratory and adjoining areas. An action plan has been developed for this work and progress is being made. NIl has followed the UKAEA investigation and carried out its own study including a visit by a ventilation specialist. This has confirmed the problems with the ventilation system. It is a complex issue that may have a wider impact across the building. A letter has been sent to UKAEA detailing a series of short-term requirements and the need to review implications and produce a longer-term action plan. UKAEA is cooperating fully with these requirements. INCIDENT 02 / 4 / 2. Dounreay (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority) On 12 November 2002, two contractors leaving the D 2001 Intermediate Level Waste Processing facility were found to have contaminated shoes and one had contamination on his hands. All personnel in the building were withdrawn and monitored, and as a result contamination was revealed on the shoes of a further fifteen individuals.
