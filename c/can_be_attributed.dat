5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to the presence of different objects.

5|$|The low status of—and {{subsequent}} discrimination against—women in India <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to many cultural norms. Societal {{forces of}} patriarchy, hierarchy and multigenerational families contribute to Indian gender roles. Men use greater privileges and superior rights {{to create an}} unequal society that leaves women with little to no power. This societal structure is exemplified with women’s low participation within India’s national parliament and the labour force.|$|E

This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E

5|$|Château de Chinon is {{a castle}} {{located on the}} bank of the Vienne river in Chinon, France. It was founded by Theobald I, Count of Blois. In the 11thcentury the castle became the {{property}} of the counts of Anjou. In 1156 Henry II of England, a member of the House of Anjou, took the castle from his brother Geoffrey after he had rebelled for a second time. Henry favoured the Château de Chinon as a residence: most of the standing structure <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to his reign and he died there in 1189.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working {{men out of}} the home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion. Wealthy capitalists wishing {{to strike a balance between}} the demands of labor and desires of capital looked to Robert Owen's example. George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. The peaceful atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> in part to the absence of alcohol.|$|E

Offshore, two Japanese nationals died when their boat capsized. The reduced death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation. More than 100injuries <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to Iniki, though most {{occurred in}} the aftermath of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Mount Elbert is {{composed}} largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, {{as well as}} bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Overall, 209,000people were {{affected}} with 6,000households requesting assistance. A week after Dennis, Hurricane Emily brought further rain to the island, exacerbating damage.

One person died due to flooding. Relief operations began before the hurricane subsided, and international communities provided further aid. The overall effects of Dennis were limited and the nation's economy sustained no major ramifications.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible {{absorption}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to the B centers. Early {{assignment of}} the N9 absorption {{system to the}} B center have been disproven later. The B center has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum (see the infrared absorption picture above) with a sharp peak at 1332cm−1 and a broader feature at 1280cm−1. The latter is routinely used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the B form.|$|E
5|$|Spectra of {{the main}} ring {{obtained}} by the HST, Keck, Galileo and Cassini have shown that particles forming it are red, i.e. their albedo is higher at longer wavelengths. The existing spectra span the range 0.5–2.5 μm. No spectral features have been found so far which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to particular chemical compounds, although the Cassini observations yielded evidence for absorption bands near 0.8μm and 2.2μm. The spectra {{of the main}} ring {{are very similar to}} Adrastea and Amalthea.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Fort Blakely {{happened}} {{six hours}} after Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox. In {{the course of}} the battle, Brigadier General St. John Richardson Liddell was captured and surrendered his men. Out of 4,000 soldiers originally, Liddell lost 3,400 that were captured in this battle. About 250 were killed and only some 200 men escaped. The successful Union assault <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> in large part to African-American forces.|$|E

5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to a {{deepening}} low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core low {{off the coast}} of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of the Christ Child. The Virgin’s right arm mirrors {{the arm of the}} satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located on the shoulders of the satyr, a position similar to the Christ Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E
