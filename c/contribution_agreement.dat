25|$|As {{part of its}} {{obligation}} {{under the}} Mount Laurel doctrine, the Council on Affordable Housing requires Marlboro Township to provide 1,673 low / moderate income housing units. The first two rounds of New Jersey's affordable housing regulations ran from 1987 to 1999. Under a Regional <b>Contribution</b> <b>Agreement</b> (RCA), Marlboro Township signed an agreement in June 2008 that would have Trenton build or rehabilitate 332 housing units, with Marlboro Township paying $25,000 per unit, a total of $8.3 million to Trenton for taking on the responsibility for these units. Under proposed legislation, municipalities may lose {{the ability to use}} these RCAs to pay other communities to accept their New Jersey COAH fair housing obligations, which would mean that Marlboro Township is now required to build the balance of housing. When the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing requested plans to complete this obligation, Marlboro generated the largest number of objectors to an affordable housing plan in the history of New Jersey. Numerous appeals followed and in October 2010, the Appellate Division struck down portions of the 2007 regulations, invalidated the growth share methodology and directed COAH to develop new regulations. The NJ supreme court granted all petitions for certification in October 2010 and is set to hear the appeals. In June 2011, the Governor issued a reorganization plan which eliminated the 12-member COAH, though state courts overturned the governor's plan.|$|E

The author argues that, as implemented, RCAs thwart the Mount Laurel doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s explicit goal of revitalizing urban areas and its implicit goal of racial integration of suburban municipalities. The article concludes that, because the RCAs thwart some of the basic goals of the Mount Laurel doctrine, the New Jersey Fair Housing Act can no longer be described as a codification of that doctrine and substantial revisions are required to harmonize the Act, as currently implemented, with the Mount Laurel vision...|$|R

Those municipalities that chose not to participate in COAH's administrative process remained vulnerable to exclusionary zoning lawsuits and the prospect of the builder's remedy. The disadvantage would be that a participating municipality might be required to zone some land in a manner that extra housing would be produced. Some municipalities, believing that the likelihood of facing an actual exclusionary zoning lawsuit was low enough, took their chances in not participating.|$|E
