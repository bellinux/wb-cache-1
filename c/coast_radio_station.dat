5|$|The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration {{established}} a <b>coast</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station,</b> Svalbard Radio, at Finneset in 1911, which {{was moved to}} Longyearbyen in 1930. The town's tourist industry started in 1935, when SS Lyngen started calling regularly during the summer season. In 1937, SNSK established Sverdrupbyen to house workers for Mine 1b and operation of the mine started in 1939. In 1938, Longyearbyen's first road was completed, between the town center and Sverdrupbyen. Operations at Mine 2b, a different entrance to Mine 2a, started in 1939.|$|E
5|$|A {{royal decree}} on 26 October 1967 {{established}} an Oslo-based chief inspector {{who was to}} inspect the facility at least once per year, and a local inspector who would inspect the facility at least once per week. The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of radio technology, Per Mortensen, was appointed chief inspector, while the manager of Ny-Ålesund's <b>coast</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> was appointed assistant inspector. The ground station and auxiliary facilities were ready for operation in 1967. Through its history, the station had five managers: Henning Nielsen (1965–67), Roald Søfteland (1967–68), Ewald Øyen (1968–70), Einar Enderud (1970–72) and Kristian Sneltvedt (1972–74).|$|E
25|$|The five-member Ellingsen Committee, {{appointed}} by the government, recommended in November 2001 that the nine remaining coast radio stations be merged into two units and co-located with the two JRCCs. The rationale was costs savings and the existing possibilities of routing operations to adjacent stations and that fewer stations would not give less safety. The unmanning of three stations, Farsund, Bergen and Ørlandet, {{was carried out in}} 2004. The telephone number 120 was introduced on 1 February 2005, allowing recreational boaters to reach their closest <b>coast</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> by mobile telephone. Telenor Maritim Radio also introduced a series of commercial services through the number; this was criticized by the JRCCs, who stated that the marketing could raise doubt as to whether contacting a <b>coast</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> in an emergency was a free service or not. Svalbard Radio was remotely controlled from Bodø Radio from 2006. Rogaland and Bodø were moved and co-located with the JRCCs in Sola and Bodø. Tjøme Radio moved to Horten in 2008.|$|E

25|$|The German {{occupation}} of Norway during World War II (1940–45) caused a heavy wear {{on the radio}} equipment, {{and by the end}} of the war the coast radio network was non-operational. Ørlandet Radio opened in 1952. Norway had twenty-seven <b>coast</b> <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> in 1953, of which five were located in Svalbard and Jan Mayen. Twelve only had a telephony service, while the remainder had both telegraphy and telephony. The maritime VHF radio system was introduced in 1956. Because of the limited range of VHF compared to MF, an additional forty unmanned stations were established, connected with a manned station with relays.|$|E

Værøy Radio opened the same year. The Telegraphy Administration launched a national plan in 1910 for building a network of <b>coast</b> <b>radio</b> <b>stations,</b> which would cover the coastline and included plans for a transatlantic service and a radio on Spitsbergen. The politician's main motivation were not tied to Norway having the world's third-largest merchant marine, but rather tied to the use by fisheries and coastal traffic.|$|R
