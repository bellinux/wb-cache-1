40|$|Traffic {{dynamics}} on {{single or}} isolated complex networks {{has been extensively}} studied in the past decade. Recently, several coupled network models {{have been developed to}} describe the interactions between real-world networked systems. In a system of interconnected networks, the <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> refer to the physical links between networks and provide paths for traffic transmission. Thus, the coupling pattern, i. e., the way <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> are added, has a profound influence on the overall traffic performance. In this paper, we employ a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal configuration of the <b>coupling</b> <b>links,</b> which effectively improves the overall traffic capacity compared with random, assortative and disassortative couplings.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a mathematical model}} of synaptic interaction between two pulse neuron elements. Each of the neurons is modeled by a singularly-perturbed difference-differential equation with delay. Coupling {{is assumed to be}} at the threshold, and time delay is taken into consideration. Problems of existence and stability of relaxation periodic movements for obtained systems are considered. It turns out that the ratio between the delay due to internal causes in a single neuron model and the delay in the <b>coupling</b> <b>link</b> between oscillators is crucial. Existence and stability of a uniform cycle of the problem is proved for the case where the delay in the link is less than a period of a single oscillator that depends on the internal delay. As the delay grows, the in-phase regime becomes more complex, particularly, it is shown that by choosing a suitable delay, we can obtain more complex relaxation oscillation and inside a period interval the system can exhibit not one but several high-amplitude splashes. This means that bursting-effect can appear in a system of two synaptic coupled oscillators of neuron type due to a delay in a <b>coupling</b> <b>link...</b>|$|E

The transition is characterized by a saturation of the algebraic connectivity upon the addition of suffcient <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> (between the two individual networks of a NoN).

40|$|Mathematical {{models for}} climate studies {{are treated as}} a <b>coupling</b> <b>link</b> between {{physical}} and computational models.

40|$|The big {{advantage}} of LED is the flexible spectral design to make white light using different color mixing schemes. Recently, the color mixing of RGB LEDs is mostly done by sealing all three chips at single package and regulated the mix ratio {{of these three}} colors to produce the color of light.

40|$|We {{propose a}} set of general {{coupling}} conditions to select a coupling profile ({{a set of}} coupling matrices) from the linear flow matrix (LFM) of dynamical systems for realizing global stability of complete synchronization (CS) in identical systems and robustness to parameter perturbation. The coupling matrices define the coupling links between any two oscillators in a network that consists of a conventional diffusive <b>coupling</b> <b>link</b> (self-coupling link) {{as well as a}} cross-coupling link. The addition of a selective cross-coupling link in particular plays constructive roles that ensure the global stability of synchrony and furthermore enables robustness of synchrony against small to non-small parameter perturbation. We elaborate the general conditions for the selection of coupling profiles for two coupled systems, three- and four-node network motifs analytically as well as numerically using benchmark models, the Lorenz system, the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model, the Shimizu-Morioka laser model, the Rössler system and a Sprott system. The role of the cross-coupling link is, particularly, exemplified with an example of a larger network where it saves the network from a breakdown of synchrony against large parameter perturbation in any node. The perturbed node in the network transits from CS to generalized synchronization (GS) when all the other nodes remain in CS.

In other words, there exists an uncertainty for time-window’s length and time nodes.

Although the adoption of continuous-time expressions {{may lead to a}} more complex model structure and stronger <b>coupling</b> <b>link</b> between variables, it can minimize the size of a model and improve the solving efficiency. Based on the previous research of the MILP discrete method for dendritic pipeline network scheduling, MirHassani and Ghorbanalizadeh (2008) have proposed a continuous-time MILP method, the result of which demonstrates that the introduction of continuous-time can apparently enhance the calculating efficiency. During the past several years, optimizing of schedule issues on the basis of continuous-time models for different pipelines has become an issue of interest in academia. For instance, some researchers aim at single-source pipelines (Cafaro and Cerdá 2004, 2008; Relvas et al. 2006), some focus on tree-structure pipelines (Mirhassani and Ghorbanalizadeh 2008; Castro 2010; Cafaro and Cerdá 2011), or mesh-structure pipelines (Cafaro and Cerdá 2012). However, at present, the scheduling plan given by a continuous-time MILP model is just an approximate scheduling which contains only a general time zone and approximate injection as well as offtake volume for each station instead of a detailed operating time.|$|E
40|$|The {{next-generation}} retinal prostheses feature high {{image resolution}} and chronic implantation. These features demand {{the delivery of}} power as high as 100 mW to be wireless and efficient. A common solution is the 2 -coil inductive power link, used by current retinal prostheses. This power link tends to include a larger-size extraocular receiver coil coupled to the external transmitter coil, and the receiver coil {{is connected to the}} intraocular electrodes through a trans-sclera trans-choroid cable. In the long-term implantation of the device, the cable may cause hypotony (low intraocular pressure) and infection. However, when a 2 -coil system is constructed from a small-size intraocular receiver coil, the efficiency drops drastically which may induce over heat dissipation and electromagnetic field exposure. Our previous 2 -coil system achieved only 7 % power transfer. This paper presents a fully intraocular and highly efficient wireless power transfer system, by introducing another inductive <b>coupling</b> <b>link</b> to bypass the trans-sclera trans-choroid cable. With the specific equivalent load of our customized 512 -electrode stimulator, the current 3 -coil inductive link was measured to have the overall power transfer efficiency around 36 %, with 1 -inch separation in saline. The high efficiency will favorably reduce the heat dissipation and electromagnetic field exposure to surrounding human tissues.
