30|$|Not {{unlike the}} Roco/Bainbridge report, the Nordmann report aims at {{promoting}} ID {{as an instrument}} for creating innovation: “strong interdisciplinarity for research. […] Research is needed about the processes of innovation and diffusion, the economies of artificial environments, conditions for multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary work” (Nordmann et al. 2004 : 45 / 41). 32 The Nordmann report is reflexive as long as ID is not considered as simply given or easily produced. Rather, ID creates independent research questions: research about ID as research for ID—and thus {{the condition of the}} possibility of innovation. But {{it is not just the}} meta-issue of ID which distinguishes the Nordmann from the Roco/Bainbridge report. It is also the understanding of ID which is different. The CTEKS concept advocates problem-oriented ID. First of all, another <b>convergence</b> <b>circle</b> must be chosen for this, comprising more than the four technology types described in the Roco/Bainbridge report (“NIBC technologies”) as well as the associated techno-sciences. The additional <b>convergence</b> <b>circle</b> of the Nordmann report refers to: “nano-bio-cogno-socio-anthro-philo-geo-eco-urbo-orbo-macro–micro”. For this, the Nordmann report uses the term “converging technologies”; thus, it does not accept the narrow American definition of the term concerning limitations to NBIC technologies.|$|E

In marked difference with the results from heavy fermion formalism, the impulse and s-wave rescattering terms in the relativistic limit have equal signs and therefore add constructively, giving rise to a substantial contribution to the cross section. We argue that the power series expansion of the nucleon propagator is {{on the border of}} its <b>convergence</b> <b>circle.</b> Consequently, a finite order heavy fermion formalism does not predict nucleon pole terms correctly and therefore can not be applied to meson production.

Here we revisit the enumeration problem of the HS index on the rooted, unlabeled, plane binary set of trees, and enumerate the same index on the ambilateral set of rooted, plane binary set of trees of n leaves. The ambilateral set is a set of trees whose elements cannot be obtained from each other via an arbitrary number of reflections with respect to vertical axes passing through any of the nodes on the tree. For the unlabeled set we give an alternate derivation to the existing exact solution. Extending this technique for the ambilateral set, which is described by an infinite series of non-linear functional equations, we are able to give a double-exponentially converging approximant to the generating functions in a neighborhood of their <b>convergence</b> <b>circle,</b> and derive an explicit asymptotic form for the number of such trees.

30|$|But {{not just}} the <b>convergence</b> <b>circle</b> is wider and broader. Especially that which converges is different: “Converging {{technologies}} converge toward a common goal [or shared visions]” (Nordmann et al. 2004 : 4). The Nordmann report advocates convergence of (and in the) goal(s), while the Roco/Bainbridge report prefers a convergenceof (and in the) object(s). In the European CTEKS approach, the goals and problems to be solved are not considered as simply given, but rather must be found and formulated. Problems, goals, and starting points must be determined. Thus, the Nordmann report’s CTEKS approach “always [entails] an element of agenda setting. Because of this, converging technologies are particularly open to the deliberate inclusion of public and policy concerns. Deliberate agenda-setting for CTs can therefore be used to advance strategic objectives such as the Lisbon Agenda” (Nordmann et al. 2004 : 4). The report uses the buzzword “converging technologies” {{in the context of}} a future discourse, which aims to determine research and development goals. Discursive, deliberative processes—connected with key words such as participatory governance and technoscientific citizenship—are favored; a proximity to discourse ethics becomes apparent. The Nordmann report calls for an integration, not just of experts, but of citizens and concerned parties into the process of agendasetting: “CTEKS agenda-setting is not top down but integrated into the creative technology development process. Beginning with scientific interest and technological expertise, it works from the inside out in close collaboration with the social and human sciences and multiple stakeholders through the proposed WiCCinitiative (‘Widening the Circles of Convergence’). For the same reason, ethical and social considerations are not external and purely reactive but through the proposed EuroSpecs process bring awareness to CT research and development” (Nordmann et al. 2004 : 4). The normativity associated with that which appears on various levels—from problem perceptions and definitions to the definition of purposes and the formulation of goals—is made explicit by the CTEKS approach, as part of ID: “Normative setting” is at the core of “interdisciplinary excellence” (Nordmann et al. 2004 : 42). To achieve this, the following is valid: “CTEKS research programs require and produce new standards for interdisciplinary research. Interdisciplinarity usually means that researchers from various disciplines pool intellectual and technical resources as they address a problem together. This form of interdisciplinarity is insufficient when the CTEKS agenda-setting process requires critical and comparative assessments of the viability of proposals. Mutual criticism across disciplinary boundaries is required […]. Funding incentives for collaborative research is not enough to produce this kind of interdisciplinarity” (Nordmann et al. 2004 : 46).|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} the shapes of stones and other {{particles}} formed by water or wind has always {{attracted the attention of}} geologists and mathematicians. A classical model of abrasion due to W. J. Firey leads to a geometric partial differential equation representing the continuum limit of the process. This model predicts convergence to spheres from an arbitrary initial form; analogously, the two-dimensional version of the model predicts <b>convergence</b> to <b>circles.</b> The shapes of real stones are, however, not always round. Most notably, coastal pebbles tend to be smooth but somewhat flat, and ventifacts (e. g. pyramidal dreikanters) often have completely different shapes with sharp edges. Inspired by Firey’s results, a new PDE is derived in this paper, which not only appears to be a natural mathematical generalization of the PDE, but also represents the continuum limit of a generalised abrasion model based on recurrent loss of material due to collisions of nearby pebbles. Preliminary results suggest that our model is capable to predict a broad range of limit shapes: polygonal shapes with sharp edges develop due to sand blasting (big stone surrounded by infinitesimally small particles), round stones emerge due to collisions with relatively big stones, and flat shapes are the typical outcome in the intermediate case. The results show nice agreement with real data despite the model's simplicity...|$|R

40|$|A {{long time}} ago, {{it has been}} conjectured that a Hamiltonian with a {{potential}} of the form x^ 2 +i v x^ 3, v real, has a real spectrum. This conjecture has been generalized to a class of so-called PT symmetric Hamiltonians and some proofs have been given. Here, we show by numerical investigation that the divergent perturbation series can be summed efficiently by an order-dependent mapping (ODM) in the whole complex plane of the coupling parameter v^ 2, and that some information about the location of level crossing singularities can be obtained in this way. Furthermore, we discuss to which accuracy the strong-coupling limit {{can be obtained from}} the initially weak-coupling perturbative expansion, by the ODM summation method. The basic idea of the ODM summation method is the notion of order-dependent "local" disk of convergence and analytic continuation by an order-dependent mapping of the domain of analyticity augmented by the local disk of <b>convergence</b> onto a <b>circle.</b> In the limit of vanishing local radius of convergence, which is the limit of high transformation order, convergence is demonstrated both by numerical evidence as well as by analytic estimates.

40|$|Summary. The John O'Groats Sandstone, on the {{north-east}} tip of Scotland, is {{the uppermost}} unit of a thick Old Red Sandstone sequence from the uppermost Middle Devonian. Samples from 13 sites {{have been treated}} by thermal and acid leaching techniques making use of the <b>convergence</b> of re-magnetization <b>circles</b> when stable end points were not reached. In some cases, in which the magnetic constituents were asymmetrically distributed, splitting the specimens proved useful. Two axes of magnetization have been identified. The easiest to determine, called the A axis, is present most frequently in the reversed sense, at roughly Dec 190 °, Inc- 40 ". The normal component can also be detected as stable end points on acid leaching. The A-axis magnetization is carried mainly by the pigmented cement. The B axis, which is aligned NNE-SSW and almost horizontal, is less well defined. Both the A- and B-axis orientations cited are after making corrections for structural tilts that are present {{at some of the}} sites. The direction of the B-axis magnetization agrees well with that of other Devonian units from west of the Great Glen Fault and is interpreted as having been acquired during, or shortly after, deposition. The A magnetization is interpreted as having been acquired during the Mesozoic, probably associated with regional burial and subsequent tectonic uplift of the area during the Jurassic. Later tectonic movements to produce at least the major structural tilts post-date the A magnetization and may be related to crustal unrest {{at the opening of the}} modern Atlantic. The John O'Groats directions are compatible with similar directions found in the hncansby Neck, a volcanic vent that penetrates the Sandstone. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{new word}} of command in business, {{professional}} and academic <b>circles,</b> <b>convergence</b> has been utilized {{to refer to}} a diversity of processes: concentration of the communication groups, initiatives for integration of newsrooms and distribution of content in multiple platforms, development of new language formats, reconfiguration of the relations between producers and audiences, etc. As the researcher Canavilhas explains in the opening article of this dossier, “We can ascertain an attempt to integrate the several facets of convergence, seeking an overall definition capable of covering all the fields of convergence”. In fact, beyond a mere technical description of the phenomenon, the concept of convergence has benefited from different approaches – economic, sociological, technological, normative – which explain the diversity of objects and scenarios described as convergent. The interdisciplinary relation with many meanings that is established with regard to convergence can lead to a draining of the concept. It is sometimes confounded with a group of variables that explain the processes of transformation or reconfiguration of the entire media system. This explains the caution of the authors who participate in the dossier Digital Media, convergence and journalistic practice: challenges and prospects, in this edition of Brazilian Journalism Research. Some researchers prefer to utilize more precise terminologies to describe phenomena that emerge in this scenario. This is shown by the articles by Alzamora and Tarcia and also by Pase, Nunes and Fontoura on considering “transmedia narrative ” to be a subject of research which is located in the ambit of convergent journalism. Canavilhas prefers to apply the concept of “remediation ” to describe the transposition and adaptation of aspects of digital language by the traditional media, which would differ from convergence of content, defined as the utilization of “a particular language with unique and differentiate...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Bu tez yakınsayan endüstrilerde firmaların nasıl davrandığına odaklanmıştır. Son yıllarda firmalar onları doğrudan rakip ya da ortak yapacak bazı stratejik seçimler yapmıştır. Amacımız yakınsama şartlarında firmaların aldığı stratejik aksiyonları Kaynak Tabanlı Yaklaşım ile keşfetmek ve anlamaktır. Yakınsayan endüstri olarak mobil cüzdan endüstrisi seçilmiştir. Son yıllarda yeni ödeme sistemlerinde hızlı bir artış olmuştur. Mobil ödeme sistemleri cep telefonları, özellikle de akıllı telefonların hızlı benimsenmesinden faydalanarak bu cihazların kullanım özelliklerine entegre edilen ödeme kanallarının bir kategorisidir. Mobil ödeme endüstrisinin hızla büyümesi ve mobil iletişim ve finansal kuruluşların yakınsamasına örnek oluşu, endüstriyi üzerinde çalışmak için ilginç kılmıştır. Mobil cüzdan endüstrisi büyük ölçüde bilgi temellidir. Ve biliyoruz ki başarılı bir mobil cüzdan genellikle sadece iyi teknoloji üzerine kurulmaz, aynı zamanda mobil ödeme değer zincirindeki farklı aktörler ile işbirliğine de bağlıdır.   İşbirlikleri önemi fazla olduğu için tüm dünyada faaliyet gösteren 138 mobil cüzdan uygulaması ile 2008 - 2014 yılları arasında hangi işbirliklerinin yapıldığı araştırılmıştır. Ayrıca, hangi temel aktörlerin mobil cüzdan endüstrisinde olduğu ile ilgili kavram geliştirmeyi vaat ettik. Analiz sonucuna göre, sermaye tabnlı olmayan işbirliklerinin sermaye tabanlı işbirliklerine (birleşme ve satın almalara) göre daha çok tercih edildiği tespit edilmiştir. Firmaların ilgili aksiyonlarının önemli bir unsuru sermaye tabanlı olmayan işbirlikleri olmuştur. İşbirliklerinin yakınsama öncesinde, esnasında ya da sonrasında yapılabildiği görülmüştür. Literatüre katkı sağlayacak dört temel aktör tespit edilmiştir. İçinde bulunduğumuz bilgi çağında ekonomik büyümenin başlıca itici gücü olan ve günlük hayatın hemen her alanında birçok işlev için altyapıyı oluşturan bilgi ve iletişim teknolojilerinde son 10 - 15 yıl içinde önemli değişiklikler yaşanmıştır. Bu değişimin en önemli boyutlarından birisi yakınsamadır. Yakınsama kavramı, belli bir bağlam dahilinde kullanılmadığı takdirde zaman içinde belli bir değere, noktaya, ortak görüşe ya da sabit bir denge durumuna doğru yaklaşma anlamına gelmekte, telekomünikasyon. bilgi teknolojileri ye yayıncılık endüstrileri bağlamında ise, daha önce kesin bir şekilde birbirinden ayrılabilen söz konusu endüstrilerin arasındaki geleneksel sınırların azalması olarak ifade edilmektedir. Yakınsama olarak adlandırılan bu gelişim ve dönüşüm sürecinde farklı şebeke platformları benzer ses hizmetlerini, görsel-işitsel hizmetleri ve yeri hizmetlerini taşıyabilmekte, farklı son kullanıcı araçları üzerinden benzer hizmetler sunulabilmekte ve yeni hizmetler ortaya çıkmaktadır. This {{thesis is}} focused on how firms behave when {{converging}} environments with strategic alliances. In the recent years they have made some strategic choices that resulted in them becoming direct competitors or partners. Our goal is to explore and understand the moves {{in the context of}} convergence with ‘Resource Based View’. The industry where they are facing each other is mobile wallet services During recent years there has been a rapid increase of new payment solutions. So-called mobile payment solutions are a category of payment solutions that utilize the rapid adoption of cell phones, especially smart phones. Since the mobile payment industry is rapidly expanding and mobile payment industries result from the convergence of the mobile communications and financial payment industries, it is an interesting industry to study for mobile wallet services. The industry is to a large extent knowledge-based and we believe that a successful mobile wallet solution is often not only built on good technology, but also dependent on collaborations with several different actors in the mobile payment value network.   Since the collaborations are of major importance we decided to further investigate which collaborations made years between 2008 - 2014 with 138 mobile wallet service provider. Further, we hope to develop an understanding of what different kind of actors are in the mobile wallet industry. According to the result of analysis, it has been found out that alliances is chosen over merger and acquisitions. An important element of their related actions has been the use of strategic alliances. The alliances can be done before, during or after the convergence process. There are four main actors found in the industry contributed to the literaure in this study. Convergence has been widely used in management practice in the IT, telecom and media industries in the last decades. A working definition of convergence could be something like: “merging of separated markets, removing entry barriers across industry boundaries. ” The popular illustration of <b>convergence</b> was four <b>circles</b> representing the IT, telecom, media and consumer electronics industries moving into each other, creating one big converging industry. This study gives a brief history of how convergence has justified a number of mostly failed mergers within the convergence industry. One conclusion is that convergence gives few guidelines for concrete strategic action for a given firm. Convergence drives re-definitions of industry boundaries, but the result of convergence is not a merging of separate industries into one big converging industry. The lessons from the resource based view of the firm are enforced. However, convergence fills an important role in early phases of market re-definitions by alerting strategists about change. The mobile telecommunication market has recently been shaken by the arrival of new actors. The relatively well-established mobile network operators (MNO) have to rethink their position in the market if they want to participate in the growth of mobile telecommunication revenues.   Mobile applications and services are being seen as great opportunity of new revenue sources. However, with the current market structure, MNOs do not hold a privileged position compared to mobile platforms providers such as technology firms. In this paper, we assess {{whether or not there is}} still space in the mobile application market for MNOs. In order to do so, we examine different roles in the mobile application value chain and determine how MNOs can position themselves in this turbulent new market. Our analysis shows that MNOs will have to establish alliances with platform providers.   Mobile payment is a very promising service which is still in an early stage of development. Various solutions have been proposed with disparate success. This can partially be explained by the immaturity of the market, by the inexistence of proven business models for the various actors, and by the presence of several unresolved technological and business issues. As these aspects are all relevant and interrelated, the purpose of this study is to discuss the importance of analyzing the mobile wallet  environment using multiple perspectives During recent years there has been a rapid increase of new payment solutions. So-called mobile payment solutions are a category of payment solutions that utilize the rapid adoption of cell phones, especially smart phones. Since the mobile wallet industry is rapidly expanding, it is an interesting industry to study. Moreover, the industry is to a large extent knowledge-based. The actors are seldom producers of physical products and we believe that a successful mobile wallet solution is often not only built on good technology, but also dependent on collaborations with several different actors in the mobile wallet value network. Since the collaborations are of major importance we decided to further investigate the subject of collaborations in relation to the mobile wallet industry. Further, when evaluating the collaboration structures we hope to develop an understanding of what the current collaboration structures imply for the different kind of actors in the mobile wallet industry. The purpose of this study is to create an understanding for the use of, and the approach towards, collaborations, including collaboration strategies, among the different types of actors in the mobile wallet industry. Further, the purpose is also to describe the resulting value creation alternatives for mobile wallet actors that the collaboration situation gives rise to. When studying collaborations, the choice of an industry that is in need of collaborations is obviously important, yet there are additional reasons why the mobile wallet industry is interesting to study. In the current immature development state, without a clear standard business model, it should be possible for actors to try very different strategies when trying to get a strong position, compared to a more mature industry where solutions would generally be expected to be more similar. Moreover, the many options and early state make it possible for new companies, largely dedicated towards mobile wallet industry, to enter the industry and contrast older companies that see mobile wallet industry as just another possible diversification.   The mobile wallet industry must first be defined. It is hard to define exactly what type of commercial actors that are/will be  stakeholders in the mobile wallet industry as a standard solution has yet to emerge, and as new mobile wallet solutions enter the market, so might new types of actors. However, there are some types of commercial actors that are considered main stakeholders in current and/or future solutions.   In order to cover the subject of collaborations, we will first introduce different collaboration arrangements and how different researchers argue that these arrangements should be defined. Following, we will go through the purpose of collaborations and finally explain the associated advantages, limits and risks.   Given the limited research on this area, we argue that this study is relevant since it highlights and investigates an unexplored research area and focuses on unsolved research questions. Moreover, since the mobile wallet industry is immature and in an expanding state, the general utility this study will provide is an increased understanding of the collaborations in the mobile payment industry. This is interesting since we believe that collaborations are an important building block for the industry to function.   We suggest three main areas for future research: Firstly, focused research on the advantages of collaborating in knowledge-based industries. Secondly, we suggest similar studies to this one on other industries with different characteristics for comparison. Finally, we believe it would be interesting to expand our study to other markets to investigate how the external environment affects the collaboration situation. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
