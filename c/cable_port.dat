50|$|The e-Reader {{fits into}} the Game Boy Micro and has a link <b>cable</b> <b>port,</b> but not a {{standard}} connector. A special Game Boy Micro Game Link Cable must be used for linking features. The Game Boy Micro's non-standard link <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> can not accept the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable, meaning it cannot link with GameCube games without modification to the cable.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{versions}} {{were released}} in Japan: the original e-Reader (without a link <b>cable</b> <b>port),</b> which could read cards to unlock game content, etc.; {{and later the}} e-Reader+ (simply [...] "e-Reader" [...] in Australia and North America), which came with a link <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> to connect with Nintendo GameCube games such as Animal Crossing and with other Game Boy Advance systems for games such as Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. The e-Reader was only considered successful in Japan. It was announced for Europe but very few were made, as it was almost immediately canceled, and it was discontinued in North America in early 2004, {{due to a lack}} of popularity. In Japan, it sold much better and was produced up to the discontinuation of the Game Boy hardware line.|$|E

50|$|The Nintendo Game Link Cable {{is used to}} link two or more {{systems in}} the Game Boy line of handhelds for {{multiplayer}} gaming. Games such as the Pokémon series use the Game Link Cable to transfer data between linked cartridges. Several different variations of Game Link Cables were produced as different Game Boy models had different link <b>cable</b> <b>ports.</b> Various adapters were also produced to interlink different Game Boy models. These variations and adapters are explained in the main article.|$|R

50|$|The {{fourth and}} last {{generation}} Game Link Cable, called the Game Boy Micro Game Link Cable (model OXY-008), was {{designed specifically for}} use with the Game Boy Micro. The Game Boy Micro features an even smaller link <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> than the Game Boy Advance, so it too requires its own Game Link Cable. The link cable features a fourth generation connector on each end which allows two Game Boy Micros to link. Alternatively, the Game Boy Micro Game Link cable {{can be used in}} conjunction with the Game Boy Micro Converter Connector (model OXY-009) to link one Game Boy Micro and one Game Boy Advance or Game Boy Advance SP. Like the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable, the Game Boy Micro Game Link Cable features a link <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> in the middle, used to receive additional cables to connect up to four players at once.|$|E
5000|$|The e-Reader is a {{card reader}} add-on {{released}} for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. The add-on is plugged {{directly into the}} cartridge slot of the Game Boy Advance. Its main function is scanning e-Reader cards to play minigames and ported NES games, or to unlock special content for certain Game Boy Advance and GameCube games. There is only one version of the e-Reader outside Japan, {{but there are two}} Japanese versions. Japan's first version of the add-on came without a link <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> among other things. But the second version (e-Reader+ in Japan, simply [...] "e-Reader" [...] in Australia and North America) came with a few improvements, including a new link <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> allowing support for multiplayer gameplay and the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable. These improvements add extra functionality that can be taken advantage of using link cables with games like Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E

50|$|The Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable is a link cable used {{to connect}} the Nintendo GameCube and the Game Boy Advance. This {{provides}} an opportunity for added gameplay in certain GameCube and Game Boy advance games. Minigames can be downloaded to the Game Boy Advance, the Game Boy Advance may be used as an extra screen to supplement gameplay, or the Game Boy Advance can be used as an enhanced GameCube controller. One end of the link cable plugs into a GameCube controller port, and the other end plugs into the Game Boy Advance's link <b>cable</b> <b>port.</b> The cable is only compatible with the Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo Wii, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, Game Boy Player, and e-Reader. The cable does not work with the Game Boy Micro, as the Micro has a non-standard link <b>cable</b> <b>port.</b> However, the Game Boy Micro Game Link Cable and Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable can be modified and spliced together in order to support compatibility with the Game Boy Micro.|$|E
50|$|The third {{generation}} {{started with the}} release of the Game Boy Advance which was released alongside its own link cable called the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable (model AGB-005). It features yet another new type of link <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> which is used on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Player. This link cable can only be used for connecting Game Link compatible Game Boy Advance games.|$|E
50|$|For {{reasons that}} are not clear in {{historical}} sources, the original Liz plans were dropped and only one machine using the new design was released. Announced at a New York City press conference on December 13, 1982, the rechristened 1200XL {{was presented at the}} Winter CES on January 6-9, 1983 and shipped in March 1983. Notable features were 64 KB of RAM, built-in self test, redesigned keyboard (featuring four function keys and a HELP key), and redesigned <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> layout.|$|E

50|$|The port {{design on}} the third {{generation}} is almost identical to the second generation link <b>cable</b> <b>ports</b> except that it adds an extra protrusion on the plug and a notch on the socket to prevent a Game Boy Advance Game Link cable from being accidentally inserted into older model Game Boy systems. The almost identical shape of the port allows the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Player to accept all the second generation Game Link Cables, but only for backward compatibility between Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. The second generation Game Link cable cannot be used to link Game Boy Advance games, and the third generation Game Link Cable cannot be used to link Game Boy or Game Boy Color games.|$|R

Players can then load the snapshot later on and continue where they left off. Only one snapshot can be stored at a time.|$|E
50|$|BitBoy (2015) - GameBoyPhoto {{created the}} BitBoy, a straight-to-SD-card {{transfer}} device {{designed to work}} with Game Boy Camera. BitBoy enables for single image transfer as well as batch-image transfer of up to 30 images at a time, {{by taking advantage of}} the printer-transfer signal via the Game Boy Link <b>Cable</b> <b>port.</b> Since the Game Boy Camera produces 4-bit Bitmap image files (approximately 24 kilobytes in size), BitBoy is the first device that extracts these Bitmap files directly, in a lossless process, so that users can save and print images en masse.|$|E
50|$|After the Game Boy Pocket {{came the}} Game Boy Light (a backlit Game Boy Pocket only {{released}} in Japan), and the Game Boy Color, all {{share the same}} link <b>cable</b> <b>port</b> design, and Game Boy Color games and original Game Boy games can both use a second generation cable. Therefore, the Game Boy Color {{is compatible with the}} MGB-008 and MGB-010. Despite this, the Game Boy Color did receive its own designated link cable, the Game Boy Color Game Link Cable (model CGB-003), however it was functionally identical to the MGB-008.|$|E
