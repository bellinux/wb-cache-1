That same month, Vaughan and Staples promoted the series by appearing together at the 2012 New York Comic Con, their first appearance together since the series' debut.

Finding <b>a</b> prime <b>cover,</b> <b>an</b> irredundant prime <b>cover,</b> or <b>a</b> minimal prime <b>cover</b> of <b>a</b> function f is a problem that arises in several fields of computer science, for instance in logic synthesis, automated reasoning, realiability analysis, and some optimization problems.

The Pirates experienced a surge in fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener.

Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to <b>cover</b> <b>a</b> seed cache.|$|E

5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to <b>cover</b> <b>a</b> portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still <b>cover</b> <b>a</b> portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E
