5|$|A {{major change}} from The Two Towers is the {{interactive}} {{nature of the}} game environments. The player <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to complete objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E

The Doctor struggles against his captors, who reveal that they have formed an alliance to imprison him in the Pandorica. Knowing the TARDIS exploding would cause the cracks destroying reality, they believe only the Doctor <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> the TARDIS, and thus removing him will prevent the explosion and save the universe. As the Doctor is sealed into the Pandorica, explosions surround the Earth in space before everything fades to black and silence.|$|E

5|$|The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol is in {{the process}} of being electrified. However because of cost overruns and delays, on 8 November 2016 the {{government}} announced that several elements of the programme would be deferred including electrification south west of Thingley Junction near Chippenham and Bristol Parkway. This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> as diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete. The electrification plans do not extend west of Bristol so local services will continue to be provided using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s cascaded from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on local services.|$|E
5|$|The SL95s make up 32 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the older}} SL79. The SL95s {{are the only}} {{bidirectional}} trams, and therefore {{the only ones that}} <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> on the Ullevål Hageby Line, that is served by lines 17 and 18. Since line 13 is a continuation of line 17 at Sinsen, the SL95s also operate on that line. Due to a too-small curve radius on the Briskeby Line, the SL95s do not operate on any of the lines to Majorstuen. They run on the Ullevål Hageby-, Ekeberg-, Sinsen-, Grünerløkka–Torshov-, Lilleaker- and Skøyen lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|E
5|$|The game uses {{both of the}} system's screens {{to offer}} new options. The top screen {{displays}} the normal gameplay, while the bottom touchscreen can function as an overhead map and touch controls. The overhead map displays the current course the player traverses and displays item locations. The touch controls include virtual buttons, which rotate the top screen's camera angle, and directional character controls, which <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> with either the DS stylus or the player's thumb using the DS wrist strap. In addition to the single-player adventure, the game includes 36 minigames and a multiplayer mode. Minigames are made accessible by catching rabbits in the main game. All minigames use the touchscreen to play, and are based on different themes: racing, card games, puzzles, and so forth. The multiplayer mode uses the wireless DS Download Play where up to four players compete against each other using Green, Red, Blue and Yellow Yoshi (voiced by Kazumi Totaka)—character hats appear in the stage allowing players to transform into either Mario, Luigi, or Wario. Wario can stun opponents by picking them up, swinging them, and throwing them.|$|E
