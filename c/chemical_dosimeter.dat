The experimental results from {{studies indicate that}} the activity of cavitation generated by bi- or multi-frequency ultrasound irradiation is higher than that caused by single frequency irradiation. In this study, effects dual (1 MHz and 40 kHz) and single frequency sonication on acoustic cavitation were investigated by <b>chemical</b> <b>dosimeter</b> using iodide. Methods: In this study, we investigated the exposure parameters in low level dual-frequency ultrasound in near fields of 40 kHz and 1 MHz in the progressive wave mode by <b>chemical</b> <b>dosimeter</b> using iodide. Finally, the effective protocol for enhancement of the inertial cavitation activity was determined. Results: It {{has been shown that}} the dosimeter absorbance in the continuous mode sonication is more than the pulse mode. Moreover, significant correlations were found between the time and intensity of single and dual frequency sonication and the iodide dosimeter absorbance. In constant energy, inertial cavitation activity in the pulse mode remained approximately constant. Among different combinations, the combined ultrasound sonication in continuous mode could produce a more remarkable enhancement of the inertial cavitation activity (1. 78 times) than the algebraic sum. Conclusion: Simultaneous combined dual frequency sonication is more effective than single frequency sonication in producing the inertial cavitation activity.

These effects are associated with the formation of cavitation bubbles that produce free radicals. Quantification (dosimetry) of chemical cavitation effects due to ultrasonic descalers has not been reported yet.

A mixture of chloroform and distilled water, at a 1 : 1 ratio, served as a <b>chemical</b> <b>dosimeter.</b> Cl ˚ ions, which are liberated during exposure to ultrasound, give rise to a weak hydrochloric acid (HCl).

40|$|AbstractIn {{radiation}} accident, {{detecting the}} accurate radiation rapidly {{is very important}} for rescuing wounded persons and dealing with the emergency. In the past decades, aqueous <b>chemical</b> <b>dosimeter</b> was widely used in the dose monitoring of radiation. However, each <b>chemical</b> <b>dosimeter</b> has a dose detection limit, for example, × 107 Gy for Frick dosimeter and 1000 Gy for FBX (ferrous sulphate- benzoic acid-xylenol orange) one. Those chemical dosimeters are not suitable for monitoring of dose less than 1000 Gy. In this work, CeO 2 nanowires were synthesized by a hydrothermal method for developing a new low dose aqueous -radiation dosimeter. The researching results showed that the aqueous CeO 2 nanowire dosimeter exhibited high sensitivity to -radiation of less than 1000 Gy dose and a good linear response in dose range from 20 Gy to 500 Gy. The radiation response mechanism of the CeO 2 nanowires aqueous - radiation dosimeter is given as well. Furthermore, the effect of the initial CeO 2 concentration on absorption varying rate of the CeO 2 nanowires aqueous -radiation dosimeter was also investigated. The results indicated that absorption varying rate increased with the CeO 2 concentration decreasing. In a lower concentration of 0. 05 mg/ml, the relative absorption variation rate of CeO 2 nanowires aqueous reached more than 83 % under 28 Gy. A radical scavenger (ethanol) was added in the CeO 2 nanowires aqueous to researching impact of radicals on the reaction of the CeO 2 nanowires with -ray. There was almost no change of the absorption observed after ethanol adding, indicating the radicals produced from water radiolysis were closely relevant to the reaction of the CeO 2 nanowires with -ray.

40|$|Nowadays, a {{wide variety}} of medical {{procedures}} make use of electromagnetic radiations. UV and X-rays are the most commonly employed. UV rays are used in phototherapy to treat different dermatologic diseases. Generally, patients are irradiated with UVA or UVB rays; the target of the exposure can be a small area of the skin or the whole body surface. In the past few years, several studies reported long term side effects of phototherapy. In radiotherapy, X-rays are employed for cancer treatment: a controlled dose is delivered to a localized region of the patient to kill the tumour. One of the most important objectives of radiotherapy treatments is to deliver the prescribed dose to the tumour and a minimum dose to the surrounding tissues. In recent years, treatment planning systems have become increasingly complex. The increasing complexity of the technology requires a corresponding increase in the sophistication of the verification of the treatment plan and its delivery.

Several solid-state chemical dosimeters have been fabricated and tested to measure the underwater UV, and in turn quantify the relationship between water column depth and DOC levels to the underwater UV field distribution. However, these dosimeters have only {{had the ability to}} measure UV exposures over short temporal increments, thus limiting the scope of the data.

The aim of this work is to study in a systematic way the influence of the pre-irradiation storage procedure upon sensitivity, dose response stability and lifetime of use of a FX gel system made with gelatin from porcine skin subjected to homogeneous irradiation. For this purpose, different pre-irradiation storage procedures, in terms of temperature and duration of each storage step, were investigated.

40|$|PURPOSE: At {{the high}} dose-per-pulse rates {{used by some}} {{intraoperative}} radiotherapy (IORT) units, the employment of ionization chambers for dose measurements needs an appropriate correction (k(sat)) for ion recombination. Through a revision of the existing literature, the authors compared different methods for {{the determination of the}} recombination correction factor and their impact on clinical dosimetry. METHODS: A dosimetric characterization of IORT electron beams from a Linac Hitesys Novac 7 (Aprilia-Latina, Italy) was performed. Dose-to-water (D(w)) values were measured with dose-per-pulse independent <b>chemical</b> <b>dosimeters</b> (operated by the Italian Primary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory, ENEA) and compared to doses obtained by two different parallel-plate ionization chamber models (Markus and Advanced Markus, PTW, Freiburg, Germany). For dose measurements using ionization chambers, the authors applied two different methods for the determination of the ion recombination correction factor (k(sat)), as suggested in previous articles. The first method is based on the experimental estimation of the free-electron fraction values p; the second one is based on the "nonstandard" two-voltage analysis including the free-electron component. RESULTS: For a Markus type chamber, there is a good agreement between the results on k(sat) and those reported in the literature for both methods, while for the Advanced Markus chamber, no data are available for comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing values of D(w) obtained by dose-per-pulse independent dosimeters and by ionization chambers measurements corrected using the two different approaches, the authors can conclude that the k(sat) factor determination is very critical and that only an experimental protocol using ionization chamber intercalibration can be considered reliable...|$|R

40|$|Various methodologies using a {{wide range}} of {{measurement}} systems have been employed previously {{in order to determine the}} amount of UV that could be incident upon various aquatic organisms in a number of different aquatic locales. Broadband meters and spectroradiometers have been employed extensively to take underwater measurements. However, these measurement campaigns are limited by the fact that radiometric equipment requires a human controller, constant power supply and regular calibrations and corrections in order to function properly. Dosimetric measurements have also been made underwater using two distinct types of dosimeter. The first type based on a synthetic chemical, like polysulphone, and the second type based on a biological matter, such as a DNA sample. The studies made using biological dosimeters have displayed very good results, however the time and skill necessary to make these types of dosimeters can outweigh their usefulness. The <b>chemical</b> <b>dosimeters</b> are easier to make and have also provided useable data, but only for short periods of exposure, usually no more than a day.

40|$|The {{effect of}} solar UV {{radiation}} (UV) upon the marine ecosystem {{has been well}} documented by many previous studies using a wide range of measurement and modeling techniques adapted to an extensive variety of underwater environments such as oceans, lakes, streams and creek beds. From these investigations it has been discovered that UVB radiation (wavelengths running from 280 to 320 nm) has a broad range of negative effects on aquatic biota, while the less energetic UVA radiation (wavelengths running from 320 to 400 nm) has the capability to both repair and damage various types of underwater life. Solar UV radiation also has the potential to cause damage to unprotected humans involved in various aquatic activities such as swimming, snorkeling and diving. The penetration and distribution of the UV field in an underwater environment is primarily dependent upon the water column depth and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level of the water, and therefore the capability of the UV to cause biological damage is also dependent upon these factors. Various chemical dosimeters have been fabricated and tested to measure the UV underwater, and in turn quantify the relationship between water column depth and DOC levels to the UV field distribution, but have only been able to record UV exposures over short time increments thus limiting the extent of the data.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Chemical {{dosimetry}} {{developed in}} response to needs created by developments {{in the field of}} high-energy radiation. Shortly after the discovery of X-rays in 1895 and of radioactivity in 1896, the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation were recognized. To guard against the injurious effects of radiation in medical application, dose-measuring methods were considered necessary. The early dosimetric methods were based on what at the time were taken to be the chemical effects of ionizing radiation. In 1902, Guido Holzknecht (1872 - 1931), a Viennese physician, suggested a method of dosimetry which was based on the coloration of a salt due to irradiation. His proposal, the first of its kind, was followed within about five years by a number of others which were made by other physicians and radiologists and which were based on some visible chemical change. Subsequent developments in chemical dosimetry until about 1915 were concerned mainly with the calibrated scales used to relate the chemical change to dose, the problem being a lack of a radiation unit of dose. Further investigations of chemical systems for dosimetry were not made, however, until in the 1920 's. In the meantime ionization methods of dosimetry became popular, although some of the earlier proposed <b>chemical</b> <b>dosimeters</b> were widely in use. The renewal of interest in the chemical effects of ionizing radiation in the 1920 's stemmed from the extensive radiobiological research that was conducted owing to the expanded application of higher-energy X-ray units in medicine and in industry. From the research done to understand better the mechanisms underlying biochemical processes, there proceeded several dosimetric systems. The one that proved most reliable was the ferrous sulfate system recommended in 1927 by the biophysicist Hugo Fricke (b. 1892). This renewed research on the chemical effects of ionizing radiation also made some significant contributions for future developments in chemical dosimetry. Most fundamental, both to the developing theories of radiation chemistry {{as well as to the}} formulation of many dosimetric systems in the post-World War II period, was the observation made by Fricke and associates that the primary action of the radiation was on the solvent rather than the solute. The discovery of the neutron and of artificial radioactivity and the development of accelerating devices in the 1930 's provided for still further application of ionizing radiation in medicine and in industry which increased the number of persons whose occupation was a source of radiation exposure. A growing concern for the protection of personnel contributed to attempts at standardizing dosage measurements. Although formal standardization began in 1928 when the roentgen was officially defined as a radiation unit by the International Commission on Radiological Units, it was not until 1962 that the rad was officially restricted as a unit of dose and the roentgen as a unit of exposure. The precision of the terminology contributed to more reliable dosimetry. The development of reactor technology in the 1940 's gave rise to new problems in radiation protection. To monitor the mixed radiation fields present in the vicinity of nuclear reactors, film badges had to be modified for the detection of various forms of radiation. Also, various filter assemblies were introduced into the badge to reduce the energy dependence of photographic emulsions, thus to improve the accuracy of the film dosimeter. Research in radiation chemistry and in nuclear technology in the post-war period called for dosimetric methods useful over a wide range of dosage and not necessarily as sensitive as those required by research in medicine and radiobiology. As a result, chemical dosimetric systems effective over a range from about 10 to 10 ¹⁰ rads were made available. Although many of the systems were formulated on the basis of the indirect action of the radiation on the solute via the solvent, not every system had a comparable reliability nor did each meet all the requirements desirable of a dosimetric system...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Radiosensitisation {{caused by}} {{titanium}} dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 -NPs) is investigated using phantoms (PRESAGE® dosimeters) and in vitro using {{two types of}} cell lines, cultured human keratinocyte (HaCaT) and prostate cancer (DU 145) cells. Methods: Anatase TiO 2 -NPs were synthesised, characterised and functionalised to allow dispersion in culture-medium for in vitro studies and halocarbons (PRESAGE® <b>chemical</b> compositions). PRESAGE® <b>dosimeters</b> were scanned with spectrophotometer to determine the radiation dose enhancement. Clonogenic and cell viability assays were employed to determine cells survival curves from which the dose enhancement levels "radiosensitisation" are deduced. Results: Comparable levels of radiosensitisation were observed in both phantoms and cells at kilovoltage ranges of x-ray energies (slightly higher in vitro). Significant radiosensitisation (~ 67 %) of control was also noted in cells at megavoltage energies (commonly used in radiotherapy), compared to negligible levels detected by phantoms. This difference is attributed to biochemical effects, specifically the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which are only manifested in aqueous environments of cells and are non-existent in case of phantoms. Conclusions: This research shows that TiO 2 -NPs improve the efficiency of dose delivery, which has implications for future radiotherapy treatments. Literature shows that Ti 2 O 3 -NPs {{can be used as}} imaging agents hence with these findings renders these NPs as theranostic agents...|$|R
40|$|This {{volume is}} the first in a planned series of reports {{intended}} to provide a comprehensive record of all the biological and medical experiments and samples flown on the Space Shuttle. Experiments described have been conducted over a five-year period, beginning with the first plant studies conducted on STS- 2 in November 1981, and extending through STS 61 -C, the last mission to fly before the tragic Challenger accident of January 1986. Experiments were sponsored within NASA not only by the Life Sciences Division of the Office of Space Science and Applications, but also by the Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) and the Get Away Special (GAS) Program. Independent medical studies were conducted as well on the Shuttle crew {{under the auspices of the}} Space Biomedical Research Institute at Johnson Space Center. In addition, cooperative agreements between NASA and foreign government agencies led to a number of independent experiments and also paved the way for the joint US/ESA Spacelab 1 mission and the German (DFVLR) Spacelab D- 1. Experiments included: (1) medically oriented studies of the crew aimed at identifying, preventing, or treating health problems due to space travel; (2) projects to study morphological, physiological, or behavioral effects of microgravity on animals and plants; (3) studies of the effects of microgravity on cells and tissues; and (4) radiation experiments monitoring the spacecraft environment with <b>chemical</b> or biological <b>dosimeters</b> or testing radiation effects on simple organisms and seeds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development, testing {{and application of}} a <b>chemical</b> film UV <b>dosimeter</b> based on the polymer Poly (2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide) (PPO) prepared especially for long – term high – exposure underwater use. Initial testing of the dosimeter was performed in a water tank within a controlled laboratory environment with an artificial UV source in which various optical and physical properties of the film were rigorously tested such as UV dose and depth response, cosine response, interdosimeter variation, dose rate independence, dark reaction, watermarking effect, exposure additivity and visible and UVA wavelength response. In each of these tests the PPO dosimeter displayed results proving {{that it could be}} reliably used in aquatic environments at a level of accuracy only slightly lower than what could be expected for in – air dosimetric measurements. The use of a polyethylene derived neutral density filter (NDF) was then employed with the PPO dosimeter in order to extend exposure time. Results from this investigation showed that the polyethylene NDF could extend the effective life time of the PPO dosimeter by as much as five days in early autumn. Following this the PPO dosimeter was calibrated in the field to the solar erythemal action spectrum in – air and to the solar UVB spectrum in clear water, creek water, sea water and dam water over the duration of a year. In both the in – air and underwater calibrations {{it was found that the}} response of the PPO dosimeter lasted over a much greater amount of time when compared to the more commonly used polysulphone dosimeter and also varied with the modulation of the incident solar spectrum brought on by changing SZA and fluctuations in atmospheric column ozone. Additionally, it was discovered that in – air and underwater calibration regimes could not be interchanged and that the PPO dosimeter response underwater is dependent upon water type, but only when transmission spectra differed between two water types by a difference on average of more than 5 % across the UVB waveband. As a final test, the PPO dosimeter was deployed over a year to take UVB exposure measurements with the use of a custom built submersible float in three different real – world field environments that included a creek, a sea water tank and a stagnant dam. Exposures could be measured reliably up to a depth of 5 cm in the creek water and the dam water and up to and possibly beyond a depth of 35 cm in the sea water. From the sea water PPO dosimeter measurements a series of attenuation coefficients were estimated for each season. These coefficients showed reasonable agreement when compared to attenuation coefficient calculations made using a calibrated spectrometer in the same sea water, further proving the usefulness of the PPO dosimeter...|$|R
