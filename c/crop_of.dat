5|$|A {{trap crop}} is a <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> {{a plant that}} attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|According to The Census of the Peach <b>Crop</b> <b>of</b> 1907 in West Virginia {{published}} by the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Kuykendall was engaged {{in the management of}} a commercial peach orchard near Romney known as Sherman Orchard. In 1907, Kuykendall's orchard produced Carman, Champion, Elberta, Salways, Bilyeu, and Heath Cling peach varieties, totaling 5,800 baskets in all.|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{in natural}} desert and agro-ecosystems was {{investigated}} in the middle sector of Egypt. The vegetation was classified by the Two Way Indicator Species Analysis technique (TWINSPAN) into nine vegetational groups representing seven habitat types: desert, fallow land, winter <b>crops</b> <b>of</b> old cultivated land, summer <b>crops</b> <b>of</b> old cultivated land, Citrus orchards, winter <b>crops</b> <b>of</b> reclaimed land, and summer <b>crops</b> <b>of</b> reclaimed land. Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) demonstrates that soil factors especially soil texture, CaCO 3, organic carbon and electric conductivity contribute significantly to the distribution of species. In all habitat types, species diversity is higher in winter than in summer season. The weed species diversity is greater in the reclaimed areas compared to the old cultivated land and in winter crops than in summer ones...|$|R

5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was one of}} {{the last}} <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> foals sired by Danehill one of the most {{successful}} stallions of the last twenty years, producing the winners of more than a thousand races, including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Dylan Thomas, Rock of Gibraltar, George Washington and North Light. Love Me True is a half-sister to Shuailaan (Winter Hill Stakes), Madison's Charm (Comely Stakes) and Bite The Bullet (Sanford Stakes), and, as a granddaughter of Lassie Dear, is closely related to Summer Squall, A. P. Indy and Lemon Drop Kid.|$|E
5|$|Former player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976. At {{the age of}} 34, {{he became}} the {{youngest}} Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and a <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (1978, 1979 and 1980), and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final on penalties. The club's only trophy during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final, widely regarded as a classic.|$|E

5|$|Jersey Royal {{potatoes}} are the local {{variety of new}} potato, and the island {{is famous for its}} early <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields).

5|$|The {{principal}} <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> the Mikea is corn, {{which was}} introduced to Madagascar in the 1890s. They also occasionally grow manioc. The dry season is used to cut new corn fields, which are burned in October (swidden agriculture, locally termed hatsaky) and planted in November and December as the rains begin to fall. This corn is harvested three months later and consumed during the wet season; surplus is dried and sold, with some saved for the following year's planting and consumption. The traders who gather the maize from the Mikea process it for international export at a significant profit.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his second <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|John Slade was a grain merchant, {{who claimed}} that Humphrey Morley had agreed to buy a <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> wheat and rye from him, paying £16, and had reneged on the agreement. He brought the case before the Assizes in 1596, where it was heard by two judges; one of the Common Pleas, {{and one of the}} King's Bench. It was heard under assumpsit, and the jury found that Morley indeed owed Slade money. Before a {{judgment}} could be issued, Popham had the case transferred to an older version of the Court of Exchequer Chamber, which, sitting in Serjeant's Inn, allowed the King's Bench judges to sit.|$|E

5|$|Leguat {{stated that}} the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited by the amount of crop milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
5|$|Like most of India, {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, and plums are widely grown and important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes. As 86% of the state consists of hills, the yield per hectare is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills.|$|E
5|$|Orme was a bay colt born in 1889 at Eaton Stud in Cheshire. He was bred by the 1st Duke of Westminster. Orme stood 16 hands {{high and}} had a large white star, with no other white markings. His sire was the unbeaten 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and St. Leger winner Ormonde. Orme was one of Ormonde's first <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> foals. By the time Orme reached a racecourse, Ormonde had been {{exported}} to Argentina. Ormonde did not become a great sire due to fertility problems, producing only a few foals most years. However, he did also sire Goldfinch, a horse that was a top class two-year-old and won the New Stakes. In the United States, he sired Futurity Stakes winner Ormondale. Orme was clear-winded, unlike his sire, who was a roarer.|$|E

5|$|Sherwood {{lived in}} Pungo, Princess Anne County (today part of Virginia Beach), and married James Sherwood, a planter, in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. Her first case was in 1697; she {{was accused of}} casting a spell on a bull, {{resulting}} in its death, but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> one of them. Sherwood sued for slander after each accusation, but her lawsuits were unsuccessful {{and her husband had}} to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County (her husband had died in 1701). She did not remarry, and lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80.|$|E
5|$|The Rashtrakuta {{economy was}} {{sustained}} by its natural and agricultural produce, its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests. Cotton {{was the chief}} <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> the regions of southern Gujarat, Khandesh and Berar. Minnagar, Gujarat, Ujjain, Paithan and Tagara were important centres of textile industry. Muslin cloth were manufactured in Paithan and Warangal. The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from Bharoch. White calicos were manufactured in Burhanpur and Berar and exported to Persia, Turkey, Poland, Arabia and Egypt. The Konkan region, ruled by the feudatory Silharas, produced large quantities of betel leaves, coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore, ruled by the feudatory Gangas, produced such woods as sandal, timber, teak and ebony. Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of Thana and Saimur.|$|E
5|$|The water mould (oomycete) Bremia lactucae has {{infected}} commercial {{crops in}} Italy and California. In 2002 on the Ligurian coast, widespread infection of several cultivars, most severely 'Florabella Pink' {{and to a}} lesser extent 'Florabella Gold' and 'Florabella White', resulted in leaf blistering and the development of chlorotic lesions on the leaves, and white patches on the undersides, particularly in areas of poor ventilation. There was an outbreak of downy mildew in a cultivated <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> Xerochrysum bracteatum in San Mateo County, California in 2006, in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions. A Phytoplasma infection damaged X.bracteatum crops in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001, causing poor growth, bronzing of foliage, and malformation of flower heads. Genetically, the pathogen was indistinguishable from the agent of aster yellows. The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) attacks and forms galls on the roots, which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant.|$|E
