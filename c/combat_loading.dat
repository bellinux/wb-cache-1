5|$|On 16 September 1941, the 45th Infantry Division, under Major General William S. Keys, was federalized {{from state}} control into the regular army force. It {{was one of}} four National Guard {{divisions}} to be federalized, alongside the 30th, the 41st and 44th Infantry Divisions, originally for a one-year period. Its men immediately began basic combat training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Throughout 1942, it continued this training at Camp Barkeley, Texas, before moving to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, to undergo amphibious assault training in preparation for an invasion of Italy. It then moved to Pine Camp, New York briefly for winter warfare training, but was hampered by continuously poor weather. In January 1943 it moved to Fort Pickett, Virginia, for its final training. The division, now commanded by Major General Troy H. Middleton, a Regular Army soldier and highly distinguished World War I veteran, moved to the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation's Camp Patrick Henry to await <b>combat</b> <b>loading</b> on the transports.|$|E
25|$|The Glock 17P, 22P, and Glock 17R are all {{training}} pistols for practicing hand-to-hand <b>combat,</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading of the pistol. These Glocks {{are identical}} {{to a standard}} Glock 17/22 except for their red frame; some models have an inert barrel (without a chamber, thus preventing the accidental chambering of a live cartridge) and no firing pin hole in the breech face (preventing someone from using a live barrel with the training slide). The difference between models is that to perform a 'reset' of the trigger, a cycling of the slide has to be performed on the 17P/22P, {{but not on the}} 17R.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were built: W4052, W4053 and W4073. The second and third, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer. This caused some delays since half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the required higher <b>combat</b> <b>loading.</b> The nose sections also had to be changed from a design with a clear perspex bomb-aimer's position, to one with a solid nose housing four [...]303 machine guns and their ammunition.|$|E

5000|$|Joint {{exercises}} in 1941 {{resulted in a}} decision that the Navy {{would be responsible for}} providing the transports for joint operations against enemy resistance. As the war progressed specialized types of ships were developed for the United States Navy, generally termed combat loaders, and specifically designated APA (transport, attack), and AKA (cargo ship, attack). Army doctrine, after some discussion as to whether the port commander or force commander should be responsible, settled on the commander of the landing force being responsible for <b>combat</b> <b>loading</b> Army forces. <b>Combat</b> <b>loading</b> for Army in the Pacific was organized under the Army Port and Service Command as directed by force commanders. Navy Attack cargo ships were assigned a specially-trained Marine Corps officer called the [...] "transport quartermaster" [...] or [...] "combat cargo officer" [...] to oversee their proper <b>combat</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Combat</b> <b>loading</b> is {{a special}} type of unit loading of ships so that {{embarked}} forces will have immediately needed weapons, ammunition and supplies stowed {{in such a way}} that unloading of equipment will be concurrent with the force personnel and available for immediate combat during an amphibious landing. It gives primary consideration to the ease and sequence with which troops, equipment, and supplies can be unloaded ready for combat, rather than to the efficient use of cargo space as in convoy loading where forces and equipment would be joined in rear or secure areas. The art and science of <b>combat</b> <b>loading</b> were developed in World War II, and contributed greatly to the success of Allied amphibious campaigns. While <b>combat</b> <b>loading</b> usually took place in forward bases, the Western Task Force for the landings in North Africa was combat loaded at the Army's Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation which was called on again for the Sicily force.|$|E
