Two years after his parole, Gaskins was arrested for the rape of a twelve-year-old girl, but he absconded while awaiting sentence. He was rearrested in Georgia and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. Gaskins was paroled in November 1968.Upon his release, Gaskins moved {{to the town of}} Sumter and began work with Fort Roofing company. His first non-prison-related murder victim was a hitchhiker whom he tortured and murdered in September 1969, before sinking her body in a swamp. In his memoirs, he wrote: [...] "All I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> how I <b>could</b> do anything I wanted to her." [...] This hitchhiker was to be the first of many he picked up and killed while driving around the coastal highways of the American South. He classified these victims as [...] "coastal kills": people, both male and female, whom he killed purely for pleasure, on average approximately once every six weeks, when he went hunting to quell his feelings of [...] "bothersome-ness". He tortured and mutilated his victims, while attempting to keep them alive for as long as possible. He confessed to killing these victims using a variety of methods including stabbing, suffocation, mutilation, and even claimed to have cannibalized some of them. He later confessed to killing [...] "eighty to ninety" [...] such victims, although his claims to have committed any [...] "coastal kills" [...] have never been corroborated. In his autobiography, Final Truth, Gaskins claims to have committed coastal kills every six weeks, yet contradicts this claim later in the book by stating he felt the overpowering need to seek out and commit a coastal kill by the 10th date of each calendar month.|$|R

St. Thomas was the namer of them to Dante.

I was deeply confused, and our aggressive production schedule didn't allow for the story re-working that usually takes place on a theatrical feature. Share Stallings, one of our creative executives on the project, was very supportive and offered encouragement to the crew.
