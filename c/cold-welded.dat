50|$|Unlike {{cold welding}} process at macro-scale which {{normally}} requires large applied pressures, scientists discovered that single-crystalline ultrathin gold nanowires (diameters less than 10 nm) can be <b>cold-welded</b> together within seconds by mechanical contact alone, and under remarkably low applied pressures. High-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} and in-situ measurements reveal that the welds are nearly perfect, with the same crystal orientation, strength and electrical conductivity {{as the rest of}} the nanowire. The high quality of the welds is attributed to the nanoscale sample dimensions, oriented-attachment mechanisms and mechanically assisted fast surface diffusion.Nanoscale welds were also demonstrated between gold and silver, and silver and silver, indicating that the phenomenon may be generally applicable and therefore offer an atomistic view of the initial stages of macroscopic cold welding for either bulk metals or metallic thin film.|$|E

The effects of impurities (within the possible interfaces) are explored for contacts and interfacial fracture between layers that are relevant to model OLEDs. The models are used to study the effects of adhesion, pressure, thin film layer thickness and dust particle modulus (between the contacting surfaces) on contact profiles around impurities between <b>cold-welded</b> thin films. The lift-off stage of thin films (during cold welding) is then modeled as an interfacial fracture process.

40|$|International audienceA Si-based anode with {{improved}} performance {{can be achieved}} using high-energy ball-milling as a cheap and easy process to produce Si powders prepared from a coarse-grained material. Ball-milled powders present all the advantages of nanometric Si powders, but not the drawbacks. Milled powders are nanostructured with micrometric agglomerates (median size [similar] 10 μm), made of submicrometric <b>cold-welded</b> particles with a crystallite size of [similar] 10 nm. The micrometric particle size provides handling and non-toxicity advantages compared to nanometric powders, as well as four times higher tap density. The nanostructuration is assumed to provide a shortened Li+ diffusion path, a fast Li+ diffusion path along grain boundaries and a smoother phase transition upon cycling. Compared to non-milled 1 - 5 μm powders, the improved performance of nanostructured milled Si powders is linked to a strong lowering of particle disconnection at each charge, while the irreversibility due to SEI formation remains unchanged. An electrode prepared in acidic conditions with the CMC binder achieves 600 cycles at more than 1170 mA h per gram of the milled Si-based electrode, in an electrolyte containing FEC/VC SEI-forming additives, with a coulombic efficiency above 99 %, compared to less than 100 cycles at the same capacity for an electrode containing nanometric Si powder...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a number}} of special ultrasonic NDE problems of particular interest o inertia and friction welds, {{but most of the}} results can be readily applied to other similar or dissimilar solid-state bonds as well. One of the major problems associated with dissimilar bonds is the "blinding " effect of the strong interface reflection caused by the inherent elastic discontinuity at the otherwise flawless boundary. A novel signal-processing technique based on the symmetric part of the boundary reflections from the two opposite sides of the interface is introduced and shown to yield a quantitative measure of boundary imperfection even for very good, apparently flawless bonds. The second problem addressed in this paper is the so-called "cold-weld " effect. As a combined result of heat softening and external pressure, intimate mechanical contact can be achieved without real fusion. Frequency analysis of the reflected ultrasonic signal from such <b>cold-welded</b> areas is shown to be capable of measuring the degree of plastic deformation at the contacting surfaces and, indirectly, to assess interface pressure and temperature. The third problem considered in this paper is the ultrasonic evaluation of the characteristic layered distribution of the grain structure in flawless inertia and friction welds. As an example, the thickness of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) was determined by ultrasonic spectroscopy, and the results were found to be in good agreement with independent optical profile measurements. Furthermore, the HAZ thickness i shown to be strongly correlated to welding pressure, therefore it offers a sensitive indicator for bond quality assessment aswell.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of electronic systems in vehicles is rapidly increasing, {{and as a}} consequence, the long-term reliability of automotive connectors has become an important issue. The aims of this thesis have been: 1. to characterize the friction, wear and electrical properties of tin coatings, 2. to achieve an improved fundamental understanding of the deterioration processes caused by wear and fretting corrosion, 3. to propose improvements of tin coatings systems for electrical connectors. The required insertion force has {{a significant impact on}} the design and the cost of a connector. A reduced insertion force can be achieved by reduced contact load and/or reduced tin coating thickness, but this will increase the risk of fretting corrosion. Wear during the insertion stroke is essential in order to wipe off the non-conductive oxide layer. However, a thin tin layer may become worn off after only a few insertion strokes. The rider will then partly slide on the hard intermetallic compound formed between the substrate and the residual tin. Due to the restricted wear when sliding on the intermetallic compound more oxide will be formed during sliding than is removed and consequently the electrical contact resistance will increase. Two semi-empirical models are proposed, the first describing the contact resistance when the rider plows the free tin layer, and the second describing the contact resistance increase due to oxidation when the rider slides on the intermetallic compound. Two novel methods to improve the performance of pre-tinned material were evaluated. The first involves the use of a lubricant in combination with a textured surface, to improve the supply of lubricant into the contact spot. The second involves the addition of small amounts of a preferential oxidation additive to the tin. This increases the possibility of achieving a <b>cold-welded</b> contact spot, which results in an ultimately stable connection...|$|E

40|$|As part of {{the ongoing}} {{scientific}} effort {{to develop a new}} amalgam-like material without mercury, a team of metallurgists and electrochemists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, announced in 1993 {{the development of a new}} Ag-Sn dental alloy system without mercury that sought to replace conventional dental amalgams. They used spherical Ag 3 Sn and Ag 4 Sn intermetallic dental alloy particles, commonly used in conventional dental alloys, and coated them with electrodeposited silver with newly-developed electrolytic and immersion techniques. The particles had relatively pure silver coatings that were closely adherent to the intermetalfic cores. ^ These silver-coated particles, due to silver 2 ̆ 7 s plasticity at room temperature, were condensed into Plexiglas® molds with the aid of an acidic surface activating solution (HBF 4) and a mechanical condensing device, producing a metal-matrix composite with Ag 3, 4 Sn filler particles surrounded by a <b>cold-welded</b> silver matrix. Since silver strain hardens rather easily, the layers had to be condensed in less than 0. 5 mm increments to obtain a dense structure. Mechanical testing at NIST produced compressive strength values equal to or greater than those of conventional dental amalgams. ^ Because of its potential for eliminating mercury as a constituent in dental amalgam, this material created a stir in dental circles when first developed and conceivably could prove to be a major breakthrough in the field of dental restoratives. To date, the chief impediments to its approval for human clinical applications by the Food and Drug Administration are the potentially-toxic surface activating solution used for oxide reduction, and the high condensation pressures needed for cold welding because of the tendency for silver to strain harden. ^ In this related study, the author, who has practiced general dentistry for 25 years, evaluates some of the mechanical and microstructural properties of these electrochemically coated particles when they are amalgamated with mercury. Because of patent restrictions for the coated particles that protect the cold-welding work being done at NIST, these particles necessarily had to include mercury as a constituent for this investigation.

40|$|The Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System (ProSEDS), {{which is}} an on-orbit {{demonstration}} of the propulsion capabilities of electrodynamic tethers in space, is a secondary payload on a Delta 11 unmanned expendable booster. The ProSEDS tether consists of a 5 km bare electrodynamic tether and a 1 0 -km non-conductive leader tether. Near the Delta 11, 160 m of the conductive tether is insulated to prevent plasma electron collection from the plasma contactor and for other science requirements. The remainder of the 5 -km conductive tether is coated with a new conductive coating to collect plasma electrons. A bare metal tether easily collects electrons from the plasma, but thermal concerns preclude this design. A highly emissive conductive polymer developed by Triton Systems, Inc. has been optimized for both conductivity and thermo-optical properties. The current design for the ProSEDS conductive tether is seven individually coated strands of 28 AWG aluminum wire, coated with an atomic oxygen-resistant conductive polymer composed of a mixture of COR (Colorless Oxygen Resistant) and polyanaline (PANI) known as C-COR (Conductive-Colorless Oxygen Resistant). The conductive-coated wire strands are <b>cold-welded</b> to individually coated strands of the insulated tether.

40|$|The Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) experiment, an {{instrument}} suite to be flown on Mars Surveyor 2001, {{will include a}} tool for doing simple mineralogical scratch and streak tests on particles from the Martian regolith. The Abrasion Tool will be applied to particles that adhere themselves to highly polished substrates of various hardnesses. Granular soil components will be subjected to a compressive force of about 3 N using a leaf spring. The spring will be applied with a paraffin actuator capable of a 0. 76 mm throw to achieve a maximum displacement of about 7. 5 mm {{at the tip of}} the tool. The pressure per grain will be dependent on the grain size, the number of grains that adhere to the substrate and the number of grains in compression. The pressure per particle is expected to be on the order of 100 MPa - 1 GPa. The MECA sample wheel containing the substrates will be rotated after the particles are placed in compression to produce scratches or pits. A primary goal of the Abrasion Tool is to identify quartz (Mohs' hardness = 7) using substrates of varying hardnesses. Quartz is considered hazardous to future human explorers of Mars because it can cause silicosis of the lungs if it is of respirable size. It is also hazardous to machinery, structures, and space suits because of its ability to abrade and scratch surfaces. Since large quantities of minerals harder than quartz are not expected, any scratches produced on polished quartz substrates might be reasonably attributed to quartz particles, although there may be minerals such as impact metamorphic diamond in the soils. Careful calibration of the tool will be necessary to ensure that grains are not overloaded; for example, a steel ball pressed into glass will produce a Hertzian fracture, even though it is softer than glass. Other minerals, such as magnetite (Mohs' hardness = 6. 5) have been shown to scratch glass ceramics such as Zerodur (Mohs' hardness = 6. 5). Thus, minerals can be differentiated: note that regardless of the mineral species, if any particle is harder than 6. 5 it will certainly be an interesting discovery for both planetary geology and human exploration concerns. The scratches will be identified using the 6 X optical microscope and profiled with the atomic force microscope included in the MECA instrument suite. Analysis of the scratch morphology will yield evidence concerning the shape of the particle responsible for producing each scratch. For example, angular grains should leave vertical cracks with microconchoidal lateral chipping, while rounded grains might leave chatter marks, or nested partial Hertzian cracks. Particle shape can thus be inferred from these indentation modes, as well as material hardness. In addition, particle size information may also be available if pits caused by rolling particles can be identified. Converse to scratching, the minerals may be crushed at their contact points, and be smeared onto the target substrates to leave what geologists refer to as "streaks". These are <b>cold-welded</b> trails of mineral material that have structure and color indicative of mineral composition. The AFM will determine the morphology of these streaks, while the microscope will ascertain the color. On the harder substrates, we might expect streaking to dominate; on the softer substrates, scratching may dominate. Progressions of material interactions across the substrate selection will be a valuable source of data for mineral discrimination. It should also be noted that many minerals have coatings (such as iron oxides), and these will have to be differentiated from the host mineral grains; laboratory tests will establish the effects of such coatings on the scratch results. Finally, we note that the microscope will provide corroborative data regarding likely mineral species by grain shapes, fracture patterns, surface textures, color, and UV fluorescence reactions.

Owing to the continuous defect accumulation and interface renewal, both structural and chemical transformations occur. The nature {{and the rate of}} such transformations have been shown to depend on variables, such as impact velocity and collision frequency that depend, in turn, on the whole dynamics of the system. The characterization of the ball dynamics under different impact conditions is then to be considered a necessary step in order to gain a satisfactory control of the experimental set up. In this paper we investigate the motion of a ball in a milling device. Since the ball motion is governed by impulsive forces acting during each collision, no analytical expression for the complete ball trajectory can be obtained. In addition, mechanical systems exhibiting impacts are strongly nonlinear due to sudden changes of velocities at the instant of impact. Many different types of periodic and chaotic impact motions exist indeed even for simple systems with external periodic excitation forces. We present results of the analysis on the ball trajectory, obtained from a suitable numerical model, under growing degree of impact elasticity. A route to high dimensional chaos is obtained. Crisis and attractors merging are also found...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{engineering}} mechanisms exhibit ball-to-flat surface contacts which are periodically closed for several (thousands of) times. The impact during closing can eventually degrade the mechanism's surface layers {{whether they are}} natural oxides, chemical conversion films or even metallic coatings. This can dramatically increase the tendency of these contacting surfaces to <b>cold-welding.</b> A specially designed laboratory apparatus- called the "impact facility", has been fabricated at the Austrian Research Centre (ARC) and used to investigate {{the influence of the}} two main parameters likely to cause "cold-welding ". These are: 1 the impact energy, and 2) the static load, which determine whether the surfaces under test will "cold-weld " together. The adhesion force, i. e. the force required to re-open the "cold-welded" contact, was measured after each contact cycle. Experiments with stainless steel (type 17 - 7 PH) in contact with itself under vacuum will be presented. It was found that the adhesion force increased directly with an increase in static load. Under impact conditions, with energies greater than the Hertzian limit, no significant relationship was found between impact energy and adhesion force. Further "cold-welding" experiments were conducted on various pairs of metals. These have enhanced our knowledge of the behaviour of coatings, such as TiC or MoS 2 -film on stainless steel. Additional results will compare the ability of MoS 2 to lower the adhesion force between materials when it is present either as a surface film, or present within the microstructure of the composite materials Ag 15 MoS 2 and Vespel SP 3. A final model will be demonstrated in order to show how results from the ARC equipment can be compared to those laboratory results generated by a different test equipment that was independently fabricated by the company CSEM. 1...|$|R
40|$|NEAScout, a 6 U cubesat and {{secondary}} payload on NASA's EM- 1, will use an 85 sq m solar sail {{to travel to}} a near-earth asteroid at about 1 Astronomical Unit (about 1. 5 x 10 (exp 8) km) for observation and reconnaissance 1. A combination of reaction wheels, reaction control system, and a slow rotisserie roll about the solar sail's normal axis were expected to handle attitude control and adjust for imperfections in the deployed sail during the 2. 5 -year mission. As the design for NEAScout matured, one of the critical design parameters, the offset {{in the center of}} mass and center of pressure (CP/CM offset), proved to be sub-optimal. After significant mission and control analysis, the CP/CM offset was accommodated by the addition of a new subsystem to NEAScout. This system, called the Active Mass Translator (AMT), would reside near the geometric center of NEAScout and adjust the CM by moving one portion of the flight system relative to the other. The AMT was given limited design space - 17 mm of the vehicle's assembly height-and was required to generate +/- 8 cm by +/- 2 cm translation to sub-millimeter accuracy. Furthermore, the design must accommodate a large wire bundle of small gage, single strand wire and coax cables fed {{through the center of the}} mechanism. The bend radius, bend resistance, and the exposure to deep space environment complicates the AMT design and operation and necessitated a unique design to mitigate risks of wire bundle damage, binding, and <b>cold-welding</b> during operation. This paper will outline the design constraints for the AMT, discuss the methods and reasoning for design, and identify the lessons learned through the designing, breadboarding and testing for the low-profile translation stages with wire feedthrough capability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNominal Ti 2 Ni was {{synthesized}} under argon {{atmosphere at}} room temperature using a planetary high-energy ball mill. The effect of milling time and Zr substitution for Ti on the microstructure was characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM, and the discharge capacities of Ti 2 xZrxNi (x 1 / 4 0, 0. 1, 0. 2) were examined by electrochemical measurements at galvanostatic conditions. XRD analysis shows that amorphous phase of Ti 2 Ni can be elaborated by 60 h of milling, whereas Zr substitution hinders amorphization process of the system. The products of ball milling nominal Ti 2 xZrxNi (x 1 / 4 0. 1, 0. 2) were austenitic (Ti, Zr) Ni and partly TiO, {{despite the fact that}} the operation was carried out under argon atmosphere. By comparing the SEM micrographs, it is found that the amorphous phase of Ti 2 Ni was formed in the stage of <b>cold-welding</b> during milling, while with Zr substitution particles were flaky and finer, inhomogeneous in size distribution with massive agglomeration. TEM analysis was carried out and confirmed the observations via XRD. In the electrochemical tests, amorphous Ti 2 Ni shows the best discharge capacity at 102 mAh/g at a current density of 40 mA/g. Without need of activation, it exhibits extraordinary cycling stability under room temperature. On the other hand, the effect of Zr substitution on the electrochemical property of Ti 2 Ni is tricky, as superficially the discharge capacity drops drastically with Zr substitution, but with increase of Zr content (from x 1 / 4 0. 1 to x 1 / 4 0. 2), the discharge capacity increases generally, which credits to larger unit-cell-volume provided by ZrNi compared to TiNi. It is also found that the TieNi system becomes significantly susceptible to oxidation when Zr is introduced to the initial powders as mechanical alloying is deployed as a synthesis method...|$|R
40|$|The {{unlimited}} {{applications of}} nanoparticles {{in human life}} are increasing day by day. Nanoparticles have drawn attention among researchers from academia to industry due to its large specific surface area, high chemical reactivity, physical affinity and interesting optical, electrical and magnetic properties. These properties of nanoparticles stimulate researchers to reduce particle sizes from few sub micrometers to nanometer levels. The successful application of nanoparticles depends on {{the simplicity of the}} methods for its cost effective synthesis. Since the very beginning of nanoscience, development of simple, low cost and high yielding methods has been a challenging task. Various approaches were proposed for the commercial production of nanomaterials from solid state. However, chemical method which is complicated and expensive showed limited success in the synthesis of controlled structure nanoparticles from rare-earth solid compounds. Among all the approaches, high energy ball milling with surfactant has been widely exploited for the synthesis of various nanomaterials, nanograins, nanocomposites from solid state. Self-assembled structures of surfactants provide a valuable tool for the controlled formation of nanostructure. In this process, the dispersion and enhanced grinding of particles are achieved in the reaction centers that reside in the microstructure of surfactants. In high-energy ball milling, plastic deformation, <b>cold-welding</b> and fracture are predominant factors which lead to a change in particle shape, size. These result in the formation of fine and dispersed particles. Stirred ball mill grinding is advantageous for nanoparticle production over other fine grinding techniques owing to its easy operation, simple construction, high size reduction rate and relatively low energy consumption. The aim of this systematic review is to represent the basic concept and applications of mechanical milling in the surfactant assisted synthesis of various nanomaterial, nanocomposite and nanocarbon materials...|$|R
