40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the introduction of}} virtual communities into the IP Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) framework. IMS allows (mobile) telecommunications providers to offer their users services based on and built upon Internet applications, services and protocols. Virtual communities {{have the ability to}} offer an access control and organizational mechanism for the distributed IMS networks services. IMS services are extra services that telecom operators can offer their clients such as voicemail, mobile child locator or <b>call</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>service.</b> This thesis investigates how a virtual community architecture can be used in the IMS network. Along with this it also considers {{the pros and cons of}} deploying the Virtual Communities components on either the mobile device or in the IMS infrastructure. As a proof of concept, an example application was built based on an existing Virtual Community framework named VICSDA. The proof of concept showed that implementing Virtual Communities in an IMS network is possible with very few changes to the D 3. 11 VICSDA framework. The changes are primarily due to using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as the transport protocol. Using SIP was necessary for communicating over the IMS network. The paper for which this proof of concept was built was subsequently accepted and shall be presented at the second conference on internet multimedia architecture and application (IMSAA) in 2008...|$|E

It is very important to note the importance of queuing models when it’s related to call center model because it helps with various calculation of the waiting time,service level,arival rate,staffing etc. All these mentioned are the instruments used to analyze a call center modelling.

40|$|Abstract [...] Strategic {{customers}} {{take their}} waiting time into consideration upon making decisions. While satisfactorily completed service increases utility of a customer, {{waiting to be}} served decreases this utility in a queueing type service system. In this system, waiting can be classified into two: in queue <b>waiting</b> and in <b>service</b> <b>waiting.</b> Unlike the literature, proposed model assumes waiting in a queue, while other customers are being served, differs from <b>waiting</b> in <b>service</b> where the former one decreases the utility of a customer more. This paper analyzes decision making of a customer under this assumption. Comparing decision of the customer under proposed assumption and literature assumption, this paper shows that in queue <b>waiting</b> differs in <b>service</b> <b>waiting.</b> Index Term [...] Strategic customer, M/M/ 1, in queue <b>waiting,</b> in <b>service</b> <b>waiting,</b> observable queues, unobservable queue...|$|R
