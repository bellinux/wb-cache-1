Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> misfortune and failures.

5|$|During the non-breeding season, storks in the Indian region {{disperse}} widely, {{mainly in}} the Gangetic Plains and sightings from the Deccan region are rare. Records of flocks from further south near Mahabalipuram have been questioned. In the 1800s, adjutant storks were extremely common within the city of Calcutta {{during the summer and}} rainy season. These aggregations along the Ghats of Calcutta however declined and vanished altogether by the early 1900s. Improved sanitation has been suggested as a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> decline. Birds were recorded in Bangladesh in the 1850s, breeding somewhere in the Sundarbans, but have not been recorded subsequently.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E

5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a major <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rise}} of the {{imperial}} Chalukyas of Badami, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> overlords against the Pallavas of Kanchi. The Chalukyas were replaced by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in 753 CE as the dominant power in the Deccan. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the Chola Dynasty of Tanjavur. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region.|$|E
5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E

5|$|Yusuf {{has built}} a largely subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen in strategic positions. The National Security Agency (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) and the so-called “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. They are well catered for, well armed and often carry out counter-insurgency operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, it undermines morale in the security services and is a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> high desertion rates.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the pronunciation of consonants /ð/ & /θ/ by adult Vietnamese learners of English. Ten adult Vietnamese learners of English were selected to be the sample for the audiotape observation, which aimed at identifying the participants’ mistakes in pronouncing /ð/ and /θ/. Secondly, 115 learners of English in Vietnam {{were asked to complete}} a questionnaire regarding the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> pronunciation errors. The findings indicated that substitution phenomenon was a dominant problem in the students’ pronunciation of /θ/ and /ð/. The most outstanding problem in pronouncing the consonant /θ/ was replacing this sound by Vietnamese /t‘/. With regards to /ð/ sound, it was most frequently mispronounced as /z/. Besides, there was a new kind of mistake found: it was the tendency to pronounce /dʒ/ instead of /ð/, which has not been reported ever. Apart from that, participants also confirmed some <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> erroneous pronunciation. As perceived by the learners themselves, the most popular <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> problems were the lack of English exposure and practice, which implicated that an effective environment for using English was highly necessary...|$|R
