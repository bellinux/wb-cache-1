40|$|On-chip {{inductance}} extraction {{and analysis}} is becom-ing increasing critical. Inductance extraction can be diffi-cult, cumbersome and impractical on large designs as in-ductance {{depends on the}} current return path — which is typically unknown prior to extracting and simulating the circuit model. In this paper, we propose a new circuit ele-ment, K, to model inductance effects, {{at the same time}} be-ing easier to extract and analyze. K is defined as inverse of partial inductance matrix L, and has locality and sparsity normally associated with a capacitance matrix. We pro-pose to capture inductance effects by directly extracting and simulating K, instead of partial inductance, leading to much more efficient procedure which is amenable to full <b>chip</b> <b>extraction.</b> This proposed approach has been verified through several simulation results. ...|$|E

A fast on <b>chip</b> RNA <b>extraction</b> module formerly used in pathogen detection was modified for the extraction of miRNAs from human cell cultures.

40|$|AbstractFiber-metal {{compound}} {{materials are}} characterized by excellent mechanical properties and enable innovative and new designs, which are increasingly used e. g. in the aircraft industry. Boreholes for riveting and bolts or fasteners are required to join the initially separated material layers. Due to the considerably different machining properties of fiber reinforced plastics and metallic materials the drilling process of compound stacks is a very challenging task. High cutting temperatures and insufficient <b>chip</b> <b>extraction</b> lead to damages and disturbances of the surface integrity especially in the anisotropic and inhomogeneous CFRP layer. In the present study, low frequency assisted vibration drilling was applied for a CFRP/Ti 6 Al 4 V [10 / 10 mm] material stack. The axial oscillations cause an interrupted cut, which leads to small chip segments in the metallic material (Ti 6 Al 4 V). It {{was found that the}} distinctive mechanical damage of the CFRP borehole surface could be significantly reduced due to the improved extraction of the small chip segments. Thermographic images of the drilling process in the titanium alloy are showing that the cutting temperatures can be reduced by more than 40 % when using low vibration assisted drilling compared to conventional drilling. Consequently thermal damage of the matrix material was not found when applying low frequency assisted vibration drilling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDrilling of fiber-metal {{compound}} {{materials is}} one of the most challenging machining operations. Besides frequently occurring damages of the borehole surface tool wear is a major concern when drilling compound stacks. The significantly divergent cutting conditions of fiber reinforced plastics and metallic alloys require compromises in the tool geometry as well as the cutting materials and coatings. Excessive cutting edge rounding due to the brittle and abrasive fibers leads to increasing cutting forces and temperatures in the metallic alloy. This usually results in a catastrophic failure of the tools. In the present study low frequency vibration assisted drilling (LFVAD) of CFRP/Ti 6 Al 4 V [10 / 10 mm] was investigated in terms of tool wear and compared to conventional drilling. Solid carbide drills with a diameter of 4. 8 mm and different CVD and PVD coatings have been tested. The flank wear as well as the adhesions at the cutting edges have found to be significantly lower when using LFVAD. The tool life could be increased by more than 300 % compared to conventional drilling. This is based on considerably lower process temperatures and an improvement of the process stability which could be proved by cutting force measurements. Additionally the <b>chip</b> <b>extraction</b> was found to be more efficient due to the generation of small chip segments which is a consequence of the interrupted cut. Best results in terms of tool wear and borehole quality have been achieved with an AlCrN coating...|$|E
40|$|Nondestructive {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} to assess existing timber structures. The models proposed for these methods are usually performed in the laboratory using small clear wood specimens. But in real situations many anomalies, defects and biological damage are found in wood. In these cases the existing models only indicate that the values are outside normality without providing any other information. To solve this problem, a study of non-destructive probing methods for wood was performed, testing the behaviour of four different techniques (penetration resistance, pullout resistance, drill resistance and <b>chip</b> drill <b>extraction)</b> on wood samples with different biological damage, simulating an in-situ test. The wood samples were obtained from existing Spanish timber structures with biotic damage caused by borer insects, termites, brown rot and white rot. The study concludes {{that all of the}} methods offer more or less detailed information about the degree of deterioration of wood, but that the first two methods (penetration and pullout resistance) cannot distinguish between pathologies. On the other hand, drill resistance and <b>chip</b> drill <b>extraction</b> make it possible to differentiate pathologies and even to identify species or damage location.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Improved {{accessibility}} {{in remote}} noble fir (Abies procera Rehd.) stands {{and the realization}} of the value of noble fir wood have led to increased pressure to enter and actively manage noble fir stands in Oregon and Washington. This study examined the incidence of infection and decay caused by Heterobasidion annosum Bref. in two previously thinned and wounded noble fir stands. The project was designed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the biology and population structure of H. annosum on a little studied host, and ultimately to provide land managers with a means for reducing the incidence and severity of annosus root and butt rot. Data for the study were collected from two study sites on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation (WSIR), Oregon. Thirty potential crop trees per stand, both wounded and unwounded, were selected. Trees were sampled using the following techniques: 1) collection of basic tree data; 2) destructive tree dissections or non-destructive wood <b>chip</b> <b>extraction</b> with subsequent isolation analysis; and 3) thirty foot circular stump plots collecting pertinent stump data. Vegetative compatibility (VC) tests were conducted to analyze the clonal distribution of H. annosum within individual trees and ultimately to examine the relative importance of primary and secondary spread. Many VC groups were present in individual trees suggesting the importance of primary spore infection. Starch gel electrophoresis was used to analyze isozyme patterns and determine the intersterility group (biological species) of a subsample of H. annosum isolates recovered from live noble fir trees. All isolates belonged to the S type intersterility group. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine if tree, stump and wound variables were associated with H. annosum infection and decay. Results suggested that percent H. annosum infection increased as the total surface area of wounds below breast height and total tree height increased. Additionally, percent decay volume increased as the mean diameter of surrounding true fir stumps and mean wound age increased. The major conclusions of this study are as follows: 1) the incidence of H. annosum infection is high in thinned and wounded noble fir stands; 2) wounded trees are significantly more decayed than unwounded trees, however, the presence of H. annosum was not significantly associated with the presence of wounds and/or decay columns; 3) both wounds and stumps are involved in disease spread, and wounds may exacerbate the decay process; 4) decay volumes steadily increase with time; and 5) manager's should treat stumps with borax, or an equivalent protectant, and take measures to minimize wounding...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Parasitic {{extraction}} {{techniques are}} used to estimate signal delay in VLSI <b>chips.</b> Inductance <b>extraction</b> is {{a critical component of}} the parasitic extraction process in which on-chip inductive effects are estimated with high accuracy. In earlier work [1], we described a parallel software package for inductance extraction called ParIS, which uses a novel preconditioned iterative method to solve the dense, complex linear system of equations arising in these problems. The most computationally challenging task in ParIS involves computing dense matrix-vector products efficiently via hierarchical multipole-based approximation techniques. This paper presents a comparative study of two such techniques: a hierarchical algorithm called Hierarchical Multipole Method (HMM) and the well-known Fast Multipole Method (FMM). We investigate the performance of parallel MPI-based implementations of these algorithms on a Linux cluster. We analyze the impact of various algorithmic parameters and identify regimes where HMM is expected to outperform FMM on uniprocessor as well as multiprocessor platforms. ...|$|R

40|$|Mallee {{plantations}} {{have been}} integrated into wheat farms in Western Australia as a large-scale and multi-purpose woody crop since the 1990 s. Mallee describes the growing habit of certain eucalypt species that grow with multiple stems shooting from an underground crown root (lignotuber), usually to {{a height of}} up to 10 meters. These types of plantations could be a considerable source of biomass to produce renewable energy. In this project the supply chain of Mallee was modelled using BIOPLAN’s linear programming model to investigate the impact of tree size, extraction distance and transport distance on supply chain costs. The harvesting system included a feller-buncher, front end loader, in-field chipper and truck. The mobile Bruks chipper {{was found to be}} more efficient than Peterson Pacific to chip Mallee trees. The results indicated that harvesting larger tree sizes can slightly diminish <b>chipping</b> cost. <b>Extraction</b> cost was very sensitive to the extraction distance in this case study. Long transport distances in larger management area (to meet higher energy demands) will highly increase the transport cost. From optimised supply chain cost and sensitivity analysis, the best practice for efficient Mallee biomass supply chain was suggested as following: harvesting Mallee trees when reaching larger size (about 0. 3 m 3 for a tree consisting of multiple stems with an average DBH of 5 cm to 10 cm per each stem), planning average extraction distance to be shorter than 1000 – 1500 m, establishing the Mallee plantations closer to energy plant with transport distance shorter than 100 km (with a radius of 50 – 75 km providing an effective compromise between cost and distance) or alternatively installing new bioenergy plants no farther than 100 km from existing Mallee plantations...|$|R

International conferences on reliability have recognized electromigration {{as one of the}} biggest problems in reliability. This thesis focuses on electromigration analysis of signal nets and was carried out in Design Methodology department at a company in Eindhoven. The purpose of this thesis work was to setup a flow for electromigration analysis using existing tools at the company. Comparison of  tools and theoretical study of electromigration also forms a big part of this internship. A summary of theoretical studies on electromigration phenomenon and their implications on  design parameters is investigated in this thesis report. The approach of setting up tools, evaluation strategy and results of the evaluation are also documented in this report. Lastly a conclusion in a form of an effective design methodology and comparison of tools are presented. This report also contains challenges encountered while setting up of tools and motivation for enabling different options for electromigration analysis. Trade-offs between simulation run time, parasitic <b>extraction,</b> <b>chip</b> area and reliability concerns are also discussed in this report...|$|R

Hemicelluloses have a low heating value compared to lignin and therefore recovery of hemicelluloses at an earlier stage of the Kraft process followed by biochemical conversion into high value-added products might offer a much better economic opportunity. In collaboration with {{the research and development}} department of Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner AB, Piteå, Sweden, alkali and water extractions of birch wood were performed under conditions compatible with the Kraft process, at different times, temperatures and alkali charges. The extraction conditions were set in a range suitable with the current pulp process at Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner. The requirements for process configurations, based on either hot water or alkali extraction were also explored. The xylan yields from different extraction trials were measured and the <b>chips</b> from those <b>extraction</b> trials were cooked, refined and turned into sheets of paper. The effects on paper quality were compared with a reference pulp made from the same wooden chips. Recovered xylans from water extracted birch wood chips were subjected to secondary hydrolysis, enzymatic or sulphuric acid. Detoxification of the hydrolysate with active carbon and regulation of pH were performed before fermentation. Fermentation of the xylose hydrolysate to succinic acid was demonstrated by the use of the succinic acid producer Escherichia coli AFP 184.
