50|$|Color {{photography}} {{is almost as}} old as black-and-white, with early experiments including John Herschel's Anthotype prints in 1842, the pioneering work of Louis Ducos du Hauron in the 1860s, and the Lippmann process unveiled in 1891, but for many years color photography remained {{little more than a}} laboratory curiosity. It first became a widespread commercial reality with the introduction of Autochrome plates in 1907, but the plates were very expensive and not suitable for casual snapshot-taking with hand-held cameras. The mid-1930s saw the introduction of Kodachrome and Agfacolor Neu, the first easy-to-use color films of the modern multi-layer chromogenic type. These early processes produced transparencies for use in slide projectors and viewing devices, but <b>color</b> <b>prints</b> became increasingly popular after the introduction of chromogenic <b>color</b> <b>print</b> <b>paper</b> in the 1940s.

There have been several varieties of Kodacolor negative film, including Kodacolor-X, Kodacolor VR and Kodacolor Gold.|$|R

As a result, it was investigated the influence of the structure, physical, mechanical and color characteristics of two-layer banknote paper, produced by formaldehid-free technology of printing, technical features and quality printed products for special purposes.

In general, the color deviation between single- and two-layer paper with the same thickness of ink layer is negligible - not more than three ?E. Found that two-layer paper has better strength properties compared to single layer paper (greater number of double bends, more destructive efforts, etc.).
