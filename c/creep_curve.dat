40|$|AbstractA {{computer}} program based on “MATLAB” {{was developed to}} predict <b>creep</b> <b>curves</b> of two high temperature alloys viz. a near α titanium alloy and Fe-Ni-Cr-Al alloy using θ-projection concept. Experimental <b>creep</b> <b>curves</b> generated at 600 °C at different stress levels were used. This technique involves fitting of experimental <b>creep</b> <b>curves</b> according to eq εc=εt−ε 0 =θ 1 (1 −e−θ 2 t) +θ 3 (eθ 4 t− 1) to obtain θi parameters for different stress levels. Different θ-values obtained from fitting are then fitted according to eq logθi=ai+biσ+ciT+diσT and experimental strain to fracture values are fitted according to eq logεf=a+bσ+cT+dσT to obtain a set of twenty material constants (ai, bi, ci, dit), and εi), which are further used along with eq εc=εt=ε 0 =θ 1 (1 −e−θ 2 t) +θ 3 (eθ 4 t− 1) to determine four θ-values and fracture strain for each desired combination of stress and temperature in order to generate new <b>creep</b> strain <b>curve.</b> The predicted <b>creep</b> <b>curves</b> for both the alloys have been validated by generating experimental curves.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that the creep characteristics at high temperatures are mainly evaluated by a minimum creep rate. Although, {{the shape of a}} <b>creep</b> <b>curve</b> may vary depending on deformation conditions, the apparent steady state or minimum creep rates can be the same. Thus, for detailed analysis and prediction of creep behavior, other values, which reflect the shape of each <b>creep</b> <b>curve,</b> should be considered. For this purpose, the authors have proposed Sato’s strain-acceleration-parameter (Strain Acceleration and Transition Objective index, SATO-index) which reflects strain rate change during creep deformation. Based on the concept of the SATO-index, the entire <b>creep</b> <b>curve</b> can be represented by a small number of numerical parameters, and can be extrapolated from a part of the <b>creep</b> <b>curve.</b> In this paper, application of the SATO-index to creep curves of aluminum-magnesium solid solutions which show both the Alloy-type and Metal-type creep behavior is discussed. The <b>creep</b> <b>curve</b> can be extrapolated by the concept from the transient part of the <b>creep</b> <b>curve,</b> and the stress dependence of the extrapolated creep rates at the minimum creep rate agrees well with experiments.

40|$|A creep {{constitutive}} equation {{is important for}} estimating creep deformation for structural designs under high temperatures. We can formulate the creep {{constitutive equation}} by characterizing {{a large number of}} creep curves.

The effect of nitrogen on creep deformation behavior of type 316 LN stainless steel has been studied using impression creep testing technique. Impression creep tests have been carried out at 923 K on 316 LN stainless steel containing 0. 07, 0. 11, 0. 14, and 0. 22 wt. % nitrogen, in the punching stress range of 472 - 760 MPa.

The steady state impression velocity was found to increase with increasing punching stress. It was observed that impression velocity was sensitive to the variation in nitrogen content in the steel.

A good correlation between the impression creep test and the conventional creep test results was observed which demonstrates the applicability of impression creep testing technique for alloy development programme...|$|R

40|$|Basic {{qualitative}} {{properties of}} the creep curves generated by the linear integral constitutive relation of viscoelasticity (with an arbitrary creep compliance) under cyclic piecewise-constant uni-axial loadings (with an arbitrary asymmetry stress ratio) are studied analytically. General formulas {{and a number of}} exact two-sided bounds are obtained for maximal, minimal and ratcheting strain values during each cycle, for their sequences limits, for the rate of plastic (non-recoverable) strain accumulation and for cyclic <b>creep</b> <b>curve</b> deviation from the <b>creep</b> <b>curve</b> at constant stress which is equal to the cycle mean stress. Their dependence on loading cycle parameters and creep compliance properties are analyzed. Monotonicity and convexity intervals of cyclic creep curves, sequences of maximal and minimal strain values and ratcheting strain sequence, their evolution with cycle number growth and conditions for their boundedness, monotonicity and convergence are examined. The linear viscoelasticity theory abilities for simulation of ratcheting, creep acceleration, cyclic hardening or softening and cyclic stability under symmetric cyclic loadings are considered. The analysis carried out revealed the importance of convexity restriction imposed on a creep compliance and the governing role of its derivative limit value at infinity. It is proved that the limit value equality to zero is the criterion for non-accumulation of plastic strain, for memory fading and for asymptotic symmetrization of cyclic <b>creep</b> <b>curve</b> deviation from the <b>creep</b> <b>curve</b> at the mean stress. The qualitative features of theoretic cyclic creep curves are compared to basic properties of typical test creep curves of viscoelastoplastic materials under cyclic multi-step uni-axial loadings in order to elucidate the linear theory applicability scope, to reveal its abilities to provide an adequate description of basic rheological phenomena related to cyclic creep and to develop techniques of identification and tuning of the linear constitutive relation. In particular, it is proved that the linear constitutive relation with an arbitrary (increasing convex-up) creep compliance function provides the absence of ratcheting and cyclic softening under symmetric cyclic multi-step loadings and the absence of creep acceleration whenever a symmetric cyclic loading is added to a constant load...|$|E

To further discover the sliding mechanism of the horizontal-strata landslides, red sandstone samples were taken from Erchengyan horizontal-strata landslide bedrock in Wanzhou, and triaxial creep tests by step loading technique were conducted on red sandstone with RLM- 2000 triaxial rheology test machine. The triaxial creep tests lasted 1180 h under the constant temperature of 18. 5 ± 0. 5.

40|$|An {{incremental}} {{format of}} creep model {{was presented to}} take account of the development of concrete creep due to loading at different ages.

Two creep curves were combined by introducing an ageing parameter whose value was obtained from two sets of time-dependent laboratory experiments on cylindrical specimens.

40|$|When creep {{recovery}} is {{predicted by the}} principle of superposition from the unit <b>creep</b> <b>curves</b> for various loading ages, both Branson's law (ACI 209 / 11) and the double power law give non-monotonic recovery curves.

40|$|Lu, X. LucasIndentation {{testing is}} widely used to {{determine}} the in situ biomechanical properties of articular cartilage, however, most curve-fitting solutions for indentation analysis require the deformation data of cartilage at the equilibrium state, which often takes the tissue hours to reach. The lengthy testing time reduces the efficiency of indentation, increases the chance of tissue deterioration, and prevents in vivo applications. Moreover, the constitutive models often involve multiple parameters. Determination of all mechanical properties by curve-fitting the indentation creep data is often complicated by over-fitting, local minima and multiple solutions. This thesis aimed to address these two particular problems. First, in order to shorten the indentation testing time, a novel technique based on principal component analysis (PCA) was developed, which can predict the full indentation <b>creep</b> <b>curve</b> based on the deformation data in a short time period.
