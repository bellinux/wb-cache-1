Paula Edelstein of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, praising the performer skills [...] "leading his own ensembles or playing with renowned jazz masters, Paquito D'Rivera {{continues to make}} a decidedly fresh imprint on Latin and Brazilian jazz."

C. Michael Bailey, also of All About Jazz, stated that the album [...] "is superb and fantastic in every way." [...] Morrice Blackwell of Jazz Review named the album a [...] "musical match made in heaven", praising the performers and the sound quality, considering {{that it is a}} live performance.
