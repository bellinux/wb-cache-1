50|$|The fuel {{region is}} {{surrounded}} by a concentric ring of beryllium reflector approximately 1 ft (0.30 m) thick. This in turn is subdivided into three regions: the removable reflector, the semi permanent reflector, and the permanent reflector. The beryllium {{is surrounded by}} a water reflector of effectively infinite thickness. In the axial direction, the reactor is reflected by water.The control plates, in the form of two thin, nuclear poison-bearing concentric cylinders, are located in an annular region between the outer fuel element and the beryllium reflector. These plates are driven in opposite directions to open and close a window at the core mid-plane. Reactivity is increased by downward motion of the inner cylinder and the upward motion of the four outer quadrant plates. The inner cylinder is used for shimming and power regulation and has no fast safety function. The outer <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> consists of four separate quadrant plates, each having an independent drive and safety release mechanism. All control plates have three axial regions of different neutron poison content designed to minimize the axial peak-to-average power-density ratio throughout the core lifetime.

40|$|International audienceThe {{sensitivity}} of the global properties of a 2 D turbulent wake produced by the separated flow of a " D " shaped cylinder at Re = 13000 is investigated experimentally using a small circular <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> as a local disturbance. The height of the main cylinder is D = 25 mm and control cylinders are of diameters d = 0. 04 D and d = 0. 12 D; the former being smaller than the shear layers thickness detaching from the main cylinder, while the latter is larger. In both cases, the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> is able to modify the global frequency, base pressure and spanwise velocity correlation. The results are presented as sensitivity maps. Reynolds stresses spatial structure and the recirculation bubble length are examined in detail when the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> is displaced vertically across the wake at a fixed downstream location. It is found that the increase of the recirculation bubble length {{is accompanied by a}} damping of Reynolds stresses with a downstream shift of their spatial structures together with the base pressure increase. The global frequency can be either decreased or increased independently of the bubble length modification. The {{sensitivity of}} these global properties are interpreted {{on the basis of the}} ability of the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> to change the size of the formation region of the Kármán vortex street by interacting with the primary detached shear layers.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} by researchers {{in the past that}} vortex shedding behind circular cylinders can be altered, and in some cases suppressed, over a limited range of Reynolds numbers by proper placement of a second, much smaller, 'control ' cylinder in the near wake of the main cylinder.

A stabilized finite element method is employed to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the primitive variables formulation. At low Reynolds numbers, for certain relative positions of the main and <b>control</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the vortex shedding from the main cylinder is completely suppressed. Excellent agreement is observed between the present computations and experimental findings of other researchers. In an effort to explain the mechanism of control of vortex shedding, the streamwise variation of the pressure coefficient close to the shear layer of the main cylinder is compared for various cases, with and without the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In the cases where the vortex shedding is suppressed, it is observed that the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> provides a local favorable pressure gradient in the wake region, thereby stabilizing the shear layer locally.

40|$|Passive wake control {{behind a}} {{circular}} cylinder in uniform flow is studied by numerical simulation for Re-D ranging from 80 to 300. Two small <b>control</b> <b>cylinders,</b> with diameter d/D = 1 / 8, are placed at x/D = 0. 5 and y/D = +/- 0. 6. Unlike the 1990 results of Strykowski and Sreenivasan, {{in the present}} study, the vortex street behind the main cylinder still exists but the fluctuating lift and the form drag on the main cylinder reduces significantly and monotonously as the Reynolds number increases from 80 to 300. Obstruction of the <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> to the incoming flow deflects part of the fluid {{to pass through the}} gap between the main and <b>control</b> <b>cylinders,</b> forming two symmetric streams. These streams not only eliminate the flow separation along the rear surface of the main cylinder, they also merge toward the wake centerline to create an advancing momentum in the immediate near-wake region. These two effects significantly reduce the wake width behind the main cylinder and lead to monotonous decrease of the form drag as the Reynolds number increases. As the Reynolds number gets higher, a large amount of the downstream advancing momentum significantly delays the vortex formation farther downstream, leading to a more symmetric flow structure in the near-wake region of the main cylinder. As the Reynolds number increases from 80 to 300, both increasing symmetry of the flow structure in the near-wake and significant delay of the vortex formation are the main reasons for the fluctuating lift to decrease monotonously.

Vertical and horizontal <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> are used to disturb the natural flow which is the superposition of two reflectional symmetry breaking states (Grandemange et al. 2013 b). When the perturbation breaks the symmetry of the setup, it can select {{one of the two}} asymmetric topologies so that a mean side force is reported. When the reflectional symmetry is preserved, some positions of horizontal and vertical <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> alter the natural bi-stability of the flow which may result in drag reduction. In addition, it is found that the horizontal perturbation affects the lift force especially when the top and bottom mixing layers are disturbed. The ability of the disturbances to suppress the bistable behavior is discussed and, introducing a formalism of induced drag, a quantification of the impact on the drag of the cross-flow forces observed for the natural bistable wake is suggested.

The drag of the main cylinder was measured to reduce by up to 45 %. To examine the physical mechanism of the flow control in detail, a series of two-dimensional numerical simulations at a Reynolds number equal to 500 were conducted.

40|$|International audienceWe assess {{experimentally}} and theoretically {{the ability}} of a small <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> to alter vortex shedding in turbulent flow past a square cylinder at R e = 22, 000. Results are presented in terms of sensitivity maps showing the flow regions where the shedding frequency and amplitude are most affected by the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Experimental results are obtained for a ratio 0. 02 of the cylinder diameters, over an extended domain covering the wake, the shear layers and the free stream. The shedding frequency can be either decreased or increased, the largest effects being obtained placing the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> at {{the outer edge of the}} detached shear layers (associated with frequency decrease) or upstream of the square cylinder (associated with frequency increase, in contrast with previous results obtained for a D-shaped geometry of the main cylinder). In contrast, the oscillation amplitude is rarely decreased, meaning that any variation of the shedding frequency comes at the expense of more intense vortex shedding. These findings are revisited in the frame of a theoretical, linear sensitivity analysis of the time-averaged mean flow, performed using adjoint methods in the frame of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes modeling. We show that the retained approach carries valuable information in view of guiding efficient control strategy, as it allows identifying the main regions yielding either a decrease or an increase of the shedding frequency in striking agreement with the experiments. This is a tremendous timesaving in so far as the controlled states need not be computed, the overall computational cost being roughly that of computing the mean flow. In contrast, performing the sensitivity analysis on the underlying unstable steady state yields flawed predictions, hence stressing the need to encompass some level of mean coherent-coherent perturbations interaction in the linear model...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{theoretical}} {{approach is developed}} to predict {{the effect of a}} passive control device on the global stability of a cylinder flow close to the critical Reynolds number Rec = 46. 8. The passive control device is here a small <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> that is modelled by a local force. This force is the sum of a steady component, acting on the base-flow, and of an unsteady component, acting at the perturbation level. To understand how these two components affect the flow stability, a multiple timescale analysis is first performed at the bifurcation. The leading global mode responsible for the onset of the Von Karman street is assumed to oscillate on a "fast" timescale and its amplitude to grow on a "slow" timescale. Then a sensitivity analysis of the leading global eigenvalue with respect to the steady and unsteady components of the force is developed. By combining these two analysis, one obtains maps of the growth rate and pulsation of the perturbation {{as a function of the}} position of the local force. The regions of the flow where the placement of a <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> suppresses the Von Karman instability are very well reproduced.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} cavity flow physics and its passive control {{by means of}} a {{spanwise}} cylinder. Two configurations are considered. First, a laminar study of a flow over an unconfined square cavity at a low Reynolds number (7500) is presented. Global stability results are shown, allowing the identification of the driving mechanisms of the cavity flow: the aeroacoustic feedback mechanism ([18]) and the acoustic resonance mechanism [4]. When both mechanisms interact, the growth rate of the global modes is seen to display a local maximum. At low Mach numbers, we suggest that it is still the feedback aeroacoustic mechanism that selects the frequency mode, the acoustic resonance mechanism only enhancing the response. Second, we study the dynamics of a turbulent deep cavity flow in a transonic regime. Global modes and sensitivity results are shown and compared to experimental data, with and without <b>control</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Concerning the baseline (without control), RANS and URANS simulations, based on the k-ω model of Wilcox, display very good agreement with experiments.

Additionally, we did not detect any strong grazer effects and found very few significant nutrient-grazer interactions. While this might suggest that there was no important differential response to nutrients by individual grazer species or by various combinations of grazers, our results were complicated by the lack of significant differences between control and grazer treatments, and as such, these results are best explained by the presence of unwanted amphipod grazers (mean = 471 ind. m– 2) in the <b>control</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Our estimates of grazing rates and epiphyte productivities indicate that amphipods in the <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> could have lowered epiphyte biomass to the same level that the experimental grazers did, thus effectively transforming the control treatments into grazer treatments.
