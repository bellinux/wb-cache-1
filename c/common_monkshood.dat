5000|$|The Bencao gangmu {{entry for}} the rong 狨 {{explains}} the synonym nao 猱 signifies this monkey's rou 柔 [...] "soft; supple" [...] hair.The hair {{of the golden}} monkey is long and soft. So it is called Rong (meaning [...] "fine hair"). Nao is a character meaning [...] "soft." [...] Another explanation says that the animal {{is found in the}} western Rong region Sichuan, so it is thus named. There is a kind of long-hair dog that is also called Nao. ... The book Tan Yuan 談苑 by Yang Yi (楊億): The golden monkey is found in the deep mountains in Sichuan and Shaanxi. It looks like an ape. It has a long tail of golden color. So it is colloquially called Jinsirong 金絲狨 (meaning [...] "golden thread monkey"). It is quick at climbing trees. It loves its tail dearly. When shot by a poisonous arrow, it will bite off its own tail when poisoned. During the Song dynasty (960-1279), only officials of the administration and military of the third rank and above were allowed to use seats and bedding made of golden monkey hide. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401)This entry has two subheadings: the yuan 猨 or changbeihou 長臂猴 [...] "gibbon, Hylobates agilis" [...] and the du 獨 (below).The ape is good at climbing trees. It is found in the deep mountains in the Chuan and Guang regions. It looks like a monkey, but has very long arms. It is an animal that can practice Daoist qi (Vital Energy), so it lives a long life. Some say it has one arm stretching {{from one side to the}} other. This is not correct. Its arm bone can be made into a flute that sounds very clear and resonant. Apes come in different colors: blue-green, white, black, yellow and crimson. It is a kind and quiet animal, and likes to eat fruits. It lives in forests and can jump over a distance of several dozen chi. But when it falls and drops onto the ground, it may suffer from excessive diarrhea and then die. Treatment is the drinking of juice of Fuzi/radix aconiti lateralis/daughter root of <b>common</b> <b>monkshood.</b> Apes live in groups. The male cries a lot. It makes three cries consecutively. The cry sounds miserable and is penetrating. The book Guihai Zhi 桂海志 by Fan Chengda: There are three varieties of apes: Yellow ones with golden thread; black ones with jade faces; and black ones with black faces. Some say the pure black one is the male, and the golden thread one is the female. A male one shouts and a female does not. The book Rixun Ji 日詢記 by Wang Ji: People in the Guang region say that when an ape is born, it is black and male, When it gets old, it turns yellow and its genitals become ulcerous, and then it turns into a female. Then it mates with the black one. After another several hundred years, the yellow ape will evolve into a white one. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931 no. 401A) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{are obvious}} changes in neuropeptides from plasma and {{cerebrospinal}} fluid {{in patients with}} vascular dementia (VaD), and regulating the levels of neuropeptides is a key for prevention and treatment of VaD. Objective: To observe the clinical efficacy of moxibustion at head-points in treatment of vascular dementia (VaD), and assess its effects on memory-related neuropeptides. Design, setting, participants and interventions: A total of 65 VaD patients from Acupuncture Hospital, Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, were randomly divided into moxibustion group (33 cases) and Western medicine group (32 cases). Patients in the moxibustion group were treated with indirect moxibustion with <b>common</b> <b>monkshood</b> cake for 20 min. Patients in the Western medicine group were orally administered piracetam tablets, 0. 8 g for three times a day. One treatment course was 4 weeks, and they were treated for 4 treatment courses. Main outcome measures: The scores of Hasegawa’s Dementia Scale (HDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL), {{as well as the}} levels of learning and memory-related neuropeptides from cerebrospinal fluid such as somatostatin (SS) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) were measured before and after treatment in the two groups. Results: Total response rate was significantly higher in the moxibustion group than in the Western medicine group (P< 0. 01). There were significant differences in scores of HDS, MMSE and ADL between before and after treatment in the two groups(P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01). After treatment, the scores of HDS, MMSE and ADL in the moxibustion group were more improved as compared with those in the Western medicine group (P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01). The levels of SS and AVP after treatment were higher than those before treatment in the two groups(P＜ 0. 01). After treatment, the increased levels of SS and AVP were higher in the moxibustion group than in the Western medicine group (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Moxibustion is effective in improving the clinical symptom scores and regulating the levels of neuropeptides associated with learning and memory in VaD patients...|$|E
