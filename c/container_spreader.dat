50|$|The {{most common}} modern {{application}} for straddle carriers is in port terminals and intermodal yards {{where they are}} used for stacking and moving ISO standard containers. Straddles pick and carry containers while straddling their load and connecting to the top lifting points via a <b>container</b> <b>spreader.</b> These machines {{have the ability to}} stack containers up to 4 high. These are capable of relatively low speeds (up to 30 km/h) with a laden container. The workers that use this machinery sit at the very top seated facing the middle as they can see behind them and in front of them. Straddle carriers can lift up to 60 t which equals up to 2 full containers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spreader</b> {{used for}} <b>containers</b> has a locking {{mechanism}} at each corner that attaches {{the four corners}} of the <b>container.</b> A <b>spreader</b> can be used on a container crane, a straddle carrier and with any other machinery to lift containers.|$|R

40|$|Liebherr mobile harbor cranes use {{electrical}} generators {{to provide}} electrical power for load attachment {{devices such as}} <b>container</b> <b>spreaders</b> or magnets. Upcoming exhaust and noise emission standards and energy saving considerations lead to a broad diesel engine speed range. The challenging design aspect is to ensure a constant speed of the asynchronous generator by the hydraulic drive system. In addition, electrical load profiles of inductive consumers usually have DT 1 system characteristics with very small time constants. They evoke fast torque variations interfacing the hydraulic transmission. Liebherr mobile harbor cranes, see Figure 1, usually have a closed hydraulic circuit containing a hydraulic pump with a high displacement volume that is adjusted electronically in accordance to the current diesel engine speed. Regarding the energy saving aspects, a further minimization of the diesel engine speed leads to a larger pump size with increasing torque losses. Depending on the pressure setting, the volume flows can be reduced in constant pressure grids. Especially in part-load operation this results in better efficiency compared to closed hydraulic circuits by minimizing the displacement volume of hydraulic components. To obtain a stable generator speed, {{it is essential to}} adjust the displacement volume of the hydraulic unit for equalizing its input torque with the Figure 1 : LHM 800 Group 10 - Mobile Hydraulics | Paper 10 - 5 199 generator load torque. In interaction with the software-based control architecture, the stability of the electrical frequency depends on the mass inertia of the generator drive and time constants of the embedded hydraulic actuators. The system model, represented by ODEs is established and verified with a hydraulic simulation software. On that basis, the design approach of a PI-state-controller is presented. Corresponding controller gains and state feedback parameters are determined by pole placement techniques. To conclude this investigation a comparison between the hydraulically closed circuit and the constant pressure grid is shown by simulation and measurement data...|$|R
25|$|The crane {{is driven}} by an {{operator}} who sits in a cabin suspended from the trolley. The trolley runs along rails located on the top or sides of the boom and girder. The operator runs the trolley over the ship to lift the cargo, usually <b>containers.</b> Once the <b>spreader</b> locks onto the container, the container is lifted, moved over the dock, and placed on a truck chassis (trailer) {{to be taken to}} the storage yard. The crane also lifts containers from chassis on the dock to load them onto the ship.|$|R
40|$|Elsevier use only: Received date here; revised date here; {{accepted}} date here The VeriSpreaderTM {{radiation detection}} system will monitor every container {{passing through a}} shipping terminal without impeding the flow of commerce by making the radiation measurements during normal container handling. This is accomplished by integrating neutron and spectroscopic gamma ray detectors into a <b>container</b> crane <b>spreader</b> bar, {{the part of the}} crane that directly engages the intermodal shipping containers while moving from ship to shore and vice-versa. The use of a spectroscopic gamma detector reduces the rate of nuisance alarms due to naturally occurring radioactive material. The combination of gamma and neutron detection reduces the effectiveness of shielding and countermeasures. The challenges in this spreader bar based approach arise from the harsh environment, particularly the mechanical shock and the vibration of the moving spreader bar, since the measurement is taken while the container is moving. The electrical interfaces in the port environment, from the crane to a central monitoring office, present further challenges. It is the packaging, electronic interfaces, and data processing software that distinguish this system, which is based on conventional radiation sensors. The core of the system is Amptek’s Gamma-Rad, which integrates a ruggedized scintillator/PMT, digital pulse shaping electronics, electronics for the neutron detector, power supplies, and an Ethernet interface. The design of the VeriTainer system and result...|$|R
5000|$|Keith Walton Tantlinger (March 22, 1919 - August 27, 2011) was a {{mechanical}} engineer and inventor. As Vice President of Engineering at the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation his inventions {{played a major role}} in containerization. [...] Working with a Fruehauf customer, Malcom McLean, they spearheaded the container ship revolution in the 1950s, Tantlinger developed much of the early technology that made modern container shipping possible while at Fruehauf. After its initial order of containers from Brown Trailer, Sea-Land switched to containers made by the Strick division of the Fruehauf Trailer Company. Fruehauf had been one of the dominant players in building truck bodies and trailers for a long time, and, as already described, had previously innovated in the design and construction of the early commercial semi-trailers. President Roy Fruehauf was impressed with the idea of containerization, so in addition to manufacturing containers for Sea-Land his company agreed to make the trailer chassis that were needed, and also to provide financing to Sea-Land for the purchase of these containers and chassis. In 1958 Tantlinger left Sea-Land and became chief engineer at Fruehauf, where he continued to work with containers. More importantly, over the years he played a key role in the process of container standardization, working extensively on a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA) and later being critically involved with the ISO’s efforts. His designs included the corner casting and Twistlock systems found on every intermodal <b>container,</b> the <b>spreader</b> bar for automatic securing of containers lifted on and off ships, and the ship-shore container transfer apparatus for the first cellular container ship. In the course of his professional career, Tantlinger was granted 79 United States patents, all related to transportation equipment. Many of his patents related to commercial highway freight trailers and transit buses.|$|R
