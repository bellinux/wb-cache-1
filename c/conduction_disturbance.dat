A prolongation of the PR interval (a <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the heart) is also frequently seen. The ECG can fluctuate over time, depending on the autonomic balance and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs.

5000|$|Cocaine {{pharmacodynamics}} involve multiple complex mechanisms, {{although its}} half-life is short (~ 1 hour). This drug binds and blocks monoamine (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) re-uptake transporters with equal affinity. Monoamines accumulate in the synaptic cleft resulting in enhanced and prolonged sympathetic effects. Cocaine's acute {{effect in the}} central nervous system is to raise the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure center in the brain). When this effect ceases due to metabolism of cocaine, depletion of associated neurotransmitters, and receptor down-regulation (tachyphylaxis), the cocaine user may experience dysphoria, or a [...] "crash" [...] after the initial high. The principal actions of cocaine on the cardiovascular system are from alpha- and beta-1-adrenoceptor stimulation resulting in increased heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, and myocardial contractility, which are major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. Cocaine and its metabolites may cause arterial vasoconstriction hours after use. Epicardial coronary arteries are especially vulnerable to these effects, leading to decreased myocardial oxygen supply. Cocaine-induced platelet activation and thrombus formation is another deleterious effect, caused by alpha-adrenergic- and adenosine diphosphate-mediated increase in platelet aggregation. Plasminogen activator inhibitor is also increased following cocaine use, thereby promoting thrombosis. Similar to local anesthetics such as lidocaine, cocaine blocks sodium channels and interferes with action potential propagation. This Vaughn-Williams class IC effect increases the risk of <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance</b> and tachyarrhythmias. Adding to its complex toxicity, cocaine targets muscarinic acetylcholine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), sigma, and kappa-opioid receptors.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTranscatheter {{aortic valve}} {{replacement}} (TAVR) {{has become a}} well-accepted option for treating patients with aortic stenosis at intermediate to high or prohibitive surgical risk. TAVR-related <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances,</b> mainly new-onset left bundle-branch block and advanced atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation, remain the most common complication of this procedure. Furthermore, improvements in TAVR technology, akin to the increasing experience of operators/centers, have translated to a major reduction in periprocedural complications, yet the incidence of <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> has remained relatively high, with perhaps an increasing trend over time. Several factors {{have been associated with}} a heightened risk of <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> and permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVR, with prior right bundle-branch block and transcatheter valve type and implantation depth being the most commonly reported. New-onset left bundle-branch block and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation may have a significant detrimental association with patients' prognosis. Consequently, strategies intended to reduce the risk and to improve the management of such complications are of paramount importance, particularly in an era when TAVR expansion toward treating lower-risk patients is considered inevitable.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The methoxamine-sensitized rabbit {{model is}} widely used to screen drugs for proarrhythmic properties, {{especially}} repolarization-dependent TdP arrhythmias. With the change of anesthesia and/or sensitizing agent, <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> have been reported as well. Therefore, we compared currently available in-house anesthetics {{in order to preserve}} arrhythmia sensitivity and preclude <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: Rabbits were randomly assigned to 3 groups: (1) 35 mg/kg ketamine + 5 mg/kg xylazine; (2) 0. 5 mL/kg hypnorm + 3 mg/kg midazolam; (3) 35 mg/kg ketamine + 20 mg/kg propofol. Anesthesia was maintained by 1. 5 % isoflurane. Concomitant infusion of methoxamine (17 μg/kg/min for 40 minutes) and dofetilide (10 μg/kg/min for 30 minutes) was used to induce arrhythmias. Sole methoxamine infusion exclusively decreased HR in groups 1 and 3. Dofetilide lengthened repolarization, followed in time by PQ/QRS prolongation, second-degree AV block, and subsequently TdP arrhythmias. TdP was seen in 80 %, 0 %, and 33 % of the rabbits in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Decreasing the dose of dofetilide to 5 μg/kg/min in ketamine/xylazine anesthetized rabbits resulted in a drop in TdP incidence (25 %) while <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> persisted. Flunarizine (n = 6) suppressed all TdP arrhythmias while <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbances</b> remained present. CONCLUSION: TdP incidence in the methoxamine-sensitized rabbit could be dramatically influenced by anesthesia, drug dose, and flunarizine, while conduction slowing remained present. Thus, conduction slowing seems to be the integral outcome in this model...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Although sarcoid {{may involve}} the myocardium, {{there is little}} {{information}} on its incidence or significance. We studied 84 consecutive autopsied patients with sarcoidosis. The patients {{ranged in age from}} 18 - 80 years (average 46 years) and 61 % were women; 23 (27 %) of them had myocardial granulomas. In eight (35 %) these were clinically silent, and in 15 (65 %) there was a history of heart failure and/or arrhythmias and conduction defects. Of the 23 patients, only four (17 %) had grossly evident, widespread myocardial lesions: three of these four (75 %) had documented arrhythmias. All four had sudden, unexpected death at an average age of 36 years; in only two had sarcoid been suspected during life. The other 19 patients (83 %) had micro-scopically evident granulomatous involvement. Of these, eight (42 %) had a rhythm or <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance</b> and three (16 %) sudden death, although none of those who suffered sudden death had a recognized rhythm or <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Nine (15 %) of those without cardiac sarcoidosis had a rhythm or conduction distur-bance and eight (13 %) suffered a sudden death. The results show that although myocardial involvement occurs in at least 25 % of patients with sarcoid, it most often involves a small portion of myocardium and is clinically silent. Since some of the 61 patients in whom myocardial lesions were not identified may still have had small microscopic granulomas, the true in-cidence of myocardial sarcoid may be even greater than suggested here.

40|$|Electrograms {{from the}} bundle of His were {{recorded}} in two patients with acute myocardial infarction during paroxysmal atrioventricular block induced by carotid sinus massage.

In the first patient, the <b>conduction</b> <b>disturbance</b> appeared at the AH, and in the second patient at the HV, level. Paroxysmal atrioventricular block could be explained by assuming the existence of: (a) vagal effects at the atrioventricular node or upper His bundle (Case I) and at 'lower ' His bundle (Case 2); or (b) phase 4 block related to diastolic depolarization in 'upper ' (Case i) and 'lower ' (Case 2) parts of the His bundle; or (c) vagal effects at the atrioventricular node (Case I) and phase 4 block due to diastolic depolarization within {{the bundle of}} His (Case 2).

All patients followed up every 3 – 6 months after an AAI pacemaker implantation. A total of 102 patients, including 35 Group L and 67 Group H, were followed for 90 + 44 months.
