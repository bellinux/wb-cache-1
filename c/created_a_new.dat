5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both inward and outward.

5|$|Culturally speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts {{ceased to}} be a {{national}} center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as it had been before the war.

5|$|In 1811, Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{family for}} the genus Didus. He named the family Inepti, and in it {{included}} only Didus ineptus, now a synonym of Raphus cucullatus. Illiger concluded that the dodo was related to ostriches and rheas, and so placed Inepti in the order Rasores, as the sister family to Gallinacei, Epollicati (a defunct group including Turnix and Syrrhaptes), Columbini , and Crypturi.|$|E
5|$|Lasker {{followed}} Steinitz's principles, {{and both}} demonstrated {{a completely different}} chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> school of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
50|$|Other {{members of}} the Preparatory Committee sought to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{province}} out of the linguistically mixed parts of Quebec even if Quebec were to remain in Canada, in order to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> bilingual province. This faction within the early partition movement bears some resemblance to the movements that have arisen {{from time to time}} in parts of some Canadian provinces to break away and form new provinces. For example, also in the 1970s, there was a movement, led by the Parti Acadien, to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Acadian province out of northern New Brunswick.|$|R

In this manner, Hamilton Parish became Prince William County, Truro Parish became Fairfax County, and Cameron Parish developed into Loudoun County.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Assembly <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> heavily Republican 6th District in Fulton and Cobb {{counties}} in the wealthy northern suburbs of Atlanta—-an area that Gingrich had never represented. Gingrich sold his home in Carrollton and moved to Marietta in the new 6th. His primary opponent, State Representative Herman Clark, made an issue out of Gingrich's 22 overdraft checks in the House Bank Scandal, and also criticized Gingrich for moving into the district. After a recount, Gingrich prevailed by 980 votes, with a 51% to 49% result. His winning the primary all but assured him of election in November. He was re-elected three times from this district against nominal Democratic opposition.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{passed the}} Organic Act of 1871, which {{repealed}} the individual charters {{of the cities}} of Washington and Georgetown, and <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> territorial government for the whole District of Columbia. President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd {{to the position of}} governor in 1873. Shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized Washington, but ultimately bankrupted the District government. In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member Board of Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Agency had produced no coordinated estimate of the situation in Korea. Smith <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Office of National Estimates (ONE) under the direction of William L. Langer, the Harvard historian who had led the Research and Analysis branch of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Langer's staff created procedures that were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By December 1, Smith had formed a Directorate for Administration. The Agency would ultimately be divided by function into three directorates: Administration, Plans, and Intelligence.|$|E

The bill also would have <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> crime—being under the influence of marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. The bill would have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E
5|$|Human {{habitation}} in {{the southern}} portion of the Florida peninsula dates to 15,000years ago. Before European colonization, the region was dominated by the native Calusa and Tequesta tribes. With Spanish colonization, both tribes declined gradually during the following two centuries. The Seminole formed from mostly Creek {{people who had been}} warring to the North; they assimilated other peoples and <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> culture. After being forced from northern Florida into the Everglades during the Seminole Wars of the early 19th century, they adapted to the region and were able to resist removal by the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|In 293, emperor Diocletian <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{administrative}} system (the tetrarchy), to guarantee security in all endangered regions of his Empire.

The tetrarchy collapsed, however, in 313 {{and a few years}} later Constantine I reunited the two administrative divisions of the Empire as sole Augustus.|$|E
