The observation of adhering particles was done in situ during the deposition process {{with the aid of}} an image analyzer and the adsorption and desorption of each particle was monitored individually using a special tracking algorithm. Initial deposition rates j(0) (EXP) were higher to positively charged glass than to negatively <b>charged</b> glass <b>collector</b> surfaces, depending on shear rates and ionic strength. All observed experimental deposition rates were, however, smaller than the Smoluchowski-Levich (SL) approximate solution of the convective-diffusion (CD) equation.

These incident electron energies induce unity total yield at the transition between yields greater than and less than one with either negative or positive charging, respectively. The crossover energies are very important in determining both the polarity and magnitude of spacecraft surface potentials. iii) Evolution of electron emission energy spectra as a function of insulator charging used to determine the surface potential of insulators. iv) Surface potential evolution as a function of pulsed-electron fluence to determine how quickly insulators charge, and how this can affect subsequent electron yields. v) Critical incident electron energies resulting in electrical breakdown of insulator materials and the effect of breakdown on subsequent emission, charging and conduction. vi) Charge-neutralization techniques such as low-energy electron flooding and UV light irradiation to dissipate both positive and negative surface potentials during yield measurements.
