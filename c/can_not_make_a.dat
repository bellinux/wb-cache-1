As the second image restoration, super-resolution image restoration has become an active research issue {{in the field of}} image restoration. In general, super-resolution image restoration is an ill-posed problem. Prior knowledge about the image can be combined to make the problem well-posed, which contributes to some regularization methods. In these regularization methods, how-ever, regularization parameter was selected by experience in some cases. Other techniques to compute the parameter had too heavy computation cost. In this paper a new super-resolution algorithm is proposed to the problem of obtaining a high-resolution image from several low-resolution images that have been sub-sampled. The algorithm is based on the MAP framework, solving the optimization by proposed iteration steps. At each iteration step, the regularization parameter is updated using the partially reconstructed image solved at the last step. The proposed algorithm is tested on Lena images. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm has considerable effectiveness in that it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>make</b> <b>an</b> automatic choice and renew the regularization parameter, but also can get the high resolution reconstruction image expectedly.

40|$|Abstract. Consider {{towers of}} fields F 1 ⊂ F 2 ⊂ F 3, where F 3 /F 2 is a {{quadratic}} extension and F 2 /F 1 is an extension, which is either quadratic, or of odd degree, or purely transcendental of degree 1. We construct numerous {{examples of the}} above types such that the extension F 3 /F 1 is not 4 -excellent. Also we show that if k is a field, char k � = 2 and l/k is an arbitrary field extension of degree 4, then there exists a field extension F/k such that the extension lF/F is not 4 -excellent. 1. Notation and terminology The {{purpose of this paper}} is to construct nonexcellent field extensions of certain types. Recall that a field extension L/F is called excellent (resp. n-excellent) if for any quadratic form ϕ over F (resp. for any quadratic form ϕ over F of dimension at most n) the anisotropic part of the form ϕL is defined over F. It is well known that any quadratic extension is excellent (see for example [4]). Obviously, the same is true for odd degree and purely transcendental extensions, since they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> anisotropic form isotropic. We consider below towers of fields F 1 ⊂ F 2 ⊂ F 3, where the extension F 3 /F 2 is quadratic and the extension F 2 /F 1 is either quadratic or of odd degree or purely transcendental of degree 1. We give numerous examples of extensions F 3 /F 1 of such types, which are not 4 -excellent. The main source of reference concerning quadratic forms over fields is the Scharlau book [4]. We keep the standard notation. All the fields considered in the sequel are of characteristic different from 2. By a form we mean a nonsingular quadratic form. If F is a field, then W(F) is the Witt ring of F and I(F) is the ideal of evendimensional forms in W(F). The anisotropic part of a form ϕ is denoted by ϕan. Slightly abusing notation we write ϕ = 0 if ϕ is hyperbolic, i. e. its anisotropic part is zero. By D(ϕ) we denote the set of nonzero values of ϕ. The function field of the projective quadric related to the form ϕ is denoted by F(ϕ). If L/F is a field extension, then ϕL is the extension of ϕ to L, i. e. the form ϕ ⊗F L. For a, b ∈ F ∗ the symbol 〈〈a, b〉 〉 means the 2 -fold Pfisterform 〈 1, −a, −b, ab〉. If k is a field and p ∈ k[x] is an irreducible polynomial, by k(p) we denote the residue field k[x]/p. I...|$|R
