5|$|An {{expressway}} through Clare County {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Harrison to the east. The former route of US27 along M-61 and 1st Street/Clare Avenue in Harrison was designated Bus. US27 at this time. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US27 designation in the state; the <b>change</b> <b>was</b> approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 {{to make the}} change. After the <b>change</b> <b>was</b> implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in the state to reflect the new parent highway designation.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second <b>change</b> <b>was</b> forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who had missed the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final <b>change</b> <b>was</b> the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, MDOT {{petitioned the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to {{decommission}} the US27 designation in the state; the <b>change</b> <b>was</b> approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 {{to make the}} change. After the <b>change</b> <b>was</b> implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in the state. However, unlike the other new Bus. US127s, this one had no connection to US127, its new parent highway. MDOT has retained the business route as an unsigned trunkline designation ever since.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{stationarity}} {{properties of}} seasonal precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> {{different from one}} season to another and climatic indices that were evidently related to seasonal precipitation changes also differ. Specifically, summer and autumn precipitation changes shared similar changing properties, being influenced mainly by AO. Summer and autumn precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> roughly stationary; spring and winter precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> nonstationary. Spring precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> influenced mainly by PDO. Winter precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> influenced by more climate oscillations. The impacts of ENSO and PDO on winter precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> pronounced. ENSO began to influence precipitation changes during autumn, {{and the influence of}} ENSO became significant during the winter season.|$|R

5|$|With {{the series}} already lost, England made four changes to their team. Dewes {{replaced}} the injured Washbrook, while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut. England played two spinners; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker, while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard's pace. The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes. Australia made three changes. Off spinner Johnson {{was replaced by}} the leg spin of Ring. Australia's second <b>change</b> <b>was</b> forced on them; the injured seamer Toshack {{was replaced by the}} recovered batsman Barnes. The final <b>change</b> <b>was</b> the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} before the {{election}} Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This <b>change</b> <b>was</b> necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President.|$|E
5|$|A major <b>change</b> <b>was</b> {{made in the}} way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 percent of their normal earnings.|$|E

5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another <b>change</b> <b>was</b> the headlamp switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
5|$|A road {{bearing the}} M-81 {{designation}} has existed {{since at least}} July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last <b>change</b> <b>was</b> {{the construction of a}} pair of roundabouts at the I-75/US23 interchange in 2006.|$|E

5|$|An {{expressway}} through Isabella and Clare counties {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Clare to the east. The former route of US27 along McEwan Street and Clare Avenue was designated Bus. US27 at this time. A freeway bypass north of Clare and Farwell opened in 1975, and US10 was rerouted along the US27 freeway to connect {{from the new}} bypass to the existing freeway east of the city, bypassing both cities. The section of US10 in downtown Clare was designated Bus. US10 at this time, running along Bus. US27 to connect to US27/US10 north of downtown. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US27 designation in the state; the <b>change</b> <b>was</b> approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change.

5|$|Another <b>change</b> <b>was</b> the {{transition}} to the use of judges as the electoral returning officer for South Australia. This was done to impose state control on a system which had effectively combined the administration of the national and state electoral rolls. On 27 May 1925, Denny arranged the appointment of Judge Herbert Kingsley Paine of the Insolvency Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state, replacing Charles Mathews, a state public servant who had held the position since 1907. Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate.|$|E
5|$|Another major <b>change</b> <b>was</b> {{the arrival}} of foods from the Americas in Early Modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the {{incorporation}} of the potato into Northern European cuisine, and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean, including P. vulgaris (the French or haricot bean), were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{organizational}} {{change and the}} value of headquarters is derived from a model with costs of delay, vested interests and costs of organizational change. The value of headquarters is derived from imposed organizational <b>change.</b> It <b>is</b> viewed as an institution which is able to prevent surplus reducing endogenous commitment. Imposed organizational <b>change</b> <b>is</b> predicted in circumstances where the desired <b>change</b> <b>is</b> not urgent, the loss of accepting lower offers than in the past is above a certain level, and the costs of imposed <b>change</b> <b>are</b> lower than the costs of delay. Delay occurs and <b>change</b> will <b>be</b> voluntary in these circumstances when the situation is not perceived as urgent and costs of imposed <b>change</b> <b>are</b> high. Voluntary organizational change occurs immediately when the desired <b>change</b> <b>is</b> perceived to be urgent. Case studies are presented along these lines of thought. ...|$|R
