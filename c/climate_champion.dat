40|$|Mainstreaming {{climate change}} {{adaptation}} (CCA) into plans and programs is still a new approach in adaptation and thus there is limited {{information on how to}} operationalize it on-ground. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into the local land use plans in the province of Albay, Philippines. Specifically, this paper developed 20 quantitative "mainstreaming indicators" to assess the state-of-play and the challenges for local mainstreaming. These indicators were classified under three groupings, namely, the information, institutional, and resource capacities of systems. Qualitative analysis of the indicator scores suggested that developing the institutional capacities of local governments is crucial in the local mainstreaming process. Likewise, the results highlighted the "institutional issues" indicator as the primary barrier in operationalizing the approach. These institutional issues are: fragmented laws and regulations; overlapping policy requirements; and the lack of guidelines for mainstreaming CCA into the local land use plans. Meanwhile, the "leadership" indicator, as signified by a <b>climate</b> change <b>champion</b> in Albay, was evaluated as an opportunity for local mainstreaming. The champion effectively led the CCA efforts because the existing institutional mechanisms supported the champion's capacity to influence the behavior of people and produce collective action towards CCA...|$|R
40|$|The city of Dubuque, Iowa, {{aimed for}} a twofer — lower energy costs for public {{facilities}} and reduced air emissions. To achieve that goal, the city partnered with the Iowa Economic Development Authority {{to establish a}} revolving loan fund to finance energy efficiency and other energy projects at city facilities. But the city needed to understand approaches for financing energy projects to achieve both of their goals {{in a manner that}} would not be considered debt — in this case, obligations booked as a liability on the city’s balance sheet. With funding from the U. S. Department of Energy’s <b>Climate</b> Action <b>Champions</b> Initiative, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) provided technical assistance to the city to identify strategies to achieve these goals. Revolving loans use a source of money to fund initial cost-saving projects, such as energy efficiency investments, then use the repayments and interest from these loans to support subsequent projects. Berkeley Lab and the city examined two approaches to explore whether revolving loans could potentially be treated as non-debt: 1) financing arrangements containing a non-appropriation clause and 2) shared savings agreements. This fact sheet discusses both, including considerations that may factor into their treatment as debt from an accounting perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{mainstreaming}} {{of climate}} change adaptation (CCA) is increasingly popular because it integrates both adaptation and sustainable development goals. Although research interest in mainstreaming CCA is growing, there is limited information on its practical application at the local level, particularly {{in relation to the}} barriers to the effective operationalization of the approach. Consequently, this paper examines the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into local land use plans in Albay, Philippines. Using a modified version of Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the conditions surrounding the challenges were identified and assessed. These challenges are characterized as the factors that depict the information, institutional, and resource capacities of systems; hence, they are the factors that affect the effective operationalization of mainstreaming CCA. These challenges were then converted into quantitative “mainstreaming indicators”. Data were collected from a survey conducted among the key players in local land use planning and experts in mainstreaming CCA. A scorecard approach was applied to quantify the respondents’ answers. The results highlighted the “institutional issues” indicator as the primary barrier in operationalizing the approach, while “availability” and “access to information” were assessed as second-level barriers. Conversely, the “leadership” indicator was evaluated as an opportunity for local mainstreaming due to the existence of a <b>climate</b> change <b>champion</b> in Albay. This paper suggests that the: (1) challenges exist in a certain spectrum, in which they can be either barriers or opportunities for mainstreaming; (2) barriers can be classified according to varying degrees of severity; (3) challenges themselves are inter-linked; and (4) barriers can be overcome and transcend into opportunities for mainstreaming CCA...|$|R

Typically, such conspiracy theories assert that climate scientists and politicians are distorting or hijacking the science to suit their own purposes. Climate change conspiracy theories resemble other conspiracy theories in some respects, but in others {{they appear to be}} quite different. For example, climate change conspiracy theories appear to be motivated by the desire to deny or minimize an unwelcome and threatening conclusion. They also appear to be more contentious than other types of conspiracy theories. Perhaps to an unparalleled extent, {{people on both sides of}} the issue <b>champion</b> <b>climate</b> change conspiracy theories. Finally, more than other conspiracy theories, those concerning climate change appear to be more politically loaded, dividing opinion across the left-right continuum.

40|$|Abstract – A {{recent study}} by the Photovoltaics and Hybrid Systems Program at CANMET Energy Technology Centre-Varennes {{examined}} the benefits of on-site generation of electricity using grid-tied photovoltaic technology on buildings in Canada. The study focused on the grid-connect segment of the PV market, which has been experiencing the strongest growth. It showed that while costs of PV worldwide have been falling at about 5 % per year in real terms over the past twenty years following a well-established learning curve, there remain several barriers to be addressed before greater inroads can be made in this sector of photovoltaics in Canada. There are many challenges to grid-tied PV in Canada. CETC-Varennes has been addressing these challenges through their RD&D programactivities. These activities range from removing interconnection barriers to the grid, providing assistance to Canadian industry by <b>championing</b> <b>climate</b> change TEAM projects, accelerating the development of adequate policies, and providing quality information to Canadians. The outcomes of these efforts are elucidated in this paper. CETC-Varennes is committed to continuing building alliances with the private sector and with other federal, provincial and municipal levels of government to mainstream grid-tied PV in Canada. It will continue to seek out technology investment opportunities, such as those provided by TEAM, in order to share the RD&D risk and to demonstrate the benefits of linking private secto...|$|R
40|$|The file {{attached}} to this record is the author's final peer reviewed version. As increasing scientific evidence has shown the potential risk of climate change, various actors at different levels across society have participated in action to mitigate climate change. Such action has included sustainable lifestyle choices by individuals at the household level (Goodall 2007; Jackson 2005; Jones 2010), environmental initiatives in businesses as part of corporate social responsibility at the organisational level (Swaffield & Bell 2012), regulations and policies by national governments (Urwin & Jordan 2008) and various other participants (Yamin & Depledge 2004) at the macro-level. Such action mostly appears to comprise single level cases (e. g. Jones 2010; Swaffield & Bell 2012; Urwin & Jordan 2008), largely underestimating the complex nature of each action involving or requiring different stakeholders at various levels (e. g. individuals, households and community groups at the micro-level; companies, local authorities (LAs) and educational institutions at the meso-level, and national government and other international organisations at the macro-level). This paper aims to show how action across multiple levels (or a set of interventions by different actors at micro-, meso- and macro-levels) for ‘scaling up’ certain forms of sustainable behaviour (van den Bosch 2010) could, in theory, {{be more effective in}} addressing negative environmental impacts than action at a single level. Individual upcycling, the emerging household behaviour which creates or modifies any product from used materials, components or products to generate a product of higher quality or value than the original (Sung, Cooper & Kettley 2014) was used as a case for analysis. This paper is part of a PhD study on ‘sustainable production and consumption by upcycling’ which investigates upcycling by households as an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions related to materials and energy consumption. Household upcycling currently has marginal or niche status in the UK and one of the aims {{of the study was to}} develop actionable strategies for scaling up such activity. The research has three main elements: a) understanding behaviour and actors; b) identifying key behaviour-influencing factors, and c) developing intervention strategies for scaling up. This paper, based on the final phase of the research, answers the question, ‘Which combination of interventions should be implemented by which actors at which level, for successful scaling up of individual upcycling?’ A Semi-Delphi method which took the form of a questionnaire followed by a workshop was employed. The questionnaire explored intervention strategies developed on the basis of previous interviews and a survey of British consumers. The respondents were asked to rate the level of importance (in terms of potential impact on scaling up) and feasibility (technical, economic and political) for each intervention, and vote for the most suitable actor(s) in each case. During the subsequent workshop, participants critiqued a preliminary analysis of the questionnaire results and, collaboratively, selected a combination of interventions for short-term or long-term success using card sorting exercises. About 80 individuals in the UK were contacted for participation based on their expertise in areas such as environmental policies, behaviour change, transition management and sustainable design. Twenty five responded and completed the questionnaire, of whom twenty two were academics from eight universities (in disciplines ranging from politics, engineering, psychology, sociology, art and design, business management and economics), and three were policy-related professionals. Eleven of the respondents took part in the subsequent workshop. The questionnaire results revealed eight interventions to be considered important and nine to be feasible. For many of the interventions, suitable actors tended to be multiple. For example, LAs and NGOs, with the support from local communities, might be most suitable for improving facilities, access and services relating to community workshops. The interventions for short term success that received most support, based on potential impact and feasibility within two years, were a) operating a reuse/upcycle centre with a product collection service aligned with an existing waste management system (LAs and NGOs), b) providing a service model for improved provision of used materials (companies) and c) changing government procurement policy to favour upcycled goods (government and LAs). The interventions for long term success that received most support, based on the potential impact and feasibility within 10 years, were a) enriching the curriculum in art and design at schools, colleges and universities to incorporate advanced upcycling skills and knowledge (government, educational institutions and designers) and b) providing tax benefits and subsidies for upcycling-related businesses (government). The paper demonstrated how individual upcycling may be scaled up from niche to regime (Geels 2002, 2011) through a combination of interventions by actors at various levels. This highlights the potential importance of collaboration (or coordinated actions) between actors at different levels with a shared vision. Meso-level organisations, in particular, may be able to play a key role in connecting micro- and macro-level actors to achieve collaboration and partnerships, and hence should not limit their sustainability activities to internal team efforts or schemes (e. g. <b>climate</b> <b>champions).</b> Managers and decision makers at this level may need to shift their organisational mission and vision to become a key actor, implementing coordinated actions at different levels in society in order to achieve more effective action to prevent climate change...|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{adaptation}} {{presents a}} challenge to current top-down governance structures, including the tension between provision of public goods and actions required by diverse stakeholders, including private actors. Alternative governance approaches that facilitate participation and learning across scales are gaining attention {{for their ability to}} bring together diverse actors across sectors and to foster adaptive capacity and resilience. We have described the method and outcomes from the application of a social-ecological inventory to "prime," i. e., hasten the development of, a regional climate change adaptation network. The social-ecological inventory tool draws on the social-ecological systems approach in which social and ecological systems are considered linked. The tool bridges the gap between conventional stakeholder analysis and biological inventories, drawing on a social-ecological systems approach, and incorporates local knowledge as an explicit component. The process, which is dynamic and iterative, includes six phases: preparations, preliminary identification, identification of key individuals, interviewing, reviewing and enriching the inventory, and engagement. By considering the social and ecological aspects of a system, a more comprehensive inventory is achieved that provides a foundational platform to facilitate or support climate change adaptation processes that are participatory and learning oriented. Although social-ecological inventories have been used for ecosystem management, the intent of this research was to understand the potential of the tool for climate change adaptation. A social-ecological inventory was undertaken in the Niagara Region of Canada to assemble and facilitate a regional governance group to <b>champion</b> <b>climate</b> change adaptation. Moreover, the social-ecological inventory was purposefully undertaken as the initial step in priming the governance system and led into an adaptive comanagement process for climate change adaptation. Early indicators suggest that the social-ecological inventory has been instrumental in facilitating a multisectoral adaptive comanagement governance approach to climate change in the Niagara Region...|$|R

However, there are huge variations in the way health care professionals and primary health care teams respond to intimate partner violence. In this study we tested a previously developed programme theory on 15 primary health care center teams located in four different Spanish regions: Murcia, C Valenciana, Castilla-León and Cantabria. The aim was to identify the key combinations of contextual factors and mechanisms that trigger a good primary health care center team response to intimate partner violence. Methods A multiple case-study design was used. Qualitative and quantitative information was collected from each of the 15 centers (cases). In order to handle the large amount of information without losing familiarity with each case, qualitative comparative analysis was undertaken. Conditions (context and mechanisms) and outcomes, were identified and assessed for each of the 15 cases, and solution formulae were calculated using qualitative comparative analysis software. Results The emerging programme theory highlighted the importance of the combination of each team’s self-efficacy, perceived preparation and women-centredness in generating a good team response to intimate partner violence.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{investigates the}} visually-oriented staged acts of protest {{employed by the}} environmental organization Greenpeace in their international campaigning to stop climate change. This research supports the notion that these demonstrations draw attention to climate change while having the rhetorical capacity to challenge dominant cultural values that have enabled climate changing human activities to continue despite an increasing frequency of natural and manmade disasters. ^ This critical textual analysis focuses on eight images taken from four separate Greenpeace climate change campaigns from 2007 to the present. These images were selected because they are reproduced by multiple news agencies, are the most visually striking, and most clearly challenge dominant discourses of industrialism, nature, and progress. The image sets were analyzed using Kevin DeLuca 2 ̆ 7 s image event, a theory which posits that some visual demonstrations are designed to attract mass media attention in order to advocate a larger audience. Kenneth Burke 2 ̆ 7 s paired concepts of identification and disidentification were also {{used to describe the}} power of images to reveal hegemonic value systems, separate their audience from these systems, and highlight alternative perspectives. After examining all of the selected photographs, conclusions indicated that Greenpeace does construct their demonstrations to attract media attention. They also rely on their visual rhetoric to have persuasive capabilities that exceed the group 2 ̆ 7 s ability to influence public and political spheres using more traditional advocacy methods. It was also found that appealing to human interest is a warrant used by Greenpeace to <b>champion</b> <b>climate</b> change response in addition to revealing the limit of a discourse, the logic of which DeLuca solely accounts for this persuasive effect. The expansion of the electronic public-sphere and values of industrialism suggest that the rhetorical capabilities of image events to give ideological critique and reshape public consciousness function in other Westernized countries and perhaps with greater effect. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. With rapid changes in the business environment, more acute competition and increasingly demanding clients, organisations {{in the construction industry}} have identified innovation as a means of achieving competitive advantage. Innovation provides an important avenue for firms to improve performance while differentiating their products and services. Research has identified a number of factors as influencing innovation in construction organisations. Primarily these include internal factors such as organisational <b>climate,</b> innovation <b>championing,</b> leadership and exogenous influences such as clients, regulations, technology and the economy. The role of senior management in promoting innovation is widely recognised in literature. However, in the construction and project based environment, very few studies have focused on middle management and how their day to day leadership activities impact on innovation and project performance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to improve middle management leadership behaviour in order to facilitate innovation and improve project performance in construction professional services firms. Through a combination of qualitative case study, questionnaire surveys and qualitative interviews, the research identified how the leadership behaviour exhibited by middle managers in the work place could enhance innovation and project performance. The study was undertaken in five phases to reflect the five key objectives for the research. The first phase comprised a review of the literature on innovation to identify key internal and external factors influencing innovation and ultimately, project performance. The second phase involved a case study of three different innovative projects to examine the role of middle managers in facilitating the innovations studied. Phase three of the study investigated the relationships among transformational leadership, innovation <b>championing</b> and organisational <b>climate</b> for innovation while examining how they combine to promote innovation and enhance project performance. Phase four involved qualitative validation of the relationship among the constructs examined in phase three and preparation of leadership development resource for middle managers which was subsequently trialed in phase five. Key findings from the study suggest that transformational leadership behaviour exhibited by middle managers influences innovation by developing an environment conducive to innovation which in turn fosters innovation championing behaviour and ultimately, enhances project performance. The study contributes to knowledge and adds to the understanding of the role of middle managers in facilitating innovation and improving project performance. It demonstrates that the bypass effect of transformational leadership is applicable in the project based environment since transformational leadership of middle managers directly influenced project performance, circumventing project managers. In addition, the cascading effect of transformational leadership was confirmed, as <b>championing</b> behaviour and <b>climate</b> for innovation mediated the relationship between transformational leadership of middle managers and project performance. Furthermore, it revealed that the individual dimensions of transformational leadership influenced innovation and project performance differently. The study found that individualised support was the most influential dimension impacting on innovation <b>championing</b> behaviour, <b>climate</b> for innovation and project performance. Articulating vision and fostering the acceptance of group goals both influenced climate for innovation and project performance. High performance expectation, modelling behaviour and intellectual stimulation influenced innovation championing and project performance. Beyond these the study has highlighted the particular actions which constituted each dimension of transformational leadership and how they influenced the performance of project team members. Through this study transformational leadership development resource has been developed to help middle managers cultivate the expected leadership behaviour that could facilitate innovation and improve project performance. The study also identified how transformational leadership behaviour can be engrained in the day to day working practices of middle managers. The study presents a more positive view of middle managerial role in improving organisational performance contrary to previous negative reporting on this constituency and identifies the need for greater recognition for their role. The study recommends that construction professional services firms should support middle managers to develop transformational leadership behaviour and create the kind of environment where innovation becomes a part of the normal daily work practices. In addition the study opens a new avenue for the study of transformational leadership by using both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the impact of the individual dimensions. It recommends that future research adopts the same approach in different contexts to further test the suggested relationships. The study concludes with recommendations for policy makers to give greater attention to incorporating transformational leadership behaviour into the essential set of behavioural competencies managers in the construction industry need to develop beyond their technical skills...|$|R
