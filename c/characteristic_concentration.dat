60|$|That {{came up in}} all connexions {{during the}} rest of these first days; came up in especial under {{pressure}} of the fact that each time our plighted pair snatched, in its passage, at the good fortune of half an hour together, they were doomed--though Densher felt it as all by his act--to spend a part of the rare occasion in wonder at their luck and in study of its queer character. This was the case after he might be supposed to have got, in a manner, used to it; it was the case after the girl--ready always, as we say, with the last word--had given him the benefit of her righting of every wrong appearance, a support familiar to him now in reference to other phases. It was still the case after he possibly might, with a little imagination, as she freely insisted, have made out, by the visible working of the crisis, what idea on Mrs. Lowder's part had determined it. Such as the idea was--and that it suited Kate's own book she openly professed--he had only to see how things were turning out to feel it strikingly justified. Densher's reply to all this vividness was that of course Aunt Maud's intervention hadn't been occult, even for his vividness, from the moment she had written him, with <b>characteristic</b> <b>concentration,</b> that if he should see his way to come to Venice for a fortnight she should engage he would find it no blunder. It took Aunt Maud really to do such things in such ways; just as it took him, he was ready to confess, to do such others as he must now strike them all--didn't he?--as committed to. Mrs. Lowder's admonition had been of course a direct reference to what she had said to him at Lancaster Gate before his departure the night Milly had failed them through illness; only it had at least matched that remarkable outbreak in respect to the quantity of good nature it attributed to him. The young man's discussions of his situation--which were confined to Kate; he had none with Aunt Maud herself--suffered a little, it may be divined, by the sense that he couldn't put everything off, as he privately expressed it, on other people. His ears, in solitude, were apt to burn with the reflexion that Mrs. Lowder had simply tested him, seen him as he was and made out what could be done with him. She had had but to whistle for him and he had come. If she had taken for granted his good nature she was as justified as Kate declared. This awkwardness of his conscience, both in respect to his general plasticity, the fruit of his feeling plasticity, within limits, to be a mode of life like another--certainly better than some, and particularly in respect to such confusion as might reign about what he had really come for--this inward ache was not wholly dispelled by the style, charming as that was, of Kate's poetic versions. Even the high wonder and delight of Kate couldn't set him right with himself when there was something quite distinct from these things that kept him wrong.|$|E

In DEP-FFF, DEP forces are combined with drag flow to fractionate a sample {{of different types of}} particles. Particles are injected into a carrier flow that passes through the separation chamber, with an external separating force (a DEP force) being applied perpendicular to the flow. By means of different factors, such as diffusion and steric, hydrodynamic, dielectric and other effects, or a combination thereof, particles (<1 μm in diameter) with different dielectric or diffusive properties attain different positions away from the chamber wall, which, in turn, exhibit different <b>characteristic</b> <b>concentration</b> profile.

For all solutes tested, the critical cooling rate is an exponential function of concentration.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracture}} {{treatments are}} used in low permeability shale reservoirs {{in order to provide}} highly conductive pathways from the reservoir to the wellbore. The success of these treatments is highly reliant on the created fracture conductivity. Optimizing fracture designs to improve well performance requires knowledge of how fracture conductivity is affected by rock and proppant characteristics. This study investigates the relationship between rock characteristics and laboratory measurements of propped and unpropped fracture conductivity of outcrop samples. These samples are from the Eagle Ford shale and the Fayetteville shale. Triaxial compression tests were performed on core specimens {{in order to determine the}} Young?s Modulus and Poisson?s Ratio of the outcrop samples. A combination of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the mineralogy. Profilometer surface scans were also performed to characterize the fracture topography. The results from this study show that the main factors affecting fracture conductivity are closure stress and proppant <b>characteristics</b> (<b>concentration,</b> size, and strength). For unpropped fractures, the fracture topography is the main factor in determining fracture conductivity. The topography interaction of the two surfaces determines the fracture width. A higher Young?s Modulus helps maintain this fracture width by resisting deformation as closure stress increases. For propped fractures, the most influential factor in determining fracture conductivity is proppant <b>characteristics</b> (<b>concentration,</b> size, and strength). At a proppant monolayer placement, the major mechanism for conductivity loss is proppant embedment, leading to decreased fracture width. A higher Young?s Modulus reduces the proppant embedment and better maintains fracture conductivity as closure stress increases.

After being washed thoroughly the membranes are dried in air for several hours, soaked in water for several hours, and removed from the tubes. Further drying in air but without support shrinks the membranes slightly. The resulting membranes are designated "permselective" or "megapermselective" protamine collodion membranes.

40|$|We present {{experimental}} results of quasi-elastic light scattering for different charged micellar solutions. The <b>characteristic</b> <b>concentration</b> {{dependence of the}} mutual diffusion coefficient Dm at large volume fraction arises from the many-body hydrodynamic interactions. These interactions are introduced through the quasi-empirical screened Navier-Stokes equation. The effective pair mobility tensor has been calculated for terms up to r - 7 (r is the inter-particle distance) with the formalism of Mazur and van Saarloos. The tensor is not « screened » {{in the sense that}} its long distance behaviour is as an inverse power of r, rather than exponential. A single « screening » constant K is proposed which is volume fraction dependent with only one adjustable parameter. The evolution of Dm with the micellar concentration has been well reproduced by the same value of K at various ionic strengths. At large volume fraction Φ the hydrodynamic interactions are essentially dominated by uncharged hard-sphere repulsions. This observation is confirmed by the fit of the dynamics of concentrated hard-sphere solutions. The behaviour of the self and mutual diffusion coefficients is described by using the same « screening » constant.

A sound theoretical basis and a rational physicochemical understanding based on experimental findings lead to a proper understanding of a topic. Colloid chemistry strengthened its footing by the extensive studies on gold sols by Michael Faraday in 1850 s, however, the term “colloid” was coined by Thomas Graham in 1861. Historically, the Stone Age paintings in the Lascaux cave in France and the written records of Egyptian pharaohs were produced with stabilized colloid pigments. The part of colloid science dealing with amphiphilic molecules is so diverse on its own that it is dealt in a separate branch called the “association colloid”.
