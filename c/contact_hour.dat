5000|$|In {{a college}} or {{university}} in the United States, students generally receive credit hours {{based on the number}} of [...] "contact hours" [...] per week in class, for one term; more well known as Semester Credit Hours. A <b>contact</b> <b>hour</b> includes any lecture or lab time when the professor is teaching the student or coaching the student while they apply the course information to an activity. Regardless of the duration of the course (i.e. a short semester like summer or intersession) and depending on the state or jurisdiction, a semester credit hour (SCH) is 15-16 contact hours per semester. Most college and university courses are 3 Semester Credit Hours (SCH) or 45-48 contact hours, so they usually meet for three hours per week over a 15-week semester.|$|E

40|$|What {{is covered}} in the lab? During {{the first week of}} the lab, {{students}} retake the MPT. Based on test results, students are directed to review using online free, open-source homework system called Webwork which contains a national database of math problems. Although Webwork does not adjust its content to student performance, it does serve as a mechanism to get homework and MPT remediation back to the students and to give them unlimited practice and instant feedback on their work. Remediation topics include fractions, function, geometry, and trigonometry. For the supplemental <b>contact</b> <b>hour,</b> we use pen-and-paper workbooks aligned with the textbook; here, the focus is on the act of writing mathematics as a connection between lecture, homework, and exams. These elements are coordinated with the work of the faculty and TAs, as well as with other course materials: lecture notes, supplemental <b>contact</b> <b>hour</b> workbooks, homework problems, and exam problems.

40|$|Cost {{behavior}} {{analysis was}} used to operationalize higher education cost factors in the analysis of instructional costs of three baccalaureate nursing programs in one state university system. Higher education cost factors were conceptualized by Robinson, Ray and Turk (1977) to be three; volume, decision, and environmental. The 30 variables derived from the three factors were the independent variables used in this study to explore their influence on the dependent variables of cost per student credit hour and cost per student <b>contact</b> <b>hour.</b> Several data sources were used, including a questionnaire which elicited program administrator's perceptions of the relative importance of the three factors to their instructional costs. Instructional costs were partitioned into direct and indirect costs. The data were analyzed in three phases to describe the relative influence of the independent variables on instructional costs within programs, among programs, relative to their respective institutions, and to their respective classification of institutions. The findings suggest that volume and decision factors more strongly influence costs than do environmental factors. The mix of volume and decision factors influencing costs differed for the three programs. In general, the most influential volume factors on costs were the number and frequency of course and class offerings. The most influential of the decision variables was student-faculty ratio and faculty rank mix. Higher full-time-equivalent enrollments and higher student credit hour production did not correspond to lower instructional costs, largely because of intervening decision factor variables. All three nursing programs were more costly per student credit hour when indexed to the average instructional expenditures for their respective universities. However, when the nursing program costs were indexed to the average instructional expenditures per full-time-equivalent enrollments of their respective institutional classifications, all three nursing programs were lower than the average. The model of instructional cost analysis used in this modified case study proved to be effective in identifying sources of higher costs within programs and variations among the programs. For student <b>contact</b> <b>hour</b> intensive programs such as nursing, student <b>contact</b> <b>hour,</b> as opposed to the student credit hour is recommended as the more sensitive measure of direct instructional costs...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In high {{incidence}} settings, {{the majority of}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) transmission occurs outside the household. Little is known about where people's indoor contacts occur outside the household, and how this differs between different settings. We estimate the number of <b>contact</b> <b>hours</b> that occur between adults and adult/youths and children in different building types in urban areas in Western Cape, South Africa, and Zambia. METHODS: Data were collected from 3206 adults using a cross-sectional survey, on buildings visited in a 24 -h period, including building function, visit duration, and number of adults/youths and children (5 - 12 years) present. The mean numbers of <b>contact</b> <b>hours</b> per day by building function were calculated. RESULTS: Adults in Western Cape {{were more likely to}} visit workplaces, and less likely to visit shops and churches than adults in Zambia. Adults in Western Cape spent longer per visit in other homes and workplaces than adults in Zambia. More adults/youths were present at visits to shops and churches in Western Cape than in Zambia, and fewer at homes and hairdressers. More children were present at visits to shops in Western Cape than in Zambia, and fewer at schools and hairdressers. Overall numbers of adult/youth indoor <b>contact</b> <b>hours</b> were the same at both sites (35. 4 and 37. 6 h in Western Cape and Zambia respectively, p[*]=[*] 0. 4). Child <b>contact</b> <b>hours</b> were higher in Zambia (16. 0 vs 13. 7 h, p[*]=[*] 0. 03). Adult/youth and child <b>contact</b> <b>hours</b> were highest in workplaces in Western Cape and churches in Zambia. Compared to Zambia, adult <b>contact</b> <b>hours</b> in Western Cape were higher in workplaces (15. 2 vs 8. 0 h, p[*]=[*] 0. 004), and lower in churches (3. 7 vs 8. 6 h, p[*]=[*] 0. 002). Child <b>contact</b> <b>hours</b> were higher in other peoples' homes (2. 8 vs 1. 6 h, p[*]=[*] 0. 03) and workplaces (4. 9 vs 2. 1 h, p[*]=[*] 0. 003), and lower in churches (2. 5 vs 6. 2, p[*]=[*] 0. 004) and schools (0. 4 vs 1. 5, p[*]=[*] 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of indoor contact between adults and adults/youths and children differ between different sites in high M. tb incidence areas.

These costs are derived as functions of student population density, a parameter which can be calculated from census data for one potential market for CAI, the public primary and secondary schools.
