40|$|We {{compared}} Ro 11 - 8958, {{an analog}} of trimethoprim (TMP) with improved antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic properties, other dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and dapsone (DAP) {{in the treatment}} of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in an immunosuppressed rat model. In contrast to previous reports, high dosages of the DHFR inhibitors were used in combination with fixed, low dosages of SMX (3 mg/kg of body weight per day) or DAP (25 mg/kg/day). When administered alone at these dosages, SMX and DAP reduced the median P. carinii <b>cyst</b> <b>count</b> about 5 - to 15 -fold. Ro 11 - 8958, TMP, and diaveridine used at a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day with SMX were only slightly more effective than SMX used alone. However, administration of these DHFR inhibitors at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with SMX lowered the <b>cyst</b> <b>count</b> about 500 - to 1, 000 -fold, indicating a synergistic effect. Little or no synergism was found when other DHFR inhibitors (pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, and tetroxoprim) were combined with SMX. Regimens of Ro 11 - 8958 at a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day with DAP and of TMP or diaveridine used at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with DAP showed comparable anti-P. carinii activity, lowering the <b>cyst</b> <b>count</b> 100 - to 200 -fold. By contrast, Ro 11 - 8958 administered at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with DAP reduced the <b>cyst</b> <b>count</b> > 1, 000 -fold. Thus, the experimental approach used here enables the rat model of pneumocystosis to be used to compare synergistic combinations of antifolate drugs. The favorable results achieved with Ro 11 - 8958 indicate that it should be considered for clinical trials...|$|E

P. carinii was not cleared from the lungs until after week 13 (more than 6 weeks after discontinuation of all steroids). Histologically, there was an increased prominence of alveolar macrophages and the progressive development of interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate and fibrosis. Thus, P. carinii grows grows slowly in vivo and interacts with specific host cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Our aim was {{to study}} histopathological changes in lung tissue at the light {{microscopic}} and ultrastructural level during recovery from immunosuppres-sion and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Male Wistar rats were immunosuppressed by per oral dexamethasone for 12 weeks to induce P. carinii pneumonia, after which dexamethasone was stopped. Recovery was monitored 1, 2 and 4 weeks after cessation of the immunosuppres-sion. In immunosuppressed animals, CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes were both decreased in situ. CD 8 + lymphocytes increased above control level at week one. Like CD 8 + cells, the ED 1 + macrophages increased rapidly in situ. This {{was accompanied by a}} progressively increasing migration (more transient for lymphocytes) of macrophages into bronchoalveolar fluid, associated with morphological signs of activation and phagocytosis and proliferation of type II pneumocytes. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) increased from subnormal levels to a 4 week peak, with an inverse correlation between TNF-α and <b>cyst</b> <b>count</b> (r=- 0. 626).

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} radical and conservative surgical interventions for liver hydatid disease. METHODS: The study comprised 59 patients in two groups who had undergone radical and conservative surgical procedures for liver hydatid disease in our department between 2004 and 2009. Preoperative diagnostic tools, medical treatments, demographic and clinical characteristics, postoperative follow-up, and recurrence were compared in both groups. RESULTS: This non-randomized retrospective study included 59 patients who had undergone liver hydatid disease surgery. The radical technique was used in 18 patients (mean age: 42. 1 ± 13. 5 years, seven male, 11 female), and the conservative technique was used in 41 patients (mean age: 43. 5 ± 13. 9 years, 17 male, 24 female). The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 58 mo. Although operative time was significantly shorter in the conservative group (P < 0. 001), recurrence was significantly reduced in the radical group (P = 0. 045).

In this study, we constructed a DNA vaccine expressing a TgPLP 1 /MIC 6 fusion protein using the pIRESneo vector, and we evaluated the immune response induced by this vaccine in Kunmingmice. Levels of IgG antibody, gamma interferon (IFN-), interleukin 2 (IL- 2), IL- 12, IL- 4, and IL- 10 were examined.

40|$|Alexandrium tamarense is a cyst-forming dinoflagellate {{that can}} cause {{toxicity}} in shellfish. Belfast Lough, in northeast Ireland, has experienced toxicity events due {{to the presence of}} A. tamarense, which are monitored because of shellfish farms in the Lough. Since 1992 anthropogenic influences on the Lough have changed with the introduction of a ‘fast cat’ ferry service and an increase in mussel farming. In 2002 Belfast Lough was surveyed for A. tamarense cyst distribution in the sediments and the results are compared to a previous cyst survey carried out in the Lough in 1992. Cyst numbers were generally lower in 2002 than in 1992 (t-test, P < 0. 01). The highest concentration found in 2002 was 1058 cysts g− 1 dry sediment compared with 3330 in 1992. Although sediment disturbance increased in the period between the surveys and plays a role in cyst distribution, A. tamarense cysts are still present in the seabed of the Lough. These cysts remain an important repository of inoculating cells for A. tamarense blooms that have not been removed by the recent anthropogenic activity in the Lough and therefore the requirement for monitoring remains. Comparisons between <b>cyst</b> <b>counts</b> per volume of wet sediment and per weight of dry sediment were carried out, and although the first is needed for ecological studies allowing a deeper analysis, it is also recommended that <b>cyst</b> <b>counts</b> per dry weight of sediment are always reported for wider comparative purposes...|$|R

The available medications, for chronic toxoplasmosis, are awfully limited by resistance of Toxoplasma cysts. Therefore, {{there is a growing}} necessity for novel therapeutic approaches. Agents increasing cAMP levels and downregulating proinflammatory cytokine could inhibit Toxoplasma conversion to the bradyzoite stage. This study explores a potential immunomodulatory effect of rolipram, a PDE 4 inhibitor, on the course of experimental toxoplasmosis and links this role to deterrence of the resistant chronic phase of the disease. Materials and methodsMice infected with low pathogenic strain of Toxoplasma gondii were treated with rolipram for three weeks. The effect of rolipram was evaluated through tissue injury scoring, brain <b>cyst</b> <b>count,</b> specific IgG titers as well as TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL- 12 assays. ResultsRolipram was partially able to prevent the progression to chronic toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma brain cyst burden showed a 74 % reduction while Toxoplasma-induced inflammatory foci per liver area and nucleated cells per inflammatory focus were significantly reduced: 57. 14 % and 61. 3 % respectively. Significant reduction of TNF-α (84. 6 %), IFN-γ (76. 7 %) and IL- 12 (71 %) levels was demonstrated along with significant inhibition of anti-Toxoplasma antibody response. ConclusionRolipram efficiently modulated the Toxoplasma-induced immunological changes with a consequent remission of chronic toxoplasmosis.

The interviews revealed that among the 300 study participants, 182 (60. 7 %) had been infected by taeniosis at least once during the previous year and of these 99. 0 % had eaten raw or undercooked beef, the majority (88. 3 %) obtained from butchers assumed to provide officially inspected meat that was fit for consumption. This indicated that existing meat inspection processes were inadequate to prevent carcasses infected with T. saginata cysticerci from reaching consumers. The high prevalence of viable cysts in the edible parts of beef together with the widespread consumption of raw or undercooked beef indicated the importance of T. saginata cysticercosis as a food safety problem in eastern Ethiopia. The promotion of policies to upgrade existing meat inspection procedures and public education to ensure effective prevention of T. saginata taeniosis in humans were recommended...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSES: To {{evaluate}} the histomorphometry of ovarian interstitial cells, {{as well as}} the blood sex steroid concentrations of female rats with polycystic ovaries induced by continuous light. METHODS: Twenty female rats were divided into two groups: Control Group - in the estrous phase (CtrlG), and a group of rats with polycystic ovaries induced by continuous illumination (POG). CtrlG animals were maintained on a light period from 07 : 00 a. m. to 07 : 00 p. m., and POG animals with continuous illumination (400 Lux) for 60 days. After this period all animals were anesthetized and blood was collected for the determination of serum estradiol (E 2), progesterone (P 4), and testosterone (T), followed by removal of the ovaries that were fixed in 10 % formalin and processed for paraffin embedding. Five-µm histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and used for histomorphometric analysis. Morphological analyses, <b>cyst</b> <b>count,</b> determination of concentration and of the nuclear volume of interstitial cells were performed {{with the aid of a}} light microscope adapted to a high resolution camera (AxioCam), whose images were transmitted to and analyzed by the computer using AxioVision Rel 4. 8 software (Carl Zeiss). Data were analyzed statistically by the Student's t-test (p CtrlG= 73. 2 ± 6. 5, p CtrlG= 80. 6 ± 3. 9, p POG= 4. 2 ± 1. 5, p CtrlG= 63. 6 ± 16. 5, p CtrlG= 6. 9 ± 3. 2, p GCtrl= 73, 2 ± 6, 5; p GCtrl= 80, 6 ± 3, 9; p GOP= 4, 2 ± 1, 5; p GCtrl= 63, 6 ± 16, 5; p GCtrl= 6, 9 ± 3, 2; p< 0, 05) em relação aos animais do GCtrl. CONCLUSÃO: As células intersticiais do ovário policístico da rata provavelmente provêm dos cistos ovarianos devido degeneração das células da granulosa e diferenciação das células da teca interna. As elevações dos níveis séricos de testosterona e de estradiol provavelmente provêm do aumento significativo da atividade celular e da área ocupada pelas células intersticiais.

40|$|OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a histomorfometria das células intersticiais dos ovários, bem como analisar a concentração sanguínea de esteroides sexuais de ratas portadoras de ovários policísticos induzidos pela luz contínua. MÉTODOS: Vinte ratas foram divididas em dois grupos: ratas na fase de estro (GCtrl) e ratas portadoras de ovários policísticos induzidos pela iluminação contínua (GOP). Os animais do GCtrl permaneceram com período de luz das 7 : 00 s 19 : 00 horas, e os animais do GOP, com iluminação contínua (400 Lux), durante um período de 60 dias. Ao final desse período todos os animais foram anestesiados, foi coletado o sangue, para determinação dos níveis séricos de {{estradiol}} (E 2), progesterona (P 4) e testosterona (T), seguido da retirada dos ovários que foram fixados em formol a 10 % e processados para inclusão em parafina. Cortes histológicos com 5 µm corados pela hematoxilina e eosina foram utilizados para análise histomorfométrica. As análises morfológicas, contagem de cistos, determinação da concentração e do volume nuclear das células intersticiais foram realizadas com o auxílio de microscópio de luz adaptado a uma câmera de alta resolução (AxioCam), cujas imagens foram transmitidas e analisadas em computador com software AxioVision Rel 4. 8 (Carl Zeiss). Os dados obtidos foram submetidos ao teste t de Student (p GCtrl= 73, 2 ± 6, 5; p GCtrl= 80, 6 ± 3, 9; p GOP= 4, 2 ± 1, 5; p GCtrl= 63, 6 ± 16, 5; p GCtrl= 6, 9 ± 3, 2; p PURPOSES: To {{evaluate the}} histomorphometry of ovarian interstitial cells, {{as well as}} the blood sex steroid concentrations of female rats with polycystic ovaries induced by continuous light.

CONCLUSION: The interstitial cells of the rat polycystic ovary probably originate from ovarian cysts due to the degeneration of granulosa cells and differentiation of the internal theca cells. The elevations of serum testosterone and estradiol were probably due to the significant increase in cell activity and in the area occupied by interstitial cells...|$|E
40|$|Although studies {{indicate}} that alveolar macrophages participate in host defense against Pneumocystis carinii, their role in organism degradation and clearance from the lung {{has not yet been}} established. We, therefore, quantified the uptake and degradation of 35 S-labeled P. carinii by cultured macrophages, demonstrating significant degradation of P. carinii over 6 h. We further evaluated the role of macrophages in elimination of P. carinii from the living host. Rats received either intratracheal PBS, liposomal PBS (L-PBS), or liposomal dichloromethylene diphosphonate (L-Cl 2 MDP), a preparation which leads to selective depletion of macrophages. Over 72 h, L-Cl 2 MDP-treated animals had loss of > 85 % of their alveolar macrophages. In contrast, L-PBS-treated rats had cellular differentials identical to rats receiving PBS. Macrophage-depleted rats and controls were next inoculated with P. carinii and organism clearance was determined after 24 h. P. carinii elimination was evaluated with both <b>cyst</b> <b>counts</b> and an ELISA directed against glycoprotein A (gpA), the major antigen of P. carinii. Both assays indicated that macrophage-depleted rats had substantial inpairment of P. carinii clearance compared to L-PBS- or PBS-treated rats. These data provide the first direct evidence that macrophages mediate elimination of P. carinii from the living host...|$|R
40|$|The {{course of}} primary infections with Giardia muris differs between BALB and B 10 H- 2 congenic strains of mice. In the first 3 weeks of infection, {{there is a}} more rapid decline in {{intestinal}} trophozoite and fecal <b>cyst</b> <b>counts</b> in B 10 strains than in BALB strains. To determine whether this difference could be explained by variation in specific antibody responses, both secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum antibody responses were compared between these strains. No significant differences in the timing, titer, or specificity of secretory or serum antibodies were found. However, on comparing specific anti-G. muris serum IgG subclass responses, we found that B 10 strains produced IgG 2 a while BALB strains produced IgG 1, suggesting differential involvement of T helper 1 and 2 subsets of lymphocytes. When cells harvested from mesenteric lymph nodes were stimulated with concanavalin A in vitro, both gamma interferon and interleukin- 5 were secreted by cells from B 10 mice, but only interleukin- 5 was secreted by cells from BALB/c mice. Specific blockade of gamma interferon by monoclonal antibody administered to B 10 mice resulted in an enhanced intensity of infection...|$|R

40|$|Heterodera cajani is an {{important}} nematode pest of pigeonpea in India and a simple and reliable greenhouse procedure has been developed to screen pigeonpea genotypes for resistance to it. In pot experiments, white cysts of H. cajani were counted on {{the roots of the}} susceptible genotype ICPL 87 at 15, 30 and 45 days after seedling emergence in soils infested with different levels of H. cajani. The seedlings were rated for the number of white cysts per root system on a one (highly resistant, no cysts) to nine (highly susceptible, more than 30 cysts) scale. White cysts were not easy to see on wet roots but were clearly visible on slightly dried roots. <b>Cyst</b> <b>counts</b> and ratings were more uniform when roots of 30 day old seedlings were evaluated than when 15 or 45 day old seedlings were examined. Effects of different H. cajani infestation levels on the ratings were not significant although the use of higher inoculum densities (16 to 27 eggs and juveniles/cm 3 soil) was effective in reducing variability. This procedure was used to screen 60 pigeonpea genotypes and all of them were rated seven or nine. Ten accessions of Atylosia spp. and Rhynchosia spp. were rated three...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} in solid medium, in water microcosm co-cultures and by light and {{transmission electron microscopy}} the influence of Legionella pneumophila Lp- 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Burkholderia cepacia ATCC 25416 and Pseudomonas fluorescens SSD 35 on the growth and survival of Acanthamoeba polyphaga. The infection with L. pneumophila was microscopically characterized {{by the presence of}} few bacteria inside protozoa at 4 th h, and by the beginning of disruptive effects in late phase of trial. In water microcosm studies, performed at different temperature, the more significant interactions were observed at 30 °C. In these conditions, L. pneumophila caused a marked reduction in trophozoite and <b>cyst</b> <b>counts</b> from the 4 th day until the end of incubation (11 days). B. cepacia showed, by microscopic observation, few and generally single rods within protozoan phagosomes and caused a light reduction of trophozoite viability and cyst formation in co-cultures. A more invasive type of endocytosis, characterized by an early invasion with the presence of a high bacteria number inside amoebae, was observed for Pseudomonas strains. P. fluorescens produced a violent lysis of the host, whereas P. aeruginosa did not cause lysis or suffering. These results underline that water bacteria other than legionella are capable of intracellular survival in Acanthamoeba, influencing the protozoa viable cycle...|$|R

40|$|Lycopodium clavatum tablets are {{commonly}} added as a spike to determine dinoflagellate cyst concentrations in sediments. In {{this study we}} investigate the effects of different processing techniques on dinoflagellate cyst concentrations using well-mixed sediment samples from Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, Canada. At the onset of any dinoflagellate cyst investigation, we suggest following the recommendations of Maher (1981) to experimentally adjust the sample size to obtain a ratio close to ~ 2 of dinoflagellate <b>cysts</b> <b>counted</b> to Lycopodium spores counted, {{in order to obtain}} reproducible concentrations. Results further show that both oven-drying at ~ 45 °C and freeze-drying are viable, non-destructive techniques yielding reproducible results. Use of warm HCl (40 – 60 °C) for a short time (30 min) is harmless, whereas treatment with warm HF (40 – 60 °C) affects the reproducibility of the concentrations. Pre-sieving can result in loss of cysts and/or spike but this can be easily monitored by checking the residue. Perforated metal sieves show more consistent results than the Nitex nylon meshes. The use of 30 second sonication does not affect the reproducibility, and is advised to remove amorphous organic matter. Adding the Lycopodium spike at the end of preparation yields consistently lower concentrations, which were usually not reproducible, suggesting noticeable losses of Lycopodium spores during processing if the Lycopodium spores are added at the beginning. This method can be considered a viable alternative, but the discrepancy should be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of Giardia was investigated along the Oreto river between January 2008 and May 2009 {{with the aim}} of understanding the source of contamination by molecular typing of cysts. Methods: A total of 38 water samples (10 collected from the river mouth, 24 from the whole Oreto basin and 4 sewage samples from the Monreale treatment plant) were processed. In addition, 22 faecal samples of livestock living close to the Oreto area, were analyzed. The {{presence of}} Giardia was determined by immunofluorescence assay and their genetic characterization was achieved by a nested PCR assay targeting the triosephosphate isomerase gene. Results: All water samples from the river mouth were positive for Giardia, even if the concentration of cysts fluctuated considerably among sampling occasions. Our investigation showed that the Vadduneddu and Altofonte torrents, two influents of the river, were the principal sources of contamination. Moreover, the genotypes of Vadduneddu torrent were the same as those detected in human wastewater taken from the activated sludge plant of Monreale city. Assemblages A and B were found in water samples with a predominance of Assemblage A, subtype AII. Assemblage E was only found in a single calf isolate. Conclusions: The data show that the high <b>cyst</b> <b>counts</b> regularly detected in the Oreto river are due to contamination with wastewater of human origin. This finding is relevant for public health, particularly because river water is used for agricultural purposes...|$|R
