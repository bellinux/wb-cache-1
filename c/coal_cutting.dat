40|$|PRESENT INVESTIGATION [...] The {{purpose of}} the 1991 {{drilling}} program was twofold: 1. To evaluate the coal reserves in a previously identified thick coal {{in an area of}} low structural dips and dip-slope topography near the axial plunge of the west extension of the Deadfall Syncline, primarily for surface mining, and to determine the feasibility of mining additional beds in conjunction with the thick coal. (For the purposes of this investigation, this coal is designated K 3 as explained below), 2. To examine a continuous and unbroken stratigraphic interval of the Corwin formation in the northeastern part of the Deadfall Syncline as an initial step toward evaluation of the whole basin. This was accomplished by drilling overlapping [...] holes aligned generally parallel to the dip direction, and spaced in accordance with [...] the magnitude of dip and depth capacity of the drill. About 720 feet of stratigraphic [...] section were covered in this way. A total of fourteen exploratory holes were drilled, ranging from 116 to 426 feet in depth (Figure [...] 2). The drill was a Mobil B- 60 mounted on a Nodwell tracked vehicle. Circulation was provided by a large compressor mounted on another Nodwell. Most of the footage was drilled with an air hammer, which provided a significant improvement in drilling rates over conventional rotary drilling. Lithology of cuttings from all holes was logged continuously, and composite grab samples from each 5 or 10 foot interval were taken. <b>Coal</b> <b>cuttings</b> were collected on a (relatively) clean plastic sheet, and promptly double bagged in plastic to minimize loss of bed moisture.

40|$|High {{contents}} of arsenic (As) in coal samples from four localities within Neogene deposits of the Pannonian Basin in Slovenia are presented and {{discussed in this}} paper. Data from three localities represent interval samples of <b>coal</b> <b>cuttings</b> from wells TER- 1 (Terbegovci), Sob- 3 g (Murska Sobota), and MD- 1 (Mislinjska Dobrava). The fourth locality is Globoko, where the main lignite seam was analysed already in 1989. The oldest are coal samples from the MD- 1 well which {{are supposed to be}} of the Lower Miocene age (except for the shallowest one, which is of the Plio-Quaternary age). Coal samples from the TER- 1 and Sob- 3 g wells are of the Upper Miocene age (Mura Formation). The lignite sample from Globoko is of the Upper Miocene age too (Pontian; Globoko Formation). Most samples were prepared for the ICP-MS method analysis as “whole coal”, dry, pulverized lab-samples, weighting ca. 10 g. The results show for all “whole coals” samples considerably increased {{contents of}} As: 22. 7, 111. 4, 222. 1, and 131. 4 µg/g for the Lower Miocene (?), and 84. 5 µg/g for the Plio-Quaternary coals from MD- 1 well, 392 µg/g for coals from the Sob- 3 g well, and 116 µg/g for a coal from the TER- 1 well (both Upper Miocene – Mura Formation). In the case of Globoko, not “whole coal” but its high temperature ash was analysed and showed As content as high as 170 µg/g applying AAS method of analysis, and even 260 µg/g applying the ICP-MS. Origin of As could be pre-Neogene rocks of the hinterland and/or Neogene calc-alkaline volcanites.
