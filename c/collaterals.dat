The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E

5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer <b>collaterals</b> leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The dendrites are covered with dendritic spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje cell run as high as 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting <b>collaterals</b> that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E
25|$|In the hypothalamus, {{oxytocin}} {{is made in}} magnocellular neurosecretory {{cells of}} the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and is stored in Herring bodies at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) of the pituitary gland. These axons (likely, but dendrites have not been ruled out) have <b>collaterals</b> that innervate neurons in the nucleus accumbens, a brain structure where oxytocin receptors are expressed. The endocrine effects of hormonal oxytocin and the cognitive or behavioral effects of oxytocin neuropeptides {{are thought to be}} coordinated through its common release through these <b>collaterals.</b> Oxytocin is also produced by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project {{to other parts of the}} brain and to the spinal cord. Depending on the species, oxytocin receptor-expressing cells are located in other areas, including the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.|$|E
40|$|Enhancement of {{coronary}} <b>collateral</b> function is an intriguing {{approach to the}} preservation of ischaemic myocardium.

In striking contrast to the 100,000-plus inputs from parallel fibers, each Purkinje cell receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this single fiber [...] "climbs" [...] the dendrites of the Purkinje cell, winding around them and making a total of up to 300 synapses as it goes.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{cross-country}} differences in <b>collateral</b> laws regarding movable assets on lending and sectoral allocation of resources. Using micro-level loan data for a sample of emerging market countries we show that loan-to-values of loans collateralized with movable assets are on average 21 percentage points higher in countries with strong-collateral laws relative to immovable assets. Further, stronger <b>collateral</b> laws tilt <b>collateral</b> composition away from immovable to movable assets.

30|$|Since {{empirical}} studies {{have identified a}} significant positive influence of <b>collateral</b> on the recovery rate, {{there has been a}} second strand of literature, in which the <b>collateral</b> provided, instead of the individual debtors or loans, is studied. Studies in this field analyze the fundamental value of different forms of <b>collateral,</b> such as <b>collateral</b> in real estate, guarantees, etc. The fundamental value is measured by the proceeds ratio, which relates the realized proceeds to the original fundamental value assumed by the bank. Grunert (2010) analyzes potential factors influencing the proceeds ratio, based on a German data set consisting of 104 pieces of <b>collateral</b> (of which 62 are <b>collateral</b> in real estate). The average proceeds ratio is 61  %, and the author concludes that the proceeds ratio fluctuates {{depending on the type of}} <b>collateral.</b> Franks et al.

40|$|We {{examine the}} issue of {{pledging}} <b>collateral</b> {{and its effect on}} access to credit, interest rates and credit risk of SMEs financing in Bangladesh with respect to bank size. We also examine the <b>collateral</b> classification (fixed assets <b>collateral,</b> personal guarantee and third-party guarantee) by bank ownership types to find what types of <b>collateral</b> are preferred by public, private and foreign banks in Bangladesh for lending to firms. In addition to that, we examine whether <b>collateral</b> requirements are different between large and small banks as they have different incentives for <b>collateral</b> based lending. Our empirical results suggest that small banks have no additional incentives to provide loans based on the <b>collateral</b> security than large banks. Hence, we did not find any evidence that <b>collateral</b> can increase access to credit for SMEs from small banks.

With regards to <b>collateral</b> segmentation across bank ownership types and bank size, our regression’s results suggest that each type of banks has its own preferences about <b>collateral</b> requirements while lending to firms.

40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{regulators}} in the U. S. and the U. K. {{have protected}} the <b>collateral</b> takerâs right to re-use securities <b>collateral</b> in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets on {{the understanding that}} it would promote liquidity and credit growth, and reduce systemic risk. However, this rationale was incomplete: it failed to acknowledge the full implications of <b>collateral</b> re-use for systemic risk. In this dissertation, I aim to complete that understanding by illustrating how the re-use of securities <b>collateral</b> in those markets can aggravate systemic risk. In particular, I describe two effects. First, re-using securities <b>collateral</b> multiplies the number of market participants that will be exposed {{to changes in the}} price of the <b>collateral</b> asset and can thus amplify the role of asset prices as channels of contagion. Second, by conferring a right to re-use, the <b>collateral</b> provider will effectively waive its proprietary interests in the <b>collateral</b> assets and retain a mere contractual claim against the <b>collateral</b> taker for the return of equivalent securities. This transformation will accentuate the incentive of the <b>collateral</b> provider to run from an over-collateralised <b>collateral</b> taker if the latter were to experience financial difficulty. Information asymmetries and a lack of coordination among <b>collateral</b> providers could push the <b>collateral</b> taker over the brink of insolvency. These risks pose an obvious question for regulators: what should we do about <b>collateral</b> re-use? At a time when international bodies are drawing their attention to this widespread market practice, the question is an invitation to a very timely reflection. The final chapter of the dissertation offers an answer to this question and assesses the potential efficacy of the most recent regulatory initiatives in relation to <b>collateral</b> re-use. </p...|$|R
