In contemporary times, one of the foremost and influential architects in the city has been Warren C. Heylman, who helped give the city a great breadth of mid-century architecture. Heylman's career was most prolific during the 1960s and 1970s where his main body of work was done in the modernist style, designing numerous residential houses, apartment buildings, and architectural embellishments. Some of his most noteworthy works in Spokane include The Parkade, Spokane International Airport, Spokane Regional Health Building, and the Burlington Northern Latah Creek Bridge over Hangman Valley.|$|E

40|$|Key words: duck, <b>chilling</b> <b>water</b> temperature, breast meat quality ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to inves-tigate whether variations in <b>chill</b> <b>water</b> temperature affect muscle shortening and meat quality in duck breast. Three <b>chill</b> <b>water</b> temperatures were applied to duck carcasses at 20 min postmortem for 30 min, including in ice water at 0 °C, in cold water at 10 °C, and in water at 20 °C.

The pH of breast meat in the 0 °C treatment was higher (P 0. 05) in pH existed among treatments. Drip loss, cooking loss, and moisture content were not different for breast meat samples that were chilled at different temperatures. Differences (P 0. 05) among the breast meat samples chilled at different <b>chill</b> <b>water</b> temperatures.

40|$|ABSTRACT A large spin-type chiller in an Ontario poultry {{processing}} plant was adapted so that the <b>chill</b> <b>water</b> could be treated with various levels of chlorine dioxide (C 102), increasing the con-centration of C 102 from 0 to 1. 39 mg/liter resulting in reducing the bacteria count {{to the point where}} salmonellae could not be isolated from the <b>chill</b> <b>water</b> or the <b>chilled</b> broiler carcasses. In addition, coliform, psychrotroph, and aerobic plate counts were all greatly reduced (< 1 log cycle) in <b>chill</b> <b>water</b> but were only slightly reduced (<. 5 log cycle) in macerated chicken broiler breast skin. Shelf-life was lengthened for broiler carcasses treated with 1. 33 and 1. 39 mg/liter C 102 as compared to control carcasses.

25|$|AstroWorld was {{constructed}} on {{land that was}} swampy and prone to flooding. A million cubic yards (765,000 m³) of dirt were used to fill the site in preparation for construction. Some areas of the site were filled to depths as great as six feet (1.8 m). Ahead of its time, a unique feature of the park's infrastructure included 2,400 tons (8,400kW) of outdoor air conditioning powered by systems built by Carrier Corporation. Underground pipes carrying <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> radiated out to most areas {{of the park and}} provided cool air to queue lines, picnic tables, shops, restaurants and other large open spaces. Air conditioning ducts and grates were disguised and blended to match the area's theming. High standards were set by Judge Hofheinz. Mr. Hofheinz had final approval for aspects of park design. Many rare and valuable antiques, some from Mr. Hofheinz's personal collection, were used to enhance the theming in areas. The original landscaping, all designed in-house, included approximately 10,000 trees, 20,000 shrubs, and countless millions of flowers; nearly 600 varieties of plants were all combined to create a distinct atmosphere for each of the themed areas.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Percent water uptake, thawing, {{and cooking}} losses were {{determined}} on broiler carcasses {{which had been}} ice-slush chilled (ice slush, 1 C overnight), brine chilled (5 % NaCl, — 1 C overnight), and hot packaged (no chill). After cooking, the meat samples were evaluated for flavor, tenderness, and juiciness by a taste panel. Shear force and percent moisture analyses were also conducted. Carcasses and <b>chill</b> <b>water</b> were tested for microbial population throughout the experi-ment. Brine-chilled carcasses had significantly greater water uptake and lower thawing and cooking losses than conventionally-chilled carcasses. While all samples were scored favorably for flavor, tenderness, and juiciness, brine-chilled samples received higher scores than conventionally-chilled or hot-packaged samples. Meat from brine-chilled carcasses had a significantly higher moisture content and lower shear force values (more tender) than meat from conventionally-chilled or hot-packaged carcasses. Total plate and coliform counts were lower for both brine-chilled and conventionally-chilled carcasses than for hot-packaged carcasses.

2500|$|On {{the liquid}} side of these heat exchangers, the common fluids are water, a water-glycol solution, steam, or a refrigerant.

5000|$|A {{new twist}} on this {{technology}} uses ice as a condensing medium for the refrigerant. In this case, regular refrigerant is pumped to coils {{where it is}} used. Rather than needing a compressor to convert it back into a liquid, however, the low temperature of ice is used to chill the refrigerant back into a liquid.

In addition, unlike water-cooled <b>chill</b> <b>water</b> systems that do not experience a tremendous difference in efficiency from day to night, this new class of equipment typically displaces daytime operation of air-cooled condensing units.
