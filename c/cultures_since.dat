25|$|Germanium dioxide {{is used in}} algaculture as an {{inhibitor}} {{of unwanted}} diatom growth in algal <b>cultures,</b> <b>since</b> contamination with the comparatively fast-growing diatoms often inhibits the growth of or outcompetes the original algae strains. GeO2 is readily taken up by diatoms and leads to silicon being substituted by germanium in biochemical processes within the diatoms, causing a significant reduction of the diatoms' growth rate or even their complete elimination, with little effect on non-diatom algal species. For this application, the concentration of germanium dioxide typically used in the culture medium is between 1 and 10mg/l, depending {{on the stage of}} the contamination and the species.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, archaeological {{excavations}} {{have proven}} {{that the area}} around modern-day Xuzhou, including the later heartland of Xu, was a major trading hub and cultural centre for the Yangshao, Dawenkou and Longshan <b>cultures</b> <b>since</b> the 3rd millennium BC. Oracle bones and later historical records both indicate that the Xuzhou area was occupied by the indigenous Dapeng kingdom since the middle Shang dynasty. A powerful polity, Dapeng was eventually destroyed by the Shang under King Di Xin. In turn, Xu's existence is first reliably reported by the Yi Zhou Shu for 1042 BC, only a few decades after Dapeng's fall. It remains unknown if these two polities were related in any way.|$|E
25|$|Once {{thought to}} face {{extinction}} as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of {{aspects of their}} cultures, together with asserting their sovereignty and direction of their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so that education is expressive of their <b>cultures.</b> <b>Since</b> the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, {{as well as to}} promote the education and welfare of their people through health care and construction of improved housing.|$|E

25|$|The {{time when}} the Boian culture {{developed}} into the Gumelniţa culture {{is referred to as}} a transitional period, during which there are commonalities found {{on both sides of the}} chronological divide between the two cultures; as such, Boian Phase IV and Gumelniţa Phase A1 may be considered as a single, uninterrupted, transitional phase. As a result, there are frequent references to this by scholars, who use the term Boian-Gumelniţa culture to describe this specific period. Sometimes, though, this term is mis-used by some to include both the entire Boian culture and Gumelniţa culture periods, not just the transitional period overlapping the two <b>cultures.</b> <b>Since</b> each culture is distinct from the other during its main phases, they should each be considered and named separately, with the exception (as just mentioned) of the transitional phases of their development.|$|E

2500|$|The nuptial crown, {{sometimes}} called a coronal, worn by a bride, {{and sometimes the}} bridegroom, at her wedding is found in many European <b>cultures</b> <b>since</b> ancient times. In the present day, it is most common in Eastern Orthodox cultures. The Eastern Orthodox marriage service has a section called the crowning, wherein {{the bride and groom}} are crowned as [...] "king" [...] and [...] "queen" [...] of their future household. [...] In Greek weddings, the crowns are diadems usually made of white flowers, synthetic or real, often adorned with silver or mother of pearl. [...] They are placed on the heads of the newlyweds and are held together by a ribbon of white silk. [...] They are then kept by the couple as a reminder of their special day. In Slavic weddings, the crowns are usually made of ornate metal, designed to resemble an imperial crown, and are held above the newlyweds heads by their best men. [...] A parish usually owns one set to use for all the couples that are married there since these are much more expensive than Greek-style crowns. This was common in Catholic countries in the past.|$|E
