50|$|Technetium (99mTc) {{arcitumomab}} {{is a drug}} {{used for}} the diagnostic imaging of colorectal cancers, marketed by Immunomedics. It consists of the Fab' fragment of a monoclonal antibody (arcitumomab, trade name <b>CEA-Scan)</b> and a radionuclide, technetium-99m.|$|E
40|$|ObjetivesThe {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} was to evaluate {{whether or not the}} added cost of immunoscintigraphy with <b>CEA-Scan</b> (arcitumomab) to routine anatomic imaging, can reduce the overall cost of patient management in patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: Two hundred ten (210) colorectal cancer patients underwent preoperative CT and immunoscintigraphy. The ability of CT alone and combined with immunoscintigraphy to preoperatively assess the resectability status of each patient was evaluated. Costs included were: total cost of administering and interpreting both imaging studies, total surgical costs, and the costs of false positives and false negatives (with respect to determination of resectability). An outcomes table was constructed to incorporate economic possibilities for each patient sub-group. ResultsImmunoscintigraphy with arcitumomab reduced the overall cost of patient management by approximately $ 5, 000 per patient, primarily due to those patients whom CT incorrectly indicated as resectable. ConclusionThis analysis indicates that the addition of immunoscintigraphy to the preoperative workup of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer decreases the overall cost significantly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), highly {{expressed}} in many cancer types, {{is an important}} target for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Radionuclide-based imaging techniques (gamma camera, single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] and positron emission tomography [PET]) have been extensively explored for CEA-targeted cancer imaging both preclinically and clinically. Briefly, these studies {{can be divided into}} three major categories: antibody-based, antibody fragment-based and pretargeted imaging. Radiolabeled anti-CEA antibodies, reported the earliest among the three categories, typically gave suboptimal tumor contrast due to the prolonged circulation life time of intact antibodies. Subsequently, a number of engineered anti-CEA antibody fragments (e. g. Fab’, scFv, minibody, diabody and scFv-Fc) have been labeled with a variety of radioisotopes for CEA imaging, many of which have entered clinical investigation. <b>CEA-Scan</b> (a 99 m Tc-labeled anti-CEA Fab ’ fragment) has already been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for cancer imaging. Meanwhile, pretargeting strategies have also been developed for CEA imaging which can give much better tumor contrast than the other two methods, if the system is designed properly. In this review article, we will summarize the current state-of-the-art of radionuclide-based cancer imaging targeting CEA. Generally, isotopes with short half-lives (e. g. 18 F and 99 m Tc) are more suitable for labeling small engineered antibody fragments while the isotopes with longer half-lives (e. g. 123 I and 111 In) are needed for antibody labeling to match its relatively long circulation half-life. With further improvement in tumor targeting efficacy and radiolabeling strategies, novel CEA-targeted agents may play a...|$|E
