50|$|During 1995-1998 {{monetary}} policy was highly expansionary. Net domestic credit of the National Bank of Belarus was increasing {{at the rate}} of over 100 percent from 1996 till mid-1998 as a consequence of numerous presidential decrees and resolution of the Council of Ministers instructing NBB to extend credits. Since no external sources were available for covering state budget deficit, the NBB emission activity provided its financing. Also, through authorized banks serving governmental programs, the NBB extended preferential targeted loans to state-owned enterprises. The list of credited enterprises is prepared by the government and sometimes depends on the ad-hoc strategies of development. In 2000, Belarus managed to unify its currency exchange rates, tightened its {{monetary policy}}, and partially liberalized the foreign currency market. Starting from the period of an administrative peg of the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble in 1995, the monetary policy was based on administrative regulation of interest rates. In November 1995, administrative limitations of the inter-bank credit market activity were initiated and still remain in force. In spite of the Central Bank Law passed in 1994 guaranteeing its independence, President Lukashenko has a power to nominate and dismiss the Chairman of the NBB. and to formulate monetary and foreign exchange policy. Over the past years, preferential credits, administrative price setting, and decline of the interests rate spread below 15 percentage points {{in the second quarter of}} 1997 resulted in damaging consequences to enterprises and especially banks. As the process of exhaustion of the Central Bank's hard currency reserves exhibits a dangerous tendency, government introduced restrictions on currency transactions. These have resulted in inconvertibility of the Belarusian ruble for the <b>current</b> <b>transactions</b> since March 1998.|$|E
40|$|The {{matter of}} balance {{adjustment}} generates many interesting reflections. For a long time, the equilibrium {{of the balance}} of payments {{was the focus of}} theoretical debates referring to international economy. At the beginning, it was reduced to the equilibrium of the balance of <b>current</b> <b>transactions.</b> However, the focus still remains on bringing the balance to the state of equilibrium, both in the case of <b>current</b> <b>transactions</b> {{and in the case of}} non-monetary operations. The paper presents the main monetary factors that influence the elements of the balance of payments and the direction and path of such influence. Thus, the results can conclude the impact of the NBR monetary policy over the current account and the capital account of the balance of payments. In the first decade of the transition the monetary policy of the NBR was based especially on some very restrictive monetary tools, such as maintaining for a long time a high discount rate and a high rate of the minimum reserves in lei. Their high level, as compared to that of the other economies in transition, has caused the maintaining o...|$|E

We show that the buy-only strategy(BOS) achieves the highest market capitalization for the <b>current</b> <b>transaction.</b> In addition, simulation results also prove that BOS always yields the fastest growth of market capitalization even when multiple stages are taken into consideration. Simulation results also show that BOS is a better revelation of the traders' personal beliefs, though it exhibits a higher risk in traders' payoffs. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

In the present article, the authors propose to concentrate on the presentation of the facts from 1946 to 1968 in a form which will permit of a searching economic analysis. This approach brings out a better understanding of the transactions between the United States and the rest of the world. This method involves the use of several accounts and sub-accounts as well as the calculation of different types of balances. Three main types of accounts are examined separately: the <b>current</b> <b>transactions</b> account; the capital transactions account; and the account for settlements or offsetting transactions.
