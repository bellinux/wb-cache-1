50|$|Demands for {{specific}} PSC services {{have grown to}} record levels in recent decades, and private firm’s capabilities now include an array of services that are vital {{to the success of}} on-the-ground war fighting as well as other more traditional stability operations and contingency contracting. While past calls for corporate responsibility have heralded successes such as the Kimberley Process and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in widespread international operations, there has also been a move within the PSC and contingency <b>contracting</b> <b>industries</b> to call for accountability and to implement a code of ethics for the retention of services and operations of such service providers. Existing credible accountability initiatives form a skeleton for governing the conduct of contractors, but much remains to be fleshed out to form a coherent and standardized framework from which to oversee such organizations and activities.

40|$|Since the 1920 's {{economists have}} {{wrestled}} {{with the effects of}} external economies on trade liberalization. In this paper I show that under extreme conditions, externalities can reverse the gains from trade found in perfectly competitive trade models. However, the externalities needed to generate this result, even under the worst possible conditions (all expanding industries are subject to negative externalities, all <b>contracting</b> <b>industries</b> have positive externalities) are orders of magnitude larger than those estimated in Krizan (1997). This suggests that the presence of external economies of scale does not provide a credible argument for protectionism. On the other hand, the CGE model showed that external effects can increase the welfare gains from trade liberalization, but the combined effect is still small compared to other policy options. This finding contrasts sharply with many models featuring internal returns to scale that are able to generate large welfare benefits from trade liberalization.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{relates the}} postdisplacement {{experience}} {{of individuals to}} changes in the competitive position of the industry, vis a vis the rest of the world, from which the individual was displaced. The focus is on the duration of unemployment spells and the change in wages accompanying displacement. Controlling for demographic character-istics, we find that workers from declining traded industries suffer greater hardship after displacement than do workers from nontraded or expanding traded industries. They incur both a longer spell of unemployment and a greater loss of earnings. Furthermore, workers separated from expanding traded industries fare better than those from other industries. This evidence regarding the duration of the unemployment spell is then combined with previous results regarding the volume of trade related displacements to provide an accounting of the change in the aggregate number of weeks of unemployment resulting from changing trade patterns. Although the expansion of some traded industries was sufficient to offset the displacement effects of contracting traded industries, the longer spell of unemployment incurred by those displaced from <b>contracting</b> <b>industries</b> is found to result in a significant increase in unemployed resources...|$|E
40|$|Industrialized housing {{has been}} a common {{phenomenon}} in the building industry since the industrial revolution; the casting of iron components enabled Victorian iron casters to prefabricate entire buildings and to export them to all British colonies. It got a second boost from Modernist architects like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius and Konrad Wachsmann; and a third boost in the US when the soldiers {{came back from the}} Second World War in 1945 and wanted to buy a ready-made house. In the later decades of the 20 th century composite prototypes were built. Timber frame houses are extremely popular in low density areas worldwide. For densely populated areas housing is now firmly attached to reinforced concrete. The <b>contracting</b> <b>industries</b> have developed efficient building methods for the concrete structures on which separate systems of claddings are fixed to form a house. However, in the coming decades, designers, builders and scientists also have to keep the environment in mind, working with a minimal amount of materials, and for minimizing embodied energy and energy use. In the coming age minimal embodied energy and low ecological footprints are renewed values that will be added to energy-positive housing and that will have an influence on the building technology of the future. This will lead to a reformation of the building vocabulary. Other materials will have to be chosen and developed to function in building elements and components.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an investigation into}} the differences in the postdisplacement labor market experiences of workers separated from declining traded, expanding traded and nontraded industries. The results presented provide the beginnings of a bridge across the gap between what is known and what is perceived regarding the allocative efficiency effects of trade-related labor displacements. The strategy of the paper is to relate the postdisplacement experience of individuals to changes in the competitive position of the industry from which the individual was displaced. The investigative lens is primarily focused on the impact of changing industry competitiveness on the duration of unemployment spells and the change in wages accompanying displacement. The findings are that workers from traded industries in general suffer greater hardhip after displacement than do nontraded workers. They incur both a longer spell of unemployment and a greater loss of earnings. Within traded industries, workers separated from declining traded industries fare much worse than those from expanding traded industries. This evidnece regarding the duration of the unemployment spell is then combined with previous results regarding trade related displacements to provide an accounting of the change in the aggregatenumber of weeks of unemployment resulting from changing trade patterns. The finding is that although expansion of traded industries was sufficient to offset the displacement effects of contracting traded industries, the longer spell of unemployment by those from <b>contracting</b> <b>industries</b> results in a significant increase unemployed resources...|$|E
40|$|Fly-in/fly-out (FIFO) {{practices}} in the mining and <b>contracting</b> <b>industries</b> are currently prominent and expanding throughout Western Australia. There is a strong need for effective social support systems for families during the worker 2 ̆ 7 s deployment due to {{long periods of time}} apart, reappraisal of family roles and social isolation. This study used a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to explore the lived experiences of parents whose partners are employed on a fly-in/fly-out basis and their views of social support systems in addressing the issues of loneliness and isolation. Family resilience was also utilised to investigate how female home-based partners deal with the stress involved with the FIFO lifestyle. Triangulation was used to build interpretive rigour and to access two relevant samples in order to reach the widest audience range. Twelve online interviews were conducted from the research forum of a pregnancy and parenting 2 ̆ 7 website. Twelve participants took part in semi-structured face-to-face interviews which were audio-recorded and transcribed. Following analysis of the data using thematic content analysis as described by Braun and Clarke (2006), four major themes were identified. These were; emotional support, instrumental support, social interactions and family resilience through positive reappraisal. The online sample reported more enduring experiences of loneliness and social isolation and was more likely to have younger children, less experience with the FIFO lifestyle and less time in their current partner relationship. Thus, supporting current literature that has identified family life stage and experience with partner absence as modifying factors in family stress and coping (Gallegos, 2006; Taylor 2 ̆ 6 Simmonds, 2009). Support needs were found to be related to both the issues of critical timing as found by Gallegos (2006), and to the high levels of parental responsibility, demands and time restraints experienced during their partner 2 ̆ 7 s absence. Emotional support was provided primarily by partners, while the participant 2 ̆ 7 s parents were their main source of instrumental support. Many participants reported strong, supportive social networks and an ability to elicit support if required. However, further research is needed on families new to the FIFO lifestyle and those in early family life stages. In addition, longitudinal studies are required to examine the longer term impact of this lifestyle on families...|$|E
