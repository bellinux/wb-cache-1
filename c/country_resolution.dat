40|$|This article {{examines}} {{some of the}} significant institutional and legal developments in the African human rights system between July 2004 and December 2006. 1 During this period, measured progress {{was made by the}} African Union on the establishment of an African Court of Human and Peoples' Rights ('African Court'). The thematic procedures of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights ('Commission') were engaged more extensively than before, culminating in the adoption by the Commission of <b>country</b> <b>resolutions</b> on the situation of human rights in Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe. These <b>country</b> <b>resolutions</b> generated, for the first time, direct confrontation between the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union ('Assembly') and the Commission at a Summit of the Assembly held in Khartoum in January 2006. As a result, the Commission's 19 th Annual Activity Report that had contained these resolutions was embargoed by the Assembly. These resolutions were released later in the 20 th Annual Activity Report after Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe had formally responded to the Commission. During the period under review, the Commission also sought to enhance its capacity by reviewing its status, mandate and independence in the framework of the African Union and developed the practice of exposing the imperfect record of periodic reporting by States Parties to the African Charter on Human and the Peoples' Rights 1981 ('African Charter'). 2 The growing number of individual complaints on the docket of the Commission was also apparent, and three of the Commission's most important decisions made in the period under review are discussed subsequently...|$|R

Finally, the Council decided to meet again on 7 January 1980, to review the situation, and if needed, take any further action.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} said that Resolution 688 (1991) {{established}} a "right to interfere" for humanitarian reasons. This right - reference was even made to a "duty of humanitarian interference" - would allow third-party states to take the initiative of committing acts of humanitarian intervention on behalf of minorities subjected to ill treatment by the authorities of their <b>country.</b> <b>Resolution</b> 688 (1991), however, does not establish this right. Although the Security Council recognized itself as being competent to intervene, it did so because it had succeeded in identifying a threat to peace. Furthermore, although the United States, France, and Great Britain intervened, they were able to do so because they had breathed new life into humanitarian-motivated intervention by giving it the form of a sanction-intervention...|$|E

5000|$|The {{objections}} of the Nonconformists {{were not only}} on principle. The Church of England received financial support from Parliament, while their own congregations were totally dependent on voluntary contributions. They {{did not want to}} have to support another parish as well as their own. Enforcement of the rate was not uniform across the <b>country.</b> <b>Resolutions</b> were passed protesting against the rate, and societies to abolish the church rate were formed all over the country. In 1836 at a public meeting in London, a central committee, the Church Rate Abolition Society was formed to co-ordinate the efforts of local Societies. [...] In 1837, Parliament made two concessions to the Nonconformists, a more acceptable marriage ceremony, and the civil registration of births, deaths and marriages. But the parish rate remained compulsory until 1868. The Whig leader in the House of Commons, Lord John Russell, supported the rate. But in 1856 The Times called the government's attention to what the editor believed was a civil war raging throughout the country on the church rate question.|$|R

This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.|$|R
