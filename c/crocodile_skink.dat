5000|$|Tribolonotus {{gracilis}} de Rooij, 1909 [...] - [...] red-eyed bush <b>crocodile</b> <b>skink</b> ...|$|E
50|$|They are {{commonly}} known as red-eyed <b>crocodile</b> <b>skinks,</b> or, rarely, red-eyed bush <b>crocodile</b> <b>skinks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tribolonotus is a genus of lizards, {{commonly}} known as <b>crocodile</b> <b>skinks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Red-eyed <b>crocodile</b> <b>skinks</b> {{are popular}} in the pet trade but are still {{considered}} exotic pets. For captivity they require a large terrarium that can withstand high humidity that the species requires. For nutrient most red-eyed <b>crocodile</b> <b>skinks</b> eat a variety of insects such as fruit flies, mealworms, and small crickets. Like most species of reptiles in captivity, most reptiles need a calcium supplement with their regular food.|$|R
50|$|Hosts of {{this species}} include the <b>crocodile</b> <b>skink</b> (Tribolonotus species) and Leiolopisma fuscum.|$|E
50|$|The social {{bond and}} parental {{attention}} of reptiles appears equal in circulus containing egg-laying reptiles {{compared to those}} with live bearing reptiles. Another case of egg-laying lizards with a circulus is the <b>Crocodile</b> <b>skink</b> (Tribolonotus gracilis). The female will sit on the egg and guard the young. As {{in the case of}} Corucia, the young tend to stay close to the parents, especially, the mother who guards the neonate. The young skink will often climb on the abaxial area of the female or male for protection and security, just {{as in the case of}} the Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata).|$|E
50|$|The park's reptile {{house is}} named after the famous herpetologist Mark O'Shea. He also makes {{appearances}} at the park, occasionally performing in the reptile encounters that take place outside the building, where guests {{can learn more about}} some of the park's reptiles. Reptiles in this exhibit include alligator snapping turtle, American alligator, amethystine python, beaded lizard, black rat snake, Borneo short-tailed python, Cuban crocodile, Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, Egyptian cobra, frill-necked lizard, green anaconda, green and black poison dart frog, green tree python, Jamaican boa, king cobra, malagasy giant hognose snake, Nile crocodile, red-eyed <b>crocodile</b> <b>skink,</b> red-eyed treefrog, red-tailed green ratsnake, reticulated python, saharan horned viper, and western diamondback rattlesnake.|$|E
5000|$|Red-eyed <b>crocodile</b> <b>skinks</b> can be sexed {{using the}} pores on their front feet, as only males have these [...] "pores". Females {{have only a}} single working ovary (right ovary), laying one egg at a time. The female often curls around the egg. They show tendencies for mother-child family groups. Male <b>crocodile</b> <b>skinks</b> will battle other males for females and females can be {{territorial}} as well.|$|R
50|$|It is the namesake genus of the Egernia genus-group, {{which also}} {{includes}} the Solomon Islands skink (Corucia), Cyclodomorphus and the blue-tongued skinks (Tiliqua). In some older works, it is considered closely related to Mabuya, but even among the subfamily Lygosominae this genus {{does not seem to}} be particularly closely related and would—were the genus-groups treated at the rarely used rank of infrafamily—certainly constitute an infrafamily of its own. On the other hand, the enigmatic <b>crocodile</b> <b>skinks</b> (Tribolonotus) might be a very basal member of the Egernia genus-group.|$|R
50|$|The Saint Bathans {{formation}} also bears {{fossils of}} moa, mekosuchine <b>crocodiles,</b> turtles, <b>skinks,</b> tuataras, geckoes, {{at least eight}} taxa of waterfowl, a petrel, Accipitriformes, rails, a possible seagull, herons, a palaelodid flamingo, pigeons, parrots, a swift, an owlet-nightjar, passerines, the enigmatic Aptornis and a primitive kiwi, Proapteryx.|$|R
50|$|Reptiles at the Park include American alligators, <b>crocodiles,</b> turtles, tortoises, <b>skinks,</b> Komodo dragons, monitor lizards, geckos, iguanas, pythons, taipans, brown snakes, death adders, and a King cobra.|$|R
