Various laboratory methods, typically categorised as steady-state, unsteady-state and centrifuge are used to measure relative permeability and may lead to different results. In recent years 1 D MRI and NMR T 2 and T 1 profiling have been applied for the characterisation of rock cores. It {{has been shown that}} the spatially-resolved NMR in conjunction with centrifuge technique may provide high-quality capillary pressure curves. Combining Burdine and Brooks-Corey models enables estimation of relative permeability from capillary pressure curves. This approach assumes a strong relationship between capillary pressure and relative permeability known to be complex. Here we compare a generalised approach of Green, which relies on saturation profiles set by various <b>capillary</b> <b>drainage</b> techniques, to a NMR relaxation approach. Comparisons are performed experimentally and numerically using three sandstone rocks to test the influence of rock morphology. The numerical part includes simulation of a centrifuge <b>capillary</b> <b>drainage</b> by applying morphological drainage transforms on high resolution 3 D tomograms. T 1 responses along the sample are simulated using a random walk technique. The NMR relaxation based approach is then compared to LBM simulated relative permeability and to experiment.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{comparisons between}} <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure curves computed directly from 3 D micro-tomographic images (micro-CT) and laboratory measurements {{conducted on the}} same core samples. It is now possible to calculate {{a wide range of}} petrophysical and transport properties directly from micro-CT images or from equivalent network models extracted from these images. Capillary pressure is sensitive to rock microstructure and the comparisons presented are the first direct validation of image based computations. The measured data include centrifuge and mercury injection <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure for fired Berea, Bentheimer and Obernkirchner sandstones and unfired Mount Gambier carbonate. The measurements cover a wide range of porosities and permeabilities. The measurements were made on core samples with different diameters (2. 5 cm, 1. 5 cm, 1 cm and 0. 5 cm) to assess the effect of up-scaling on capillary pressure measurements. The smallest diameter samples were also used to obtain the 3 D micro-CT images. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental measurements and direct computations on 3 D micro-CT images...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} for petrophysical properties {{are very important}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry. For two-phase flow in porous media, experimental techniques for determining these properties can be difficult to set up and can take a very long time. Generalization of these experimental results for the whole reservoir requires adapting boundary and environmental conditions which may require a large num- ber of experimental set-ups, hence emphasizing the need for numerical methods. Several numerical techniques like pore network models have been used in the past to estimate and quantify transport properties like relative permeability in reservoir rocks. These network models are however mostly restricted to quasi-static condi- tions and have many free parameters; thus are not easily predictive. An alternative is to carry out simulations directly on imaged samples of rock micro-structure using lattice Boltzmann techniques which are far more able to handle complex geometrical boundaries than classical computational fluid dynamics techniques. In this thesis, we examine the effect of four initialization techniques namely; the Euclidean Distance Transform, Covering Radius Transform, <b>Capillary</b> <b>Drainage</b> Transform, and Uniform Random distribution on the final fluid distribution in a porous media. These techniques were applied to a reconstructed sample of Fontainebleau sandstone. The convergence of the initial saturations to steady state is quantified by the Minkowski functionals and the <b>capillary</b> <b>drainage</b> transform is shown to be the most stable of the four initialization techniques. Three lattice Boltzmann (Shan-Chen, the Color Gradient, and the Free Energy) approaches are also introduced for two phase simulation in a 2 D geometry. The methods are vali- dated against standard test cases in 2 D. The Shan-Chen solver was then applied to a reconstructed sample of Fontainebleau sandstone for the different initial conditions. Furthermore, the initial conditions are compared with regard to discretisation ef- fects and with regard to speed of convergence. For the simple case of 2 D simulations we also apply a body force to the two phase simulation. In three dimensions, we use a two relaxation time (scheme which is known for its better accuracy and stability) Shan and Chen lattice Boltzmann approach to simulate fluid redistribution for the different initial conditions studied in the thesis...|$|E
40|$|The circulatory {{pattern in}} the gastric mucosa of the rat and {{relationships}} of mucosal capillaries to gastric gland cells were investigated. Techniques used included the vascular corrosion cast/scanning electron microscope method, scanning electron microscopy of acid-digested tissues, conventional transmission electron microscopy and in vivo light microscopy. Arterial break-up into capillaries invariably occurs {{around the base of}} the gastric glands. The mucosal capillaries are fenestrated and vesiculated, and pass in close proximity to the abluminal aspects of the cells of the gastric glands, particularly the parietal cells. At the apices of the glands, the capillaries form a honeycomb network closely applied to the abluminal aspect of the surface epithelial cells, before draining into infrequent venules which are embedded in a substantial connective tissue sheath. No <b>capillary</b> <b>drainage</b> occurs into these venules deeper in the mucosa. No evidence of either mucosal or submucosal arteriovenous anastomoses was found. Because of the close proximity of the fenestrated mucosal capillaries to the parietal cells and surface epithelial cells and the direction of capillary blood flow, the alkaline tide of the actively secreting parietal cell must be transferred to the abluminal aspect of the surface epithelial cells. The capacity of these cells to secrete HCO 3 - or to neutralize back diffusing H+ ions would thereby be increased...|$|E

Lymphatic drainage function is critically coupled to the fluid mechanical properties of the interstitium, yet this coupling is poorly understood. Here we sought to effectively model the lymphatic-{{interstitial fluid}} coupling and ask why the lymphatic capillary network often appears with roughly a hexagonal architecture. We use homogenization method, which allows tissue-scale lymph flow to be integrated with the microstructural details of the lymphatic capillaries, thus gaining insight into the functionality of lymphatic anatomy. We first describe flow in lymphatic capillaries using the Navier–Stokes equations and flow through the interstitium using Darcy's law. We then use multiscale homogenization to derive macroscale equations describing lymphatic drainage, with the mouse tail skin as a basis. We find that the limiting resistance for fluid drainage is that from the interstitium into the capillaries rather than within the capillaries. We also find that between hexagonal, square, and parallel tube configurations of lymphatic capillary networks, the hexagonal structure is the most efficient architecture for coupled interstitial and capillary fluid transport; that is, it clears the most interstitial fluid for a given network density and baseline interstitial fluid pressure. Thus, using homogenization theory, one can assess how vessel microstructure influences the macroscale fluid drainage by the lymphatics and demonstrate why the hexagonal network of dermal lymphatic capillaries is optimal for interstitial tissue fluid clearance...|$|E

30|$|Leverett J-function (Leverett 1941) {{is widely}} used as drainage-type {{capillary}} pressure model, but it is restricted to water-wet reservoirs and may generate erroneous results to describe mix-wet reservoirs (Masalmeh 2002). Thomeer (1960) introduced a pore geometrical factor in his model to comprise the heterogeneity properties of the porous medium. Clerke and Martin (2004) determined the water saturation in transition zones of carbonate reservoirs {{on the basis of}} Thomeer model. However, Thomeer method is not suitable for mixed-wet porous system and cannot match well with experimental results. Most of the models for capillary pressure correlation have been developed with two adjustable parameters. One parameter indicates the pore size distribution considering the curvature of capillary pressure curve, and other one specifies the mean of entry capillary pressure, i.e., the actual level of the capillary pressure. Brooks and Corey (1966) proposed a capillary pressure correlation method comprising two fitting parameters to represent the pore size distribution and entry capillary pressure, but this model is limited to water-wet reservoirs. The previously developed models are restricted to first drainage and spontaneous imbibition capillary pressure. Huang et al.

40|$|The {{experimental}} determination of capillary pressure drainage curves at the pore scale is of vital {{importance for the}} mapping of reservoir fluid distribution. To fully characterize <b>capillary</b> <b>drainage</b> in a complex pore space, we design a differential imaging-based porous plate (DIPP) method using X-ray micro- tomography. For an exemplar mm-scale laminated sandstone microcore with a porous plate, we quantify the displacement from resolvable macropores and subresolution micropores. Nitrogen (N 2) was injected as the nonwetting phase at a constant pressure while the porous plate prevented its escape. The measured porosity and capillary pressure at the imaged saturations agree well with helium measurements and experi- ments on larger core samples, while providing a pore-scale explanation of the fluid distribution. We observed {{that the majority of}} the brine was displaced by N 2 in macropores at low capillary pressures, fol- lowed by a further brine displacement in micropores when capillary pressure increases. Furthermore, we were able to discern that brine predominantly remained within the subresolution micropores, such as regions of fine lamination. The capillary pressure curve for pressures ranging from 0 to 1151 kPa is provided from the image analysis compares well with the conventional porous plate method for a cm-scale core but was conducted over a period of 10 days rather than up to few months with the conventional porous plate method.

40|$|Pore Network Modelling (PNM) is a {{well-established}} micro-scale numerical method for {{the prediction of}} permeability in reservoir rocks. We study the capabilities of this method for coal as a heterogeneous unconventional rock. The fracture structure of coal known as cleats is captured using high resolution micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) images at the core-scale. A network model is extracted to idealise the fractured geometry and its interconnectivity. This three-dimensional arrangement of pore nodes and throats replaces the entire complex geometry of coal. Flow simulation is then performed on the extracted network model. The absolute permeability is compared with direct computations on micro-CT images by the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Obtained relative permeability is also compared against <b>Capillary</b> <b>Drainage</b> Transform (CDT) and microfluidic framework as direct simulation and experimental methods, respectively. Comparison of PNM with LBM, CDT and microfluidic results shows applicability of PNM as a predictive method for permeability in anisotropic geometries such as coal. However, the accuracy of calculations {{is tied to the}} connectivity of the fractures in the flooding direction. The effects of flow direction, wettability and pore network geometrical statistics such as coordination number, pore size distribution and shape factor on absolute and relative permeabilities are investigated. Then, a numerical simulation model is developed using a commercial reservoir simulator to estimate the average relative permeability at the core-scale. The effect of different wettability conditions on gas production from coal is investigated by moving the cross point in the obtained gas-water relative permeability. Our results quantified the effects of aperture size, wettability and porosity of coal on its permeability. However, to improve the accuracy of the results, it is recommended to combine PNM with stochastic methods to simulate flow on more representative samples in terms of size. In addition, effect of micropores is ignored in this work. Dual networks are recommended to be developed to take them into account...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a numerical and experimental investigation of resistivity index (RI) at low water saturations. A novel analysis of micro-CT images of small rock samples {{is combined with}} laboratory measurements to examine the predictive value of imagebased computations of RI. Experimentally measured porosity, formation factor, capillary pressure (Pc) and RI are compared with image-based computations using the same rock sample for both imaging and laboratory measurements. The fluid systems used are 2 wt% NaCl brine and air. The porous plate and centrifuge methods are used to measure Pc and RI at ambient conditions. Two carbonate samples from the Middle East and two outcrop sandstone samples (Fontainebleau and Bentheimer) are investigated. Three of the samples are homogeneous {{and one of the}} carbonate samples is heterogeneous. The effects of injection boundaries on image based computations of single and multiphase flow properties of the rock samples are investigated numerically. The RI of Fontainebleau and Bentheimer sandstone is studied at water saturations as low as 10 %. The laboratory measurements show {{that it is possible to}} conduct reasonable tests on the small rock samples which are used for image analysis. For homogeneous rocks these measurements compare well with measurements made using conventional size cores and the measurements are in reasonable agreement with image-based computations. Simulations are in good agreement with experimental measurements of <b>capillary</b> <b>drainage</b> RI using the porous plate method at water saturations as low as 10 %. However, this agreement is a result of careful treatment of discretisation effects. Fontainebleau sandstone exhibits a percolating network of grain contacts, while the high-porosity Bentheimer sandstone does not. It is shown that this difference in the topological connection of conductive films at low water saturations is responsible for the non- Archie behaviour of Fontainebleau sandstone. It is shown that grain contact conductivity needs to be attributed to the grain contacts in Fontainebleau sandstone in order to reconcile experiments and computations. Conductive films organised as pendular rings around grain contacts are shown to be insufficient to explain this result...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental investigation of two-phase flow properties of porous rock samples having different scales ranging from micro-CT imaging to conventional core plug scales. Advances in micro-CT imaging of porous materials provide {{the opportunity to}} extract representative networks from the images. This improves the predictive capability of porescale network models to predict multiphase flow properties. However, all these predictions need to be validated with laboratory data. Micro-CT imaging is currently limited to small sample sizes, having bulk volumes {{of the order of}} 0. 1 cm³. Conventional core plugs, however, have sizes several orders of magnitude larger than that (bulk volumes of 10 cm³ or larger). The aim of this thesis is to investigate the scale effect on laboratory data and to provide reliable experimental data which can be used to test the predictive value of microCT based network models. Berea and Bentheim sandstones and Mount Gambier carbonate were used in the experiments. The core samples were thoroughly cleaned in order to obtain strongly, uniform water-wet conditions. Simple well-characterized fluid systems were chosen in the experiments: Air-brine fluid-system for <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure, resistivity index and spontaneous imbibition experiments while oil-brine fluid-system for wettability and relative permeability measurements. <b>Drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure, resistivity index, relative permeability and spontaneous imbibition measurements were made on the cores having bulk volumes ranging from 0. 1 to 12 cm³. Previous studies have shown that experiments at this scale are still lacking. The wettability was tried to keep strongly water-wet for all experiments. The experimental results show that the measurements of <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure, and resistivity index and spontaneous imbibition on small core samples, having similar scales as micro-CT imaging can be made accurately in the laboratory. The measurement of relative permeability remains challenging. This thesis concludes that commonly used homogeneous rock types (Berea and Bentheim sandstones and Mt. Gambier carbonate) can be considered to be sufficiently homogeneous from the pore to core scale based on the two-phase flow properties examined in this study. Hence, laboratory data taken from these rocks using conventional core plugs can be used to calibrate micro-CT based network models for multiphase flow properties...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades there have been several {{attempts}} to compute relative permeability from high resolution, three-dimensional, X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) images of the microstructure of a natural porous rock. In these attempts, researchers simulated fluid flow directly on the imaged 3 D pore space to compute relative permeabilities. They then used laboratory measurements to validate the predictions. Analysis of these works shows a number of shortcomings in those validations. For example: (i) there has been very limited direct comparison between the imaged rock and the rock used in the laboratory tests, i. e. researchers preferred to use the literature data for validation mostly, (iii) there has been image resolution issues that limited prediction accuracy, (iv) there has been limited attempt to use high resolution images of multiple fluids in place and (v) the Lattice-Boltzmann method has instability issues to predict relative permeability at low phase saturations. The purpose of this thesis is to test the predictive value of image-based numerical computations for two-phase, drainage relative permeability using well-defined laboratory measurements. The experimental data represents a steady-state flow of oil and water in strongly water-wet, homogeneous outcrop sandstone (Bentheimer) and covers a full saturation range of both phases. This data is obtained using a standard core sample. Next, a small sister plug is imaged by micro-CT and the steady-state experiments are repeated on this plug for three different saturation distributions. These three saturation distributions are imaged and compared with simulated fluid distributions on the dry image (using the <b>capillary</b> <b>drainage</b> transform CDT method). The comparison shows that CDT-based saturation distributions agree with the actual imaged saturation distributions. Finally, relative permeability computations are made over the CDT-based saturation distributions. The issues experienced in the previous studies such as the image resolution and computational capacity are minimized in this study through using an image of higher resolution and a larger subset. The thesis demonstrates a good agreement between the image-based computations made using the CDT method and the laboratory data. The requirements for a successful prediction using the CDT method are strong wetting conditions and capillary-dominated flow. In order to ensure these conditions, the laboratory tests described in this study employ the plasma technique for cleaning the core plug and use appropriate flow rates for controlling the capillary number. The agreement also confirms that steady-state experimental data is representative for testing image-based predictions. In this thesis, an attempt is made to use high-resolution micro-CT images of multiphase distributions in relative permeability computations. It is found that relative permeabilities are underestimated. This is attributed to snap-off that occurs when the steady-state experiment is stopped for micro-CT imaging and causes the non-wetting phase to be disconnected. As a result, the thesis recommends that both steady-state tests and micro-CT images should be carried out at dynamic conditions for an accurate validation of image-based methods...|$|E
40|$|Increasing energy {{consumption}} and continuous depletion of hydrocarbon reservoirs {{will result in}} a conventional oil production peak in the near future. Thus, the gap between the global conventional oil supplies and the required amount of fossil fuel energy will grow. Extensive attempts were made during the last three decades to fill this gap, especially using innovative emerging heavy oil and bitumen production technologies. Most of these recovery methods have been developed in Canada, considering the fact that Canada and Venezuela have the largest deposits of heavy oil and bitumen throughout the world. The horizontal well drilling technology opened a new horizon for the recovery of heavy oil and bitumen. Most of the in-situ recovery techniques, including Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) recovery method, take advantage of horizontal injection and production wells. The vacated pores in the reservoir are filled mainly either with steam or with a mixture of steam and solvent vapour {{in the case of the}} SAGD and Solvent Aided SAGD (SA-SAGD) recovery methods, respectively. The use of long horizontal wells combined with the reduced viscosity of the produced oil allows economic production with limited amount of bypassed residual oil in the invaded region. The macro-scale success of the SAGD recovery technique is greatly affected by its pore-scale performance. It is beneficial to understand the pore-level physics of the SAGD process in order to develop mathematical models for simulating field-scale performance. Available commercial reservoir simulators cannot describe pore-level mechanisms of the SAGD process including mechanisms related to the fluid-flow as well as heat-transfer aspects of the process. A systematic series of flow visualization experiments of the SAGD process using glass-etched micromodels was developed to capture the pore-level physics of the process using qualitative analysis. With the aid of image processing techniques, the pore-scale performance of the SAGD process was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated. The main objective of Chapter 2 of this thesis is to address the relevant pore-scale mechanisms responsible for the in-situ oil mobilization and drainage in a conventional SAGD process. Transport processes, occurred in a conventional SAGD process at the pore-level including fluid flow and heat transfer aspects, were mechanistically investigated and documented. The qualitative analysis of the results revealed that near a well-established oil-steam interface, gravity drainage takes place through a thick layer of pores, composed of about 1 - 6 pores in thickness, within the mobilized region. The drainage of the mobile oil takes place due to the interplay between gravity and capillarity forces near this mobilized region. In-situ mobilization of bitumen was found to be as a result of both conductive and convective elements of the local heat transfer process. Moreover, the phenomenon of water-in-oil emulsification at the interface was also demonstrated which is due to the local steam condensation and spreading characteristics of water droplets over the oil phase in the presence of a gas phase. Other pore-scale aspects of the process such as drainage displacement as well as film-flow drainage mechanisms of the mobile oil, localized entrapment of steam bubbles as well as condensate droplets within the mobile oil continuum due to capillarity phenomenon, sharp temperature gradient along the mobilized region, co-current and counter-current flow regimes at the chamber walls, condensate spontaneous imbibition followed by mobile oil drainage, and snap-off of liquid films are also illustrated using these pore-level studies. The second objective of Chapter 2 is to quantitatively analyze the production performance of the SAGD process based on the micro-scale measurements. Our pore-scale experiments revealed that the rate of pore-scale SAGD interface advancement depends directly on the pore-scale characteristics of the employed models and the pertaining operating conditions. The average sweep rate data were correlated using an analytical model proposed by Butler (1979, 1981, 1991) and a pore-scale performance parameter was defined for the SAGD process. The measured horizontal sweep rates of the SAGD process at the pore-scale are in good agreement with the theory predictions provided by the performance parameter. In addition, the effect of different system variables on the ultimate recovery factor of the SAGD experiments were investigated and it was found that higher permeability values and lower in-situ oil viscosities lead to higher ultimate recovery factor values for a particular SAGD trial. Moreover, the Cumulative Steam to Oil Ratio (CSOR) data were scaled and a reasonably good fit for the experimental data was achieved by defining a scaling parameter. Although the SAGD process offers several inherent advantages including high ultimate recovery, stable oil production rates, reasonable energy efficiency, and high stable sweep efficiency, there are some drawbacks associated with the SAGD process such as high {{energy consumption}}, high levels of CO 2 emission, and usage of large quantities of fresh water which make this process uneconomical in reservoirs with thin net pay, low matrix porosity and thermal conductivity, and low initial pressure. The most promising route for improving the SAGD performance appears to be the co-injection of a light hydrocarbon solvent with steam in the context of the Solvent Aided SAGD (SA-SAGD) process. The pore-level aspects of the SA-SAGD process are not yet understood to the extent of incorporating the pore-scale physics into mathematical models. The main objective of Chapter 3 of my thesis is to mechanistically investigate the SA-SAGD process at the pore-level to enlighten the unrecognized pore-scale physics of the process. A methodical set of pore-scale SA-SAGD experiments were designed and carried out with the aid of glass micromodels. The methodology used in this set of the SA-SAGD trials was similar to that of the pore-scale SAGD experiments described in Chapter 2. Normal Pentane and Normal Hexane were used as the steam additives. The pore-level events were recorded on a real-time basis and then analyzed using the image processing techniques. According to the qualitative results, it was obtained that all the condensate and gaseous phases flow simultaneously in the mobilized region composed of about 1 - 4 pores in thickness. Heat transfer mechanisms at the pore-scale include conduction as well as convection. The mechanisms responsible for the mass transfer at the pore-level include molecular diffusion as well as convection. The mobile oil drains as a result of two active mechanisms of film flow as well as direct <b>capillary</b> <b>drainage</b> displacements at the pore-scale. Due to the near miscible nature of the displacement process, the residual oil left behind in the invaded portion of the micromodels was negligible and asphaltene precipitation and plugging was found to be a temporary phenomenon. The second objective of Chapter 3 is to quantify the pore-scale production performance of the SA-SAGD process using the flow visualization experiments. The horizontal SA-SAGD interface advancement velocity was chosen to be the indicator of the pore-scale performance of the process. It was found that addition of n-C 6 as the steam additive was more effective than n-C 5 in terms of enhanced pore-scale interface advancement as well as achieving higher ultimate recovery factor when all the other experimental variables are unchanged. The higher the solvent concentration in the injection mainstream is, the higher would be the pore-scale sweep rate as well as the ultimate recovery factor of the process. When oil type with lower in-situ viscosity was used, higher sweep rates as well as higher ultimate recovery factors values were achieved compared to the trials in which the more viscous bitumen was employed as the oil type. In addition, a scaling parameter composed of porous media properties was found by which the pore-scale interface advancement velocity and the ultimate recovery factor of the SA-SAGD trials were scaled when all other experimental variables remain unchanged. In Chapter 4 of this thesis, the production performance of the SAGD and SA-SAGD processes were demonstrated and compared at the macro-scale under controlled environmental conditions. A 2 D physical model was designed and fabricated and Athabasca bitumen was used as the oil type. According to the experimental results, it was obtained that the average mobile oil as well as dead oil production rates are reasonably constant over the course of the SAGD and SA-SAGD trials. As far as the SAGD experiments are concerned, there is a linear correlation between the mobile oil production rates and the square root of the porous media permeability when all the other experimental variables remain unchanged. In addition, the Steam to Oil Ratio (SOR) values of the SAGD trials correlate reasonably well with the inverse of the square root of permeability when all the other experimental variables are fixed. By introducing the solvent additive to the injection mainstream of the SAGD process, it was found that enhancements of about 18 % and 17 % were observed in the mobile oil and dead oil production rates of the SAGD process respectively. In addition, the SOR values of the SA-SAGD process was reduced by about 35 % compared to that of the SAGD process. Finally, an advanced photomicrography unit with an integrated image processing software was used in order to investigate size of the enclosed water condensate droplets in the continuum of the mobile oil produced during the course of the SAGD and SA-SAGD experiments. The captured microscopic snapshots were analyzed using the image processing techniques and some representative average values of the water condensate droplet sizes were reported for the corresponding SAGD and SA-SAGD trials...|$|E

Along these lines, Parker and Lenhard (1987) developed a model that includes effects of gas entrapment during imbibition. Their model defines limiting maximum <b>capillary</b> heads for <b>drainage</b> and minimum <b>capillary</b> heads for imbibition.

For such cases, a modification has been made for better representation and to use Brooks and Corey correlation for capillary pressure estimation under such cases. This modification in addition to better representation of effective saturation correlation, will result into analyzing and estimating capillary pressure also for the respective scenario, when incorporated into Brooks and Corey Correlation, which will result into better reservoir monitoring and surveillance...|$|R

These {{are related to}} the surface hydrology (like rainfall, evaporation, irrigation, use of drain and well water for irrigation, runoff), and the aquifer hydrology (like upward seepage, natural drainage, pumping from wells). The other water balance components (like downward percolation, upward <b>capillary</b> rise, subsurface <b>drainage)</b> are given as output.The quantity of drainage water, as an output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data), a drainage reduction factor (to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system), and the height of the water table, resulting from the computed water balance. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options.|$|R
30|$|To avoid {{unreliable}} {{results obtained}} from the simulation of LSW flooding, the relative permeability and capillary pressure curves under high- and low-salinity condition were extracted from a recent research conducted by Omekeh et al. (2013). These high- and low-salinity relative permeability functions which {{were used for the}} general model are shown in Fig.  1 a. This figure indicates oil wetness behavior at the initial state of the reservoir and more water wetness after low-salinity water flooding, based on Craig’s rule (1971). As it can be seen in Fig.  1 b, LSW imbibition capillary pressure curve is situated above HSW curve which proves that the spontaneous imbibition in LSW condition is more dominant in comparison to HSW condition. By assumption of water flood injection at irreducible water saturation in this study, the imbibition capillary pressure curve must be applied rather than <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure. Note that the same two-phase relative permeability curves under high-salinity condition are used for base case simulation.|$|R
40|$|Interfacial {{properties}} play a {{major role}} in governing where and how dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) move in the subsurface. Interfacial tension and contact angle measurements were obtained for a simple, single component DNAPL (tetrachloroethene, PCE), complex laboratory DNAPLs (PCE plus Sudan IV dye), and a field DNAPL from the Savannah River Site (SRS) M-Area DNAPL (PCE, trichloroethene [TCE], and maching oils). Interfacial properties for complex DNAPLs were time-dependent, a phenomenon not observed for PCE alone. <b>Drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure-saturation curves are strongly influenced by interfacial properties. Therefore time-dependence will alter the nature of DNAPL migration and penetration. Results indicate that the time-dependence of PCE with relatively high Sudan IV dye concentrations is comparable to that of the field DNAPL. Previous DNAPL mobility experiments in which the DNAPL was dyed should be reviewed to determine whether time-dependent properties influenced the resutls. Dyes appear to make DNAPL more complex, and therefore a more realistic analog for field DNAPLs than single component DNAPLs...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} results of using of a new {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) based method for acquiring primary drainage, imbibition and secondary <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure curves for oil/water systems. The technique uses a centrifuge to create a distribution of fluid and capillary pressures in a standard rock core plug and then uses a new quantitative MRI method to measure the saturation in the rock. This allows for many (approximately forty) capillary pressure/saturation points to be acquired for each centrifuge speed, dramatically decreasing measurement time. Also, the technique {{does not require the}} measurement of the expelled fluid as the fluid is directly measured in the rock using MRI. This allows for the oil/water contact to be placed half way up the rock enabling the measurement of both the positive and negative portions of the imbibition and secondary drainage curves. This work also presents information on how to integrate traditional T 2 cut-off measurements into MRI-based air/water capillary pressure measurements...|$|R
30|$|Laboratory-based nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) measurements from cores {{and the distribution of}} transversal T 2 relaxations are usually employed for modelling petrophysical properties of reservoir rocks, due to their sensitivity to pore-size distribution, which invariably controls capillary pressures and permeabilities. Several methods have been proposed to derive synthetic <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressures directly from NMR data. However, most approaches lack geologic calibration of the dataset and empirical correction factors are usually introduced in the scaling factor to improve the capillary pressure prediction at low wetting phase saturation. Volokitin et al. (A practical approach to obtain primary <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure curves from NMR core and log data, SCA- 9924, 2001) proposed an approach for NMR T 2 capillary pressure modelling based on a relationship between the NMR T 2 and pore-throat distribution embedded within a single universal proportionality parameter termed kappa, κ; where: they concluded that the universal scaling factor, κ[*]=[*] 3 psi Hg s seems to work for all clastic reservoirs. In this present work, analysis aimed at validating the existence of the proposed relationship between measured capillary pressures and inverse NMR T 2 distribution after Volokitin et al. indicate a nonlinear relationship. Pore throat distribution and accessible pore volumes analysis using a full-bore core mercury injection capillary pressure data from the Niger Delta Deep Water canyon reservoir demonstrates a single kappa factor is insufficient in characterizing pore throat distribution for reservoir with complex lithologies. Measured capillary pressures were compared with NMR derived ones for calibration with emphasis on various genetic reservoir units (lithofacies association). It suffices then to conclude that there exists no direct linear relationship between the NMR T 2 distributions and pore throat distributions. In addition, a constant scaling factor for kappa is insufficient in modelling subsurface capillary pressures/pore throat distribution from NMR T 2 data. An improved approach for NMR capillary pressure modelling can be obtained through local calibration, possibly allowing the kappa, κ scaling factor to vary as a function of rock types (pore size/grain sorting) and influence of clay diagenesis within the clastic system. The method has been applied successfully to a number of core samples from the clastic turbidites {{with a wide range of}} permeabilities. The NMR derived and primary <b>drainage</b> mercury injection <b>capillary</b> pressure curves show a very good agreement.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of hydrocarbon saturation (1 - Sw), a key volumetric parameter in reservoir characterisation, has {{a profound}} impact on the economic development potential of oil and gas fields. <b>Drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure (Pc) data acquired from core are required to model initial water saturation (Sw) distribution in the reservoir as a function of height above the free water level. Imbibition (Sw increasing) Pc is not considered in this paper. Pc data can be acquired from core by a variety of methods – traditionally by ultracentrifuge, porous plate and air-mercury injection. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages – in terms of how well the Pc curve is characterised. The ultracentrifuge offers several advantages including achieving higher capillary pressure and much shorter test duration than porous plate. A disadvantage is that the Pc curve is constructed indirectly, based upon Sw calculated from a theoretical model(s) [15]. Although the accuracy of Pc curve modelling improved significantly during the 1990 ’s based upon the work of such authors as Forbes [6], the capacity to form a robust bu...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{pressure}} {{is one of}} the most fundamental rock-fluid characteristics in multi-phase flow, critically influencing both the initial reservoir fluid distribution and the dynamic processes of oil recovery. Thus, it is of great importance to obtain accurate capillary pressure-saturation relationships when examining reservoir rocks. This work investigates a new method for obtaining the primary <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure curve for heterogeneous carbonates in air-brine and oil-brine systems. The method uses an ultracentrifuge to create a distribution of fluids and capillary pressures in a rock core before a NMR method is used to measure the saturation profile within the rock. In order to widen the application of the method, a diffusion-weighted profile sequence is used for NMR measurements in oil-brine systems. The method is able to provide a primary <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure curve in 3 days, and is therefore considered as a rapid alternative to other methods. By comparing results obtained for a relatively homogeneous Berea sandstone with that of more heterogeneous carbonate samples, the effects of heterogeneity are evident. The complexity of the studied material is reflected in the resulting capillary pressure curves, illustrating how heterogeneities violate classical concepts and assumptions within core analysis. However, these effects can provide valuable additional information for further studies. In particular, in-depth studies of a highly complex vuggy carbonate material questions the validity of assumptions made in numerous studies. It is also suggested that a capillary pressure curve representing the matrix porosity of the vuggy carbonate is obtainable. Since it is able to measure the actual fluid saturations within the rocks, NMR is proved to be a valuable tool for core analysis in heterogeneous material, visualizing both internal structures and their specific properties. In an attempt to verify the current method, several uncertainties concerning the procedures are addressed, including the prospects of fluid evaporation and redistribution. Studies indicate that fluid evaporation can be neglected within the time needed to perform the measurements with the new method. The rate of fluid redistribution is decreasing with permeability and the type of fluids present. Thus, it does occur to some extent in air-brine measurements, but can be neglected for the oil-brine measurements in the low permeable limestones. Due to its low uncertainties, the investigated method is considered to be a very accurate and reliable technique...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{and water}} {{application}} rates and timing {{depend on the}} final yield a grower expects the potato crop to achieve. Therefore precise measurements of 1) the nitrogen status of the crop and 2) the water status of the soil are needed. A crop growth model LINTUL-Potato calculates yields and the associated resource requirements based on the temperature dependent length of the growing season, the amount of solar radiation (potential yield) and on the soil moisture availability (achievable yields). Irrigation has to take place before a critical soil moisture level is reached and monitoring soil moisture may be done with several devices. Soil fluxes such as <b>capillary</b> rise, <b>drainage</b> and rainfall need not be monitored as they are accounted for by monitoring the soil for moisture depletion. Timing and amount of irrigation follow from the depletion rate, which depends on {{the proportion of the}} ground covered by green foliage and on the forecasted evapotranspiration rate by weather services of green foliage. To support decisions on supplemental nitrogen dressing knowledge is required on how much nitrogen is present in the soil at planting. Experimental data incorporated in the crop growth model have shown how much nitrogen a potato crop needs to contain before the end of a crucial time window to achieve the desired yield level. Several sampling techniques showing the crop nitrogen content presently exist. A nitrogen and water decision support system based on model and sensing techniques is nearing completion and already partly ready for world wide web application. Its usefulness for field specific application increases for each individual field, as more reinforcing data become available and are used in the decision process. Such a self-learning system becomes more powerful when more growers join the scheme for more years...|$|R
30|$|Accurate {{evaluation}} of capillary pressure and relative permeability {{are very important}} for investigating hydrocarbon recovery processes. Both of the two parameters are path dependent {{that is to say}} that they are different in imbibition and drainage processes, which is generally known as hysteresis effect and makes it difficult to predict. Basic knowledge is required to understand the flow path of wetting and non-wetting phase in reservoirs with displacing and displaced fluids. The terminologies of Morrow (1990) are adopted to represent the <b>capillary</b> pressure curves, <b>drainage</b> indicates a fluid flow of oil displacing water, no matter it is oil wet or water wet, and imbibition indicates a fluid flow of oil displaced by water. Through Figs.  3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, capillary pressure hysteresis can be clearly observed from the secondary drainage and bounding imbibition curves. The hysteresis effects of middle zone core samples are not as pronounced as those from the upper zone. Varying hysteresis is observed due to its dependency on the properties of permeability, porosity and wettability of porous medium. Each rock sample has its typical capillary pressure hysteresis that differs from those of the other ones.|$|R
30|$|Relative {{permeability}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters that affect the fluid flow in the simulation model. The shape of the P c and K r curves, as well as their endpoints, was very important to accurately model fluid flow in the reservoir. The water and oil relative permeabilities are two of the most sensitive and important reservoir parameters when evaluating any reservoir’s water breakthrough and waterflood potential. The relative permeability curves control the relative mobility of the fluid phases in the reservoir. They consequently influence displacement efficiency, and, to a lesser extent, sweep efficiency. It is critical to obtain reliable and realistic relative permeabilities for input into the simulator. Similar to capillary pressure curves, care should be taken in the preparation of the relative permeability data for the simulation models in order to have a simulation model that runs efficiently and accurately. The curves should be smooth and monotonic, and end point saturations between the <b>drainage</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure, imbibition capillary pressure and relative permeability curves should be consistent. In the current study, the measured core laboratory capillary pressure and relative permeability curves were used. However, the capillary pressure was scaled on the basis of the Leverett J-function (Leverett 1941) for the permeability, porosity and interfacial tension.|$|R
40|$|Gas-oil gravity {{drainage}} {{is considered to}} be one of the most dependable recovery mechanisms in naturally fractured reservoirs. The production mechanism is as a result of the density difference between the phases and capillary contrast between the matrixes and the fractures. This mechanism is contingent upon certain factors such as capillary threshold height and capillary discontinuity, among others. To assess the efficiency and contributions of these factors, a simulation study was carried out on a modeled fractured porous system using ECLIPSE- 100 simulator. The results obtained show that oil recovery from a single matrix block (RUN 1) was higher than matrix blocks with two, three and five stacks with capillary continuity (RUNS 2, 3 and 4 respectively). Additionally, with capillary discontinuity (RUNS 5, 6 and 7), the results depicted an increase in oil recovery compared to the cases of capillary continuity. However, varying the degree of capillary discontinuity with the respective matrix block stacks in the fractured model yielded no significant increase in oil recovery. Thus, the results show that while both capillary threshold height and capillary discontinuity remain significant factors in gas-oil gravity <b>drainage,</b> <b>capillary</b> continuity and varying the degree of discontinuity between the matrixes degree has little or no effect on this recovery mechanism in fractured porous media...|$|R

This thesis focuses on capillary trapping in which capillary forces immobilize CO₂ bubbles at the pore scale. During injection of supercritical CO₂, brine is displaced in {{what is known as}} the drainage process. Non-wetting fluid (supercritical CO₂) connectivity after drainage has been shown to impact the amount of <b>capillary</b> trapping after <b>drainage.</b> The drainage process (i. e. the CO₂ injection) should be engineered to provide favorable connectivity conditions to promote capillary trapping. This project investigated how drainage flow rate affects NW fluid connectivity. Experiments were conducted on Bentheimer sandstone rock cores with brine as the wetting (W) fluid and air as the non-wetting (NW) fluid. The rock cores were first saturated with brine and then drained at various flow rates. X-ray computed microtomography was used to acquire scans of the cores after saturation and after drainage to analyze the amount and distribution of NW phase fluid present in the pores. The two data sets acquired showed opposite trends between NW fluid connectivity and drainage flow rate. Significantly different NW saturations were reached making it difficult to directly observe the effect of drainage flow rate on fluid connectivity...|$|R
