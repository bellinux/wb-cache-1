50|$|The Australian {{academic}} Thomas Alured Faunce {{has argued}} that by expressly applying Annex 2C on pharmaceuticals, the NVNB claim in article 21.2(c) of the AUSFTA may {{have been responsible for}} lobbying by United States negotiators around the constructive ambiguity of reward of innovation (through the Medicines Working Group established by article 2C of the AUSFTA) that influenced Australian legislative changes impacting on reference pricing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. He maintains that such pressure from NVNB claims is most likely to arise from 'behind doors' lobbying using threats of <b>cross-retaliation</b> (threatening a trade dispute in one trade area to obtain a result in a different sector) if a planned or existing domestic policy is perceived to breach the 'spirit' of the relevant bilateral trade agreement. Formal dispute resolution proceedings may never be initiated or be intended to commence if such lobbying is persuasive. If this hypothesis is correct, it represents a disturbing example of regulatory capture and has worrying implications for democratic sovereignty. The Australian government, however, strenuously denies such claims.|$|E
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} law has become {{bound up in}} a debate about appropriate remedies for violations of the World Trade Organization Agreement. As an alternative to traditional countermeasures that consist of retaliation under the violated agreement, the World Trade Organization (2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 2) contemplates that violations {{of one of its}} covered agreements may be remedied through 2 ̆ 2 <b>cross-retaliation,</b> 2 ̆ 2 or retaliation under another agreement. One form of <b>cross-retaliation</b> has garnered interest in recent years: the threat to suspend intellectual property rights in response to unrelated trade violations <b>Cross-retaliation</b> through intellectual property rights suspension is theoretically appealing for its potential to avoid problems inherent in traditional retaliatory countermeasures-often tariff increases. <b>Cross-retaliation</b> appears attractive because its strength as a remedy is theoretically dependent on the value of the intellectual property rights at stake, rather than the political or economic strength of the complaining country. Proponents suggest it will solve power differential problems at the WTO while encouraging compliance. Missing from the conversation about <b>cross-retaliation</b> are (1) an assessment of its effectiveness in cases where it has been approved, and (2) an advocate for what I call the 2 ̆ 2 IP hostage 2 ̆ 2 of trade retaliation-that is, an account of the potential costs that may accompany threats to intellectual property rights. This account is useful in explaining why <b>cross-retaliation</b> has not been as effective as its proponents have suggested it would be. This Article fills the gap in the literature by providing case studies of the instances in which the WTO Dispute Settlement Body has approved intellectual property rights suspension as a means of trade retaliation. Based on these case studies, this Article argues that <b>cross-retaliation</b> may be a useful tool in some, limited circumstances, but generally suffers from many of the same problems as traditional retaliatory measures, particularly as they relate to developing countries with smaller economies. Moreover, this Article argues that the unique characteristics of intellectual property rights make it particularly difficult to carry out a threat of <b>cross-retaliation</b> through intellectual property rights suspension. Taking intellectual property rights hostage will not solve problems inherent in the remedial scheme for trade violations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{two prominent}} institutional {{rules in the}} international trading system: a lim- ited <b>cross-retaliation</b> rule characterized by the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) Article 22. 3 and a limited punishment rule characterized by the General Agreement on Taris and Trade (GATT) Article XXVIII. In general, both rules are designed to limit the countermeasures upon a violation; however, the former rule species the limits of composition in retaliation, whereas the latter one designates the limits of retaliation magnitude. We show that, albeit seemingly unrelated, the limited <b>cross-retaliation</b> rule complements the limited punishment rule in per- mitting greater trade liberalization. Specically, we show how the limited <b>cross-retaliation</b> rule also helps limit the incentives to violate the trade agreement when the limited punishment rule prevails. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explain}} {{the outcome of the}} WTO dispute on cotton {{subsidies}} between Brazil and US by analysing possible factors for the change in US policy vis-à-vis Brazil in the case. Brazil challenged US cotton subsidies through WTO dispute settlement in 2002, and the process has been running since, with a preliminary stop in June 2010. The WTO dispute settlement body issued two sets of recommendations in the case: One in 2005, after the first treatment of the case, and one in 2008 after the second. This essay attempts to explain why US changed their policy from after the first to after the second report. The essay concludes that the Brazilian threat of <b>cross-retaliation</b> was necessary for the change of US policy. However, more factors contributed to the outcome. The situation of the US economy, particularly {{in the aftermath of the}} financial crisis, enhanced the effect of the sanctions significantly. The <b>cross-retaliation</b> threat thus opened up a window of opportunity. The changed bilateral power relationship between US and Brazil was an important factor, as Brazil became a relatively more powerful actor. The role of the domestic ratification procedures in US played in, particularly in explaining why Brazil accepted the lack of full US compliance. Also, the relative strength of different US lobbies changed the US domestic coalition after the Brazilian <b>cross-retaliation</b> threat, weakening the US bargaining position...|$|E
40|$|This Paper, a {{thorough}} revision of Spagnolo (1996), addresses the following questions: What is the optimal {{design for a}} set of self-enforcing international policy agreements? How many and which issues should each agreement regulate? Are GATT’s constraints on issue linkage (<b>cross-retaliation)</b> welfare-enhancing? To facilitate international cooperation should governments keep policy issues under centralized control, or should they delegate them to independent agencies (e. g. central banks) ? In the second case, which issues should be delegated? Finally, institutions allowing governments to credibly delegate policy choices (e. g. to ‘conservative’ central bankers) are good or bad for international policy cooperation?Cooperation; Cross-Border Spillovers; Delegation; International Agreements; International Institutions; Linkages; Policy Coordination...|$|E
40|$|A {{widely shared}} {{assessment}} of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism {{is that it has}} worked reasonably well. But has the mechanism served the interests of developing countries? There were worries during the Uruguay round that developing countries would not benefit from the strong and quasi-judicial dispute settlement procedures of the WTO as they lacked the economic muscle for effective retaliation on which the procedures relied in the end. There were fears also that developing countries would be vulnerable to <b>cross-retaliation</b> by developed countries across the agreements on goods, services and intellectual property agreements. Actual experience during the 17 years of dispute settlement has shown that the anxieties of developing countries were overly exaggerated. Developing countries have not only raised a large number of disputes against developed countries but have also succeeded in obtaining rulings of legal violation in 88 per cent of the cases. They have also secured implementation in 94 per-cent of the cases in which they obtained rulings in their favour. Developed countries have been even more successful in cases against the developing. Their task has been made easier by the readiness of developing countries to live up to their WTO commitments. As a consequence, there has been no case of retaliation by the developed against developing countries. <b>Cross-retaliation</b> has proved to be an arrow in the quiver of developing countries rather than that of the developed, although they have been hesitant in using it. Overall, there has been sparing use of retaliation even among developed countries and WTO Members have relied more on moral pressure than coercive legal measures to enforce compliance. Provisions in the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) on special and differential treatment of developing countries have benefited them only marginally and their main handicap has been the dearth of human and financial resources to protect and defend their interest in disputes...|$|E
40|$|The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) favours {{negotiated}} settlements for disputes. However, arbitrations {{according to}} Article 22. 6 of the DSU {{have been carried}} out as compulsory conventional arbitrations, even though such arbitrations do not offer strong incentives for the parties to reach a settlement. For quite some time, scholars have studied other forms of arbitration that may encourage settlements more strongly, such as final offer arbitration. Yet this form of arbitration has received rather limited attention in the academic discussion about dispute settlement under the WTO. This article explores to what extent final offer arbitration might make sense for settling WTO disputes and concludes that it would be suitable for arbitrations pursuant to Article 22. 6 of the DSU, specifically for setting the level of suspension of obligations and, under certain circumstances, for deciding on so-called <b>cross-retaliation</b> pursuant to Article 22. 3 of the DSU. Before negotiations start, parties to a dispute should agree on final offer arbitration if arbitration should be deemed necessary. Such an agreement might be expressed in a pre-emptive joint proposal on procedural aspects. Amendment of the DSU would then be unnecessary...|$|E
40|$|The WTO dispute {{resolution}} body (DSB) is coming under increasing strain because some member states that lose cases, often the WTO’s wealthiest members, fail to fully implement the dispute panel rulings. On August 21, Brazil formally requested a WTO dispute panel because the U. S. {{has not made}} all the changes to its cotton programs that the dispute ruling of June 2004 on U. S. Upland Cotton required. The case is not unique. Non-compliance undermines the credibility and viability of the WTO’s rules-based multilateral trading system. In {{the wake of the}} July 2006 collapse of the Doha Round negotiations, many experts believe there will be a significant rise in WTO legal disputes. IATP proposes developing countries consider using a new strategy to ensure compliance: <b>cross-retaliation</b> within the WTO system. Under this approach, winners would be able to force implementation by suspending commitments to WTO agreements not named in the dispute. The approach is allowed in theory, but has not yet been tested in practice. * Compliance with WTO Dispute Rulings There {{have been a number of}} studies conducted on the extent of compliance within the WTO dispute settlement system. An analysis of 181 WTO disputes prior to July 1, 2002, found an 83 percent compliance rate. 1 Despite the high percentage of full or partial compliance, many of the disputes that led to formal non-compliance action includ...|$|E
