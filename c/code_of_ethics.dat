5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them. White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E

This study used a sample of 613 management accountants drawn from the United States to study the relationship between corporate and professional <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> and employee attitudes and behaviors. The presence <b>of</b> corporate <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> was associated with less perceived wrongdoing in organizations, but not with an increased propen-sity to report observed unethical behavior. Further, organizations that adopted formal <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> exhibited value orientations that went beyond finan-cial performance to include responsibility to the com-monweal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore {{the present state of}} ethical {{standards}} in universities. Drawing on the work of five faculty members who, in 1966, co-authored a discussion paper titled, "Ethical Principles in University Teaching", this work will ascertain the extent to which <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> are providing the intended direction, especially with regard to ethical behaviour among faculty and staff. This thesis begins with an historical review <b>of</b> how <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> emerged. This is followed by a description <b>of</b> five <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> chosen from Canadian universities. Closer examination of seven ethical principles is then undertaken. Although it has been determined that <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> provide the direction intended and are acting as guides to behaviour, there is still a dearth of empirical research on the continuing need for <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> and on ways in which they might be more effective in reducing the incidents of unethical behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Business {{ethics is}} a subject that {{recently}} has been thrust again into prominence in industrialised economies around the world, due to the revelations of the practices {{of some of the}} major corporations operating within the USA. In Australia, corporate collapses such as HIH and Onetel and in Sweden, the scandals with the top executives of Skandia and also Systembolaget have brought in to sharp focus that these practices are not confined to the USA. Since the early 1960 s, <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> have been in evidence in many organisations in the USA, whilst in Australia, as in Britain, the interest in <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> was piqued by the stock market crash of 1987.

The empirical results show that in most cases managers and employees are required to comply with the standards set by the Codes.

40|$|In making ethical decisions, {{how much}} should {{engineers}} rely on their own moral judgments rather than established <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics?,</b> In the modern, industrialised world of today, engineers working in any engineering discipline around the world having to face ethical dilemmas {{at some point in}} their careers simply cannot be avoided.

Research Question/ Issue: <b>Codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> {{contain a}} set of rules of conduct and {{corporate}} principles concerning the responsibility to stakeholders and shareholders, which help guide corporate and employees' behavior, and they constitute verifiable elements of social responsibility. Given the growing concern for social responsibility and for the relationship with external stakeholders, which has become an undeniable social demand, we think that the <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> the most respectable and admired companies should reflect this trend. This study looks into the Most Admired Companies of the World ranked by Fortune magazine in 2009 to find out if their <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> exhibit greater emphasis on social responsibility and strong implementation processes, and whether they could be considered <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> the third generation.

Museum research {{is an important part}} of museum work; it is an ethical responsibility of museum professionals to perform this work for society and to encourage this undertaking in their institutions by other stakeholders. But how do <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> in their current form encourage that? Instead of promoting a contemporary idea of research – multi-faceted, complex, open to the participation of many different interested parties, such as different professionals and communities of knowledge – they seem to understand research as a rather single-faceted phenomenon, object-oriented and collections-based. If <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> are the epitome of museum professionalism and museum values, then these ethics should be embodied in new provisions for museum research. Notions like social inclusion, public accountability, and transparency, are central in museum research, and should be included in all <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> as well, reflecting the efforts museums make to embody democratic ideals and share both research and writing of history with their audience, thus creating communities of knowledge.
