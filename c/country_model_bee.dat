40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is a complete}} case study of transdisciplinary research. The goals were to engage farmers in exploring landscape patterns for perennial agriculture and to assess resulting environmental impacts. Transdisciplinary research involves participants from several academic disciplines and nonacademic stakeholders, who work together toward a single research goal relevant to a societal problem. Participation in transdisciplinary research can be enhanced {{through the use of}} boundary objects, which are conceptual tools that promote cooperation without requiring consensus and that allow meaningful discussion of complex issues. When research explores landscape change, landscapes or landscape representations may be used as boundary objects. Working with farmers in an Illinois watershed, I developed future landscape patterns (FLPs) that include perennial bioenergy crops (PBC) within the corn/soy agricultural matrix to develop societally acceptable PBC farming systems. My results suggest that employing real places, landscape visualizations, and spatially explicit datasets as landscape boundary objects is an effective means of involving stakeholders. Next, I used a spatially explicit <b>model</b> of <b>bee</b> abundance to explore effects on wild bee habitat of the FLP’s crop composition, total PBC area, and landscape configuration. I found that more PBC area enhanced bee habitat. Prairie provided the greatest <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance, followed by switchgrass and then by willow. Landscape configuration altered the proportion of PBC within a given distance from a specific location in the landscape, but did not affect overall <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance {{at the level of the}} watershed. Next, I developed additional FLPs that represent spatial patterns associated with temperate agroforestry: willow/prairie alley cropping and entire-field management. I found that alley crop composition significantly influenced <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance. Specifically, prairie provided the greatest <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance, followed by alley cropping, and then by willow. Entire-field management did not affect overall <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance, but did affect distribution of habitat. My results suggest that simply incorporating PBC into the corn/soy agricultural system will enhance wild bee habitat, but that crop composition, area converted to PBC, and agroforestry strategies could further enhance wild bee habitat in agricultural landscapes...|$|R

Methods: In this study, the sodium urate and LPS were used on rats and mice to construct the <b>model.</b> <b>Bee</b> venom gel–microneedle combination effect on the model {{is to determine the}} role of microneedle gel permeation by observing inflammation factors.

40|$|Abstract. Honeybees {{coordinate}} foraging efforts across vast areas {{through a}} complex system of advertising and recruitment. One mechanism for coordination is the waggle dance, a movement pattern which carries positional information about food sources. However, recent {{evidence suggests that}} recruited foragers may not use the dance’s positional information {{to the degree that}} has traditionally been believed. We <b>model</b> <b>bee</b> colony foraging to investigate the value of sharing food source position information in different environments. We find that in several environments, relying solely on private information about previously encountered food sources is more efficient than sharing information. Relying on private information leads to a greater diversity of forage sites and can decrease over-harvesting of sources. This is beneficial in environments with small quantities of nectar per flower, but may be detrimental in nectar-rich environments. Efficiency depends on both the environment and a balance between exploiting high-quality food sources and oversubscribing them. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) are {{attracted}} to those particular inflorescences where other bees are already foraging, {{a process known as}} local enhancement. Here, we use a quantitative analysis of learning in a foraging task to illustrate that this attraction can lead bees to learn more quickly which flower species are rewarding if they forage in the company of experienced conspecifics. This effect can also be elicited by <b>model</b> <b>bees,</b> rather than live demon-strators. We also show that local enhancement in bumble-bees most likely reflects a general attraction to conspecifics that is not limited to a foraging context. Based on the widespread occurrence of both local enhancement and associative learning in the invertebrates, we suggest that social influences on learning in this group may be more common than the current literature would suggest and that invertebrates may provide a useful model for understanding how learning processes based on social information evolve...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{points to}} a neuroprotective action of bee venom on nigral dopamine neurons in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we examined whether bee venom also displays a symptomatic action by acting on the pathological functioning of the basal ganglia in rat PD <b>models.</b> <b>Bee</b> venom effects were assessed by combining motor behavior analyses and in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr, basal ganglia output structure) in pharmacological (neuroleptic treatment) and lesional (unilateral intranigral 6 -hydroxydopamine injection) PD models. In the hemi-parkinsonian 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion <b>model,</b> subchronic <b>bee</b> venom treatment significantly alleviates contralateral forelimb akinesia and apomorphine-induced rotations. Moreover, a single injection of bee venom reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy, a pharmacological model reminiscent of parkinsonian akinetic deficit. This effect is mimicked by apamin, a blocker of small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SK) channels, and blocked by CyPPA, a positive modulator of these channels, suggesting the involvement of SK channels in the bee venom antiparkinsonian action. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (basal ganglia output structure) showed no significant effect of BV on the mean neuronal discharge frequency or pathological bursting activity. In contrast, analyses of the neuronal responses evoked by motor cortex stimulation show that bee venom reverses the 6 -OHDA- and neuroleptic-induced biases in the influence exerted by the direct inhibitory and indirect excitatory striatonigral circuits. These data provide the first evidence for a beneficial action of bee venom on the pathological functioning of the cortico-basal ganglia circuits underlying motor PD symptoms with potential relevance to the symptomatic treatment of this disease...|$|R
