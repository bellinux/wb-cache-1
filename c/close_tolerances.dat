25|$|In {{the case}} of modern {{television}} receivers, no other technique was able to produce the precise bandpass characteristic needed for vestigial sideband reception, {{similar to that used}} in the NTSC system first approved by the U.S. in 1941. By the 1980s these had been replaced with precision electromechanical surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters. Fabricated by precision laser milling techniques, SAW filters are cheaper to produce, can be made to extremely <b>close</b> <b>tolerances,</b> and are very stable in operation.|$|E
500|$|Emerson's early folding knives {{were of the}} linerlock variety, {{ground by}} the stock removal method, and {{utilized}} rare materials from the aerospace industry, including titanium, carbon fiber, micarta, and meteorite. [...] He incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of the time, including mother-of-pearl, abalone shell, paua shell, staghorn, and rare hardwoods. Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species, noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker. The steel used in these blades was typically graded ATS-34, AEB-L, or 440C, and the blades were either highly polished or hand-rubbed. Emerson made knives with Damascus steel blades. Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are known as the [...] "Pre-Tac" [...] (Pre-Tactical) models. They can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades. The knives were noted for their <b>close</b> <b>tolerances</b> and precise locking mechanisms. Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker: Michael Walker, Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson.|$|E

2500|$|As {{well as the}} <b>close</b> <b>tolerances</b> between parts, the engine's lack of gaskets {{was made}} {{possible}} by a unique crankcase ventilation system. On any 2-cylinder boxer engine such as the 2CV's, the volume of the crankcase reduces by the cubic capacity of the engine when the pistons move together. This, combined with the inevitable small amount of [...] "leakage" [...] of combustion gases past the pistons leads to a positive pressure in the crankcase which must be removed in the interests of engine efficiency and to prevent oil and gas leaks. The 2CV's engine has a combined engine [...] "breather" [...] and oil filler assembly which contains a series of rubber reed valves. These allow positive pressure to escape the crankcase (to the engine air intake to be recirculated) but close when the pressure in the crankcase drops as the pistons move apart. Because gases are expelled but not admitted this creates a slight vacuum in the crankcase so that any weak joint or failed seal causes air to be sucked in rather than allowing oil to leak out.|$|E
2500|$|Tile {{is a thin}} modular stone unit, {{commonly}} 12 in. square (30.5cm) and 3/8 in. (10mm) deep. [...] Other popular {{sizes are}} 15 in. square (38cm), 18 in. square (46cm), and 24 in. square (61cm); these will usually be deeper than the 12 in. square. The majority of tile has a polished finish, but other finishes such as honed are becoming more common. Almost all stone tile is mass-produced by automated tile lines to identical size, finish, and <b>close</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Exceptions include slate flooring tile and special orders: tile with odd sizes or shapes, unusual finishes, or inlay work. [...] In summary, the automated tile line is a complicated complex of cutting and calibrating machines, honing-polishing machines, edging machines that put on flat or rounded edges, and interconnecting conveyors to move the stone from the slab input to the final tile product. The stone for tiles is most commonly marble, but often is granite, and sometimes limestone, slate, or quartz-based stone. [...] Common colors are white and light earth colors. Much of the stone for this application is produced in Italy and China.|$|E
