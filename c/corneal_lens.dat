25|$|The {{anterior}} median eyes (AME) {{have very}} good vision. This pair of eyes is built like a telescopic tube with a <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> {{in the front and}} a second lens in the back that focus images onto a four-layered retina, a narrow boomerang-shaped strip oriented vertically. Physiological experiments have shown they may have up to four different kinds of receptor cells, with different absorption spectra, giving them the possibility of up to tetrachromatic color vision, with sensitivity extending into the ultraviolet range. As the eyes are too close together to allow depth perception, and the animals do not make use of motion parallax, they have evolved a method called image defocus instead. Of the four photoreceptor layers in the retina, the first two closest to the surface contain ultraviolet-sensitive pigments while the two deepest contain green-sensitive pigments. The incoming green light is only focused on the deepest layer, while the other one receives defocused or fuzzy images. By measuring the amount of defocus from the fuzzy layer, it is possible to calculate the distance to the objects in front of them. In addition to receptor cells, also red filters have been detected, located in front of the cells that normally register green light. It seems that all salticids, regardless of whether they have two, three, or four kinds of color receptors, are highly sensitive to UV light. Some species (for example, Cosmophasis umbratica) are highly dimorphic in the UV spectrum, suggesting a role in sexual signaling (Lim & Li, 2005). Color discrimination has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{morphological}} {{and optical}} {{features of the}} <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> and retina have been examined in the posterior large stemma of the larva of the tiger beetle (Cicindela chinensis). A cup-shaped retina was positioned 55 ± 6 μm beneath the posterior margin of the <b>corneal</b> <b>lens,</b> which was 479 ± 20 μm in diameter and 391 ± 18 μm in thickness (n= 41). A light path through an isolated <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> showed that the object at infinite distance {{was focused on the}} distal margin of the retina. Geometrical optics gave a value of 334 ± 15 μm (n= 55) for the posterior focal length of the <b>corneal</b> <b>lens.</b> The refractive index of the <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> was estimated to be around 1. 8, if the lens was considered to be homogenous in structure. The internal structure of the lens, including concentric lamellae, was presumed to contribute to such a high refractive index, because this was higher than that of insect cuticle. The retinal structure and how images were blurred at different focus levels were also examined. Data obtained for optics of the <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> and retinal structures are discussed with reference to the distinct visual behavior of the larva...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of certain orally active contraceptive steroids on the eye, related to the tolerance of a corneal contact lens. An oestrogen, ethinyloestradiol BP. 0. 05 mg, a progestogen, norethisterone acetate BP. 2. 50 mg and a control tablet (vitamin C, 50 mg) were utilised. The effect of these preparations on corneal curvature, lacrimal fluid volume and protein composition and directly on <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> tolerance was monitored in a group of 23 volunteer patients. The progestogen was found to produce a significant (P≥ 0. 05) decrease in tear volume as measured by a 3 minute Schirmer test. A smaller volume reduction was observed with ethinyloestradiol. A normal cornea appears unaffected, within the measurement limits available, by the use of either hormone. However, {{in the presence of a}} <b>corneal</b> <b>lens,</b> oestrogen was found to induce substantial corneal steepening, indicative of tissue oedema, during the initial 2 - 3 weeks of medication. Progestogen occasionally produced a similar effect, which could recur with either hormone shortly after the end of the treatment period. A new method of acrylamide gel electrophoresis was developed for examination of the protein concentration and composition of lacrimal fluid. This allowed much greater resolution of microquantities of unconcentrated fluid than anything previously reported. Quantitation by densitometry has permitted the recording of medication and lens-induced changes in the protein pattern. Tear albumin has been shown to differ from serum albumin and to consist of up to 3 subfractions, 7 further protein fractions may also be resolved. The concentration and probable origin of these proteins have been established and the overall effects of hormone administration described. Individual idiosyncratic responses are also discussed. The study has established tbenature of some effects of contraceptive steroids on the anterior eye, and the probable reasons for resultant <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> intolerance...|$|E

40|$|Atomic force Microscopy (AFM) {{has become}} a {{versatile}} tool in biology due to its advantage of high-resolution imaging of biological samples close to their native condition. Apart from imaging, AFM can also measure the local mechanical properties of the surfaces. In this study, we explore {{the possibility of using}} AFM to quantify the rough eye phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster through mechanical properties. We have measured adhesion force, stiffness and elastic modulus of the <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> using AFM. Various parameters affecting these measurements like cantilever stiffness and tip geometry are systematically studied and the measurement procedures are standardized. Results show that the mean adhesion force of the ommatidial surface varies from 36 nN to 16 nN based on the location. The mean stiffness is 483 +/- 5 N/m, and the elastic modulus is 3. 4 +/- 0. 05 GPa (95 % confidence level) at the center of ommatidia. These properties are found to be different in <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> of eye expressing human mutant tau gene (mutant). The adhesion force, stiffness and elastic modulus are decreased in the mutant. We conclude that the measurement of surface and mechanical properties of D. melanogaster using AFM can be used for quantitative evaluation of `rough eye' surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The centred model predicts increase in spherical aberration in myopia.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} a distinctive pigment ring that appears in spider eyes after ecdysis and successively decreases in size in the days thereafter. Although pigment stops in spider eyes are well known, size variability is, to our knowledge, reported {{here for the first}} time. Representative species from three families (Ctenidae, Sparassidae and Lycosidae) are investigated and, for one of these species (Cupiennius salei, Ctenidae), the progressive increase in pupil diameter is monitored. In this species the pupil occupies only a fourth of the total projected lens surface after ecdysis and reaches its final size after approximately ten days. MicroCT images suggest that the decrease of the pigment ring is linked to the growth of the <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> after ecdysis.

40|$|AIM/BACKGROUND—Alport {{syndrome}} is an X linked disease {{that results in}} renal failure, deafness, and ocular abnormalities including a dot and fleck retinopathy and anterior lenticonus. The ultrastructural appearance of {{the glomerular basement membrane}} in thin basement membrane disease (TBMD) resembles that seen in some patients with Alport syndrome, and in some cases this disease is inherited too. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether patients with TBMD have any ocular abnormalities.  METHODS—The eyes of 17  unrelated individuals with TBMD were studied by slit-lamp, including biomicroscopic fundus examination with a 78  D lens, by direct ophthalmoscopy, and by fundal photographs. The findings were compared with those in patients with IgA glomerulonephritis or Alport syndrome, and in normals.  RESULTS—No patient with TBMD had a dot and fleck retinopathy or anterior lenticonus. A corneal dystrophy (n =  2) or pigmentation (n =  1), and retinal pigment epithelial clumping and maculopathy (n =  1) were noted. <b>Corneal,</b> <b>lens,</b> and retinal dots were found in five (29 %), three (18 %), and 16  (94 %) patients, respectively, but these were also demonstrated in individuals with other renal diseases and in normal individuals.  CONCLUSIONS—The dot and fleck retinopathy and anterior lenticonus typical of Alport syndrome do not occur in TBMD. The protein abnormality and genetic defect in TBMD are not known, but the lack of ocular lesions suggests that the abnormal protein in this disease is more sparsely distributed or less important in the basement membranes of the eye than of the kidney. Alternatively, the protein may be less affected by the mutations responsible for TBMD. ...|$|E
40|$|Epithelia of the cornea, {{lens and}} retina contain {{a vast array}} of ion {{channels}} and pumps. Together they produce a polarized flow of ions in and out of cells, as well as across the epithelia. These naturally occurring ion fluxes are essential to the hydration and metabolism of the ocular tissues, especially for the avascular cornea and lens. the directional transport of ions generates electric fields and currents in those tissues. Applied electric fields affect migration, division and proliferation of ocular cells which are important in homeostasis and healing of the ocular tissues. Abnormalities in any of those aspects may underlie many ocular diseases, for example chronic corneal ulcers, posterior capsule opacity after cataract surgery, and retinopathies. Electric field-inducing cellular responses, termed electrical signaling here, therefore may be an unexpected yet powerful mechanism in regulating ocular cell behavior. Both endogenous electric fields and applied electric fields could be exploited to regulate ocular cells. We aim to briefly describe the physiology of the naturally occurring electrical activities in the <b>corneal,</b> <b>lens,</b> and retinal epithelia, to provide experimental evidence of the effects of electric fields on ocular cell behaviors, and to suggest possible clinical implications.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} work {{discussed here}} {{focuses on the}} behavioral and physiological aspects of visual sexual signaling in the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. The blue crab has a pair of apposition compound eyes that are relatively acute (1. 5 ° resolution) for an arthropod. The eyes have two photopigments sensitive to blue (λ max = 440 nm) and green (λ max = 500 nm) light, allowing for simple color vision. Visual cues and signals are used during antagonistic and sexual communication and primarily involve claw-waving motions. A primary feature of the blue crab morphology is its sexually dimorphic claw coloration; males have blue and white claws and females have red claws. However, despite the potential for interesting color signaling, visual cues have typically been considered non-important, particularly in sexual communication where chemical cues have dominated blue crab signaling studies. In a series of experiments designed to simultaneously test the role of visual cues in mating behavior and blue crab color vision, I tested males' responses to photographs of females with differently colored claws. I found that photographs of females elicited male courting behaviors. I also found that males preferred females with red claws over those with white or isoluminant (i. e. matched brightness) gray claws. The discrimination of red from isoluminant grey showed the use of color vision in male mate choice. In natural populations, the claws of sexually mature females vary from light orange to deep red. To determine males' abilities discriminate between similar colors, I tested male color preferences for red against several shades of orange varying in brightness. Overall, males showed an innate preference for red-clawed females over those with variations of orange claws. However, in tests between red and orange shades similar in both brightness and hue, male blue crabs did not show a distinct preference, suggesting that males are either not able or not motivated to discriminate between these shades. Further, my results suggest that male blue crabs may use a mixture of chromatic and achromatic cues to discriminate between long-wavelength colors. After confirming the use of color in mate choice, I focused {{on the role of}} claw color in intraspecific communication. To quantify claw coloration, I measured spectral reflectance of claws of a blue crab population in North Carolina. In both sexes, the color of the claw varied with reproductive maturity and may act as a cue of reproductive readiness. Additionally, there was individual variation in claw color which could indicate individual quality. I have modeled the appearance of claw coloration to the blue crab eye and found that these color differences are visible to the blue crab eye and potentially signal gender, reproductive readiness, and/or individual quality. After investigating male mate choice, I began investigating visual aspects of female mating behavior. In the blue crab, like many crustaceans, courtship occurs during the female molting cycle and copulation takes place after the female has shed her exoskeleton. In crustaceans and other arthropods with compound eyes, the <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> of each facet is part of the exoskeleton and thus shed during molting. I used optomotor assays to evaluate the impact of molting on visual acuity (as measured by the minimum resolvable angle &alpha min) in the female blue crab. I found that visual acuity decreases substantially in the days prior to molting and is gradually recovered after molting. Prior to molting, &alpha min was 1. 8 °, a value approximating the best possible acuity in this species. In the 24 hours before molting, &alpha min increased to a median of 15. 0 ° (N= 12), an eight-fold drop in visual acuity. Six days after molting, &alpha min returned to the pre-molting value. Micrographs of C. sapidus eyes showed that a gap between the <b>corneal</b> <b>lens</b> and the crystalline cone appeared approximately five days prior to shedding and increased in width the process progressed. This separation was likely responsible for the loss of visual acuity observed in behavioral tests. Since mating is limited to the female's pubertal molt, a reduction in acuity during this time may {{have an effect on the}} sensory cues used in female mate choice. These results may be broadly applicable to all arthropods that molt and have particular importance for crustaceans that molt multiple times in their lifetime or have mating cycles paired with molting.

Molecular Vision, 17, 237 – 246. Purpose: The {{purpose was to}} develop suitable in vitro methods to detect ocular epithelial cell damage when exposed to UV radiation, {{in an effort to}} evaluate UV-absorbing ophthalmic biomaterials. Methods: Human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC), lens epithelial cells (HLEC), and retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE- 19) were cultured and Ultraviolet A/Ultraviolet B (UVA/UVB) blocking filters and UVB-only blocking filters were placed between the cells and a UV light source. Cells were irradiated with UV radiations at various energy levels with and without filter protections. Cell viability after exposure was determined using the metabolic dye alamarBlue and by evaluating for changes in the nuclei, mitochondria, membrane permeability, and cell membranes of the cells using the fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33342, rhodamine 123, calcein AM, ethidium homodimer- 1, and annexin V. High-resolution images of the cells were taken with a Zeiss 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Results: The alamarBlue assay results of UV-exposed cells without filters showed energy level-dependent decreases in cellular viability. However, UV treated cells with 400 nm LP filter protection showed the equivalent viability to untreated control cells at all energy levels. Also, UV irradiated cells with 320 nm LP filter showed lower cell viability than the unexposed control cells, yet higher viability than UV-exposed cells without filters in an energy level-dependent manner. The confocal microscopy results also showed that UV radiation can cause significant dose-dependent degradations of nuclei and mitochondria in ocular cells. The annexin V staining also showed an increased number of apoptotic cells after UV irradiation. Conclusions: The findings suggest that UV-induced HCEC, HLEC, and ARPE- 19 cell damage can be evaluated by bioassays that measure changes in the cell nuclei, mitochondria, cell membranes, and cell metabolism, and these assay methods provide a valuable in vitro model for evaluating the effectiveness of UV-absorbing ophthalmic biomaterials, including contact lenses and intraocular lenses.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to assess the expression patterns of heat shock proteins (Hsps), after eyeball heating or cooling, and to elucidate their relationships with corneal wound healing and intraocular complications after excimer laser treatment. Experimental mice were grouped into three according to local pretreatment type: heating, cooling, and control groups. The preconditioning was to apply saline eyedrops onto the cornea prior to photoablation. Following photoablation, we evaluated corneal wound healing, <b>corneal</b> opacity and <b>lens</b> opacity. Hsp expression patterns were elucidated with Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. The heating and cooling groups recovered more rapidly, and showed less <b>corneal</b> and <b>lens</b> opacity than the control group. In the heating and cooling groups, there were more expressions of Hsps in the cornea and lens than in the control group. These results were confirmed in the Hsp 70. 1 knockout mouse model. Our study showed that Hsps were induced by the heating or cooling preconditioning, and appeared to be a major factor in protecting the cornea against serious thermal damage. Induced Hsps also seemed {{to play an important role}} in rapid wound healing, and decreased <b>corneal</b> and <b>lens</b> opacity after excimer laser ablation...|$|R

In the present study, full-thickness detachment of the corneal epithelium was induced by n-heptanol, and the feasibility of the quantitative evaluation of this injury by <b>corneal</b> contact <b>lens</b> electrodes was evaluated in vivo. Methods: The central area of an albino rabbit&# 39;s cornea was exposed to a filter paper pre-immersed in n-heptanol for 1 minute to induce injury of the corneal epithelium. After induction of injury, the electrical CR was measured {{and the percentage of}} CR (%CR) was calculated. Fluorescein solution (3 &micro;L) was applied to the wound/affected area of the corneal epithelium for photography with a slit-lamp biomicroscope. The wound/affected area was measured using an image analysis system. The correlation between the %CR and the wound/affected area was analyzed. Results: As the size of the wound/affected area of the corneal epithelium increased, the %CR decreased after corneal epithelium detachment. Thus, a close correlation was found between the area of corneal epithelium detachment and the %CR. Conclusion: The corneal resistance device that we developed was capable of quantitatively evaluating n-heptanol-induced full-thickness injuries of the corneal epithelium.
