40|$|The military-fiscal {{problems}} {{played an}} important part in the political activity of opposition during the Seym of 1786. The unpopularity of the court’s military policy gave facilities to opposition for setting the Unity of the Court Party at variance. The passive behaviour of the king Stanisław August was conducive to that while the opposition was showing a great amount of activity. There was a sign of this situation - the carrying of rider to resolution approving the activity of the Standing Council’s War Departament. The tenor of this rider does not deserve such a severe criticism how it was suggested by previous historical opinions. The analogous success of opposition was connected with approval of the Polish Treasury <b>Commitee’s</b> activity. These facts show that the opposition’s programme did not limit to negation but it contained constructive elements. The criticism of unsuccessful regulations enacted by the War Departament {{played an important}} part in discussion about military subjects. The opposition attacked: - The way of formulation of these regulations. - The transgression of War Departament’s powers established by resolution from 1776. - The merits of military problem’s solution. For the opposition the criticism of War Departament was the part of action against the Standing Council. The particular streams of opposition set their hopes on that action. The above-mentioned discussion was the announcement of political changes which appeared {{at the beginning of the}} Great Seym-especially the resolution from November 3 / 4 th, 1788 repealed the War Departament of Standing Council.

Development and Management, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Since 1994 {{fundamental}} transformation {{has taken}} place in South Africa in terms of disaster risk management. The transformation process gave rise to the promulgation of the Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002) that heralded a new era for disaster risk management in South Africa. Consequently the National Disaster Management Framework, published in 2005, set clear guidelines for the implementing of the mentioned act. The National Disaster Management Framework emphasises the importance of the integration and coordination of disaster risk management activities in all spheres of government. Die Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002) calls for the establishment or certain disaster risk management structures like interdepartmental <b>commitees,</b> disaster management centers, disaster management frameworks, and disaster management advisory forums. Furthermore the National Disaster Management Framework sets certain guidelines in compliance with the Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002). Municipalities in South Africa have had time since the promulgation of the act in 2003 to get all the mentioned structures in place. This study tried to deretmine the degree in which municipalities complied with the requirements of the Disaster Management Act (57 / 2002). The municipalities were handles per procvince and the research is based on a 20 % representative sample of all the municipalities in South Africa. A mixed method of research was followed. That means that qualitative (telephonic and semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires with Likert scale questions) research was used.

By leaving the current role model, the USSR, Yugoslavia started on a new course towards then still undefined system of self-government.

The reform changes took place in several steps during the 1950 and 1952 being concluded when the Constitutional law regarding the basis of social and political organization of the Federal People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of Yugoslavia and the federal organs of government was accepted. This law confirmed the socio-political changes during the period from 1950 to 1952 and legalised a system which proclaimed public property as the basis of social system, at the same time trying to create a system of Yugoslav class unity. A basic function of these reforms was to deal with the abandonment of already existing ruling forms of <b>commitees</b> and general directorates. Ministries and councils remained main bodies. A role of the councils was dominant, while the ministries took care of the classical part of administration, not covering area of the economy. New administrative bodies, the councils, should have represented coordinative bodies, based on parity principle. They still retained a coordinative role of the federal center. The idea of self-government, based on theoretical propositions of the heads of the Yugoslav Communist Party, was founded on the political need of finding a specific road in leading the country. Regardless of the 1950 and 1952 reforms, which were conducted before the acceptance of self-government legislation, the basic characteristics of statist socialism were retained, keeping also the form of state property and control of the entire political system...|$|R

Mostly occurred ethical disturbances, which often marked juniors’ workers and persons having more little work experience, were: usage own positions, purposing one or second support relatives or friends - (44. 7 %), in the outpatient clinic existing work place used for personal aims – (40. 4 %), every second (49. 8 %) respondent marked, that in the outpatient clinic existing presents for direct positions performance, every third (33. 9 %) respondent indicated, that “selves” medical services provided more qualify and fast. 98. 3 % of respondents answer, that in the outpatient clinic non confidentiality principles disturbances. Conclusion. In the Kaunas Sanciai outpatient clinic predominant ethical climate, so the motivation of investigated collective for ethical behavior is very positive, meanwhile in this outpatient clinic determined some ethical disturbances, which for crossing necessity to tighten workers responsibility and its work control. Practical recommendations. For intensifaying the ethical climate of workers in the health care institutions, would need established the ethical <b>commitees</b> and commisions, which organized ethical education for outpatient clinic workers and would warrant organisation ethical climate betterment, pointedly to decrease ethical disturbances in the health care institution...|$|R
40|$|For the {{development}} of new stadium concepts relevant aspects of planning are described with proven actual relations, created by a typological investigation of structures and use-specific organization. This is a basis, which is contentwise necessary, {{in order to be able}} to decide substantial initial parameters of a line of sight profile on grandstands. In that case at modern sports grounds or places of event "Sightlines and Safety" are inseparable In assistance of built examples and parameter studies, empirical investigations and a review on historical building defaults, the safety-relevant appropriate decision criteria are cleared up. In this way a planning instrument will be developped for sightline-construction, which qualifies the comfort of viewing accomodations. The requirements and technical recommendations to sports stadia changed in the process of the past decades very strongly. The desire for a higher comfort for the spectators and a better marketableness became clear defaults for new stadium designs. By the omission of many athletic careers the grandstand bodies move much closer to the pitch. This leads to the desired effect of closer atmosphere, but changes the viewing conditions for the spectators. The planning parameter "point of eye" or "C- value" become the quality standard with the evaluation of a grandstand. This is usually not further crucial in a Track and Field stadia, because of a sufficient distance of seating. By the increasing complexity of multi-functional use structures in stadium and arena the factors of influence become ever obscurer on the latest development of a modern grandstand, for example the issues of safety in pitch perimeter barriers of the "First row". Decisions and defaults from different responsibility ranges unnoticed interlink with diagram geometry of a sightline-profile. In a first step the building type is set into a historical context. The bases of seeing are described, the physics of the eye and the visual acuity criteria necessary for regarding. The moreover a sample person Modulor "EN" is being developed from the bases of the anthropometry. This way a contract-obligatory basis for a line of sight design can be represented by the overlay of historical proportion teachings, like the "golden section", with existing regulations and statistic data for body-measurements. In the next step an objective construction procedure for the sightline-determination is developed. Because of the past legislation C. E. N. Technical <b>Commitees</b> (TC's) defaults do not exist in a practice-relevant form to design a viewing accomodations and will not lead to its possible commitment of a qualitative comparison standard. In assistance by parameter studies within the calculation formula and empirical investigations on the examples built for the FIFA soccer World Cup 2006 in Germany, appropriate decision criteria are represented. In this connection the technical recommendations and requirements of important sports federations are analyzed and set with one another in relationship, in order to clear their dependence up and to make critical conclusions possible on the respective regulations. This work is to inform as a methodical decision basis and to serve as an optimizing planning instrument for the construction of stadia in {{the development}} of sightline-profiles for modern sports grounds or places of event...|$|R
