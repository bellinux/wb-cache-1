40|$|The {{last few}} decades the {{development}} {{in the field of}} electronics has been huge. The components performance gets better {{at the same time as}} the manufacturing cost decreases. Many of the design moments that have to be done, are done automatically today, but it can get better. Especially for analog circuit design. At Electronic System in Linköpings universitet, research is in progress to develop a tool that can design analog circuits in reasonable time. It means that it has to size the components (transistors, resistances, capacitances etc), so that the circuit can fulfill the performance requirements. An optimization method in conjunction with derived equations for the circuit performance is used to solve this task. The tool is created to design e. g. analog amplifiers. The goal is to decrease the design time and at the same time achieve better circuit performance. This tool has been tested on three different circuits, a power-amplifier, a Nested Miller <b>Compensated</b> <b>amplifier</b> with an active feedback (Active Nested Miller Compensation) and a Nested Miller <b>Compensated</b> <b>amplifier</b> without an active feedback (Nested Miller Compensation). In this report the results from the designing tests are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Class A {{and class}} AB {{operational}} amplifiers are {{an essential part}} of a mixed- signal chip, where they are used as active filter sub-blocks, compensators, reference current generators and voltage buffers, {{to name just a few}} of many applications. For analog circuits such as operational amplifiers a mixed-signal chip is a very unfriendly operating environment, where the power supply is often corrupted by high current switching circuits. In addition, power supply voltages for analog blocks are shrinking, because of the deployment of new battery technologies and fine line length integrated circuit processes, which can reduce the amplifier dynamic range a problem requiring supply insensitive low voltage compatible amplifier topologies and other analog blocks. The aims of this thesis were to further develop the low voltage compatible class AB amplifier topologies published earlier by other authors, to improve their bandwidth efficiency by means of re-examining two- and three-stage amplifier compensation techniques and to find solutions for enhancing the high frequency power supply noise rejection performance of class A and class AB amplifiers without degrading their signal path stability. The class AB amplifier cores presented here improve the amplifier’s power supply noise insensitivity at high frequencies and increase bandwidth efficiency when compared to the commonly used two-stage Miller <b>compensated</b> <b>amplifier,</b> enabling the construction of better buffers and more power-efficient and reliable low voltage mixed signal chips...|$|E

40|$|The basic {{building}} block of a pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is the multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC). The performance of the MDAC significantly depends {{on the performance of}} the operational amplifier and calibration techniques. To reduce the complexity of calibration, the operational amplifier needs to have high-linearity, high bandwidth and moderate gain. In this work, the Op-amp specifications were derived from the pipeline ADC requirements.
