5|$|Sound Transit {{revisited}} the routing issue during community {{meetings in}} 1997 and 1998, proposing an alternate route through Eastlake, South Lake Union, and the Seattle Center if engineering of the <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill</b> tunnel would jeopardize the project's budget.

Sound Transit proposed that Capitol Hill's cut and cover station be located under Broadway south of East John Street, with several entrances to serve nearby Seattle Central Community College and the Broadway business district. From the station, trains would continue south to a station in First Hill before entering the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel; and north under Portage Bay to the western University District. An additional <b>Capitol</b> <b>Hill</b> station, near Broadway and East Roy Street, was proposed by Seattle representatives but {{left out of the}} preferred alternative due to cost concerns.
