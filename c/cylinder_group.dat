These values may then be a valuable tool for evaluating increasing misfit duo to fabrication processing and wear. Materials and methods: A total of 7 implants and 7 analogues with external and internal hexagon connection (Biomet 3 I, Palm Beach, FR USA), with corresponding prefabricated gold cylinders and gold screws, prefabricated cylindrical plastic cylinder and laboratory screws were studied. One set of components from the external and internal group was measured manually and digitally. Measurements from the test subjects were compared with identical measurements from the virtual model, to obtain threshold values. The virtual model was then used to obtain optimal orientated cuts. Results: The horizontal machining tolerances for castable plastic abutments on external implants were 12 ± 89 μm and for internal 86 ± 47 μm. Tolerance measurement on prefabricated gold abutments for external implants were 44 ± 9 μm and for internal implants 58 ± 28 μm.

40|$|This study reinvestigates {{the effects}} of primary {{imprinting}} of chicks with either a naturalistic stimulus or an artificial object on subsequent imprinting with artificial objects. Initial experience with a live chick (group C) or a yellow <b>cylinder</b> (<b>group</b> Y) had differential effects {{on the development of}} a secondary filial attachment in chicks. In chicks of both groups, growth of attachment to the novel imprinting object manifested itself rather abruptly, but the change in response to the novel object occurred later in C- than in Y-chicks. There was no difference between the groups in the outcome of secondary imprinting: chicks in groups C and Y eventually became equally strongly attached to their novel imprinting stimulus, and when exposed to a third object, chicks in both groups imprinted equally well on this object. Thus, (1) initial imprinting on a naturalistic stimulus postponed, but did not block secondary imprinting on an artificial object, and (2) within the lengths of exposure used, the capacity to form new filial attachments was not limited, contrary to the prediction of the competitive exclusion model for imprinting. Secondary imprinting was delayed for a longer time when chicks were exposed to the novel imprinting stimulus in an unfamiliar environment. This indicates that induction of fear in chicks interfered with the occurrence of secondary imprinting. This effect {{may have contributed to the}} difference between groups C and Y in the length of delay of secondary imprinting. Possibly, separation from the first stimulus and exposure to the second stimulus was more fearful to C-chicks than to Y-chicks...|$|E

Feldspathic ceramic <b>cylinders</b> (<b>Groups</b> 1, 2, 5 and 6) were etched for 60 s with 10 % hydrofluoric acid and Groups 3, 4, 7 and 8, without acid etching. Two layers of silane Clearfil Ceramic Primer (CCP, Groups 1 to 4) and two layers of RelyX Ceramic Primer (RCP, groups 5 to 8) were applied and dried for 60 s. Brackets were bonded to the cylinders with Transbond XT and light-activated for 40 s with Bluephase G 2. All specimens were stored in deionized water at 37 °C for 24 h, and the specimens of groups 1, 3, 5 and 7 were submitted to 7, 000 thermal cycles (5 °C/ 55 °C).

40|$|File {{systems were}} {{originally}} designed for hosts {{with only one}} disk. Over the past 20 years, a number of increasingly complicated changes have optimized the performance of file systems on a single disk. Over the same time, storage systems have advanced on their own, separated from file systems by the narrow block interface. Storage systems have increasingly employed parallelism and virtualization. Parallelism seeks to increase throughput and strengthen fault-tolerance. Virtualization employs additional levels of data addressing indirection to improve system flexibility and lower administration costs. Do the optimizations of file systems make sense for current storage systems? In this paper, I show that {{the performance of a}} current advanced local file system is sensitive to the virtualization parameters of its storage system. Sometimes random block layout outperforms smart file system layout. In addition, random block layout stabilizes performance across several virtualization parameters. This approach has the advantage of immunizing file systems to changes in their underlying storage systems. 1 File Systems The first popular file systems used local hard disks for persistent storage. Today there are often several hops of networking between a host and its persistent storage. Most often, that final destination is still a hard disk. Disk geometry has {{played a central role in}} the past 20 years of file system development. The first file system to make allocation decisions based on disk geometry was the BSD Fast File System (FFS) [5]. FFS improved file system throughput over the earlier UNIX file system by clustering sequentially accessed data, colocating file inodes with their data, and increasing the block size, while providing a smaller block size, called a fragment, for small files.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the thermal flows and heat transfer phenomena occurring in the cooling circuit of a high specific power engine and to suggest a valid method to evaluate its effectiveness in keeping the temperature below a safety limit even in the highest thermal power points. This is a first work showing the analysis of the cooling circuit of a small single-cylinder, four-stroke, high power density gasoline engine carried out with a numerical three-dimensional CFD analysis by means of a CFD conjugate simulation, whose boundary conditions have been taken from a validated one-dimensional fluid dynamic engine model. Once its validity has been assessed by the comparison between the simulation results and data collected by literature and experiments, the interest for this procedure relies on the fact that heat fluxes are directly calculated by the CFD code through the knowledge of gas temperatures and convective heat transfer coefficients. Hence an arbitrary, a priori subdivision of the total heat flux released by fuel combustion into heat converted into mechanical work, heat released to the cooling system, heat rejected to the exhaust, etc. can be avoided; at the same time, the model provides the proper distribution of the heat rejected to the various surfaces constituting the water jackets. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the cooling system is then directly performed in terms of temperature distribution. By this way, once the engine has been designed from a fluid dynamic and mechanical point of view, the effectiveness of the cooling system can be immediately verified through the application of the described procedure. This study takes into consideration the evaluation of average and instantaneous heat transfer coefficient and in-cylinder gas temperature through the use of a validated 1 D CFD model, the analysis of the temperature field by means of a conjugate heat transfer simulation of the whole head and <b>cylinder</b> <b>group</b> and an example of the application of this procedure for the evaluation of a simple modification of the cooling system...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) methods to various problems {{in the field of}} coastal and ocean engineering is gaining importance due to the level of detail and accuracy offered by these methods. With the advances made in the computing power over the last decade and anticipated future increase in computational power, large and complex problems can be handled using CFD modeling. The PhD study aims at the development of a CFD-based numerical wave tank, validation and testing of the wave tank and {{application of}} the model to study the hydrodynamics of an Oscillating Water Column (OWC) device and build a platform for further research on OWC design and deployment in arrays. The development of the numerical model covers incorporation of the best available numerical recipes to produce accurate results in the numerical wave tank, using higher-order discretization schemes to obtain a sharp representation of the free surface and avoiding numerical damping of the waves propagating in the wave tank. The numerical model is validated by investigating various phenomena in coastal engineering such as interaction of non-breaking waves with cylinders, wave shoaling, breaking, and interaction of breaking waves with vertical cylinders and the numerical results are compared to experimental data with very good agreement. Wave shoaling and decomposition over a submerged bar is simulated with very good representation of the phase and amplitude of the decomposed waves observed in experiments. The model is further validated for wave interaction with an OWC device by investigating a 1 : 12. 5 model scale device; the hydrodynamics of the device is studied and the numerical results compared to experimental data. Wave interaction with cylinders at low Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) numbers is further investigated to obtain insight into the phenomena associated with large coastal structures such as the OWC device. The investigation into high steepness wave diffraction revealed that the wave forces on a single cylinder are over-predicted by about 32 % by the McCamy-Fuchs theory for an incident wave of steepness 0. 1, due to the difference in the wave diffraction pattern. The phenomenon of wave near-trapping is investigated for a four <b>cylinder</b> <b>group</b> and it is found that the leading cylinder in the group experiences two times the force on a single cylinder due to wave near-trapping at low incident wave steepness of 0. 004, but only 1. 2 times the force on a single cylinder at a higher wave steepness of 0. 06 due to a break-down of the conditions leading to wave near-trapping at a high incident wave steepness. Breaking wave forces on a vertical cylinder are known {{to be sensitive to the}} location of the cylinder with respect to the breaking point. The maximum breaking wave force is calculated in the scenario where the overturning wave crest impacts the cylinder just below the wave crest level and is 1. 5 times the magnitude of the wave force calculated when the wave breaks just behind the cylinder. An impinging jet is seen to form behind the vertical cylinder due to breaking wave impact, which can have consequences on the wave forces on a cylinder placed behind it. It is found that when the wave breaks at or just behind the first cylinder, the wave force on the second cylinder is about 10 % higher than the breaking wave force on a single cylinder. The hydrodynamics of an OWC device is studied, including the interaction with steep incident waves, the effect of power take-off (PTO) damping due to the turbine and the air volume in the chamber is investigated. A linear PTO system corresponding to a bi-directional Wells turbine is assumed in the study. It is found that for incident waves with a high steepness of 0. 1, the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is about 40 % compared to the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency of 80 % obtained at a lower wave steepness of 0. 03 for the same incident wavelength. The effect of damping from the linear PTO system is investigated and it is found that the hydrodynamic efficiency of the OWC is found to increase from about 10 % to about 80 % for the resonant wavelength on increasing the PTO damping from 0 to 4 × 108 m− 2. On further increase in the PTO damping, the hydrodynamic efficiency of the OWC is reduced to 60 %. Similar trend is observed for wavelengths away from resonance and it is concluded that there exists an optimal value for PTO damping for every incident wavelength, which results in the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency of the OWC for that wavelength. The air chamber volume of a 1 : 12. 5 scale model device is increased by increasing the height of the chamber while maintaining the cross-sectional area to study the effect of air compressibility. This effect is found to be negligible both in the model scale device and in the device with an enlarged air chamber. The pressure developed in the OWC chamber, though, is reduced by about 30 % and free surface oscillations increased by about 30 % in the device with the enlarged chamber compared to the 1 : 12. 5 scale model device. The differences observed could be attributed to the air velocity distribution in the two configurations of the device, as it is found that the high velocity air stream interacts with the free surface in the model scale device but not in the device with the enlarged chamber. The results show that the numerical model produces a good representation of the hydrodynamics involved in the different wave transformation and interaction processes encountered in coastal waters and in the specialized case of an OWC device. In future work, the model can be used to further investigate the wave forces on an OWC, interaction with irregular waves, the combination of OWC with detached breakwaters and other device parameters to improve the hydrodynamic characteristics of an OWC...|$|E
40|$|The {{peculiar}} {{velocity field}} measured by redshift-space distortions (RSD) in galaxy surveys provides a unique probe {{of the growth}} of large-scale structure. However, systematic effects arise when including satellite galaxies in the clustering analysis. Since satellite galaxies tend to reside in massive halos with a greater halo bias, the inclusion boosts the clustering power. In addition, virial motions of the satellite galaxies cause a significant suppression of the clustering power due to nonlinear RSD effects. We develop a novel method to recover the redshift-space power spectrum of halos from the observed galaxy distribution by minimizing the contamination of satellite galaxies. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>grouping</b> method (CGM) we study effectively excludes satellite galaxies from a galaxy sample. However, we find that this technique produces apparent anisotropies in the reconstructed halo distribution over all the scales which mimic RSD. On small scales, the apparent anisotropic clustering is caused by exclusion of halos within the anisotropic cylinder used by the CGM. On large scales, the misidentification of different halos in the large-scale structures, aligned along the line-of-sight, into the same CGM group, causes the apparent anisotropic clustering via their cross-correlation with the CGM halos. We construct an empirical model for the CGM halo power spectrum, which includes correction terms derived using the CGM window function at small scales as well as the linear matter power spectrum multiplied by a simple anisotropic function at large scales. We apply this model to a mock galaxy catalog at z= 0. 5, designed to resemble SDSS-III BOSS CMASS galaxies, and find that our model can predict both the monopole and quadrupole power spectra of the host halos up to k< 0. 5 h/Mpc to within 5 %.

40|$|Most {{contemporary}} implementations of the Berkeley Fast File System optimize {{file system}} throughput by allocating logically sequential data to physically contiguous disk blocks. This clustering is effective {{when there are}} many contiguous free blocks on the file system. But the repeated creation and deletion of files of varying sizes that occurs over time on active file systems is likely to cause fragmentation of free space, limiting {{the ability of the}} file system to allocate data contiguously and therefore degrading performance. This paper presents empirical data and the analysis of allocation and fragmentation in the SunOS 4. 1. 3 file system (a derivative of the Berkeley Fast File System). We have collected data from forty-eight file systems on four file servers over a period of ten months. Our data show that small files are more fragmented than large files, with fewer than 35 % of the blocks in two block files being allocated optimally, but more than 80 % of the blocks in files larger than 256 kilobytes being allocated optimally. Two factors are responsible for this difference in fragmentation, an uneven distribution of free space within file system <b>cylinder</b> <b>groups</b> and a disk allocation algorithm which frequently allocates the last block of a file discontiguously {{from the rest of the}} file. Performance measurements on replicas of active file systems show that they seldom perform as well as comparable empty file systems but that this performance degradation is rarely more than 10 – 15 %. This decline in performance is directly correlated to the amount of fragmentation in the files used by the benchmark programs. Both file system utilization and the amount of fragmentation in existing files on the file system influence the amount of fragmentation in newly created files. Characteristics of the file system workload also have a significant impact of file system fragmentation and performance, with typical news server workloads causing extreme fragmentation. ...|$|R

In a {{turbocharged}} engine, {{preserving the}} maximum amount of exhaust pulse energy for turbine operation will result in improved low end torque and engine transient response. However, the exhaust flow entering the turbine is highly unsteady, and the presence of the turbine as a restriction in the exhaust flow results in a higher pressure at the cylinder exhaust ports and consequently poor scavenging. This leads to an increase in the amount of residual gas in the combustion chamber, compared to the naturally-aspirated equivalent, thereby increasing the tendency for engine knock. If the level of residual gas can be reduced and controlled, it should enable the engine to operate at a higher compression ratio, improving its thermal efficiency. This paper presents a method of turbocharger matching for reducing residual gas content in a turbocharged engine. The turbine is first scaled to a larger size as a preliminary step towards reducing back pressure and thus the residual gas concentration in-cylinder. However a larger turbine causes a torque deficit at low engine speeds. So in a following step, pulse separation is used. In optimal pulse separation, the gas exchange process in one cylinder is completely unimpeded by pressure pulses emanating from other cylinders, thereby preserving the exhaust pulse energy entering the turbine. A pulse-divided exhaust manifold enables this by isolating the manifold runners emanating from certain <b>cylinder</b> <b>groups,</b> even as far as the junction with the turbine housing.

25|$|In 1900 the Italian {{engineer}} Enrico Plancher {{developed a}} new and curious design of compound engine, which first appeared on the Rete Adriatica 500 class express locomotive; it was notable for being an asymmetrical four-cylinder design, {{in which the two}} AP and the two LP <b>cylinders</b> were <b>grouped</b> together, with each couple being served by a single piston valve which admitted steam simultaneously to the opposite ends of the two cylinders. The prototype of the class was presented at the International Railway Congress of 1900 in Paris and was looked at with interest, while not meeting with outstanding success; however, on the long run the asymmetrical design, while simple, proved to be rather awkward, as it was difficult to equalize the work of each side of the locomotive and this caused hunting. The Plancher engine was used again on some Ferrovie dello Stato designs like the FS Class 680 express locomotives and the FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotives, but no further application was approved after the widespread adoption of the superheater.|$|R
50|$|The Class 470 {{locomotive}} was one {{of twelve}} standard designs developed by the FS right after their institution, and was intended for heavy mountain work. The two extreme axles were given a lateral play of 40 mm and the central wheels were without flanges, to allow the locomotive to deal even with sharp curves. The boiler was common {{with that of the}} FS Class 680, as was the four-cylinder compound Plancher engine, in which the two high pressure (HP) and the two low pressure (LP) <b>cylinders</b> were respectively <b>grouped</b> together, with each pair being served by a single piston valve via a crossed port arrangement.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{amplitude}} of fluctuating pressure (Cps) of flow around a single <b>cylinder</b> and a <b>group</b> of three <b>cylinders</b> under two typical wind directions {{have been studied}} by wind tunnel testing. Especially, the relations between amplitude and {{root mean square value}} (Cprms) of fluctuating pressure has been found. The amplitudes of fluctuating pressure are in the range of 3 ~ 4 times of RMS value in most situations. The large fluctualing pressure appeared on the some part of the rear cylinder, which are caused by the inter-ference of <b>group</b> of <b>cylinders.</b> The relations between Cps and Cprms are out of the range sometimes is due to the strong gap flow at small space ratios...|$|R
