40|$|The {{occurrence}} of mechanical accidents in <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{is closely related}} to the operation of frontline workers. Based on the behavior observation method, the paper takes a <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprise</b> as objective to identify the unsafe behavior of the operation workers and its contributing factors. The influences of the different factor on the mechanical operation are investigated by using the analytic hierarchy process. The results show that there are eight kinds of unsafe behaviors of the mechanical operation in the <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The factors that induce the unsafe behaviors include safety knowledge, safety consciousness, emotion, physiological conditions, safety attitude, manager behavior, management system, production task and human environment. Among them, safety attitude, safety consciousness, manager behavior and production task are the most important factors. Therefore, the safety production capacity of the frontline workers in <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprises</b> should be improved through safety education training, manager lead demonstration, enterprise safety culture construction...|$|R

30|$|The {{efficiency}} of technological innovation of China’s <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{is on the}} rise, indicating that the {{efficiency of}} input and output of technological innovation of enterprises is obviously improved. It can help the economic construction of oil companies through the improvement of technological innovation efficiency. However, with the change of time, the efficiency of technological innovation is not balanced and continuous growth trend, indicating that oil companies need {{to work hard to}} improve their technological innovation efficiency. There are many reasons for the high efficiency of technological innovation. For example, the investment in technology research and development is too high with the insufficient output of technological innovation. Enterprises are affected by international oil prices, resulting in unstable economic conditions.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{efficiency}} of technological innovation, scholars {{both at home and}} abroad have conducted research from different levels and angles and have achieved good results. It breaks the limitation of using DEA non-parametric method or parameter method for analysis. More attention has been to focus on the research of DEA–Malmquist decomposition index on the efficiency of total factor technology innovation and improve the accuracy of technology innovation efficiency. Therefore, this study takes a Chinese oil company as the research object, and uses the combination of BCC model and Malmquist index model in DEA to empirically analyze the technological innovation efficiency of Chinese <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprises</b> from both static and dynamic perspectives.|$|R
30|$|According to the result, {{it might}} be {{concluded}} that the investment in R&D personnel input was the most influential parameter, while the non-R&D investment was the least influential parameter. The number of decision-making units is inversely proportional {{to the level of}} efficiency, while the number of parameters is proportional to the level of efficiency. By increasing the number of decision-making units and nailing down the number of precise parameters, the company can improve its TIE. The results reveal that from 2012 to 2015, the degree of dispersion of comprehensive technological innovation efficiency of this <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprise</b> has been decreasing year by year, and it has been developing towards a high concentration trend.|$|R

The inputs of GRNN include the number of punching, the maximum load, the minimum load, the effective stroke, and the computational pump efficiency, while the outputs are the electric power consumption and the oil yield. Experimental results show that there is good overlap between model estimations and unseen data. Then sixty-one sets of optimum parameters are found based on the obtained model. Also, the results show that, under the optimum parameters, more than 5. 34 % oil yield is obtained and more than 3. 75 % of electric power consumption is saved...|$|R

50|$|As {{the name}} implies, Petroleum Center was {{developed}} during the Pennsylvanian oil rush of the mid-19th century. The first well was drilled on the George Washington McClintock Farm in 1860. Soon a small community grew about half way between Oil City and Titusville. George Henry Bissell, James Bishop and others formed the <b>Central</b> <b>Petroleum</b> Company which owned the farm {{in the beginning of}} 1866 when daily production topped 1,000 barrels per day. By the summer of 1866, over 3,000 people called the Centre home with a bank, two churches, a theater, a half-dozen hotels/boarding houses, and stores serving all the needs of the growing community. Bissel & Co. Banking House stimulated economic growth with its direct ties to financial institutions in New York City. President Ulysses S. Grant visited the town in 1871. When a fire devastated the nearby town of Pithole, Pennsylvania, that town's newspaper, the Pithole Daily Record, was relocated to Petroleum Center. The town was founded in 1866 and was essentially abandoned after 1873.|$|R
5000|$|Considered the biggest, most {{efficient}} enterprise in Austro-Hungary, Maryampole {{was built in}} six months and employed 1,000 men. Subsequently, investors from Britain, Belgium, and Germany established companies to develop the {{oil and natural gas}} industries in Galicia. This influx of capital caused the number of <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprises</b> to shrink from 900 to 484 by 1884, and to 285 companies manned by 3,700 workers by 1890. However, the number of oil refineries increased from thirty-one in 1880 to fifty-four in 1904. By 1904, there were thirty boreholes in Borysław of over 1,000 meters. Production increased by 50% between 1905 and 1906 and then trebled between 1906 and 1909 because of unexpected discoveries of vast oil reserves of which many were gushers. By 1909, production reached its peak at 2,076,000 tons or 4% of worldwide production. Often called the [...] "Polish Baku", the oil fields of Borysław and nearby Tustanowice accounted for over 90% of the national oil output of the Austria-Hungary Empire. From 500 residents in the 1860s, Borysław had swollen to 12,000 by 1898. [...] At the turn of the century, Galicia was ranked fourth in the world as an oil producer. This significant increase in oil production also caused a slump in oil prices. A very rapid decrease in oil production in Galicia occurred just before the Balkans conflicts.|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the wave of {{privatization}} of the 1980 s and 1990 s, state ownership of enterprise remains {{a very important part}} of the political economies of both developing and industrialized nations. The conventional wisdom in industrial organization states that public enterprises are inefficient; nevertheless, it says very little about the wide variation among these firms both within and across countries. This dissertation provides a new analytical framework to explain differences in behavior among state-owned enterprises. New insights are possible thanks to the use of theoretical and methodological tools from three different fields: political science, economics, and organizational sociology. State-owned enterprise behavior is conceptualized as having two elements, business efficiency and policy utilization, and it can largely be explained with only three variables: the ideology of the government's ruling coalition, the degree of competition in the business environment, and the level of cohesion of the company's managers. Subsequently, this study applies the framework to explain the puzzling variation in the behavior of the subsidiary companies of the Mexican state-owned <b>petroleum</b> <b>enterprise,</b> Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
