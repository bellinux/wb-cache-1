Dryland forests in the miombo region of Africa cover ~ 3. 6 million km 2 and support nearly 100 million people, and are being incorporated into the UN-REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) efforts to reduce local-scale deforestation and forest degradation. Although reducing deforestation rates is {{the primary goal of}} REDD+, fostering rules and regulations that also promote regeneration in degraded areas will {{play a critical role in}} mitigating net emissions. This study considers the effects of the institutional structure of forest governance and associated land uses on forest regeneration in REDD+ villages operating under community-based forest management in comparison to <b>centrally-managed</b> forests. Seedling density was used as a proxy for recruitment and modeled using a generalized linear model with several environmental parameters to test for the effects of forest governance and land use on tree regeneration. The environmental parameters that best predicted recruitment were fire frequency, tree biomass, and soil clay content. Predicted recruitment was significantly higher in community-managed forests (1. 11 seedlings m 2 - 1) than <b>centrally-managed</b> forests (0. 63 seedlings m 2 - 1), supporting previous studies showing community managed areas have healthier forests. <b>Centrally-managed</b> lands had lower predicted recruitment across all lands uses, with the lowest regeneration on <b>centrally-managed</b> timber land (0. 50 seedlings m 2 - 1). This demonstrates that environmental conditions experienced by seedlings are not only effected by land use type, but also the institutional structure that is governing it. Management policies that reduce fire frequencies and retain threshold levels of biomass for shade and seed sources will help facilitate forest regeneration and maintain ecological goals...|$|E

40|$|Three {{key issues}} have arisen for <b>centrally-managed</b> {{wholesale}} electric power markets in Europe and the United States {{as they attempt}} to handle an increased penetration of variable energy resources. First, rigid definitions for energy and reserve products make it difficult to ensure appropriate compensation for important needed flexibility in start-up times, ramp-rates, power dispatch levels, and duration. Second, participation restrictions hinder the achievement of an even playing field for potential providers of flexible services. Third, reliance on out-of-market compensation for the provision of some valued services encourages strategic manipulation. This study examines the possibility of addressing these three issues through the introduction of standardized energy and reserve contracts with swing (flexibility) in their contractual terms. Concrete examples are used to demonstrate how the trading of these standardized contracts can be supported by linked forward markets in a manner that permits efficient real-time balancing of net load subject to system and reserve-requirement constraints. Comparisons with existing wholesale electric power markets are given, and key policy implications are highlighted...|$|E

This thesis explores some of the powerful implications of this shift: 1) the deepening of a consumer culture; 2) a heightening of socio-economic polarity; and 3) the institutionalization of a new form of subtle, omnipresent, largely consensual control. Three key tools of mall design and private management [...] illusion, exclusion and control [...] are examined in case studies of two malls in downtown Boston: the urban mall as megastructure, Copley Place; and the "festival marketplace", Faneuil Hall Marketplace.

40|$|We {{consider}} a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) live streaming network formed by unreliable nodes. The video is encoded into k MDC (Multiple-Description Coded) and t FEC (Forward Error Correction) streams. To achieve stream continuity notwithstanding node failures, the k + t streams are {{pushed to the}} nodes in parent-disjoint spanning trees. The challenge is how to construct these trees minimizing the worst-case node delay. We address the optimization of the spanning trees through problem analysis and algorithmic design. We first formulate the problem and show that it is NP-hard. We then propose SUN (Streaming with Unreliable Nodes) to achieve high continuity with low delay. For <b>centrally-managed</b> network, we propose SUN-Centralized which is efficient and {{also serves as a}} benchmark for comparison. For large distributed network, we propose SUN-Distributed, a simple and distributed algorithm which continuously reduces delay through overlay adaptation. Through extensive simulation on real Internet topologies and PlanetLab, we show that our algorithms are effective, achieving low delay and high continuity in the presence of unreliable nodes.

40|$|Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are {{attracting}} considerable {{research and}} commercial interest with promising applications {{in a number}} of areas including cooperative vehicle-highways systems, sensor networks and safety systems. However, due to high speed and variable driver behaviour, automotive ad-hoc networks will behave in fundamentally different ways to the most prevalent models in Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) research. Previous work in MANETs usually assumes that the mobile nodes move randomly with an unconstrained mobility model and it is clear that a random mobility model is not adequate to represent the major characteristics of real-world vehicle motions, and may therefore lead to unreliable results. Recent studies of VANETs have attempted to introduce macro- and micro-mobility constraints to model vehicle motions, but they usually focus on modelling the mobility of generic private vehicles. Given the potential for the co-ordinated deployment of network nodes on <b>centrally-managed</b> fleet vehicles, it has become important to model the characteristics of a VANET featuring vehicles of different types, with systematically different behaviour patterns.

40|$|Background Monitoring {{mosquito}} {{population dynamics}} {{is essential to}} guide selection and evaluation of malaria vector control interventions but is typically implemented by mobile, <b>centrally-managed</b> teams who can only visit {{a limited number of}} locations frequently enough to capture longitudinal trends. Community-based (CB) mosquito trapping schemes for parallel, continuous monitoring of multiple locations are therefore required that are practical, affordable, effective, and reliable. Methods A CB surveillance scheme, with a monthly sampling and reporting cycle for capturing malaria vectors, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps (LT) and Ifakara Tent Traps (ITT), were conducted by trained community health workers (CHW) in 14 clusters of households immediately surrounding health facilities in rural south-east Zambia. At the end of the study, a controlled quality assurance (QA) survey was conducted by a centrally supervised expert team using human landing catch (HLC), LT and ITT to evaluate accuracy of the CB trapping data. Active surveillance of malaria parasite infection rates amongst humans was conducted by CHWs in the same clusters to determine the epidemiological relevance of these CB entomological surveys.
