It {{was the last}} of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical problems or poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he brought along a supply of money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps and charts, and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off fatigue and an assortment of homeopathic remedies.|$|E

The technologies considered in the study are wind turbines, solar panels (PV), batteries, EV and the microgrid can have the possibility {{to be connected to}} the grid or not. A sensitivity analysis will be performed in order to <b>check</b> <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technologies taken in to account. Finally, an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal scheduling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system will be presented. Results show that for this type of system batteries aren’t available in any scenario, while electrical vehicles used as batteries can have a very important role for the energy transition. Furthermore it is highlighted the importance to consider as many technologies as possible in order to low total costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system.

40|$|The Iberian Peninsula is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{regions in}} the world with higher {{occurrence}} of cut-off low systems (COL). <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this paper is to analyse <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> events (rainfall and cloudiness layer) associated to COLs in the Iberian Peninsula with tools not previously used: (a) <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new multidecadal COLs database developed by Nieto et al (2005) that permit us to study a 41 years period (1958 - 1998), (b) <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expected <b>weather</b> events (rainfall and cloudiness layer) associated with COLs in a conceptual model (Winkler et al, 2005) and (c) <b>the</b> extensive use <b>of</b> radiosoundings to analyse convective instability in areas inside and close to the COL. Two points of view are used to make the analysis: (1) a source oriented method, when a particular COL is followed and its associated precipitation and cloudiness is analysed over four quadrants in which Iberia was divided and (2) a receptor oriented method, when the precipitation associated to COLs is analysed in given areas, defined by patterns of precipitation. Results reveal that the precipitation and cloudiness patterns associated to COLs in the conceptual model reproduce quite well the main characteristics found over the Iberian Peninsula. The generalized idea that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> COLs produce intense convective rainfall is show to be misleading. Convective phenomena are important usually when <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> COL is located on the Mediterranean region. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rainfall associated with COLs comes from the baroclinic shield; specially in cases located over <b>the</b> west half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iberian Peninsula. It is shown that nearly 30 % of COLs do not induce any rainfall; most of them located in <b>the</b> southern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peninsula, and mainly during autumn. Only 30 % of COLs produce generalized rainfall over the whole analysed territory, being most of them (about 90 %) located over <b>the</b> western half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iberian Peninsula...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric {{water vapour}} plays an {{important}} role in thermodynamic and radiative processes which have an immediate impact on <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> and climate system. However, the processes that determine <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> water vapour remain poorly understood. The complexity arises out of a range of source and sink processes from convective clouds on the kilometre scale to cloud systems associated with motions on scales of a thousand or more kilometres, as well as advection of water vapour as a passive tracer outside of clouds. While large-scale advection of water vapour is well represented in general circulation models, <b>the</b> simulation <b>of</b> small-scale moist processes that are of central importance to <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> clouds are heavily dependent on parameterisations. However, observations as well as processes that determine <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water vapour field are insufficiently explored, leading to constrained parameterisations and therefore contributing significantly to <b>the</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> numerical <b>weather</b> and climate predictions. Hence, a more accurate description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhomogeneous water vapour field based on high-resolution observations is required. This thesis investigates a comprehensive data set of two-dimensional airborne water vapour observations in the free troposphere collected by a Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) in order to gain a height-resolved statistical characterisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhomogeneous water vapour field. Structure functions, i. e., statistical moments up to <b>the</b> fifth order <b>of</b> absolute increments over a range of scales, are investigated and power-law behaviour or scale dependence is identified over horizontal distances from about 5 km to 100 km. <b>The</b> slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power-law fit, the so-called scaling exponent, is found to take different values, depending on whether or not the observations were taken in an air mass where convective clouds were present. These results are consistent with a non-convective regime that is dominated by large-scale advective processes, leading to monofractal scaling, but strong localised input of small-scale variability by convective circulations leading to intermittent fields. Further, the observed power-law statistics are used to evaluate <b>the</b> high-resolution numerical <b>weather</b> prediction model COSMO-DE <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German <b>weather</b> service with regard to the small-scale water vapour variability. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scaling exponent analysis of cloud-free and partly cloudy scenes suggest, that the smallscale variance is modeled quite well in comparison with the lidar observations. By using <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model simulation where data is not limited to a specific flight path, <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> sampling limitation is estimated and is found to be not significant. Further, the simulation provides humidity data in and beneath clouds which allows for an estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> data gaps in the lidar observations due to optically thick clouds. The error is identified to be in a range of only few percents. This thesis demonstrates that airborne DIAL observations are useful to build up a height-resolved statistical characterisation of tropospheric water vapour variability that allows to distinguish physical mechansims that are responsible for the water vapour distribution, to get new insights into stochastic parameterisations and further to use the structure function method as a suitable reality <b>check</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerical <b>weather</b> model COSMO-DE...|$|R
