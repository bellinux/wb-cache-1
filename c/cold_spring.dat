5|$|In early 1941, {{she took}} {{a leave of absence}} from Missouri in hopes of finding a {{position}} elsewhere. She accepted a visiting Professorship at Columbia University, where her former Cornell colleague Marcus Rhoades was a professor. Rhoades also offered to share his research field at <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor on Long Island. In December 1941, she was offered a research position by Milislav Demerec, the newly appointed acting director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Genetics <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor Laboratory; McClintock accepted his invitation despite her qualms and became a permanent member of the faculty.|$|E
5|$|NY108 {{begins at}} Woodbury Road at the Nassau County {{line in the}} {{community}} of <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor. Woodbury Road continues east as CR11, which later becomes Pulaski Road. To the west, Woodbury Road proceeds through Nassau County as unsigned CR12. The road, named Harbor Road, passes {{to the north of the}} Long Island Rail Road's <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor station and runs along the NassauSuffolk county line. The route heads northward through a small residential neighborhood. At the intersection with Stillwell Lane, NY108 southbound crosses into Nassau County, but soon curves away back into Suffolk. Soon after, the two-lane road continues into Trail View State Park, where the route becomes desolate, passing two local ponds. A short distance later, NY108 enters a small region of houses and intersects with Lawrence Hill Road. At the intersection with Lawrence Hill, NY108 terminates; just westward lies at an intersection with NY25A (North Hempstead Turnpike) in <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor.|$|E

5|$|PA371 {{continues}} eastward {{through the}} rural regions, continuing {{its way through}} Mount Pleasant Township. The highway intersects with Township Road 613, where the highway makes a hairpin turn to the south. The route continues to the southeast into a denser portion of Lebanon Township. The route continues for a distance to the east until an intersection with Lebanon Township Road 614 {{in the community of}} <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring.</b> In <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring,</b> PA371 turns to the southeast through deep forests until an intersection with Township Roads 612 and 617. There, the forests break, and the route continues to the southeast. A short distance later, PA371 intersects with PA191 (Hancock Highway) in the community of Rileyville. There, the route begins to follow the alignment of the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike. PA371 continues through rural farmlands until a hairpin turn in the deep forests nearby.|$|E
5|$|Some of McClintock's {{personality}} and scientific achievements {{were referred to}} in Jeffrey Eugenides's 2011 novel The Marriage Plot, which {{tells the story of}} a yeast geneticist named Leonard who suffers from bipolar disorder.

40|$|The actinobacterial {{diversity}} {{was investigated}} in the sediments of five <b>cold</b> <b>springs</b> in Wuli region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using 16 S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. The actinobacterial communities of the studied <b>cold</b> <b>springs</b> were diverse and the obtained actinobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were classified into twelve actinobacterial orders (e. g. Acidimicrobiales, Corynebacteriales, Gaiellales, Geodermatophilales, Jiangellales, Kineosporiales, Micromonosporales, Micrococcales, Nakamurellales, Propionibacteriales, Pseudonocardiales, Streptomycetales) and unclassified Actinobacteria. The actinobacterial composition varied among the investigated <b>cold</b> <b>springs</b> and were significantly correlated (r = 0. 748, P = 0. 021) to environmental variables. The actinobacterial communities in the <b>cold</b> <b>springs</b> were more diverse than other cold habitats on the Tibetan Plateau, and their compositions showed unique geographical distribution characteristics. Statistical analyses showed that biogeographical isolation and unique environmental conditions might be major factors influencing actinobacterial distribution among the investigated <b>cold</b> <b>springs...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Vishnu Purana narrates {{another version}} {{of the origins of}} Badrinath. According to the tradition, Dharam had two sons, Nar and Narayanboth of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their {{religion}} and each of them wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yog Bhadri, Dhyan Badri and Bhavish Badri. They finally found the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>spring</b> behind the Alaknanda River and named it Badri Vishal.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{ground was}} broken on the Kinzua Dam, which would dam the Allegheny River downriver from NY280 {{at a point}} east of Warren, Pennsylvania. The {{structure}} was completed on December13, 1965, leading {{to the creation of}} the Allegheny Reservoir. Much of NY280 was inundated by the new reservoir, as were <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring,</b> Quaker Bridge, and a significant portion of Pennsylvania Route346 (PA346) that ran along the river in Warren County. As a result, new alignments were built for both NY280 and PA346 along the eastern edge of the new reservoir. Construction of NY280's new alignment began in 1965 and was completed by 1968. NY280 now began at the realigned PA346 at the state line and ended at exit18 of the Southern Tier Expressway, which was built between Steamburg and Salamanca during the mid-1960s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and Activator (Ac). She found that the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociator and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E

5|$|She {{was elected}} a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1989. McClintock {{received}} the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society in 1993. She was awarded 14 Honorary Doctor of Science degrees and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. In 1986 she {{was inducted into}} the National Women's Hall of Fame. During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after Evelyn Fox Keller's 1983 biography of her, A Feeling for the Organism, brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications The Discovery and Characterization of Transposable Elements: The Collected Papers of Barbara McClintock was published in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Skip Holtz {{grew up in}} many towns {{while his}} father coached football. After Skip was born in Connecticut, the Holtz family moved to Columbia, South Carolina for two years, as his father worked as an {{assistant}} coach at the University of South Carolina. In 1968, the family moved to Columbus, Ohio after Holtz took a job at Ohio State University. One year later, the Holtz family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia and The College of William & Mary for Lou's first head coaching position. After two seasons, Lou took a head coaching position with the Wolfpack of North Carolina State University. The family lived in Raleigh, North Carolina for four years until Lou accepted a head coaching job for the National Football League's New York Jets. The family lived in <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor, New York for one year, while Lou coached the Jets. After resigning from the Jets, Lou took his family back to the American South when he accepted the head coaching job in Fayetteville, Arkansas, at the University of Arkansas in 1977.

25|$|In 1851, {{under the}} General Railroad Act, the Hicksville and <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Branch Railroad was {{organized}} {{to build a}} line running northeast from Hicksville to <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring.</b> Oliver Charlick was motivated to build the line because of his fear of competition. The railroad was chartered on November 7, 1853, and it was completed to Syosset by July 3, 1854, and the right-of-way to <b>Cold</b> <b>Spring</b> Harbor was graded to White Oak Tree. This line was leased by the LIRR and was successful, tapping the rich farmland of the central North Shore. Syosset got almost all of its ridership from the villages of Oyster Bay, Huntington and Northport.|$|E
