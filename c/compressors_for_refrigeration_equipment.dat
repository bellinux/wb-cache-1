The blend and R- 22 were tested at saturated evaporator temperature conditions of about {minus} 10 F to {minus} 20 F and saturated condenser temperature conditions from about 80 [...] 100 F. The compressor speed was varied such that evaporator (cooling) capacity was held constant at approximately the same value for both refrigerants for each test condition. To maintain equal capacity, results showed the <b>compressor</b> speed <b>for</b> the blend to be at least 53 % greater than that for R- 22. Measured system efficiency with the blend was at least 25 % better than for R- 22 for near equal operating temperature and capacity conditions.

Ideal cycle calculations using the best available property estimates for the blend and the compressor efficiencies observed during the tests also suggested a 10 % improvement for the blend over R- 22 (almost all due to better isentropic efficiency of the compressor with the blend).

Thus, new and emerging refrigeration technologies are being developed to provide more energy efficient and environmentally friendly alternatives to current technologies. Superchilling is a concept where the temperature is reduced 1 e 2 C below the initial freezing point of the product. The small amount of ice formed within the product (10 e 15 %) serves as a heat sink, eliminating the need for ice during storage and transport. In this work, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is applied to the chilling and superchilling salmon cold chains. The superchilling cold chain presents an important improvement compared to the chilled one: diminution of about 18 % of the environmental impacts. This improvement is mainly due to a better utilisation of available volume for transportation. Other solutions to increase the environmental performance (replacement/reduction of packaging material and diminution of electricity consumption during retail display) are also studied and a sensitivity analysis on the electricity grid mix of different countries is performed. © 2016 Published b...|$|R

The operation of the compressor mechanism is directly from the shaft to the mechanism compression components. This mean that when the shaft start to rotate, the mechanism compression components will be rotate together in the same direction and this mechanism is able to compress the refrigerant at all speed of rotation. This is because the design of the vane tip is embedded in the swing slot at the rotating sleeve and the other end side of vane is embedded into the rotor slot. The fabrication of prototype of the compressor needs the concentration because it is involving the high precision of machining and mostly of the tolerance was applied in this design is around 5 m to 20 m.

50|$|Superconducting magnets have {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over resistive electromagnets. They can generate magnetic fields that are up to ten times stronger than those generated by ordinary ferromagnetic-core electromagnets, which are limited to fields of around 2 T. The field is generally more stable, resulting in less noisy measurements. They can be smaller, and the area {{at the center of the}} magnet where the field is created is empty rather than being occupied by an iron core. Most importantly, for large magnets they can consume much less power. In the persistent state (above), the only power the magnet consumes is that needed <b>for</b> any <b>refrigeration</b> <b>equipment</b> to preserve the cryogenic temperature. Higher fields, however can be achieved with special cooled resistive electromagnets, as superconducting coils will enter the normal (non-superconducting) state (see quench, above) at high fields. Steady fields of over 40 T can now be achieved by many institutions around the world usually by combining a Bitter electromagnet with a superconducting magnet (often as an insert).|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{hermetic}} <b>compressors</b> <b>for</b> household <b>refrigeration,</b> one {{important part of the}} overall efficiency of the machine comes from a good thermal efficiency of the discharge manifold. It is desired that the heat generated during the compression process and accumulated by the gas in the discharge chamber does not return to the compression chamber walls. If not, this heat returns to the pump, reducing volumetric efficiency. Current technologies like on/off and variable velocity compressors, normally make use of metallic parts in the discharge chamber, such parts having high thermal conduction coefficients making them less efficient. Linear compressor technology, together with the non-use of oil allows the improvement of the discharge manifold system, increasing the thermal insulation of the heat from discharge chamber to compression chamber, improving efficiency.

40|$|In principle, a {{reciprocating}} compressor stage {{consists of a}} cylinder, the working volume which varies periodically due to a piston moving inside a liner. Latter is sealed by two sets of valves. On the one hand the suction valve for admitting the gas to be compressed {{and on the other}} the discharge valve for allowing the high pressure gas to be delivered to the downstream process. The typical type of valves used within <b>compressors</b> <b>for</b> <b>refrigeration</b> plants are reed valves. The key feature of these mentioned valves - simultaneously affecting both their sealing performance as well as the reliability - is that they are not actuated. They are held close by elastic forces and they open and close automatically, in accordance to the balance of gas pressure forces as well as the previously mentioned elastic ones. The former is primarily characterized by the static pressure difference across the closed valve and the aerodynamic drag brought about by the gas flow impinging onto the sealing reed in a partially or fully open valve. Evidently, a high degree of coupling between the gas flow and the sealing element motion, today referred to as fluid-structure interaction (FSI), can be expected. The reed and the absence of a reliable guide that would provide for the plan-parallel motion give rise to non-parallel impacts with other parts of the valve assembly, leading to dynamic stress effects. This not only complicates the prediction of the reed valve dynamics, it also causes premature sealing element fracture, decreases the compressor efficiency and ultimately leads to unscheduled maintenance shutdowns. Consequently pursuing the optimization of the reed valve movement is a necessity. The measurements of reed valve dynamics as well as their movement in compressors can be performed by commercial proximity sensors, strain gauges or in house developed sensors. Although timing and lift information is available through these methods, other modes of fluttering such as torsional movement are more difficult to be observed. This work tries to address these aspects by providing real operation data obtained in a test rig. An in-depth comparative analysis of three measurement methodologies, represented by an optical, resistive as well as an eddy current sensor system will be carried out regarding their possible adoption in a state-of-the-art refrigeration compressor. Furthermore, the acquired data will be evaluated with respect to its potential application for collecting mentioned torsional movements.

40|$|Comprehensive {{knowledge}} about the heat transfer mechanisms and the temperature field inside hermetic compressors {{is very important for}} the thermal management and thus their performance. A numerical model to predict the temperature field in a hermetic reciprocating <b>compressor</b> <b>for</b> household <b>refrigeration</b> appliances is presented in this work. The model combines a high resolution three-dimensional heat conduction formulation of the compressorâ€™s solid parts, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach for the gas line domain and lumped formulations of the shell gas and the lubrication oil. Heat transfer coefficients are determined by applying CFD to the gas line side and correlations from the literature on the shell gas and oil side, respectively. The valve in the gas line simulation is modelled as a parallel moving flat plate. By means of an iterative loop the temperature field of the solid parts acts as boundary condition for the CFD calculation of the gas line which returns a cycle averaged quantity of heat to the solid parts. Using an iteration method which is based on the temperature deviation between two iteration steps, the total number of iterations and consequently the computational time can be reduced. The loop is continued until a steady-state temperature field is obtained. Calculated temperatures of the solid parts are verified against temperature measurements of a calorimeter test bench. The numerical results show reasonable agreement with the measured data...|$|R
