5|$|Some {{upmarket}} {{lightweight and}} <b>corrosion-resistant</b> tools, such as shovels and flashlights, {{are made of}} titanium or titanium alloys.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{is slowly}} {{oxidized}} by air {{at room temperature}} and is considered <b>corrosion-resistant.</b> Historically, {{it has been used}} for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for <b>corrosion-resistant</b> nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium's large {{neutron capture}} {{cross-section}} {{makes it a}} good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants, {{but at the same}} time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent <b>corrosion-resistant</b> zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Iridium is {{the most}} <b>corrosion-resistant</b> metal known: it is not {{attacked}} by almost any acid, aqua regia, molten metals, or silicates at high temperatures. It can, however, be attacked by some molten salts, such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, as well as oxygen and the halogens (particularly fluorine) at higher temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steels {{contain a}} minimum of 11% chromium, often {{combined}} with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some stainless steels, such as the ferritic stainless steels are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are nonmagnetic. <b>Corrosion-resistant</b> steels are abbreviated as CRES.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room {{temperature}} for extended periods. Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is <b>corrosion-resistant,</b> exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|Iridium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is generally credited {{with being the}} second densest element (after osmium). It {{is also the most}} <b>corrosion-resistant</b> metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000°C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} for manganese is in aluminum alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased {{resistance to corrosion}} through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion. The <b>corrosion-resistant</b> aluminium alloys 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most beverage cans. Before year 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.|$|E
5|$|Uses {{for regular}} glass fiber include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, {{electrical}} insulation, sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat- and <b>corrosion-resistant</b> fabrics. It {{is also used}} to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, pole vault poles, arrows, bows and crossbows, translucent roofing panels, automobile bodies, hockey sticks, surfboards, boat hulls, and paper honeycomb. It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as <b>corrosion-resistant</b> coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a <b>corrosion-resistant</b> plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and <b>corrosion-resistant</b> properties in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is <b>corrosion-resistant</b> and {{chemically}} similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, its {{name comes from}} Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly <b>corrosion-resistant.</b> It {{is part of the}} refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum. Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{metal and}} its alloys {{have a wide}} range of applications, where the {{corrosion}} resistance, the heat stability and the low density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of <b>corrosion-resistant</b> hafnium and zirconium has been in nuclear reactors. Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors, because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and was heading towards Louisiana. For precaution, Six Flags closed down the New Orleans theme park during mid-season {{to prepare for}} the storm. Due to {{substantial}} flooding, many of the park's rides were damaged beyond repair causing the park to remain closed until the floods retrieved. Many of the park rides were destroyed as the park's drainage system failed and were submerged in water {{for a long period of}} time, long after the hurricane. Anything found in the park still in good use was removed and moved to other parks in the company as Six Flags had no plans on reopening the theme park. Batman: The Ride survived, mainly because of its elevated station and <b>corrosion-resistant</b> support structure, which caused it to make it through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. <b>Corrosion-resistant</b> zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main <b>corrosion-resistant</b> metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon <b>corrosion-resistant</b> {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} <b>corrosion-resistant</b> metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E
25|$|Although {{glass is}} {{generally}} <b>corrosion-resistant</b> and more corrosion resistant than other materials, it still can be corroded. The materials {{that make up}} a particular glass composition has an effect on how quickly the glass corrodes. A glass containing a high proportion of alkalis or alkali earths is less <b>corrosion-resistant</b> than other kinds of glasses.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} {{manufacturer}} makes a yellow receptacle, which identifies it as <b>corrosion-resistant.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their antifouling benefits, copper alloys have strong structural and <b>corrosion-resistant</b> properties in marine environments.|$|E
25|$|Engines showing {{excessive}} corrosion {{are pulled}} from service and repaired {{in a shop}} visit, more <b>corrosion-resistant</b> blades have been developed and are rolled-out.|$|E
25|$|It {{includes}} a redesigned and upgraded interior, Honeywell Primus Epic 2.0 avionics, a stern thruster, new Sumitomo <b>corrosion-resistant</b> landing gear, a hydraulic electrically steerable nose gear, and MT five-blade composite propellers and Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-135As.|$|E
25|$|Salt water causes {{corrosion}} {{in metal}} parts. It {{can be difficult}} to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water. The use of <b>corrosion-resistant</b> materials such as stainless steels, high-nickel alloys, copper-nickel alloys, nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce, or eliminate, corrosion damage.|$|E
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} large number of lightweight, <b>corrosion-resistant</b> {{synthetic}} materials in its design; the receiver housing, stock, trigger group (including the fire control selector and firing mechanism parts), magazine well, handguard and carry handle are all made of a carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide. The receiver has an integrated steel barrel trunnion (with locking recesses) and a nylon 66 steel reinforced receiver.|$|E
25|$|French chemist Henri Moissan, {{formerly}} one of Frémy's students, {{continued the}} search. After trying many different approaches, he built on Frémy and Gore's earlier attempts by combining potassium bifluoride and hydrogen fluoride. The resultant solution conducted electricity. Moissan also constructed especially <b>corrosion-resistant</b> equipment: containers crafted from {{a mixture of}} platinum and iridium (more chemically resistant than pure platinum) with fluorite stoppers.|$|E
25|$|The hook {{determines the}} basic {{size and shape}} of each fly and is {{generally}} an important part of any fly pattern description. Hooks come {{in a wide range of}} size, shape, length and weight, and must be selected to complement the pattern being tied and the method by which it will be fished. Additionally, flies constructed for use in salt water are typically tied on <b>corrosion-resistant</b> hooks.|$|E
25|$|Cladding is {{the outer}} {{layer of the}} fuel rods, {{standing}} between the coolant and the nuclear fuel. It is made of a <b>corrosion-resistant</b> material with low absorption cross section for thermal neutrons, usually Zircaloy or steel in modern constructions, or magnesium with small amount of aluminium and other metals for the now-obsolete Magnox reactors. Cladding prevents radioactive fission fragments from escaping the fuel into the coolant and contaminating it.|$|E
25|$|Store H3PO4 in {{containers}} made of <b>corrosion-resistant</b> materials. Sigma-Aldrich recommends storing phosphoric acid in a stainless-steel container with a resistant inner lining. Containers {{should always be}} stored upright to avoid leaks. Do not store in incompatible metals such as aluminium, the alloys of aluminium, and carbon steel. Store away from all incompatible chemicals and compounds. Keep away from food and foodstuffs. Ensure any solid material is kept dry. Do not reuse containers, even if they appear clean and empty.|$|E
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of <b>corrosion-resistant</b> reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly <b>corrosion-resistant</b> features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar. Reference ASTM standard specifications A1035/A1035M Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Low-carbon, Chromium, Steel Bars for Concrete Reinforcement, A767 Standard Specification for Hot Dip Galvanised Reinforcing Bars, A775 Standard Specification for Epoxy Coated Steel Reinforcing Bars and A955 Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Stainless Bars for Concrete Reinforcement.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary hooks are {{manufactured}} from either high-carbon steel, steel alloyed with Vanadium, or stainless steel, depending on application. Most quality fish hooks {{are covered with}} some form of <b>corrosion-resistant</b> surface coating. Corrosion resistance is required not only when hooks are used, especially in saltwater, but while they are stored. Additionally, coatings are applied to color and/or provide aesthetic value to the hook. At a minimum, hooks designed for freshwater use are coated with a clear lacquer, but hooks are also coated with gold, nickel, Teflon, tin and different colors.|$|E
25|$|As with SOFCs, MCFC {{disadvantages}} include slow start-up {{times because}} of their high operating temperature. This makes MCFC systems not suitable for mobile applications, and this technology {{will most likely be}} used for stationary fuel cell purposes. The main challenge of MCFC technology is the cells' short life span. The high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode. These factors accelerate the degradation of MCFC components, decreasing the durability and cell life. Researchers are addressing this problem by exploring <b>corrosion-resistant</b> materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance.|$|E
25|$|Plating, painting, and the {{application}} of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of <b>corrosion-resistant</b> material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise to plate with active metal such as zinc or cadmium.|$|E
25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the sand control screen) and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded <b>corrosion-resistant</b> wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be swaged until they contact the wellbore wall.|$|E
