40|$|<b>Creasing</b> is {{a process}} which indents a section of {{corrugated}} board along fold lines to facilitate a neat fold. The most common failure site in a box made out of corrugated board is at the folds, where the stiffness is reduced by the <b>creasing</b> operation. <b>Crease</b> depth is an important parameter to be controlled. If the <b>crease</b> is too shallow, the section will crack during folding due to excessive strain on the outer liner. On the other hand, if the <b>crease</b> is too deep, the board may crack during the <b>creasing</b> operation itself or it may fail during handling due to excessive reduction in local strength along the fold line. A {{review of the literature}} reveals that only a limited amount of research has been carried out on experimental <b>creasing</b> of corrugated boards and comparison with numerical analyses. However, modelling of paper for corrugated board has been successfully done using Hill's plasticity model. In this work, experimental investigations on <b>creasing</b> of corrugated paperboard are carried out. These are complemented by finite element simulations of the <b>creasing</b> process. The simulations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The findings of the work done are helpful in understanding the mechanics of <b>creasing</b> more clearly and in arriving at an appropriate <b>crease</b> depth in order to reduce cracking of corrugated board during the <b>creasing</b> process...|$|R

5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or <b>creases</b> drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E

500|$|Kawasaki's theorem, {{applied to}} each of the {{vertices}} of an arbitrary <b>crease</b> pattern, determines whether the <b>crease</b> pattern is locally flat-foldable, meaning that the part of the <b>crease</b> pattern near the vertex can be flat-folded. However, there exist <b>crease</b> patterns that are locally flat-foldable but that have no global flat folding that works for the whole <b>crease</b> pattern at once. [...] conjectured that global flat-foldability could be tested by checking Kawasaki's theorem at each vertex of a <b>crease</b> pattern, and then also testing bipartiteness of an undirected graph associated with the <b>crease</b> pattern. However, this conjecture was disproven by , who showed that Hull's conditions are not sufficient. More strongly, Bern and Hayes showed that the problem of testing global flat-foldability is NP-complete.|$|R

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback guitarfish is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout is short and broad, with a blunt tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and gently arched; there are a pair of <b>creases</b> running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly trapezoidal area. The lower lip is inscribed by a deep furrow that wraps around the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to blunt, and are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears <b>creases</b> and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back, along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|E

40|$|Complete distal biceps tendon {{ruptures}} require prompt surgical {{management for}} optimal functional and aesthetic outcome. The need exists for a {{valid and reliable}} diagnostic tool to expedite surgical referral. We hypothesized complete distal biceps tendon ruptures result in an objectively measurable anatomic landmark (the distance between the antecubital <b>crease</b> of the elbow and the cusp of distal descent of the biceps muscle, or the biceps <b>crease</b> interval), {{as a result of}} proximal retraction of the musculotendinous complex. We established normal biceps <b>crease</b> interval values and biceps <b>crease</b> ratios between dominant and nondominant arms in 80 men with no history of biceps injury (average age, 43  years). The mean (± standard deviation) biceps <b>crease</b> interval for dominant and nondominant arms was 4. 8  ±  0. 6  cm. The mean biceps <b>crease</b> ratio was 1. 0  ±  0. 1. We measured the biceps <b>crease</b> interval and biceps <b>crease</b> ratio on 29 consecutive patients presenting with a possible complete distal biceps tendon rupture. Using a diagnostic threshold of a biceps <b>crease</b> interval greater than 6. 0  cm or biceps <b>crease</b> ratio greater than 1. 2, the biceps <b>crease</b> interval test had a sensitivity of 96 % and a diagnostic accuracy of 93 % for identifying complete distal biceps tendon ruptures, making it a valid and reliable tool for clinicians to identify cases requiring urgent surgical referral...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} <b>creasing</b> {{device to}} capture the most important properties of a commercial rotary <b>creasing</b> tool was designed. Finite element analysis of the <b>creasing</b> of a multiply paperboard in the laboratory <b>crease</b> device was presented. The multiply paperboard was modeled as a multilayered structure with cohesive softening interface model connecting the paperboard plies. The paperboard plies were modeled by an anisotropic elastic–plastic material model. The purpose of {{the analysis of the}} laboratory <b>creasing</b> device was to present material models that represent paperboard, and to investigate how well the analysis captured the multiply paperboard behavior during laboratory <b>creasing.</b> And to increase the understanding of what multiply paperboard properties that influence the laboratory <b>crease</b> operation. The result of the simulations showed very good correlations with the experimental obtained results. The results indicated that the paperboard properties that have the most influence is the out-of-plane shear, out-of-plane compression and the friction between the laboratory <b>creasing</b> device and the paperboard...|$|R

25|$|Four <b>creases</b> (one popping crease, one bowling crease, and two return <b>creases)</b> {{are drawn}} {{at each end}} of the pitch, around the two sets of stumps. The batsmen {{generally}} play in and run between the areas defined by the <b>creases</b> {{at each end of}} the pitch. The bowling <b>creases</b> lie 22 yards (66 feet or 20.12 m) away, and marks the other end of the pitch. For the fielding side, the crease defines whether there is a no ball because a fielder has encroached on the pitch or the wicket-keeper has moved in front of the wicket before he is permitted to do so. In addition, historically part of the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling crease to avoid a delivery being a no ball. This rule was replaced by a requirement that part of the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride must fall behind the popping crease (see below).|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{combinatorial}} model of paperfolding {{for the purposes}} of enumeration. A planar embedding of a graph is called a <b>crease</b> pattern if it represents the <b>crease</b> lines needed to fold a piece of paper into something. A flat fold is a <b>crease</b> pattern which lies flat when folded, i. e. can be pressed in a book without crumpling. Given a <b>crease</b> pattern C =(V,E),amountain-valley (MV) assignment is a function f: E →{M,V} which indicates which <b>crease</b> lines are convex and which are concave, respectively. A MV assignment is valid if it doesn’t force the paper to self-intersect when folded. We examine the problem of counting the number of valid MV assignments for a given <b>crease</b> pattern. In particular we develop recursive functions that count the number of valid MV assignments for flat vertex folds, <b>crease</b> patterns with only one vertex in the interior of the paper.
