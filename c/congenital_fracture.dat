40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{spontaneous}} intrauterine ping-pong fractures {{are reported in}} newborns delivered by cesarean section. Skull fractures occurred with no evidence of extrinsic trauma or cephalopelvic disproportion. Subsequent clinical follow-up at 6 and 12 months revealed normal skull reshaping and growth, with no associated neurological deficits. Spontaneous intrauterine ping-pong fractures in newborns delivered by cesarean section is a distinctly rare condition. These 2 cases demonstrate that, even without complicated spontaneous vaginal delivery or history of external trauma, <b>congenital</b> ping-pong <b>fracture</b> of the skull can occur.

40|$|Zulma S Tovar-Spinoza, Peter D KimDepartment of Neurosurgery, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse NYAbstract: There {{are limited}} reports of {{neonatal}} depressed skull fractures {{in the absence}} of any known trauma or obvious risk factors. Here we describe a male neonate with a significant frontal nontraumatic depressed fracture, his course of treatment, and a literature review. A male neonate was attended for a significant <b>congenital</b> depressed skull <b>fracture</b> in the left frontal bone. He was born full term after an uncomplicated delivery to a multiparous mother who was a human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) -positive immigrant from sub-Saharan Africa. The pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated. There was no history of trauma to the mother during the pregnancy or delivery. Ultrasonography had been unremarkable. No other abnormalities were noted. The patient was brought to the operating room at the age of 13 days for elevation of his fracture due to its nonreducible nature. A small linear incision was made just posterior to the coronal suture. The dura mater was stripped and a combination of Penfield and periostial elevators was used to elevate the depressed fracture. Nontraumatic depressed skull fractures are uncommon in neonates. The cause of this entity has not been identified, and many theories about its origin have been proposed. Treatment can be either surgical or conservative. Keywords: neonatal, <b>congenital,</b> depressed <b>fracture,</b> spontaneous, nontraumati...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{infantile}} spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA type I, Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) has generally been accepted as an autosomal recessive disorder. However, several investigators have noted a slightly increased male to female ratio. We describe here a family with two affected male sibs who had a form of acute infantile SMA with <b>congenital</b> bone <b>fractures,</b> whose parents were first cousins. Pedigree analysis strongly suggested autosomal recessive inheritance, but X linked recessive inheritance could not be ruled out. In view of the heterogeneity of the SMAs, and the distinct clinical features found in our patients, we suggest that their infantile SMA might well be a distinct entity. We suggest that SMA I with congenital contractures and bone fractures appears to be a recognisable disorder that can be distinguished from the more common classic form of SMA I...|$|R

We report on recessive loss-of-function mutations in two genes (TRIP 4 and ASCC 1) that encode subunits {{of the nuclear}} activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC- 1) complex. We used autozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing to search for pathogenic mutations in four families. Affected individuals presented with prenatal-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), multiple congenital contractures (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita), respiratory distress, and <b>congenital</b> bone <b>fractures.</b> We identified homozygous and compound-heterozygous nonsense and frameshift TRIP 4 and ASCC 1 mutations {{that led to a}} truncation or the entire absence of the respective proteins and cosegregated with the disease phenotype. Trip 4 and Ascc 1 have identical expression patterns in 17. 5 -day-old mouse embryos with high expression levels in the spinal cord, brain, paraspinal ganglia, thyroid, and submandibular glands. Antisense morpholino-mediated knockdown of either trip 4 or ascc 1 in zebrafish disrupted the highly patterned and coordinated process of α-motoneuron outgrowth and formation of myotomes and neuromuscular junctions and led to a swimming defect in the larvae. Immunoprecipitation of the ASC- 1 complex consistently copurified cysteine and glycine rich protein 1 (CSRP 1), a transcriptional cofactor, which is known to be involved in spinal cord regeneration upon injury in adult zebrafish. ASCC 1 mutant fibroblasts downregulated genes associated with neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and pathfinding (SERPINF 1, DAB 1, SEMA 3 D, SEMA 3 A), as well as with bone development (TNFRSF 11 B, RASSF 2, STC 1).

40|$|Recurrent {{dislocation}} of the {{hip joint}} {{in the absence of}} a predisposing acetabular defect is rare: so far as we have been able to determine, it has been reported in only eleven adults and eleven children.

The impact resulted in an open fracture of the right clavicle and a right pulmonary contusion but no pneumothorax. Thorough examination in the emergency department revealed a non-palpable right radial artery pulse and a strong, palpable right ulnar artery pulse. The patient had no detectable neurologic deficit and his right hand was warm and well perfused. Right upper extremity angiography was performed to evaluate for possible vascular injury. Arteriography revealed normal subclavian, axillary and brachial arteries proximally. In the forearm (Panel A), there was a normal ulnar artery (black arrow), a diminutive inteross-eous artery (white arrow), and a congenitally absent right radial artery with no evidence of thrombosis or embolism.

The 83. 9 % rate of posterior presentation and the 90 % rate of males confirmed the hypothesis of hypomobility of calves affected by congenital articular rigidity. The success rate after appropriate treatment was 82. 8 %. This study also confirmed the predisposition of Belgian Blue calves to tibial fractures (52 %).

40|$|Background: Globally, {{the major}} causes of {{neonatal}} deaths are birth asphyxia, prematurity and severe infections. Little {{attention is paid}} to deaths contributed by surgically amenable conditions. This study was undertaken to determine the burden and types of surgical problems encountered in the neonatal period, their outcome and challenges encountered. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective study. The case notes of all neonates admitted into the newborn unit of our centre between April 2002 and March 2010 with surgical conditions were retrieved and the following information extracted: Sex, diagnosis, age at presentation, surgical intervention and outcome. Results: Out of 7, 401 neonates admitted within the study period, 460 (6. 2 %) had a surgical condition. Of the 1, 657 babies that died within the same period, 196 (11. 8 %) of them were those with surgical conditions. Congenital abnormalities accounted for 408 (88. 7 %) of all the surgical cases. Intestinal obstruction 129 (31. 6 %), neural tube defects 101 (24. 8 %) and anterior abdominal wall defect 58 (14. 2 %) were the commonest <b>congenital</b> abnormalities, while <b>fracture</b> of the long bones following birth trauma 15 (28. 8 %) and perforated NEC 14 (26. 9 %) were the commonest acquired conditions. Surgery was performed in 166 (36. 1 %) and 98 (59 %) had postoperative complications. Significantly, more deaths occurred in preterms than in term babies (P = 0. 003) and in those delivered outside the hospital than in in-born babies (P = 0. 02). The major cause of death was infection in 92 (47 %). Conclusion: Neonatal surgical conditions contributed significantly to both neonatal admissions and overall neonatal mortality and thus highlights the need for investments in newborn surgical care in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Case Description: A 2. 870 g female infant {{was born}} at 38 weeks via vaginal {{delivery}} in occipito-posterior position. Because of a prolonged second stage of labour and recurrent late decelerations indicating foetal distress, the delivery was vacuum-assisted with a cup placed {{on the right side}} of the forehead. At birth, a depression of the left parietal skull was noted, measuring approximately 5 mm in depth and 40 mm in diameter. The depression had a bony base and no accompanying oedema or hematoma. Neurologic and physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. A thorough review of the perinatal history could not identify a causal trauma. Radiography of the maternal pelvis showed no abnormalities. An X-ray of the skull was performed to evaluate the depression, indicating a ping-pong fracture. Computed tomography (CT) scan additionally demonstrated a small zone of contusion below the depression. Surgical elevation was opted because of this underlying contusion. A follow-up CT-scan was performed the day after surgery, which showed complete resolution of the depression and a small subarachnoid haemorrhage. The child was discharged home on day 7 with a normal neurological examination. Discussion: A ping-pong fracture is a type of fracture seen only in neonates and young infants. It consists of a depression of the skull without cortical break. These depressed skull fractures can either be congenital or acquired. Congenital depressions of the neonatal skull unrelated to trauma are rare and often puzzling in origin. They are referred to as “faulty fetal packing”, since they are caused by external pressure in utero, e. g. by a bony prominence of the maternal pelvis or spine. Non-traumatic, <b>congenital</b> depression <b>fractures</b> are the result of moulding of the soft foetal skull during its intra-uterine stay. Intra-cranial abnormalities are therefore rare. Acquired depressed skull fractures are more common and are usually caused by birth trauma due to obstetric manoeuvres or instrumental delivery. The acquired type of depressed fracture carries a higher risk of intra-cranial lesions, because of the sudden and important force applied to the skull. Management of ping-pong fractures in newborns is based on careful history taking and thorough clinical examination. A difficult delivery, e. g. with need for instrumentation, is more likely to cause traumatic ping-pong fractures and must always alert the clinician with respect to possible intra-cranial damage. Surgical lifting of the bone must be considered and was therefore applied in this case. A trouble-free birth without perinatal history for trauma and a newborn without neurological symptoms, is more likely a case of “faulty fetal packing”. This can be treated conservatively, as full and spontaneous resolution within the first few months of life has been described. Surgical correction is necessary when spontaneous resolution has not occurred by 6 months of age or when neurological symptoms appear...|$|R
40|$|Tissue Engineering is a {{scientific}} discipline {{that aims to}} regenerate tissues and organs that are diseased, lost or congenitally absent. It encompasses the use of suitable synthetic equivalents of native extracellular matrix {{that may or may}} not be supplemented with cells or relevant growth factors. Such scaffolds are designed to reside at the site of implantation for a variable period of time during which they induce the regeneration of native tissue. During this time, they also provide a template for new cells to attach, infiltrate, differentiate into appropriate phenotype and eventually restore function of the concerned tissue. Among the factors that affect the outcome are the composition of scaffold, methods of fabrication, bulk properties of the scaffold and topography and architecture at the cellular level. Bone is unique in the body in that it is one of the few tissues capable of complete regeneration even in adults, as seen during fracture healing. However, certain conditions (non-union of <b>fractures,</b> <b>congenital</b> and acquired bone deficiencies) exist in which the regenerative capacities of bone are exceeded and appropriate intervention becomes necessary. Current treatment options include autologous bone grafts harvested from iliac crest or de-cellularized allografts or synthetic substitutes made from metals, ceramics and polymers. However these options have serious limitations: while autografts are limited in supply, necessitate second surgery and show inadequate vascularization, allografts can transmit viral infections. Metals, ceramics and polymers are in essence structural replacements without performing any biological function. Other problems associated with these synthetic materials include adverse immune reactions, corrosion, stress-shielding and secondary fractures due to inadequate osseo-integration. Bone tissue engineering is a specialized field of research that provides an alternative strategy to repair bone defects by exploiting the advances in engineering and better understanding of bone biology. Scaffold-based tissue engineering approach is a promising field that involves implantation of a biomaterial that is specifically matched in terms of biological and material properties to the tissue it replaces. This study explores the feasibility of using electrospinning as a potential fabrication strategy for bone tissue engineering applications, more specifically intended for cleft palate repair. This model represents a congenital deformity that affects both hard and soft tissues and presents unique challenges and opportunities. Among the challenges are: the need for the implant allow growth of the most complex areas of the facial skeleton, integrate and grow with the patient through adolescence, the ability of the implant to not interfere with vital functions including breathing and feeding. Further the implant should provide a flexible matrix that can effectively support erupting teeth. In spite of these extreme demands, maxilla is a non load-bearing membranous bone, a favorable consideration from materials engineering perspective. The present study is organized into three independent sections. The first section investigates developing strategies intended to improve the material properties of electrospun bone scaffold. Bone is composed of a high volume fraction (50 %) of inorganic hydroxyapatite nanocrystals that is closely associated with collagen. The dispersal of brittle mineral is critical in not only strengthening the bone in compression but also contributes to the osteoconductivity of the matrix. Since loading of mineral in a bone scaffold is a serious limitation, we attempted to achieve improved loading of bone mineral by dual mineralization approach. We first incorporated nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nHA) directly into the scaffold by adding it to the electrospinning polymer solution. The second step involves inducing biomimetic mineralization of electrospun scaffolds by incubating them in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 2 weeks. The hypothesis was that the nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite seeded during electrospinning would act as sites for nucleation and further crystal growth when incubated in solution supersaturated with respect to calcium and phosphate ions. We tested this approach in two synthetic, biocompatible polymers-polydioxanone and poly (lactide: glycolide) and four formulations of SBF with differential loading of nHA (0 - 50 % by wt. of polymer). A modified Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining that specifically binds to calcium was developed that allowed us to quantify the mineral content of 3 D scaffold with great accuracy. Results indicated a unique combination of factors: PDO scaffolds containing 50 % nHA incubated in 1 x revised-SBF incubated under static conditions gave maximum mineralization over a period of two weeks. We then sought to exploit these findings to engineer a stiffer scaffold by stacking multiple layers together and cold welding them under high pressure. Electrospun scaffolds (1, 2 or 4 layered stacks) were either compressed before or after mineralizing treatment with SBF. After two weeks, scaffolds were analyzed for total mineral content and stiffness by uniaxial tensile testing. Results indicated while compression of multiple layers significantly increases the stiffness of scaffolds, it also had lower levels of mineralization partly due to increased density of fibers and loss of surface area due to fiber welding. However this can be offset to a reasonable degree by increasing the number of stacks and hence this strategy can be successfully adopted to improve the mechanical properties of electrospun scaffolds. The second section introduces a novel infrared imaging technique to quantify and characterize the biological activity of biomaterials, based on cell adhesion. Cells attach to the surface by the formation of focal contacts where multiple proteins including vinculin and talin assemble to signal critical processes like cell survival, migration, proliferation and differentiation. After allowing MG- 63 osteoblasts to adhere to 2 D biomaterial surface coated with extracellular matrix proteins (collagen, gelatin, fibronectin) cells were fixed and probed with antibodies for vinculin and talin. Secondary antibodies, tagged with infrared-sensitive fluorescent dyes, were used to quantify the molecules of interest. In addition, the kinetics of focal contact formation in these different substrates was followed. Successful quantification of focal contacts were made and further research revealed phosphorylation of vinculin at pY- 822 as one potential mechanism for recruitment of vinculin to focal contacts. Hence it could represent a subset of vinculin and might serve as a specific molecular marker for focal contacts. As an extension, we evaluated the possibility of using such an assay to quantify 3 D electrospun tissue engineering scaffolds. We fabricated scaffolds of graded biological activity by electrospinning blends of polydioxanone and collagen in different ratios. Vinculin and talin expressed by MG- 63 cultured on these scaffolds for 24 hours were quantified in a similar manner. Results indicate that while talin does not show a significant difference in expression among different scaffolds, vinculin showed a positive correlation with increasing biological activity of scaffolds. In conclusion, we have identified vinculin as a reliable marker of focal contacts in 3 D scaffolds while phosphovinculin (pY- 822) was more specific to focal contacts in coated 2 D substrates. In both instances, infrared imaging proved to be reliable in study of focal contacts. 	The third section aims to make the bone scaffolds osteoinductive- a property of a material to induce new bone formation even when implanted in subcutaneous and intramuscular heterotopic sites. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are potent cytokines that can induce migration, proliferation and differentiation of stem cells along osteoblastic lineage. The therapeutic efficacy of BMPs in the treatment of severe bone defects has been identified and is currently FDA approved for specific orthopedic applications. BMPs are clinically administered in a buffer form that not only makes the treatment expensive but less effective. Suitable delivery systems for BMP delivery have been an intense area of investigation. We rationalized electrospinning as a strategy to incorporate BMP within the scaffold and that would enable controlled release when implanted. One of the drawbacks of using electrospinning to deliver bioactive molecules is the potential denaturing effect and eventual loss of activity of BMPs. The final section of this dissertation tries to develop sensitive and relevant assays that could answer intriguing questions about solvent-protein interaction. We chose to use the BMP- 2 / 7 heterodimer as the osteoinductive molecule of choice because of its superior potency compared to homodimer counterparts. We characterized the detection and quantification of BMP- 2 / 7 using a slot blot technique. Further, we used a novel cell line (C 2 C 12 BRA) to test the retention of activity of BMP- 2 / 7 that has been exposed to organic solvents. Results indicate significant loss of activity when BMPs are exposed to organic solvents but complete recovery was possible by diluting the solvent with an aqueous buffer...|$|R
