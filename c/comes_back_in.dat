5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles {{over the course of}} the year, is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy bursts in after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore has returned to the school and accompanied by Dobby, revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it was Tom Riddle’s, it had been in the Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees Dobby from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for Dobby to jump in and save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E

25|$|Surgery is {{normally}} reserved for complications of Crohn's disease or when disease that resists treatment with drugs {{is confined to}} one location that can be removed. Surgery {{is often used to}} manage complications of Crohn's disease, including fistulae, small bowel obstruction, colon cancer, small intestine cancer and fibrostenotic strictures, when strictureplasty (expansion of the stricture) is sometimes performed. Otherwise, and for other complications, resection and anastomosis – the removal of the affected section of intestine and the rejoining of the healthy sections – is the surgery usually performed for Crohn's disease (e.g., ileocolonic resection). None of these surgeries cure or eliminate Crohn's disease, as the disease eventually <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> healthy segments of the intestine, although when Crohn's disease recurs after surgery, it usually comes back {{at the site of the}} surgery.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were largely}} {{positive}} in their {{reviews of the}} episode. The Huffington Post Michael Pascua called [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] a [...] "hit and miss" [...] episode, criticizing the slang dialogue by saying it [...] "sounded like it came from an MTV drama", but praising the installment's [...] "character driven development". Pascua was positive {{on the development of}} Tahir's character, writing: [...] "I hope he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a later episode just to remind these people about patience and hope." [...] TV Fanatic Steve Marsi gave a positive review of the episode, saying it [...] "won [...] over", and also praising Tahir's character.

In an interview with IGN, Clive Russell stated he was hopeful {{to return to the}} role saying [...] "I'd hoped that he'd come back because he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the books again. But they're not doing the books -- there is no book to do it from. I'd hoped that would happen. I don't think I was surprised it would happen because they bring back all kinds of people at all kinds of times. But it was good to go back there, I must say." ...|$|E

500|$|Nageswara Rao {{played the}} role of a 90-year-old man. His {{character}} enters the film just before the interval and remains until {{the very end of the}} film. All the members of the principal cast except Nageswara Rao played dual roles in the film. Nagarjuna said in an interview that he would be seen in the 1920s, 1980s and 2013 and would play a zamindar in 1920. Saran revealed that every character in the film would have a specific aspect; Nagarjuna's character loves cars. Regarding her role, Saran said that she would be seen as a poor but content farmer in the flashback sequences and a doctor in the present day. She added [...] "My character goes back to 1930s and <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the present era. I can't tell how it happens though. It's a fun character and you will find me stammering a lot. Suddenly, I'm talking normally and suddenly I start stammering, that's how you understand my character." [...] She added that apart from Nagarjuna, she has more scenes with Nageswara Rao and only a couple of scenes with Chaitanya in the film.|$|E
500|$|... io9 {{felt the}} {{character}} of Danes to be a cross between Freddy Krueger and Jesus. Commenting on the Christ comparison, Pullman felt that his character {{was sort of the}} [...] "doppelganger of Jesus or something." [...] He stated of Danes: [...] "It's like he's been out in the desert, and he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in,</b> and there is a certain kind of way in which he still has pride." [...] SFX described Oswald's journey as one from a Hannibal Lecter type character to a Billy Graham or messianic figure. Pullman observed that Oswald's failure to die [...] "becomes the pivot for a whole world that has changed"; feeling that his character was an intelligent one who knows he can provide a message people want to hear. Discussing Oswald's fall from grace, series writer Jane Espenson explains that [...] "humanity doesn't seize on heroes for the long–term", and that Oswald's descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic. Though Oswald dies helping the Torchwood team, Espenson remarked that [...] "we didn't want to outright redeem this horrible, horrible man" [...] commenting that his death is intended as [...] "redemption and comeuppance both." [...] The Independents Neela Debnath observed that whilst {{the character of}} Danes had [...] "become likeable in an odd-sort of way" [...] his last scenes [...] "reiterated just how despicable he was" [...] and that it was the right time for him to depart the cast.|$|E

2500|$|In each [...] "Adventures" [...] segment {{in which}} Bill appears, he usually {{attempts}} {{to do something}} of an outdoors nature, such as backpacking, building something, chopping down a tree, or playing a sport. Each of his actions are basically slapstick comedy routines—for example, when he swings an axe, it flies {{out of his hands}} and smashes into another character or Red's Possum Van. [...] In what has become a classic occurrence, Bill often manages to knock {{one or both of the}} side mirrors off the van. He can also store large tools and miscellaneous items in his overalls, and pull them out on demand. Many segments show Bill getting hurt somehow, but apparently not seriously or permanently. (One segment in particular ends with Bill's arms crushed and flattened in a grape press.) There is generally no continuity from one [...] "Adventures" [...] segment to the next, and Bill <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the following episode good as new.|$|E

2500|$|Sputnik Music {{said about}} the song {{in a review of}} The Downward Spiral, declaring that [...] "'Mr. Self Destructs cryptic {{declarations}} of the many addictions we seem to openly enjoy are jarringly poetic, and its blistering chainsaw guitars and machine gun drum loops are an outstanding example of how aggressive yet tuneful industrial music can be." [...] Rolling Stone was also positive towards [...] "Mr. Self Destruct", saying that the song [...] "the soft passages are soft chiefly in the sense of not being loud, as if there were a really great party down the street that you were wimping out on, pumped guitars and cranking boom-thwack drum machines and what not. But almost as soon as you rush to your pre-amp and squeeze in more juice, the loud <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>in,</b> but so unimaginably loud this time that you think your speaker coils might melt, and old man Reilly in the next apartment has already started to bang his broomstick on the wall."
