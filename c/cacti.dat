5|$|<b>Cacti</b> were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside <b>cacti).</b> Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of <b>cacti</b> and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and <b>cacti</b> became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living <b>cacti</b> {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some <b>cacti</b> have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar <b>cacti.</b> Climbing, creeping and epiphytic <b>cacti</b> may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E
5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} <b>cacti.</b> Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all <b>cacti,</b> the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless <b>cacti,</b> areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cacti</b> {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} <b>cacti</b> outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. <b>Cacti</b> are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. <b>Cacti</b> in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cacti</b> {{are used}} as {{construction}} materials. Living cactus fences are employed as barricades. The woody parts of <b>cacti,</b> such as Cereus repandus and Echinopsis atacamensis, are used in buildings and in furniture. The frames of wattle and daub houses built by the Seri people of Mexico may use parts of Carnegiea gigantea. The very fine spines and hairs (trichomes) of some <b>cacti</b> were used {{as a source of}} fiber for filling pillows and in weaving.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cacti</b> have {{a variety}} of uses: many species are used as {{ornamental}} plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some <b>cacti.</b>|$|E

50|$|This beetle {{lives in}} desert habitat, where it feeds on <b>cactus</b> plants, {{especially}} species of prickly pear (Opuntia) and cholla (Cylindropuntia). The beetle {{is a threat}} to several rare species of <b>cactus,</b> including the Mojave fishhook <b>cactus</b> (Sclerocactus polyancistrus), Wright's fishhook <b>cactus</b> (Sclerocactus wrightiae), Mesa Verde <b>cactus</b> (Sclerocactus mesae-verdae), Winkler’s pincushion <b>cactus</b> (Pediocactus winkleri), and San Rafael <b>cactus</b> (Pediocactus despainii).|$|R
5|$|<b>Cacti</b> show a {{wide variety}} of growth habits, which are {{difficult}} to divide into clear, simple categories. They can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many branches. In the genus Pereskia, the branches are covered with leaves, so the species of this genus may not be recognized as <b>cacti.</b> In most other <b>cacti,</b> the branches are more typically cactus-like, bare of leaves and bark, and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some <b>cacti</b> may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. <b>Cacti</b> may also be described as shrubby, with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cacti</b> whose stems {{are even}} smaller may be {{described}} as globular (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar <b>cacti.</b> Globular <b>cacti</b> may be solitary, such as Ferocactus latispinus, or their stems may form clusters that can create large mounds. All or some stems in a cluster may share a common root.|$|E
5|$|All <b>cacti</b> {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern <b>cacti</b> were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.|$|E

5|$|Although in most <b>cacti,</b> {{the stem}} {{acts as the}} main organ for storing water, some <b>cacti</b> have in {{addition}} large taproots. These may be several times {{the length of the}} above-ground body in the case of species such as Copiapoa atacamensis, which grows in one of the driest places in the world, the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cacti</b> {{have many}} other uses. They {{are used for}} human food and as fodder for animals, usually after burning off their spines. In {{addition}} to their use as psychoactive agents, some <b>cacti</b> are employed in herbal medicine. The practice of using various species of Opuntia in this way has spread from the Americas, where they naturally occur, to other regions where they grow, such as India.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cacti</b> {{may also}} be planted {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions {{has led to the}} promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping). For example, in California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. <b>Cacti</b> are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban iguana {{makes its}} burrow near <b>cacti</b> or thistles, {{sometimes}} {{even within the}} cactus itself. These thorny plants offer protection and their fruit and flowers offer the iguanas food. In areas without <b>cacti,</b> the lizards make their burrows in dead trees, hollow logs, and limestone crevices.|$|E
5|$|The spines of <b>cacti</b> {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in whether all the spines {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some <b>cacti</b> have flattened spines (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other <b>cacti</b> have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are hooked, while outer spines are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E
5|$|Botanist Charles Lemaire (1801-1871) {{gave the}} name Schlumbergera to this genus in 1858, honouring Frédéric Schlumberger (1823-1893), a French {{collector}} of <b>cacti</b> and other succulent plants.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cacti</b> inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to high {{mountain}} areas. With one exception, they are {{native to the}} Americas, where their range extends from Patagonia to British Columbia and Alberta in western Canada. A number of centers of diversity exist. For <b>cacti</b> adapted to drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern Andes, where they are found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern Brazil, away from the Amazon Basin. Tree-living epiphytic and climbing <b>cacti</b> necessarily have different centers of diversity, as they require moister environments. They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil; in Bolivia, which {{is the center of}} diversity for the subfamily Rhipsalideae; and in forested regions of Central America, where the climbing Hylocereeae are most diverse.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{huge numbers}} of <b>cacti</b> are {{produced}} annually. For example, in 2002 in Korea alone, 49 million plants were propagated, with a value of almost US$9million. Most of them, 31 million plants, were propagated by grafting.|$|E
