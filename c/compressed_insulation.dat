40|$|The {{forthcoming}} {{operation of}} the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at 13 - 14 TeV requires a deep understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms in the most critical superconducting magnets. This is aimed at determining their steady-state quench limits and constitutes an input to compute the magnets stability in transient conditions as well, to prevent beam induced quenches. Heat extraction capability of the LHC Nb-Ti magnets relies on the significant contribution provided by superfluid helium (He II). Due to {{lack of knowledge of}} the He II distribution in the cable and in the <b>compressed</b> <b>insulation,</b> experimental investigations are necessary. In this work we present an experimental study aimed at reproducing the thermal behavior of superconducting coils using short length samples. With respect to previous studies, a new instrumentation technique was developed and an in-situ calibration of the thermocouples was performed. The study was conducted on different types of instrumented cables-stack reproducing the main bending dipole (MB), the main quadrupole (MQ), and the MQXA, {{which is one of the}} two low-β interaction region quadrupoles. The heat extraction was determined as a function of the cable temperature, of the bath temperature and of the beam loss scenario...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Partial Discharge {{measurement}} is a {{very important}} means of assessing the integrity of insulation systems in a High Voltage apparatus. In <b>compressed</b> gas <b>insulation</b> systems, floating particles can initiate partial discharge activities which adversely affect the working of insulation. Partial Discharges below the inception voltage also plays a crucial in damaging the integrity of insulation over a period of time. This paper discusses the effect of loose and fixed Copper and Nichrome wire particles on the PD characteristics in SF 6 -N 2 (10 : 90) gas mixtures at a pressure of 0. 4 MPa. The Partial Discharge statistical parameters and their correlation to the observed results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an alternative procedure {{to obtain an}} equivalent conductor from a bundled conductor, {{taking into account the}} distribution of the current in subcondutors of the bundle. Firstly, it is introduced a brief background about the concept of Geometric Mean Radius (GMR) and how this methodology is applied to define an equivalent conductor and its electric parameters. Emphasizing that the classical procedure, using GMR, is limited to premise which the current is equally distributed through subconductors. Afterwards, it is described the development of proposed method and applications for an equivalent conductor obtained from a conventional transmission line bundled conductor and from an equivalent conductor based on a bundle with <b>compressed</b> SF(6) <b>insulation</b> system, where the current is unequally distributed through subconductors...|$|R
25|$|Neoprene drysuits have {{a similar}} {{construction}} to wetsuits; these are often considerably thicker (7–8mm) and have sufficient inherent insulation to allow a lighter-weight undersuit (or none at all); however on deeper dives the neoprene can compress to as little as 2mm, losing some of its <b>insulation.</b> <b>Compressed</b> or crushed neoprene may also be used (where the neoprene is pre-compressed to 2–3mm) which avoids the variation of insulating properties with depth. These drysuits function more like a membrane suit.|$|R
25|$|Neoprene {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} a foam-rubber sheet {{containing}} tiny air bubbles, which provide insulation by themselves, and can {{eliminate the need for}} an under-suit, or greatly reduce the thickness needed for the under-fabric, but the bubbles in the neoprene are <b>compressed</b> and the <b>insulation</b> of the suit decreases with depth {{in the same way as}} for a wetsuit. Crushed neoprene provides the flexibility of neoprene with the consistent buoyancy and insulation of membrane suits. A neoprene wet suit can also be worn under a membrane dry suit for extra protection against condensation and leaks, but it will compress with depth as will any closed cell suit.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{acoustic}} {{characteristic of}} sound insulation {{of two different}} snow packs: (1) a natural snow pack; and (2) a compressed snow by stomping, were measured. Acoustic characteristics of a compressed snow pack directly vibrated by stomping on surface and sticking with ski poles were also measured. As a result, a natural snow pack shows varied insulation characteristics depending on its inner snow layer structure. In a less dense layer, high-frequency domain was insulated more than lower-frequency domain, and in a dense layer, all frequency domain was uniformally insulated. In a <b>compressed</b> snow, <b>insulation</b> reached to more than 40 dB uniformally in all frequency domain. On the other hands, in a method directly vibrating a snow pack, such as ski-pole sticking and stomping, sound pressure level measured at 30 cm depth was about 20 dB greater than the MAF (minimum audible field) in wide frequency domain. Furthermore, even if a vibrating point was horizontally 1 m far from {{the position of a}} microphone, sound pressure level at 60 cm was 10 dB greater than the MAF at 1000 Hz. The results suggest that sticking with ski poles is effective to send sounds to a burial, and much better than voice call. ...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on several}} key design {{criteria}} and site visits, {{we developed a}} Robot design and built a system which automatically strips the lagging and insulation from the pipes, and encapsulates them under complete vacuum operation. The system can operate on straight runs of piping in horizontal or vertical orientations. Currently we are limited to four-inch diameter piping without obstacles {{as well as a}} somewhat laborious emplacement and removal procedure. Experimental results indicated that the current robotic abatement process is sound yet needs to be further expanded and modified. One of the main discoveries was that a longitudinal cut to fully allow the paddles to dig in and <b>compress</b> the <b>insulation</b> off the pipe is essential. Furthermore, a different cutting method might be explored to alleviate the need for a deeper cut and to enable a combination of certain functions such as compression and cutting. Unfortunately due to a damaged mechanism caused by extensive testing, we were unable to perform vertical piping abatement experiments, but foresee no trouble in implementing them in the next proposed Phase. Other encouraging results have BOA removing asbestos at a rate of 4 - 5 ft. /h compared to 3 ft. /h for manual removal of asbestos with a 3 -person crew. However, we feel confident that we can double the asbestos removal rate by improving cutting speed, and increasing the length of the BOA robot. The containment and vacuum system on BOA is able to achieve the regulatory requirement for airborne fiber emissions of 0. 01 fibers/ccm/ 8 -hr. shift. Currently, BOA weighs about 117 pounds which is more than a human is permitted to lift overhead under OSHA requirements (i. e., 25 pounds). We are considering designing the robot into two components (i. e., locomotor section and cutter/removal section) to aid human installation as well as incorporating composite materials. A more detailed list of all the technical modifications is given in this topical report...|$|R
