5|$|When Bob was {{designated}} a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys west of Craig Key, and from Flamingo to Venice. Gale warnings were later posted for the Atlantic <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> northward through St. Augustine. Small craft south of St. Augustine were advised {{to remain in}} port. While the storm was situated off the east-central <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida,</b> the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Savannah, Georgia to Little River, South Carolina. The hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning after Bob's intensification to Category 1 status.|$|E
5|$|Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda related that {{a sailor}} from the Bay of Biscay, called the Viscayno or Biscayno, had {{lived on the}} lower east <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> for a while after being shipwrecked.

5|$|The storm, {{combined}} with a high pressure system, produced a strong pressure gradient, resulting in strong rip currents off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida.</b> The currents prompted sirens, which are normally used for storm warnings, to be activated in Pensacola Beach. The rip currents killed 5 off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida.</b> Outer rain bands from the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the Florida Panhandle of over 11inches (280mm) in one day. The Tallahassee Regional Airport recorded 10.13inches (257mm) in 24hours, breaking the old 24‑hour record set in 1969. Throughout the state, Allison destroyed 10homes and damaged 599, 196 severely, primarily in Leon County. Including the deaths from rip currents, Allison killed eight people in Florida and caused $20million (2001USD, $26million 2012USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|After Isaac {{crossed the}} Florida Keys on August26, the {{hurricane}} warning was downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning, and the tropical storm watch from Sebastian Inlet to Flagler Beach was discontinued. Simultaneously, the hurricane watch on the Gulf Coast of the United States was upgraded to a hurricane warning along the portion from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Destin, Florida. Additionally, the tropical storm warning was discontinued {{from the mouth of}} the Suwannee River to Tarpon Springs. Early on August27, the tropical storm warning on the east <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> was discontinued for areas lying north of the Jupiter Inlet. Six hours later, the tropical storm warning on the east <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> was lifted from the Jupiter Inlet southward to Ocean Reef, including Lake Okeechobee. At 1500UTC, all of the remaining watches and warnings for South Florida were cancelled. On August28, the tropical storm warning in the Florida Panhandle was discontinued for areas east of Destin. By 1500UTC on August29, all tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings were no longer in effect for the state of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, a {{separate}} tropical cyclone {{formed in the}} western Atlantic. It moved from off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> to near Bermuda between October 24 and November 1, brushing the coast from St. Augustine to Charleston with gale-force winds. No significant damage occurred, though coastal flooding and heavy rainfall that caused a break in an earthen dam were reported {{along the coast of}} Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters at the United States Weather Bureau issued {{advisories}} for {{ships and}} oceangoing vessels, while posting hurricane warnings for areas in western Florida stretching from Key West to Apalachicola on October 24 and October 25. Additionally, storm warnings were issued eastward from {{mouth of the}} Mississippi River and along the east <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E

5|$|July 11, 1996- Hurricane Bertha {{parallels}} the east <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> about 175miles (280km) offshore, producing a storm tide of 2feet (0.6m) at Jacksonville Beach, {{as well as}} rip currents along the coast. Two people drown in rip currents in Miami Beach, and one pilot dies indirectly due to the storm when an evacuating military jet crashes into a house.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, causing over 600 fatalities, primarily in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. By September25, Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm made landfall three days later near Biloxi, Mississippi, with winds of 105mph (165km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed to an eastward drift. Georges dissipated on October1 near the Atlantic <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, the low produced gale-force winds and dangerous surf near the coast from North Carolina through Georgia, and later along the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida.</b> Significant swells were also reported in the Bahamas. The waves caused beach erosion and washed up against coastal houses along the southeast coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{hurricane}}'s {{arrival in}} the United States, the National Weather Bureau issued several hurricane warnings. As the storm passed over western Cuba, warnings were declared {{for much of the}} Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> and all ships in the Gulf or planning to set sail were advised return and remain at port. Warnings were then issued for the northern Gulf Coast, allowing residents time to evacuate before the storm struck.|$|E
5|$|Since Bret {{remained}} {{over the}} open Atlantic {{for most of}} its existence, its effects on land were limited. While moving little, the storm produced inclement weather and widespread cloudiness over much of the north-central Bahamas. Squalls off the eastern <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> generated rough seas along coastlines, injuring a number of people. Although it stayed well offshore, the storm enhanced tropical moisture over Bermuda, causing beneficial rainfall in dry areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{numerous}} ship wrecks {{that occurred}} along the southeast <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida</b> from Key Biscayne to the Dry Tortugas was {{a cause for}} concern. Between the late 1840s and the late 1850s, more than 500 ships were wrecked on the Florida Reef. The Assistant United States Coast Surveyor reported that in the period from 1845 through 1849, almost one million (United States) dollars worth of vessels and cargoes were lost on the reef.|$|E

5|$|Early in its duration, Keith {{produced}} {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall in Honduras, Jamaica, and Cuba. Minimal damage {{was reported in}} Mexico, which was still recovering {{from the effects of}} Hurricane Gilbert two months prior. Keith, the last of four named tropical cyclones to hit the United States during the season, produced moderate rainfall, rough storm surge, and gusty winds across central Florida. Overall damage was fairly minor but widespread, totaling $7.3million (1988USD; $ USD). Near the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida,</b> damage occurred mainly from storm surge and beach erosion. Further inland there were floods, downed trees and power lines. No fatalities were reported.|$|E
