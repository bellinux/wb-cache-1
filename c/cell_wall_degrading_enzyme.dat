Among various structure dynamics analysis platforms, HDX (hydrogen deuterium exchange) mass spectrometry stands out as an efficient and high-throughput way to analyze protein dynamics upon ligand binding. Despite the potential, limited research has employed the HDX mass spec platform to probe regional structure dynamics of enzymes. In particular, the technique has never been used for analyzing <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes.</b> We hereby used xylanase as a model to explore the potential of HDX mass spectrometry for studying <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Results HDX mass spectrometry revealed significant intrinsic dynamics for the xylanase enzyme. Different regions of the enzymes are differentially stabilized in the apo enzyme. The comparison of substrate-binding enzymes revealed that xylohexaose can significantly stabilize the enzyme. Several regions including those near the reaction centres were significantly stabilized during the xylohexaose binding. As compared to xylohexaose, xylan induced relatively less protection in the enzyme, which {{may be due to the}} insolubility of the substrate. The structure relevance of the enzyme dynamics was discussed with reference to the three dimensional structure of the enzyme. HDX mass spectrometry revealed strong dynamics-function relevance and such relevance can be explored for the future enzyme improvement. Conclusion Ligand-binding can lead to the significant stabilization at both regional and global level for enzymes like xylanase. HDX mass spectrometry is a powerful high-throughput platform to identify the key regions protected during the ligand binding and to explore the molecular mechanisms of the enzyme function.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{discovery}} {{and development of}} novel plant <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes</b> is a key step towards more efficient depolymerization of polysaccharides to fermentable sugars {{for the production of}} liquid transportation biofuels and other bioproducts. The industrial fungus Trichoderma reesei is known to be highly cellulolytic and is a major industrial microbial source for commercial cellulases, xylanases and other <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes.</b> However, enzyme-prospecting research continues to identify opportunities to enhance the activity of T. reesei enzyme preparations by supplementing with enzymatic diversity from other microbes. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the enzymatic potential of a broad range of plant pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi for their ability to degrade plant biomass and isolated polysaccharides. Results Large-scale screening identified a range of hydrolytic activities among 348 unique isolates representing 156 species of plant pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify groups of species with similar hydrolytic profiles. Among moderately and highly active species, plant pathogenic species were found to be more active than non-pathogens on six of eight substrates tested, with no significant difference seen on the other two substrates. Among the pathogenic fungi, greater hydrolysis was seen when they were tested on biomass and hemicellulose derived from their host plants (commelinoid monocot or dicot). Although T. reesei has a hydrolytic profile that is highly active on cellulose and pretreated biomass, it was less active than some natural isolates of fungi when tested on xylans and untreated biomass. Conclusions Several highly active isolates of plant pathogenic fungi were identified, particularly when tested on xylans and untreated biomass. There were statistically significant preferences for biomass type reflecting the monocot or dicot host preference of the pathogen tested. These highly active fungi are promising targets for identification and characterization of novel <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes</b> for industrial applications. </p...|$|R

Plant {{was grown}} {{in a pot}} {{experiment}} to study the positive role of CaCl 2 on NaCl induced stress in terms of growth parameters, metabolic, cation contents and <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes</b> in different plant organs.

A hundred ml of 10 mM CaCl 2 {{were added to the}} previous concentrations for seven weeks. The data revealed that, NaCl treatments reduced the growth parameters; which most sensitive in root than shoot. Organic cytosolutes were much higher in root than shoot organ except for protein accumulation. The amount of inorganic cytosolutes (Na+ and Ca++) in general increased markedly in shoot than root and vice versa for K+ and Mg++. CaCl 2 treatment alone induces these parameters than control one. Mixed salts of NaCl and CaCl 2 positively improve the aforementioned parameters with varying degrees depending on the organs. While root seems to be the more sensitive organ for growth parameters measured, it also seems most accumulator organ than shoot for many metabolites. For the ionic contents, shoot and root varies between the mono and divalent cations. <b>Cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes</b> significantly and progressively increased as salinity level of treated plants increased.

Conidia of C. capsici showed a gradual increase in prodn. of cellulase enzyme with an increase in the incubation period. Treatment of capsicum fruit with different concns. of calcium chloride, lactic acid and sorbic acid showed a 100 %, 85. 1 % and 83. 2 % decrease in prodn. of cellulase enzyme at the concn. of 1000 ppm, 500 ppm and 1000 ppm resp.

40|$|The {{expression}} of antibody fragments {{has been suggested}} as a possible mechanism for the introduction of disease resistance into transgenic plants. Important pathogenicity factors of certain phytopathogens are secreted <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Pectate lyases and polygalacturonase are important <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes</b> secreted by Erwinia carotovora and Botrytis cinerea respectively. The blocking of activities of these enzymes could offer an opportunity for reducing the ingress of these pathogens. Pectate lyase C from E. carotovara was purified to near homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography following overexpression in E. coli. Hybridoma lines recognising this enzyme were obtained and an scFv (single chain variable fragment) isolated from one of these lines. This scFv did not recognise pectate lyase.;The purified enzyme was used to inoculate mice to construct libraries of scFvs derived from spleen mRNA. These libraries did not yield any scFvs recognising pectate lyase. A synthetic human scFv library was then screened with pectate lyase and Botrytis cinerea polygalacturonase (PG), and scFvs recognising PG isolated. These scFvs were tested against a range of antigens to determine specificity. One scFv, C 1, was found to bind PG but did not bind to control antigens bovine serum antigen, hen egg lysozyme or pectate lyase. Neither did this scFv bind to PG isolated from another fungal pathogen, Cryphonectria parasistica. scFv C 1 was found to bind to a carbohydrate epitope on the B. cinerea polygalacturonase...|$|R
50|$|Phytopathogenic fungi expose plant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> to <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> <b>degrading</b> <b>enzymes</b> (CWDEs) like PGs.In response, most {{plants have}} natural {{inhibitor}} proteins that slow the hydrolytic activity of PG. These inhibitors also prompt long chain oligogalacturonide accumulation {{in order to}} encourage a defense mechanism against the attack. The polygalacturonase inhibitor proteins (PGIPs) are leucine-rich repeat proteins that have been reported to demonstrate both non-competitive and competitive inhibition of PGs. The active site of PG interacts with a pocket containing multiple polar amino acids in Phaseolus vulgaris PGIP2. The inhibitor prevents substrate binding by occupying the active site, resulting in competitive inhibition.|$|R

PME activity increased in fruit harvested earlier as opposed to fruit harvested at ripe stage while PG activity increased in all three different stages. Activity of pectate lyase was almost invariable in all three different stages. As for younger fruit, the cellulase activity increased progressively while activity was found to be within the same range in fruit harvested at ripe stage...|$|R
