In particular, RFV explains and quantifies two important stylized facts: i) the low empirical duration of high-yield bonds and ii) the decreasing sensitivity of credit spreads to interest rates as credit quality declines.

We build this on the established research of the effects of monetary shocks on macro variables by measuring the expansionary shock as an increase in the money supply. We also investigate interest rate policy and test whether financial market variables matter for the determination of interest rate.

40|$|In this paper, we {{conduct a}} {{regression}} {{analysis on the}} spread over Libor (LS) on the domestic straight bond trading market in Japan from May 1997 through March 1998. Our analysis shows that, for non-construction issues, the lower the rating the higher the LS, and that the LS differential among issues with different ratings has expanded since around November 1997 {{against the background of}} a growing awareness of credit risk. Our analysis also shows that during the analysis period (May 1997 through March 1998) the coupon rate, which was previously a significant explanatory variable for the LS, lost its significance, and that the coefficient of the <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity,</b> which is also an explanatory variable, switched from negative to positive (the longer the period <b>remaining</b> until <b>maturity,</b> the higher the LS). The heightened awareness of credit risk among investors apparently contributed to both these phenomena, and the latter is particularly noteworthy because it is consistent with the results of empirical analyses in the United States. Finally, for construction issues, our analysis showed that the LS continued to increase following the bankruptcy of several construction companies during the summer of 1997, and that an extremely large premium has arisen for certain issues. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare the Hull-White short rate model to the Cheyette short rate model. The Cheyette short rate model is a {{stochastic}} volatility model, that is introduced to improve the fit of the implied volatility skew to the market skew. Both models are implemented with piecewise constant parameters to match the term structure. We calibrate the Cheyette model to the EURO, USD and KRW swaption markets and compare the calibration results to the Hull-White model. We propose an efficient implementation method {{to speed up the}} calibration process. In general we see that the Cheyette model gives indeed a better fit, in particular for the EURO and KRW markets. The models with calibrated parameters are used to price exotic interest rate derivatives by Monte Carlo simulation. Comparing the results of the Cheyette model to the results of the Hull-White model, can give insight in the skew and curvature impact on exotic interest rate derivatives. We consider digital caplets, digital caps, range accrual swaps, callable range acrruals and a callable <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> swap. The price impact on digital caplets and digital caps are in line with static replication. By this we mean that the prices computed with static replication are better matched by the Cheyette model than by the Hull-White model. For the callable range accrual on LIBOR we have to be more careful, since a one-factor model cannot be calibrated to two market skews per option maturity. This implies that the price of the underlying range accrual is not in line with static replication, since we calibrate to co-terminal swaptions, while the underlying depends on the cap market. For the callable <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> swap we do not encounter this issue, since the underlying depends on the same co-terminal swaption skews. For a callable RMS we observe that the Hull and White model underestimates the option price, compared to the Cheyette model.

Both approaches using single-equation regressions and a term structure model conrm that the net supply of JGBs, the issuance (supply) by the government minus the demand by the preferred-habitat investors including the Bank of Japan (BOJ), had signicant eects on long-term interest rates. The regression approach implies that the net supply eects were stronger in the zero interest rate periods, while this relationship was not found using the model approach.

To assess the association of DRD 2 with sensitivity to CB, TaqI-A 1 /A 2, TaqI-B 1 /B 2, HphI-G/T and NcoI-C/T genotypes were determined in a cross-sectional retrospective study, including 203 patients with PRL-oma. DRD 2 alleles frequencies did not differ between patients and 212 healthy subjects. Conversely, NcoI-T allele frequency was higher in resistant rather than responsive patients, considering both PRL normalization (56. 6 vs 45. 3 %, P= 0. 038) and tumor shrinkage (70. 4 vs 41. 4 %, P= 0. 006).

40|$|Human {{complement}} activation by cercariae and schistosomula of {{the human}} parasite Schistosoma mansoni was studied in vitro. Cercariae are composed of tails which are shed after infection of the host and bodies which transform into the larvae or schistosomula after infection. After incubation in fresh normal human serum (NHS), cercarial tails bound more anti-C 3 antibodies than did cercarial bodies (CB), and the tails were rapidly lysed, while the attached <b>CB</b> <b>remained</b> intact. Complement activation by cercariae was dependent on the alternative pathway but was independent of antibody, as shown by C 3 deposition by hypogammaglobulinemic human sera. By transmission microscopy, the fibrillar glycocalyx on both CB and tails was stained by NHS but not by heat-inactivated serum (HI-NHS). The glycocalyx was labeled with periodate and tritiated borohydride, and parasites were incubated in NHS and HI-NHS. After solubilization, the labeled glycocalyx on organisms incubated in NHS but not HI-NHS bound anti-C 3 antibodies. Of the CB incubated with eserine sulfate to prevent transformation, 78 % +/- 10 % were dead after culture for 24 h in NHS. In contrast, 21 % +/- 12 % of the CB were dead after culture in HI-NHS. Schistosomula incubated in NHS bound 37 % {{of the amount of}} anti-C 3 antibodies bound by cercariae but were not killed by NHS.

40|$|Receiving {{the same}} {{fractional}} recovery of par at default for bonds {{of the same}} issuer and seniority, regardless of <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity,</b> has been labelled in the academic literature as a Recovery of Face Value at Default (RFV). Such a recovery form results from language found in typical bond indentures and is supported by empirical evidence from defaulted bond values. We incorporate RFV into an exogenous boundary structural credit risk model and compare its e ect to more typical recovery forms found in such models. We find that the chosen recovery form can significantly a ect valuation and the sensitivities produced by these models, thus having important implications for empirical studies attempting to validate structural credit risk models. We show that some features of existing structural models {{are a result of}} the recovery form assumed in the model and do not necessarily hold under an RFV recovery form. Some of our results complement those found in the literature which examines the endogeneity of the default boundary. We find that some features that may have been solely attributed to modelling the boundary as an optimal decision by the firm can be obtained in an exogenous boundary framework with RFV. This has direct implications for studies which attempt to determine whether endogenous or exogenous models are better supported empirically. We extend our results to incorporate a multifactor default-free term structure model and examine the impact of the recovery form in estimating the cost of debt capital within a structural model framework. ...|$|R

The corporate bond market in India demonstrates poor investor participation.

This paper attempts to approximate the corporate bond yield using residual maturity for listed and traded bonds using traded data from the period January 2001 to October 2014. We use a two stage process, where in the first stage, we model the yield behavior of corporate bonds against their residual maturity nodes of 3 years, 5 years and 20 years, respectively. In the second stage, we identify the significant factors of bond liquidity that impacts the cubic spline residual to improve accuracy in estimation. The first step of piece wise cubic spline estimates the 3 node parameters to predict the logarithmic yield to <b>maturities</b> against their <b>remaining</b> <b>maturity</b> in years. The second step intends to analyze the prediction errors and provides for correction in accuracy incorporating factors of bond liquidity such as issuer, issue and liquidity factors, respectively. The dual approach explains the variation in yields and could be used for identifying quality papers and the reasons for lower investor participation in bond markets and for arriving at term structure in related markets.
