The extension {{will provide}} additional {{time for the}} completion of the fifth review under the PRGF. The review was delayed owing to slippages {{in the second half of}} 2004 that had led to a depreciation of the <b>Congo</b> <b>franc</b> and high inflation. As a result, three quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2004 were not met. The IMF staff supports the authorities’ request for an extension of the arrangement through October 31, 2005.
