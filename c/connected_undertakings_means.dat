40|$|The {{purpose of}} our paper is to explore two ways in which Pakistani firms can take {{advantage}} of the growing corporate social responsibility movement so as to improve their own economic performance. First, the presence of MNCs in Pakistan, the vast majority of which have made significant CSR <b>undertakings,</b> <b>means</b> that Pakistani firms seeking to do business with them will often have to meet CSR tests themselves. Second, the increasing financial clout of so-called Socially Responsible Investement (SRI) funds means that Pakistani firms have an incentive to comply with CSR standards so as to become eligible investment instruments. We begin by canvassing briefly the history of CSR movement and what are by now relatively well-known CSR principles and standards. We then explore some examples of how Pakistan-based multinationals as well local firms are currently engaging in CSR practices. We argue that Pakistan can and should acquire the reputation for being a leader in this domain. corporate social responsibility movement, economic performance, CSR...|$|R

50|$|The first Antonine {{occupation}} of Scotland ended {{as a result}} of a further crisis in 155-157, when the Brigantes revolted. With limited options to despatch reinforcements, the Romans moved their troops south, and this rising was suppressed by Governor Gnaeus Julius Verus. Within a year the Antonine Wall was recaptured, but by 163 or 164 it was abandoned. The second occupation was probably <b>connected</b> with Antoninus's <b>undertakings</b> to protect the Votadini or his pride in enlarging the empire, since the retreat to the Hadrianic frontier occurred not long after his death when a more objective strategic assessment of the benefits of the Antonine Wall could be made. The Romans did not entirely withdraw from Scotland at this time, however: the large fort at Newstead was maintained along with seven smaller outposts until at least 180.|$|R

40|$|The article {{contains}} a set of reflections concerning policy of activation of regions in Poland. The author endeavours to prove that <b>undertakings</b> <b>connected</b> with aecelaretion of economic development and with improvement {{of the state of}} their economies have had as a rule a compact character with main directions of the socio-economic policy of the state. Starting from the year 1918 the author has investigated actions connected with activation of regions development. The first step in that sphere was levelling regional disproportions after the period of the partitions of Poland. After the Second World War a fundamental problem of the state economic policy consisted in ensuring quick reconstruction processes, and — in spatial dimension — in ensuring integration of the coutry's economy within its new borders. That task was simultaneously a great activation operation. A great role had been played in searching for theoretical concepts by the research of the Poznań school under direction of S. Kruszczyński. An important role in research on methods of economic activation had also been played by Kraków and Warsaw centres. Actions of all centres have been co-ordinated by the National Commission of Spatial Development of the Polish Academy of Sciences with St. Leszczycki. International co-operation between the CMEA countries also contributed to activation processes of particular regions. The author states in the conclusion that activation operations were effective if they were connected with main directions of a development strategy determined by socio-economic policy on the national scale. From the scientific point of view the reserve (resource) theory of backward regions activation proved realistic and adequate, ithoogh especially strong for regions possessing raw materiails.
