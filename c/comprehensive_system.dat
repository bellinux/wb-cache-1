Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including the creation of a state library. These measures were also rejected.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{for state}} schools in Dorset is divided between three local {{education}} authorities: Dorset County Council, which covers {{the majority of}} the county, and Bournemouth and Poole unitary authorities. Most of the Dorset County Council area operates a two-tier <b>comprehensive</b> <b>system</b> whereby pupils attend a primary school before completing their education at secondary school. Only Dorchester, Ferndown, Wimborne and Purbeck maintain a three-tier system (first, middle and high school), although Purbeck is expected to switch to a two-tier system by 2013 because of an excess of unfilled places. Bournemouth operates a two-tier system; Poole operates a three-tier system but will switch to two tiers from September 2013. Poole and Bournemouth are two of a minority of local authorities in England to maintain selective education, each containing two single-sex grammar schools which select pupils on the basis of an eleven-plus examination. Some of the county's schools are academies—self-governing state schools which have become independent of their local education authority and are maintained directly by the Department for Education. In 2010, 59.4% of pupils attending schools in the county council area gained at least five GCSEs at A*–C grades including English and maths, above the national average of 53.4%. Bournemouth and Poole also recorded above average results at 56.5% and 55.3% respectively. However, most non-selective schools in the two unitary authorities fell below the national average.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} parametric ideals and introduce {{a notion of}} <b>comprehensive</b> involutive <b>system.</b> This notion plays the same role in theory of involutive bases as the notion of <b>comprehensive</b> Groebner <b>system</b> in theory of Groebner bases. Given a parametric ideal, the space of parameters is decomposed into a finite set of cells. Each cell yields the corresponding involutive basis of the ideal for the values of parameters in that cell. Using the Gerdt-Blinkov algorithm for computing involutive bases and also the Montes algorithm for computing <b>comprehensive</b> Groebner <b>systems,</b> we present an algorithm for construction of <b>comprehensive</b> involutive <b>systems.</b> The proposed algorithm has been implemented in Maple, and we provide an illustrative example showing the step-by-step construction of <b>comprehensive</b> involutive <b>system</b> by our algorithm.

5|$|The {{educational}} opportunities for secondary modern pupils were limited compared to those at grammar schools, prompting criticism of the selection system; grammar schools and the eleven plus were also criticised for alienating working-class families. A reluctance to improve secondary moderns or expand grammar schools under the Conservatives prompted the Labour Government to issue Circular 10/65 in 1965 which requested local education authorities convert to a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>system.</b> In 1971, Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. New plans were unveiled in 1973: the High School and the Secondary Modern sites were to become mixed 11–16 schools and Carre's would become a sixth form college. Parents voted for the plans (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout. The County Council approved them, but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised in 1974 so that Carre's and the High School became 11–18 schools; the secondary modern would be closed, Westholme absorbed by the High School and the Church Lane site by Carre's.|$|E
5|$|The {{local council}} {{operates}} a two-tier <b>comprehensive</b> <b>system</b> whereby pupils attend {{one of the}} 26 primary schools in the borough before completing their education at secondary school. Bournemouth {{is one of the}} minority of local authorities in England still to maintain selective education, with two grammar schools (one for boys, one for girls) and ten secondary modern/comprehensive schools. There are also a small number of independent schools in the town, and a further education college. Bournemouth has two universities: Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth, both of which are located across the boundary in neighbouring Poole. They are also home to AECC University College (formally known as Anglo European College of Chiropractic), which is located on Parkwood Road in Bournemouth. In 2012, 60.7% of the borough's school leavers gained 5 GCSEs of grade C or above. This was slightly better than the national average of 59.4% and above the average for the rest of Dorset, with 58.8% of pupils from the local authority of Poole, and 54.1% from the remainder of the county, managing to do likewise.|$|E

However, by using inequations (“not equal zero”), we can obtain different cells. In many cases, this number of cells of parameter space is smaller than that of Suzuki-Sato’s. Therefore, our new algorithm is more efficient than Suzuki-Sato’s one, and outputs a nice <b>comprehensive</b> Gröbner <b>system.</b> Our new algorithm has been implemented in the computer algebra system Risa/Asir. We compare the runtime of our implementation with the Suzuki-Sato algorithm and find our algorithm superior in many cases. ...|$|R
