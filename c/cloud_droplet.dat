5000|$|Like {{all other}} soluble aerosols, {{increasing}} normal-sized sea salts suppresses the precipitation process in warm clouds by increasing <b>cloud</b> <b>droplet</b> number concentration {{and reducing the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>droplet</b> size. Also, they invigorate precipitation in mix-phase clouds because once the suppressed smaller cloud droplets are lifted above freezing level, more latent heat content would be released due to the freezing of cloud drops. Besides that, adding giant sea salt aerosols to polluted clouds can accelerate the precipitation process because giant CCNs could be nucleated into large particles which collect other smaller cloud drops and grow into rain droplets. [...] Cloud drops formed on giant sea salt aerosols may grow much more rapidly by condensation that cloud drops formed on small soluble aerosol particles, as giant sea salt cloud drops may remain concentrated solution drops for long times after they are carried into cloud. Such drops may have condensational growth rates more than two times faster than drops formed on small aerosol particles, and unlike normal cloud drops, drops formed on {{the largest of the}} giant sea salt aerosols may even grow by condensation in otherwise subsaturated cloudy downdrafts.|$|E

The model also shows that the rate of conversion from <b>cloud</b> <b>droplets</b> to raindrops is important in determining the duration of the life cycle of a thunderstorm cell. This is exemplified in a case with a small rate of conversion where a thunderstorm cell is maintained in a steady state despite the drag force due to a large number of hydrometeors.

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{describes a}} feedback loop {{that begins with}} an increase in the available energy from the sun acting to increase the growth rates of phytoplankton by either a physiological effect (due to elevated temperature) or enhanced photosynthesis (due to increased irradiance). Certain phytoplankton, such as coccolithophorids, synthesise dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and their enhanced growth increases the production of this osmolyte. In turn, this leads to an increase in the concentration of its breakdown product, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), first in seawater, and then in the atmosphere. DMS is oxidised in the atmosphere to form sulfur dioxide, and this leads to the production of sulfate aerosols. These aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and increase <b>cloud</b> <b>droplet</b> number, which in turn elevate the liquid water content of clouds and cloud area. This acts to increase cloud albedo, leading to greater reflection of incident sunlight, and a decrease in the forcing that initiated this chain of events. The figure to the right shows a summarising schematic diagram. Note that the feedback loop can operate in the reverse direction, such that a decline in solar energy leads to reduced cloud cover and thus to an increase in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface.|$|E
