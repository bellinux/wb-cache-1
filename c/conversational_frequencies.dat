40|$|Twenty-nine {{audiometric}} tests undergone by {{an employee}} over a 26 -year employment period in a structural maintenance shop {{at a large}} petrochemical company are analyzed. At re-tirement, the employee was diagnosed as having irreversible sensorineural hearing loss. Since company studies yielded average noise level measurements of 90 dBA within 1. 83 m of operating equipment, the relationship between continuous noise and sensorineural hearing loss in the <b>conversational</b> <b>frequencies</b> is examined. Results suggest that the rela-tionship is linear, and that auditory capability consistently deteriorates {{over long periods of}} exposure...|$|E
40|$|This article {{advances}} a communicative {{approach to}} social capital that views communication as the fundamental source of societal integration. We contend that integration occurring {{at the system}} level via news consumption and {{at the individual level}} via interpersonal discussion is amplified through ties at the community level. This cross-level interaction is theorized to encourage civic engagement, writ large, above and beyond the influences of news, talk, or social ties. This perspective distinguishes between the extent of news use and political talk and the orientation toward news consumption and political conversation. We offer evidence that communication variables, specifically news attention and exposure along with <b>conversational</b> <b>frequency</b> and orientation toward conversational understanding, interact with associational membership and network size to foster engagement. doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1460 - 2466. 2011. 01571. x Democratic societies must act collectively to address a range of social problems. In communities, as in interpersonal relationships and organizations, members are expected to give their attention to tasks requiring joint effort (e. g., Brewer & Kramer, 1986; Latane, 1986; Murnigham, Kim, & Metzger, 1994).

40|$|Introduction and objective: This study {{correlates}} the Singing Voice Handicap Index (SVHI) {{scores with}} videostrobolaryngoscopy and acoustic analysis in healthy professional singers, {{as a measure}} of self-perceived vocal health, versus actual pathology diagnosed during examination by stroboscopy, or by modification at the acoustic voice evaluation. The objectives of the study were to measure the strength of self-assessment among professional singers and to determine whether there is a benefit of combining SVHI, acoustic analysis and videostrobolaryngoscopy for the routine assessment of singers who have no obvious singing voice problem. Method: Prospective cross-sectional study. The voice quality of 40 students of the Music Academy, Cluj-Napoca, was assessed by means of a multidimensional test battery containing a singing voice handicap index (SVHI), as well as SVHI- 10, videolaryngostroboscopy, maximum phonation time on vowel /a/, S/Z ratio, Jitter, Shimmer and NHR (Harmonic Noise Ratio, at lowest, highest and <b>conversational</b> <b>frequency).</b> Additionally, in a questionnaire on daily habits has been recorded for the participants, covering the prevalence of smoking, eating habits, and vocal abuse. The correlation between SVHI scores, acoustic analysis and pathologic findings seen on videostrobolaryngoscopy was analyzed using linear regression and serial t tests to draw the conclusions of this study. Results: Both SVHI and SVHI- 10 scores showed, as previously expected, normal values for healthy singers (SVHI- 10 being the singers preferred metric). However, although all participants self-identified as healthy, laryngeal abnormalities were relatively common. Acoustic analysis of students voices identified relative instability of pitches, problems with F 0 variation, TMF (Maximum Phonation Time) and S/Z ratio. No Significant correlation (P = 0. 9501) between SVHI scores, acoustic analysis and videostrobolaryngoscopy findings were shown by the linear regression analysis. Conclusions: Multidimensional assessment of voice quality for the routine evaluation of singers without obvious singing voice problems is an important tool for the early detection of voice problems, despite appearances of a healthy voice. A trained singer has the possibility to compensate minor laryngeal modifications using singing techniques and, thus, is at risk of overlooking or ignoring an existing pathology. In conclusion, acoustic evaluation of the performers’ voices through the methods outlined above could assist in early detection and treatment of vocal pathology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWord final dysfluencies (WFDs) are {{a type of}} dysfluent {{repetition}} or prolongation {{occurring at}} the end of words. The repetitions may include single sound repetitions or rhyme repetitions. A pause {{may or may not be}} present before a repetition. This study analyzed the use of WFDs in a school-age male with Autism during <b>conversational</b> speech. The <b>frequencies</b> of these WFDs were analyzed according to multiple variables: utterance complexity, utterance length, interest of topic, and initiation of utterance. Higher percentages of WFDs were present for sentences of increased length and/or complexity, as well as for those sentences related to high-interest or participant-initiated topics...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{inconsistent}} {{findings regarding}} bilingual advantages in executive functions (EF), we reviewed the literature {{to determine whether}} bilinguals 2 ̆ 7 different language usage causes measureable changes in the shifting aspects of EF. By drawing on the theoretical framework of the adaptive control hypothesis-which postulates a critical link between bilinguals 2 ̆ 7 varying demands on language control and adaptive cognitive control (Green and Abutalebi, 2013), we examined three factors that characterize bilinguals 2 ̆ 7 language-switching experience: (a) the interactional context of <b>conversational</b> exchanges, (b) <b>frequency</b> of language switching, and (c) typology of code-switching. We also examined whether methodological variations in previous task-switching studies modulate task-specific demands on control processing and lead to inconsistencies in the literature. Our review demonstrates that not only methodological rigor but also a more finely grained, theory-based approach {{will be required to}} understand the cognitive consequences of bilinguals 2 ̆ 7 varied linguistic practices in shifting EF...|$|R
40|$|The {{standards}} that are still in use for telephone communications since the 1950 s limit the information bandwidth to 300 - 3400 Hz. However, in normal <b>conversational</b> speech, the <b>frequency</b> content is mainly between 0 - 8000 Hz. This constraint degrades not only the sound quality but also the intelligibility of the transmitted signal. Instead of modifying the present telecommunication infrastructures, which would cost billions of dollars, many researchers have been studying more efficient methods to increase the quality of telephone speech. This paper develops an innovative solution to bandwidth extension, which {{is based upon the}} Linear Source Filter Model that breaks speech up into two parts: the excitation and the spectral envelope. Novel approaches are used to extend the frequency information for both parts. This algorithm particularly emphasizes low frequency reconstruction without neglecting high frequencies. Furthermore, different feature sets to model the spectral envelope are employed for better performance under noisy conditions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The purpose ofthe {{experiment}} {{was to explore}} relations between jaw and laryngeal functions. The general question was whether laryngeal adduction was affected byjaw opening or by jaw biting. Twelve untrained, vocally healthy male and female adults participated as subjects. Subjects produced repeated to-kens of/A/in each of 12 experimental conditions involving combinations of 3 jaw openings (10 ram, 25 mm, 40 mm), 2 jaw biting pressures (10 kPa, 200 kPa), and 2 fundamental <b>frequencies</b> (<b>conversational</b> and high). For each token, laryngeal adduction was estimated from the electroglottographic closed quo-tient. The most straightforward results were that (1) laryngeal adduction in-creased as jaw opening increased at the conversational pitch, for all subjects, in-dependent of biting pressure, and (2) laryngeal adduction increased as biting pressure increased, at the conversational pitch, for males, independent of jaw opening. Other relations between estimated laryngeal adduction and jaw ma-nipulations were more complex, varying with fundamental frequency and gen-der. Speculations aremade about possible biomechanical and neurological ex...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of ethnographic}} {{debriefing}} interviews has increasingly {{been used as}} {{an effective means of}} introducing information into the therapeutic system. Research has demonstrated that these interviews are an important addition to the overall family therapy process. This dissertation describes client family experiences of being debriefed by their therapist and a separate debriefer. Results indicated that clients are willing to be debriefed about their therapy experience by either therapist or debriefer. Several important domains were examined by families. These include: Therapist and debriefer comparisons, preference for debriefer, preference for therapist, experience of being debriefed, and how debriefing could be made better. Domains which emerged from <b>conversational</b> digressions included: <b>Frequency</b> of debriefing, influence of debriefing upon families, discomfort with communicating negative experiences, client satisfaction with therapy as a result of debriefing, debriefing as therapeutic, and rapport with therapist. Results seem to have furnished new information to the overall understanding of how these two methods of debriefing compare, the utility of debriefing interviews for families, and its value as a therapy tool and public relations device...|$|R
