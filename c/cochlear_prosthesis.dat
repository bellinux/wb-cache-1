[URL] discrimination testing was carried out under clinical trial conditions for eight profoundly postlingually deaf adults to assess the efficacy of a newly developed 22 -channel <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and speech processor. Three months postoperatively, these patients showed significantly better results with the <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis</b> than for preoperative testing with a conventional hearing aid or vibrotactile aid (following a 6 -month trial with the aid) on each of a series of tests from the Minimal Auditory Capabilities battery. Assessment of lipreading enhancement using standard speech tests, consonant recognition studies, and speech tracking showed significant improvements for each patient when using the <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Six patients showed a significant amount of open set speech discrimination without lipreading at levels which have not been reported for single electrode cochlear prostheses. The two patients who performed poorly on these tests both had restricted multiple channel systems due to their disease, one patient being restricted to virtually a single channel system and the other to only ten of the 22 electrodes. These results indicate that this multiple channel <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis</b> has potential as a treatment for profound postlingual deafness over a wide range of etiologies and ages.

[URL] first adolescent to use the 22 -electrode <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis</b> was Implanted In Melbourne in 1985 and the first child (less than 10 years), the following year. Since then, over 100 children have received the <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis</b> in Australia and over 1200 worldwide. Detailed assessment of 200 children in the U. S. A., Australia and Germany lead to the market approval of the prosthesis by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration in July 1990. The analysis of results for these children has proven to be difficult due to the use of different tests in different places, the lack of appropriate assessment tools for young children, the wide range of performance, and the problems of cooperation for young children. Despite these problems, some trends are beginning to emerge in the speech perception results for implanted children. Children with a greater amount of auditory experience before becoming profoundly deaf tend to perform better, as do children with more experience with the <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Those with a greater number of electrodes in use also perform better, a result supported by adult studies. Although older prelinguistically deafened children do not perform as well as postlinguistically deafened adults, there appears to be little difference between results for pre-and post-linguistically deafened young children.

[URL] 22 -electroce <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis</b> developed by the University of Melbourne and Cochlear Pty. Ltd. has been shown to provide significant speech perception benefits to profoundly deafened adults. More recently, use of an improved Multipeak encoding strategy has significantly improved speech perception performance both in quiet and in noise. Benefits to speech perception in children have not as yet been fully documented, in part due to the shorter history of implant use in children and the smaller overall number of children implanted as compared with adults. The first implantation of the 22 -electrode <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis</b> in a child was carried out in Melbourne in January of 1985. In Melbourne, a 5 -year-old child was operated on in April 1986, and a first congenitally deaf child in April 1987. The age of implantation has been progressively reduced, with the first 2 -year-old child implanted in Melbourne in 1990. As at January 1992, approximately 1, 200 children (under 18 years of age inclusive) have been implanted worldwide with the 22 -electrode <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Of this number, approximately 50 % are under the age of 6 years. The age of the child, aetiology of the hearing loss, age at onset and duration of the hearing loss, education program attended both prior to and subsequent to implantation, and parental motivation to assist in habilitation are all factors which may affect an individual child's development and progress with the device. Evaluation of performance in children is complicated by a number of issues, including the effects of delayed speech and language development, and the ability of individual children to perform auditory tests. The measure of performance chosen for any evaluation will also reflect the interests of the particular clinician. For example, effects of device use on speech production may be of interest to the speech therapist, whereas educational progress will be of primary importance to the teacher of an implanted child. However, in choosing an appropriate evaluation test to measure progress woth the <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> it is vital to realize that all measures such as effects of device use on speech production, educational progress, development of language, and effects on social and communication skills depend on the child being able to accurately perceive speech information through her/his device.

40|$|Abstract {{of a paper}} {{presented}} at the 10 th International Congress on AcousticsIn order for the <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis</b> to transfer sufficient information to primary auditory nerve fibres for recognition of speech-like sounds, it is necessary to electrically excite discrete fibre populations at several points along the cochlear spiral (Tong et al., 1979). In addition, because of the large number of stimulus electrodes and the small volume of the scala tympani in which the electrodes are usually implanted, current transfer must derive from "passive" electrochemical processes in order to preserve the normal biochemical environment of the nerve fibres. From measurements made in the human cochlea during implantation of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> {{it has been shown that}} the longitudinal ground current distribution arising from a multielectrode system incorporating a common intracochlear ground electrode is accurately replicated by measurements made in a saline-filled uniform tube of diameter 3 - 5 rom.

40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. A mere 16 years ago, {{the title}} of this chapter would have created considerable consternation in audiological circles. A high proportion of otologists and audiologists would have wondered, with good reason, about the potential content of such a chapter. In 1977, there were certainly cochlear implants in use with reported benefits, but reliable documentation of any useful speech perception under controlled conditions was difficult to find. The rapid development of <b>cochlear</b> <b>prostheses</b> since that time has led to thousands of profoundly hearing-impaired adults obtaining benefits for speech perception, and there is now no doubt regarding the efficacy of such devices. This chapter will provide a brief overview of this rapid improvement in the speech perception of adult cochlear implant users, consider some of the reasons for this improvement, and discuss some of the factors that may influence speech perception performance for the individual user.

These pulses {{have little}} energy at low frequencies resulting in limited stimulation of low frequency hearing by mechanical {{responses to the}} electrical stimulus. However, if electro-mechanical transduction within the cochlea is nonlinear, electrical stimulation with asymmetric, charge-balanced current pulses {{may result in a}} mechanical response with significantly more low frequency energy. We estimated the mechanical response at low frequencies to pulsatile electrical stimulation of the cochlea. The auditory nerve compound action potential evoked by low frequency tones was forward-masked by a train of symmetric or asymmetric current pulses. Masking by asymmetric current pulses was not significantly different from masking by symmetric pulses matched for pulse duration and charge. In conclusion, {{there appears to be no}} advantage to using asymmetric current pulses for the mechanical stimulation of residual low frequency hearing by electrical stimulation of the cochlea.

40|$|Eight {{patients}} implanted with multiple-channel <b>cochlear</b> <b>prostheses</b> have displayed good discrimination {{of sound}} sensations elicited at different sites within the cochlea.

Electrode transitions (changes in position along the cochlea) are well discriminated for fast changes (25 msec), whereas rate transitions are not well discriminated for changes faster than 100 msec. From these results a speech processing strategy was formulated where second formant information is mapped to position in the cochlea and fundamental frequency mapped to rate of stimulation.

Comparisons of psychophysical and neurophysiological thresholds for electrical stimulation in animals reveal consistently higher thresholds in the neural studies. A number of factors which may account for these differences are discussed. A partial resolution of the problem could result from conducting neurophysiological and behavioral studies in the same animal. Finally, comparison of psychophysical and neurophysiological studies of temporal encoding suggest that there may be more information encoded in the auditory nerve than is used by the system, at least for nonspectral frequency discrimination.
