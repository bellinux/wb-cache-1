40|$|The {{intelligent}} manufacturing system (IMS) {{is widely}} used in the surface machining of the workpiece. In the process of ceramic surface grinding, the intelligent machine (manipulator) in IMS is required to automatically plan the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> trajectory in a complex environment.

The <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> trajectory can be optimized, taking into account several parameters in the trajectory, including the length of the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> path, the weighted sum of the strokes of all joints, and the duration of the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> trajectory. Firstly, get the planning task. Secondly, set the planning parameters and obtain a number of <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> trajectories. Finally, the evaluation function is used to evaluate the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> trajectories and get the optimal <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> trajectory.

In this paper, we analyse the timing of events and how they influence software-based <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> strategies. We have found that the warning strategies for <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> are constrained by the timing of events such as DSRC communication latency, detection range, road condition, driver reaction and deceleration rate.

40|$|Due to grave {{potential}} human, {{environmental and}} economical consequences of collisions at sea, <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> {{has become an}} important safety concern in navigation. To {{reduce the risk of}} collisions at sea, appropriate <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> actions need to be taken in accordance with the regulations, i. e., International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. However, the regulations only provide qualitative rules and guidelines, and therefore it requires navigators to decide on <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> actions quantitatively by using their judgments which often leads to making errors in navigation. To better help navigators in <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance,</b> this paper develops a comprehensive <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> decision making model for providing whether a <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> action is required, when to take action and what action to be taken. The model is developed based on three types of <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> actions, such as course change only, speed change only, and a combination of both.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{autonomous}} <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> {{has continued to}} advance in many areas including sensory and perception, navigation, payload integration, and <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance.</b> The advances in <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance,</b> however, have largely focused on iterative changes to the velocity obstacle - an algorithm that inherently loses important <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> information key to replicating a human-like decision space. This thesis examines algorithms that generalize the traditional velocity obstacle into a multi-threshold based approach that more realistically represent and evaluate human ship driving practices. Novel protocol-constrained <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> evaluation algorithms are proposed including the ability to perform both on-line and post-mission analysis of both robots and humans. These algorithms become especially important when considering complex missions of competing objectives in a contact-dense, protocol-constrained <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> environment. Introduction of competing performance metrics consistent with human ship driving practices allows autonomous <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> algorithm designers to consider previously unexplored tradespaces. On-water results of up to five simultaneously interacting autonomous vessels validate the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> algorithms using four key areas of evaluation: spatial efficiency, temporal efficiency, protocol compliance, and safety. Testing of 10 complex scenarios totaled over 6, 150 vehicle-pair on-water encounters. Human-robot field experimentation demonstrated autonomous <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> performance under conflicting protocol requirements of COLREGS while interacting with human-driven vessels. An autonomous <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> "road test" framework is proposed to incorporate testing of arbitrary <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> algorithms both {{in the field and}} in simulation. by Kyle Woerner.

40|$|Local <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> {{algorithms}} in crowd simulation often ignore agents {{beyond a}} neighborhood of a certain size. This cutoff can result in sharp changes in trajectory when large groups of agents enter or exit these neighborhoods. In this work, we exploit the insight that exact <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> is not necessary between agents at such large distances, and propose a novel algorithm for extending existing <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> algorithms to perform approximate, long-range <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance.</b> Our formulation performs long-range <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> for distant agent groups to efficiently compute trajectories that are smoother than those obtained with state-of-the-art techniques and at faster rates.

TITLE: AMELORIATING AERIAL NEAR MISSES WITH PCA DEVICES AND MOTL MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Henry Hexmoor A near miss is an unplanned event in air traffic {{that does not}} result in direct injury, illness or material damage. However, since an air craft come close to one another, there is threat of collision. An immediate consequence of near miss is tremendous psychological fear. Near misses are headline news and each case is investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Every pilot during flying hours has to record near misses. Although human error is commonly an initiating event, a faulty process or system invariably permits or compounds the harm, and should {{be the focus of}} improvement. Statistics tell us that for every 300 near misses there is one serious injury. To help every pilot to navigate with ease and to avoid collision and reduce the number of near misses, public <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> systems are inexistence.
