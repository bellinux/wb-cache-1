5000|$|Kentucky Blue <b>Collar</b> <b>Band</b> are an American {{country rock}} band. They were founded in 2004 {{deep in the}} foothills of Eastern Kentucky as the Blue <b>Collar</b> <b>Band,</b> {{composed}} of Goble Cantrell (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Mark Rohan (drums) along with Don Hayes (lead guitar) and Dean Ball (bass guitar). After discovering that another band already existed in Louisville, Kentucky with the name [...] "Blue Collar Band", the band added [...] "Kentucky" [...] to its name and thus became the Kentucky Blue <b>Collar</b> <b>Band.</b> The band began performing as the Kentucky Blue <b>Collar</b> <b>Band</b> in 2006, adding Marc Currens as bass guitarist and harmony vocalist in 2008. With the release of their debut album Rockin' the Road in 2006 with independent record label Huba Records, the band garnered a good rotation of local radio play. Their second album Long Hard Road, released in 2009, fared much better and was widely played, including winning song of the month in May 2009 on a Texas radio station, Hoss the Boss with DJ Don Cudd, as well as coming in fourth for song of the year on that same station's yearly contest for 2009, setting an all-time record at that point for most fan votes of any one song {{in the history of the}} contest. The band released their third album Evolution on March 15, 2011, with that album still working its way into and up the charts.|$|E
5000|$|A camp shirt or lounge {{shirt is}} a loose, straight-cut, short-sleeved shirt or blouse {{with a simple}} placket front opening and a [...] "camp collar" [...] - a {{one-piece}} collar (no <b>collar</b> <b>band)</b> that can be worn open and spread or closed at the neck with a button and loop. It usually has a straight hemmed bottom falling at hip level, {{not intended to be}} tucked into trousers. It is often the base for fancier fabrics such as bowling shirts, aloha shirts, or various other Hawaiian/tropically inspired weaves and patterns.|$|E

Jackets with {{mandarin}} collars, also called stand <b>collars,</b> <b>band</b> <b>collars</b> or choker collars, include Nehru jackets and various military dress uniforms, {{such as the}} British Army and US Marine Corps. Turndown collars, also called Prussian collars and ghillie collars, were once common on military uniforms and on the Mao suit.|$|R
25|$|In court, barristers {{are often}} visibly {{distinguished}} from solicitors by their apparel. For example, in Ireland, England, and Wales, a barrister usually wears a horsehair wig, stiff <b>collar,</b> <b>bands,</b> and a gown. Since January 2008, solicitor advocates {{have also been}} entitled to wear wigs, but wear different gowns.|$|R
25|$|The reins {{were mostly}} {{the same as}} those in use in the 19th century, and were made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal.

5000|$|The [...] "pre-tied", or more commonly, the clip-on, necktie is a {{permanently}} knotted four-in-hand or bow tie affixed by a clip or hook, {{most often}} metal and sometimes hinged, to the shirt front {{without the aid}} of a band around a shirt collar; these ties are close relatives of banded pre-tied ties that make use of a <b>collar</b> <b>band</b> and a hook and eye to secure them. The clip-on tie sees use with children, and in occupations where a traditional necktie might pose a safety hazard, e.g., law enforcement, mechanical equipment operators etc. (see [...] below).|$|E
50|$|Venerating {{the body}} of the martyr St. Beatrice at the Benedictine Convent of Perpetual Adoration, Clyde, Missouri in 1940:"There, under the altar, {{enclosed}} in glass, lay {{the body of}} the Roman martyr, Beatrice. We bent our heads eagerly and peered under the glass, where, on silken pillows lay the glittering doll-like body of Saint Beatrice (which we later learned was not her real body but a wax figure encasing her bones). We gazed, fascinated by the rosy cheeked young girl lying there, wearing a richly brocaded and embroidered dress, looking as if she had just breathed her last breath. We stared at her head. Her brown curls were encircled by a filigree band; her pretty mouth was open. We could see her little white teeth and pink tongue. Her glassy eyes had rolled back into her head and were fixed as though staring into heaven. Her pretty head had fallen back onto a silken pillow. Above the gold brocaded <b>collar</b> <b>band,</b> her long, prettily arched neck revealed the bloody spot our eyes always sought in fearful anticipation. It was eternally there--the blood encrusted stab wound that had taken her life. Drops of her blood appeared still fresh on her neck and were caught in a gold chalice beside the pillow.|$|E
50|$|In December 2000, marking {{their fourth}} decade {{in the music}} business, the band {{appeared}} on stage at the Blind Musicians Festival in Parnell. The current line up {{at the time was}} Feau Halatau, Ray Lemon, Neville Tura and Andrew Taylor. For the event, they were to have singer Eleanor Wicks on keyboards. Around 2001, the band had $10,000 of their equipment stolen. They kept going for a few more years, and finally disbanded in or around 2007, with the only two surviving original members Andrew Taylor, and Feau Halatau parting company. Ray Lemon died on Monday, July 14, 2008. His service was held at a marae in Awaru, which is near Kaikohe. In January 2010, Andrew Taylor had joined the group Blue <b>Collar</b> <b>Band,</b> playing venues like the Wanderers Club in the Auckland suburb of Mangere. Dennis Kingston who was with The Radars at one stage was also in the band. Bass played Alex Constable was also in the band for a period of time. He played in a variety of bands including The North Harbour Rockers, and the cover band, 2 Flat Whites and a Mocha. In a 2009, a article in the Jan 22 edition of Auckland's Central Leader, drummer Halatau now living in Onehunga was looking to open a drumming school. He was hoping to make a documentary about the group as well.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to 1974, advocates {{wore the}} court dress of barristers with {{horsehair}} wig (ceremonial occasions), stiff <b>collar,</b> <b>bands,</b> and a gown; while proctors wore black coat and white trousers.

5000|$|Marc Currens, bass guitarist {{and harmony}} vocals, {{was born on}} July 5, 1963, in Lexington, Kentucky. Marc spent his early years growing up in Las Vegas, Nevada, and between San Diego and Los Angeles California before {{returning}} to Kentucky as a teenager. The musical influences Marc grew up with were vast and largely leaning towards rock, {{with the exception of}} early country-western acts. His favorites were the Beatles, the Byrds and the Rolling Stones, as well as, Buck Owens and The Buckaroo's. Marc constantly surrounded himself with all things music. He quickly learned to play drums, bass guitar, guitar, and sing lead and harmony vocals by paying close attention to Don Rich and Buck Owens. Over the years he has played in a variety of garage bands and many gigs with friends. He always kept busy playing one way or another, whether with a band or by himself. Notable bands Marc has played with include, Spectra (1993-1996), Deuces Wild (1998-1999) as a guest musician (with his brother, Chris Currens as frontman), 11:59 (2000-2002) and, Kentucky Blue <b>Collar</b> <b>Band</b> (2008-present). He was brought into the band by close friend, Drummer Mark Rohan. He hit it off instantly with the guys, and appreciated the unique, original sound and concept of the band. Marc didn't have to think twice, as he devoted his time and joined the band very quickly. He has since co-written two songs that were released on KBCB's [...] "Evolution" [...] album the songs, [...] "I Ain't Changin", with Goble Cantrell, and [...] "Do It Later", with Don Hayes, on which Marc also sings lead vocal.Marc has a son, Marc II, born 11/04/87, by a previous marriage. He married the love of his life, Melissa, on February 14, 1999. They currently reside in Lexington, Kentucky.|$|E

In all cases, {{in addition to}} the generation or relief of the curvature stress, the buds recruit specific lipids and proteins from the donor membrane through restricted diffusion {{for the development of a}} ring-type raft domain of closed topology. Here, by reconstituting the bud topography in a model membrane, we demonstrate the preferential localization of cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-enriched microdomains in the <b>collar</b> <b>band</b> of the bud-neck interfaced with the donor membrane. The geometrical approach to the recapitulation of the dynamic membrane reorganization, resulting from the local radii of curvatures from nanometre-to-micrometre scales, offers important clues for understanding the active roles of the bud topography in the sorting and migration machinery of key signalling proteins involve...|$|E

40|$|This paper presents, for {{the first}} time, an inkjet printed, wearable, low-cost, light weight and {{miniaturized}} real time locating TAG on an ordinary photo-paper. The 29 grams, 9 cm× 8 cm× 0. 5 cm TAG integrates a GPS/GSM module, a microcontroller with on-paper GPS and GSM antennas. A novel monopole antenna with an L shaped slit is introduced to achieve the required circular polarization for the GPS band. Issues related to integration of active components (e. g. BGA chip) on inkjet-printed paper substrates are discussed. The system enables location tracking through a user-friendly interface accessible through all internet enabled devices. Field tests show an update interval of 15 sec, stationary position error of 6. 2 m and real time tracking error of 4. 7 m which is 4 times better than the state-of-the-art. Due to the flexible nature of the paper substrate, the TAG can be designed for different shapes such as a wrist band for child tracking or a <b>collar</b> <b>band</b> for pet tracking applications. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
50|$|In the High Court of Australia, justices wear plain black robes with zippered fronts over normal attire. They do {{not wear}} wigs, <b>collars,</b> <b>bands</b> or jabots. The robes {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to those worn by Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, although they are more elaborately tailored.

50|$|It may {{therefore}} {{be said that}} Irish barristers robe similarly to their English counterparts. Such robes are worn by barristers in all courts, including the District Court. Like Queen's Counsel in England, Senior Counsel generally wear a short bar wig and black silk or poplin gown with flap collar and long, closed sleeves over a buttoned and broad-cuffed court coat. Their shirts will have a detachable stiff wing <b>collar,</b> worn with <b>bands.</b> Junior Counsel wear a short bar wig and black poplin or stuff bar gown (which has a gathered yoke and short, open sleeves) over a dark three-piece suit with similar wing <b>collar</b> and <b>bands.</b> While it is not unknown for female barristers to wear a blouse with separate bands much like male colleagues, more commonly they would wear a starched white all-in-one collarette or bib covering their neckline that approximates in looks to a tall Mandarin <b>collar</b> and <b>bands.</b>|$|R
