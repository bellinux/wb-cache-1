25|$|Solid {{geological}} evidence, {{based largely}} upon analysis of deep cores of coral reefs, exists only for 3 major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called meltwater pulses, {{during the last}} deglaciation. They are Meltwater pulse 1A between circa 14,600 and 14,300 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago; Meltwater pulse 1B between circa 11,400 and 11,100 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago; and Meltwater pulse 1C between 8,200 and 7,600 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago. Meltwater pulse 1A was a 13.5 m rise over about 290 years centered at 14,200 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago and Meltwater pulse 1B was a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years centered at 11,000 <b>years</b> <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago. In sharp contrast, the period between 14,300 and 11,100 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago, which includes the Younger Dryas interval, was an interval of reduced sea level rise at about 6.0–9.9 mm/yr. Meltwater pulse 1C was centered at 8,000 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> and produced a rise of 6.5 m in less than 140 years. Such rapid rates of sea level rising during meltwater events clearly implicate major ice-loss events related to ice sheet collapse. The primary source may have been meltwater from the Antarctic ice sheet. Other studies suggest a Northern Hemisphere source for the meltwater in the Laurentide ice sheet.|$|R

5000|$|The Younger Dryas is the {{youngest}} and longest of three stadials, which resulted from typically abrupt climatic changes that took place over the last 16,000 <b>calendar</b> <b>years.</b> Within the Blytt-Sernander classification of north European climatic phases, the prefix [...] "Younger" [...] refers to the recognition that this original [...] "Dryas" [...] period was preceded by a warmer stage, the Allerød oscillation, which, in turn, was preceded by the Older Dryas, around 14,000 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> BP. That is not securely dated, and estimates vary by 400 years, but it is generally accepted that it lasted around 200 years. In northern Scotland, the glaciers were thicker and more extensive than during the Younger Dryas.

50|$|Based upon solid {{geological}} evidence, consisting {{largely of}} the analysis of numerous deep cores from coral reefs, variations in the rates of sea level rise have been reconstructed for the postglacial period. For {{the early part of}} the sea level rise that is associated with deglaciation, three major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called meltwater pulses, occurred. They are commonly called meltwater pulse 1A0 for the one between 19,000 and 19,500 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago; meltwater pulse 1A for the one between 14,600 and 14,300 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago and meltwater pulse 1B for the one 11,400 and 11,100 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago. The Younger Dryas occurred after meltwater pulse 1A, a 13.5 m rise over about 290 years, centered at about 14,200 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago, and before meltwater pulse 1B, a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years, centered at about 11,000 <b>calendar</b> <b>years</b> ago. Finally, not only did the Younger Dryas postdate both all of meltwater pulse 1A and predate all of meltwater pulse 1B, it was a period of significantly-reduced rate of sea level rise relative to the periods of time immediately before and after it.|$|R
