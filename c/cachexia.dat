5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), <b>cachexia</b> in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{was known}} to the ancients, such as Galen, and various theories were proposed about {{its role in the}} body, but major clues as to the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when acromegaly due to pituitary tumors was described. The first known report of hypopituitarism was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had suffered severe puerperal fever eleven years earlier, and subsequently suffered amenorrhea, weakness, signs of rapid aging and anemia. The pituitary gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior pituitary. The eponym Simmonds' syndrome is used infrequently for acquired hypopituitarism, especially when <b>cachexia</b> (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of hypopituitarism were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of how common hypopituitarism could be in previous head injury victims.|$|E

25|$|Continuing {{weight loss}} may {{deteriorate}} into wasting, a vaguely defined condition called <b>cachexia.</b> <b>Cachexia</b> differs from starvation {{in part because}} it involves a systemic inflammatory response. It is associated with poorer outcomes. In the advanced stages of progressive disease, metabolism can change so that they lose weight even when they are getting what is normally regarded as adequate nutrition and the body cannot compensate. This leads to a condition called anorexia <b>cachexia</b> syndrome (ACS) and additional nutrition or supplementation is unlikely to help. Symptoms of weight loss from ACS include severe weight loss from muscle rather than body fat, loss of appetite and feeling full after eating small amounts, nausea, anemia, weakness and fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic ghrelin {{administration}} for <b>cachexia</b> of any cause and for hemodialysis patients is being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Saturation of {{the body}} fat {{compartment}} in patients with rapid and profound body fat loss (patients with cancer, cardiac or infection-induced <b>cachexia</b> can lose 80 % of their body fat).|$|E
25|$|Whereas high {{concentrations}} of TNF induce shock-like symptoms, the prolonged exposure to low concentrations of TNF can result in <b>cachexia,</b> a wasting syndrome. This can be found, for example, in cancer patients.|$|E
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate was {{specifically}} {{developed as a}} result of a proposal by Joseph Gold for a therapy that could offset the rapid loss of weight that occurs in cancer (cancer <b>cachexia).</b> This hypothesis was based on the fact that cancer cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might reverse this energy requirement and be an effective treatment for cancer <b>cachexia.</b> Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the test tube can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual tumor regression in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer <b>cachexia.</b> In this model, hydrazine sulfate is therefore thought to act by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.|$|E
25|$|Low {{glutathione}} {{is commonly}} observed in wasting and negative nitrogen balance, {{as seen in}} cancer, HIV/AIDS, sepsis, trauma, burns, and athletic overtraining. Low levels are also observed in periods of starvation. These effects are hypothesized {{to be influenced by}} the higher glycolytic activity associated with <b>cachexia,</b> which result from reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation.|$|E
25|$|As chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) advances, about 35% of patients experience severe weight loss called pulmonary <b>cachexia,</b> including diminished muscle mass. Around 25% experience {{moderate to severe}} weight loss, and most others have some weight loss. Greater weight loss is associated with poorer prognosis. Theories about contributing factors include appetite loss related to reduced activity, additional energy required for breathing, and the difficulty of eating with dyspnea (labored breathing).|$|E
25|$|Four {{recognised}} species infect cattle: S. bovifelis, S. bovihominis (S. hominis) S. cruzi (S. bovicanis) and S. hirsuta. S. cruzi is {{the only}} species known to be pathogenic in cattle. A number of clinical syndromes {{have been reported in}} connection with this parasite: eosinophilic myositis; abortions, stillbirths and deaths in pregnant cows; two cases of necrotic encephalitis in heifers have also been reported. Typical clinical signs of acute bovine sarcocystosis are: anorexia, pyrexia (42C or more), anemia, <b>cachexia,</b> enlarged palpable lymph nodes, excessive salivation and loss of hair {{at the tip of the}} tail.|$|E
25|$|The cDNAs {{encoding}} LT and TNF were cloned in 1984 {{and were}} {{revealed to be}} similar. The binding of TNF to its receptor and its displacement by LT confirmed the functional homology between the two factors. The sequential and functional homology of TNF and LT led to the renaming of TNF as TNFα (this article) and LT as TNFβ. In 1985, Bruce A. Beutler and Anthony Cerami discovered that cachectin (a hormone which induces <b>cachexia)</b> was actually TNF. They then identified TNF as a mediator of lethal endotoxin poisoning. Kevin J. Tracey and Cerami discovered the key mediator role of TNF in lethal septic shock, and identified the therapeutic effects of monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Kocher {{and others}} later {{discovered}} that the complete removal of the thyroid could lead to cretinism (termed <b>cachexia</b> strumipriva by Kocher) caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormones. The phenomena was reported to Kocher first in 1874 by the general practitioner August Fetscherin and later in 1882 by Jacques-Louis Reverdin together with his assistant Auguste Reverdin (1848-1908). Reverdin met Kocher on 7 September in Geneva at the international hygienic congress (internationaler Hygienekongress) and expressed his concerns about complete removal of the thyroid to Kocher. Kocher then tried to contact 77 of his 102 former patients and found signs of a physical and mental decay in those cases where he had removed the thyroid gland completely. Ironically, it was his precise surgery that allowed Kocher to remove the thyroid gland almost completely {{and led to the}} severe side effects of cretinism.|$|E
500|$|The act created [...] "The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program," [...] which {{administers the}} Medical Marijuana Act {{approved}} by the public in November 1998. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program administers the program within the Oregon Department of Human Services. As of April 1, 2009, there were 20,974 patients registered, with 10,626 caregivers holding cards for these patients. Virtually all patients benefiting from the program (18,000+) suffer from severe pain and more than 3,200 from nausea. The other conditions are given as epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, cancer, <b>cachexia,</b> chronic glaucoma and tremors caused by Alzheimer's disease. Multiple states have requested information on Oregon's program {{to use as a}} model for their own medical marijuana initiatives and registration systems.|$|E

2500|$|Severe rigors may {{mark the}} onset of this disease in humans. Fever, {{headache}} and malaise are other non-specific symptoms of this disease which may last {{for a period of}} between 1 and 6 days.

2500|$|Although {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about its frequency before the 19th century, its incidence is thought to have peaked between the end of the 18th century {{and the end of the}} 19th century. Over time, the various cultures of the world gave the illness different names: phthisis (Greek), consumptione (Latin), yaksma (India), and chaky oncay (Incan), each of which make reference to the [...] "drying" [...] or [...] "consuming" [...] affect of the illness, <b>cachexia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Major {{causes of}} {{malnutrition}} include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being {{a mixture of}} several factors. [...] Clinical malnutrition, such as: <b>cachexia,</b> is a major burden also in developed countries. Various scales of analysis {{also have to be}} considered {{in order to determine the}} sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.|$|E
2500|$|In cattle, {{the main}} signs of paratuberculosis are {{diarrhea}} and wasting. Most cases {{are seen in}} 2- to 6-year-old animals. The initial signs can be subtle, and may be limited to weight loss, decreased milk production, or roughening of the hair coat. The diarrhea is usually thick, without blood, mucus, or epithelial debris, and may be intermittent. [...] Several weeks after the onset of diarrhea, a soft swelling may occur under the jaw. Known as [...] "bottle jaw" [...] or intermandibular edema, this symptom is due to protein loss from the bloodstream into the digestive tract. Paratuberculosis is progressive; affected animals become increasingly emaciated and usually die {{as the result of}} dehydration and severe <b>cachexia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Weight loss, in {{the context}} of medicine, health, or {{physical}} fitness, refers to a reduction of the total body mass, due to a mean loss of fluid, body fat or adipose tissue or lean mass, namely bone mineral deposits, muscle, tendon, and other connective tissue. Weight loss can either occur unintentionally due to malnourishment or an underlying disease or arise from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived overweight or obese state. [...] "Unexplained" [...] weight loss that is not caused by reduction in calorific intake or exercise is called <b>cachexia</b> and may be a symptom of a serious medical condition. Intentional weight loss is commonly referred to as slimming.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary role}} of TNF {{is in the}} {{regulation}} of immune cells. TNF, being an endogenous pyrogen, is able to induce fever, apoptotic cell death, <b>cachexia,</b> inflammation and to inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication and respond to sepsis via IL1 & IL6 producing cells. [...] Dysregulation of TNF production has been implicated {{in a variety of}} human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, major depression, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Though controversial, studies of depression and IBD are currently being linked to TNF levels. [...] Recombinant TNF is used as an immunostimulant under the INN tasonermin. TNF can be produced ectopically in the setting of malignancy and parallels parathyroid hormone both in causing secondary hypercalcemia and in the cancers with which excessive production is associated.|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{with the}} chronic, {{congenital}} form of SMA syndrome predominantly have a lengthy or even lifelong history of abdominal complaints with intermittent exacerbations {{depending on the}} degree of duodenal compression. Risk factors include anatomic characteristics such as: aesthenic (very thin or [...] "lanky") body build, an unusually high insertion of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz, a particularly low origin of the SMA, or intestinal malrotation around an axis formed by the SMA. [...] Predisposition is easily aggravated by any of the following: poor motility of the digestive tract, retroperitional tumors, loss of appetite, malabsorption, <b>cachexia,</b> exaggerated lumbar lordosis, visceroptosis, abdominal wall laxity, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal trauma, rapid linear adolescent growth spurt, weight loss, starvation, catabolic states (as with cancer and burns), and history of neurological injury.|$|E

2500|$|On February 1, 1983, Karen and Richard met {{for dinner}} and {{discussed}} future plans for the Carpenters, including a return to touring. On February 3, Karen visited her parents, and discussed finalising her divorce to Burris. The following morning, her mother found her lying unresponsive {{on the floor of}} a walk-in closet, and she was rushed to hospital. After spending 20 minutes in a waiting room, a doctor entered to tell Richard and his parents that Karen had died. The autopsy stated that her death was caused by [...] "emetine cardiotoxicity due to or as a consequence of anorexia nervosa." [...] Under the anatomical summary, the first item was heart failure, followed by anorexia. The third finding was <b>cachexia,</b> which is extremely low weight and weakness and general body decline associated with chronic disease. Emetine cardiotoxicity implied that Karen abused ipecac syrup, although there was no evidence to suggest that she did as her brother and family never found ipecac vials in her apartment, even after her death.|$|E
2500|$|It {{takes over}} one hour for Marinol to reach full {{systemic}} effect, compared to seconds or minutes for smoked or vaporized cannabis. Some people accustomed to inhaling just enough cannabis smoke to manage symptoms have complained of too-intense intoxication from Marinol's predetermined dosages. Many people using Marinol {{have said that}} Marinol produces a more acute psychedelic effect than cannabis, {{and it has been}} speculated that this disparity {{can be explained by the}} moderating effect of the many non-THC cannabinoids present in cannabis. For that reason, alternative THC-containing medications based on botanical extracts of the cannabis plant such as nabiximols are being developed. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, [...] "It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine." [...] Mr. Kleiman's opinion notwithstanding, clinical trials comparing the use of cannabis extracts with Marinol in the treatment of cancer <b>cachexia</b> have demonstrated equal efficacy and well-being among subjects in the two treatment arms. United States federal law currently registers dronabinol as a Schedule III controlled substance, but all other cannabinoids remain Schedule I, except synthetics like nabilone.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cachexia</b> and {{sarcopenia}} are a {{major public}} health problem: frequent, costly, and deadly. [...] <b>Cachexia</b> has been coined as the [...] "last illness". The prevalence of <b>cachexia</b> ranges from 5-15% in end-stage chronic heart failure to 50-80% in advanced malignant cancer. It is estimated that 5 Million Americans have the condition and <b>Cachexia</b> is frequently occurring in patients with chronic kidney disease, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), HIV, Multiple sclerosis, neurological diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. Mortality rates of patients with <b>cachexia</b> range from 15-25% per year in severe COPD through 20-40% per year in patients with chronic heart failure or chronic kidney disease to 20-80% in cancer <b>cachexia.</b> SCWD was founded in 2008 on the initiative of Prof. Stefan D. Anker, Germany and Dr. John E. Morley, USA. It is made up of an international and multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals in the fields of sarcopenia, <b>cachexia</b> and muscle wasting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cachexia</b> {{is often}} seen in end-stage cancer, and in that context is called cancer <b>cachexia.</b> Patients with {{congestive}} heart failure can have a cachectic syndrome. Also, a <b>cachexia</b> comorbidity is seen in patients who {{have any of the}} range of illnesses classified as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. <b>Cachexia</b> is also associated with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, HIV/AIDS and other progressive illnesses.|$|E
