5000|$|Castle Oliver a.k.a. Clonodfoy/Clonghanodfoy Castle, Co.Limerick, Ireland (1845-52) Scottish Baronial; also {{commissioned}} by the Oliver Gascoigne sisters, it is a 110-room private residence with 2 matching gate lodges built of pink sandstone quarried locally. It featured Minton encaustic tiles and stained glass, as well as decorative ceilings, all designed by the sisters. The stonework was built by Thos. H Carroll of Dublin; Messrs. Henry & Thos. <b>Creaser,</b> of York, were the contractors for the interior finishings; Johnston Silley & Co, Decorator, Dublin, executed the decorative paintwork (still being completed in 1857) & Mr John Walker, of Walker Iron Foundry, York, supplied all the ironwork of the roof, etc. [...] Monograms of Carroll and <b>Creaser,</b> the 2 main contractors, feature in a decorative terracotta panel set high in the gable overlooking the courtyard. See examples of this and other features: http://www.castle-oliver.com/Pages/Pics/Original-features.html Jones designed large stone gryphons, 11 of which sat on the balustrade surrounding the castle. These were probably carved from Portland Stone and disintegrated in the wet Irish climate in the early 20th century. Facsimiles have recently been created from photographic evidence and a limited edition made available http://www.triton.uk.com/index.php/showcase/commission-for-castle-oliver-in-ireland/. Small scale plans signed by Jones and dated 24 June 1845 are in the Manuscripts Room at Dublin Library. The castle is remarkable for its simple, but immensely effective and durable cast & wrought iron roof trusses, which were made in numbered component form in York and assembled on site. These trusses {{are believed to have}} been relatively 'cutting edge' at the time, although it appears that Walker Iron Foundry made similar ones in 1843 to restore the Nave roof of York Minster.

50|$|Martin O'Neill kept {{faith with}} the team that had come so close to {{promotion}} and the 1992-93 season started in similar fashion to the last one, with the side winning nine league games in a row. An exciting tie {{took place in the}} second round of the FA Cup, with the Blues drawn at home to Ossie Ardiles' Third Division side West Bromwich Albion. A stunning fightback, live on Sky TV, saw goals from Glyn <b>Creaser</b> and Steve Thompson take the Baggies back to the Hawthorns. The replay was also shown live, and an amazing 4,500 Wycombe fans made the journey to the black country. They saw Keith Scott hit a post before Bob Taylor snatched a goal winner just nine minutes from time. Even in injury-time the Wanderers came agonisingly close to snatching an equaliser, Steve Guppy just inches from connecting with a Simon Hutchinson cross.|$|E
50|$|Milton's {{title for}} the masque was not Comus (this was imposed later by scholars), but A Mask, Presented at Ludlow Castle. <b>Creaser</b> notes that it had become old-fashioned by the 1630s to use an {{occasional}} title such as this (consider other masque titles of the time such as Carew's Coelum Britanicum and Tempe Restored, etc.) This shows that Milton wanted to specifically draw attention to {{his work as a}} masque, asking the reader to hold in their minds all that this signified, as he consciously used and twisted the conventions of the genre to put across his particular message. For example, his audience would have been expecting, based on other masques of this time, that the antimasque would be dispelled by virtue (usually embodied by the King and Queen). Yet in Comus the Lady's virtue is not enough to save her: she is unable to dismiss Comus on her own. Even the heroic virtue of her brothers is not enough. Comus escapes rather than actually being defeated.|$|E
50|$|One trophy did prove elusive as Northwich Victoria came to Adams Park {{and won the}} Drinkwise Cup 3-2 {{in extra}} time.

Steve Shaughnessy pulled a goal back for the Linnets just before half-time. Just before the hour mark Steve Thompson headed home a Steve Guppy corner to make it 3-1 and Wycombe missed a number of chances to extend their lead. Dave Carroll made it 4-1 with a minute left when Runcorn goalkeeper Arthur Williams allowed his shot to slip through his fingers. There was a wonderful gesture as injured captain Glyn <b>Creaser</b> went up to collect the trophy.

5000|$|The {{second and}} most {{important}} date in Lumberjacks history happened in November 2014 when the MHL League stepped in and took over ownership of the team temporarily. At this point, the team was in serious jeopardy of being dissolved or at best, relocated. The idea of losing their team to another community when the League took over was devastating to the businesses and fans {{that had come to}} love the Lumberjacks. Identifying this, Larry <b>Creaser</b> with his passion for both hockey and the South Shore intervened. He recognized the opportunities this team provided for the players and its important place in the broader community. Without hesitation and without a single corporate dollar committed at the time, he gathered an experienced group with a vast knowledge of hockey as well as enthusiastic volunteers to get the Lumberjacks back on the path to success. The [...] "Bridgewater Lumberjacks", now owned and completely financed by Mr. <b>Creaser,</b> was also to be shared with the fans and the local communities. In an effort to achieve this, the team was promptly renamed the [...] "South Shore Jr. A Lumberjacks". In December, the success story began. Players, coaches and staff were immediately given the requisite attention and priority they deserved and it showed as wins on the ice began to increase, player community involvement was highly visible and fans began to flock to the rink once more. Seats at the games soon became the [...] "hottest ticket in town" [...] again, with the last home game of the season selling out to the tune of 1500 + fans. All this happened with talented hockey players, loyal fans and volunteers, sound marketing and promotions choices and strategic hockey operational decisions. These moves have created momentum for the upcoming season and the team has big game day and on ice plans. It’s the place to be on Friday night - watching talented young men work hard at becoming league championship contenders for their committed fans. Although our owner’s devotion to the sport of hockey, his commitment to giving back to this sport and his community are what led him to jump in to rescue the team from certain disastrous outcomes, it is his strong belief that the community should run a community team. It’s the only recipe for success. It’s a community team that requires the residents and businesses of our community to support the Club and have a team to call our own. We can all win and it’s as simple as success on the ice: Preparation, Practice and team Spirit equates to the kind of victory that makes us all so proud. Together, we can write a great story and create our own history. It’s a story where we all hold the pen.|$|E
50|$|As {{he did the}} {{previous}} summer, O'Neill kept faith in his squad. Just three of his players, Glyn <b>Creaser,</b> Mark West and Steve Thompson remained part-time as the club full-time {{for the first time}} in its history. The Football League imposed very stringent financial conditions on the club, after experiences with Maidstone United and Barnet The fixture list was also rather unhelpful, as the opening fixture of the 1993-94 season would be away at Carlisle United. However, more than 1,500 Chairboys and girls made the long journey and were part of a 7,752 crowd that witnessed history in the making. The newcomers endured a torrid opening 20 minutes, Rod Thomas giving the Cumbrians the lead. However, the Wanderers soon found their feet and equalised three minutes before half-time. The first Football League goal in the club's history was an own-goal scored by Chris Curran: with 18 minutes Steve Guppy became the first Wycombe player to score in the Football League when he turned the ball home at the far post; however, Curran made up for his error ten minutes later by firing home an equaliser and the game finished 2-2. A Keith Scott goal gave the Blues their first ever victory in the Football League, a 1-0 win over Chester City at Adams Park. The league newcomers made a great start, remaining unbeaten in their first eight league matches. After beating Leyton Orient 3-0 on aggregate in the first round of the Football League Cup the team came agonisingly close to knocking out Premier League Coventry City in the second round. A 3-0 first leg deficit was overturned and a Jason Cousins free-kick gave the Wanderers a 4-0 lead early in extra time. Goals from Steve Morgan and a deflected Phil Babb effort saw the Sky Blues through 5-4 on aggregate.|$|E
50|$|The 1988-89 {{season was}} {{surprisingly}} successful as Kelman built a side that achieved the club's highest ever league finish, {{fourth in the}} GM Vauxhall Conference. There was even hopes of the championship in the Spring of 1989 and 4,239 people saw the Wanderers beat Kidderminster Harriers 1-0 at Loakes Park, the largest attendance {{for more than a}} dozen years. That attendance was eclipsed a couple of months later when 4,890 witnessed Kettering Town steal a 1-0 win, the biggest Conference crowd that season. It was a result that put paid to any hopes of winning the league. They were also hopes of another Wembley visit in the FA Trophy, but 1,000 travelling Chairboys saw their dreams come crashing down on the plastic pitch of Hyde United, who created a shock by winning 1-0. Kelman had brought in players like Andy Robinson, Martin Blackler, Steve Abbley, Matt Crossley, John Kerr, Andy Kerr and Glyn <b>Creaser,</b> who cost £15,000 from Barnet After the devastating blow of defeat by Hyde, Kelman pulled off a transfer coup, signing the highly rated Barnet striker Nicky Evans for a non-league record fee of £32,000. Evans scored a brace on his debut against Boston United and hopes were high that the club could push on and challenge for the Football League again the following season. Kelman made more astute signings, bringing in Simon Stapleton and Steve Guppy. The team's results and performances were inconsistent. High-flying Barnet were beaten 1-0 and a 3-0 deficit at home to Kidderminister Harriers was turned around in dramatic fashion when John Kerr's diving header snatched a 3-3 draw five minutes from time. On the flip side Cheltenham Town handed out a 4-0 thrashing at Loakes Park and the team was hit for four again at Telford United. It was a hugely embarrassing 3-1 defeat at Loakes Park in the FA Trophy by the Metropolitan Police that heralded the end of Jim Kelman's reign. The cup exit played its part but the managers relationship with the board had been deteriorating for some time and Kelman handed in his resignation. Kelman's legacy would be there for all to see as his successor would build his historic side out of many of the players brought to the club by Kelman.|$|E
50|$|Inspirational captain Glyn <b>Creaser</b> {{suffered}} a bad injury to {{his foot and}} when the side went on a run of four games without a win in February and March 1993, local rivals Slough Town came within four points of the Blues, having played two games more. The sides met at Adams Park and a then record crowd of 7,230, with many more locked out, saw a tense game that was decided by a 27th winner from Keith Scott. Wanderers had to play most {{of the second half}} with ten men when Andy Kerr was sent off, but some determined defending and fine goalkeeping from Paul Hyde ensured the three points. Martin O'Neill signed striker Tim Langford from Telford United for £15,000 and the sides went on another run in the FA Trophy. Wins over Cheltenham Town, Morecambe, Bromsgrove Rovers and Gateshead led the club to semi-final with Sutton United, managed by former boss Alan Gane. The U's sprung a great shock by winning the first leg at Adams Park 3-2. The tie was missed by Keith Scott through injury and he even took to an oxygen chamber to get fit for the second leg. The tension was palpable as more than half the 5,002 crowd at Gander Green Lane travelled to support the Blues. Keith Scott was declared fit and after a number of missed chances, centre-back Matt Crossley headed home from a corner and immediate sunk to his knees with a mixture of joy and relief. The visitors came out in the second half and grabbed the tie by the throat. On 48 minutes Keith Scott headed home from a Guppy corner and three minutes later Matt Crossley swept home another corner, this time from Dave Carroll, to make it 3-0. Keith Scott was replaced by Mark West with 15 minutes and within three minutes with his first touch he crossed for Dave Carroll to finish emphatically to make it 4-0. The 6-3 aggregate win saw the Blues go back to Wembley and the pitch was engulfed by celebrating fans at the final whistle. The following week there was even more celebrations, after a 1-1 draw with nearest challengers Slough Town, a 5-1 thrashing of Runcorn at Adams Park, including a sensational solo goal from Steve Guppy, saw the Wanderers all but seal promotion to the Football League.|$|E

He was eventually tracked down and killed by his nest mates andwent to Purgatory where he spent around fifty years before Dean ended up there after killing Dick Roman. Benny saves Dean from another vampire and makes a deal with him: in exchange for Dean taking him with him, Benny will show him a portal out of Purgatory. Benny helps Dean find Castiel, warning him that traveling with an angel will get them killed, but Dean is insistent on all of them getting out. After Benny saves Castiel from Leviathans, he earns Dean's full trust and Dean carries him out of Purgatory in his arm. On Earth, Dean travels to Benny's grave and resurrects him. The two remain in touch, but stay separate until Benny goes after his nest for revenge and to protect himself from further attempts on his life. After Benny is injured, he calls Dean for help and together they take down the nest, with Benny killing his maker. However, Benny is reunited with Andrea who he learns was turned into a vampire instead of being killed. She helps him out, but to Benny's heartbreak, he learns that she has changed and wants to take over the pirating operation herself and Dean is forced to kill her to save Benny. Needing something to keep him on the straight and narrow, Benny moves to his hometown of Carencro, Louisiana where he meets and secretly looks out for his great-granddaughter Elizabeth. Rogue vampire Desmond tries to get Benny to join him, but Benny refuses and Desmond leaves a trail of bodies to try to get Benny to agree, drawing the attention of insane hunter Martin <b>Creaser</b> and Sam and Dean. Dean and Benny hunt down and kill Desmond, but Martin tries to kill Benny, using Elizabeth as a hostage. Benny is forced to kill him in self-defense and is left in a deteriorating situation worsened by the fact that Dean soon afterwards cuts off all contact. When Sam gets trapped in Purgatory, Dean goes to Benny for help, knowing he can get Sam out. Benny agrees, telling Dean he feels he no longer fits in on Earth. Dean kills Benny who saves Sam and Bobby Singer from vampires and leads them to the portal out. However Benny, who never intended to return to Earth, stays behind to hold off a group of vampires and allow Sam to escape. Benny is last seen fighting the vampires. Benny finally gains Sam's acceptance with this self-sacrifice and Dean buries his body instead of burning it in hopes of bringing him back one day.|$|E
