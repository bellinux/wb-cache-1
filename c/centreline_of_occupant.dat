40|$|CT colonography is an {{emerging}} technique for colorectal cancer screening. This technique facilitates noninvasive imaging {{of the colon}} interior by generating virtual reality models of the colon lumen. Manual navigation through these models is a slow and tedious process. It is possible to automate navigation by calculating the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the colon lumen. There are numerous well documented approaches for <b>centreline</b> calculation. Many <b>of</b> these techniques have been developed as alternatives to 3 D topological thinning which has been discounted by others due to its computationally intensive nature.

Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics, 55, Part 2, pp. 313 - 326 In this paper we investigate {{the existence of}} branches of embedded trapped modes {{in the vicinity of}} symmetric obstacles which are placed on the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> a twodimensional acoustic waveguide. Modes are sought which are antisymmetric about the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the channel and which have frequencies that are above the first cut-off for antisymmetric wave propagation down the guide. In previous work [1], a procedure for finding such modes was developed and it was shown numerically that a branch of trapped modes exists for an ellipse which starts from a flat plate on the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the guide and terminates with a flat plate perpendicular to the guide walls. In this work we show that further branches of such modes exist for both ellipses and rectangular blocks, each of which starts with a plate of different length on the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the guide. Approximations to the trapped mode wave numbers for rectangular blocks are derived from a two-term matched eigenfunction expansion and these are compared to the results from the numerical scheme described in [1]. The transition from trapped mode to standing wave which occurs at one end of each of the branches is investigated in detail...|$|R

5000|$|Despite the re-spacing of the {{cylinder}} bores, {{the cylinder}} head castings remained unchanged. As a result, the <b>centrelines</b> <b>of</b> the combustion chambers {{in the head}} no longer aligned precisely with the <b>centrelines</b> <b>of</b> the cylinders but this did not matter greatly as the combustion chamber diameters in the head were smaller than the cylinder diameters. The 3.8 and 4.2-litre cylinder heads and cams are therefore interchangeable. The 4.2-litre engine from the factory had unsmoothed steps between the inlet manifold and head, and the manifold gaskets were not a good match for the inlet ports. These engines therefore make excellent bases for some modification, achieving approx. [...] SAE net and increased torque merely by [...] "flowing" [...] the head.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} embedded trapped modes for symmetric obstacles which are placed on the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> a two-dimensional acoustic waveguide. Modes are sought which are antisymmetric about the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the channel but which have frequencies that are above the first cut-off for antisymmetric wave propagation down the guide. In the terminology of spectral theory {{this means that the}} eigenvalue associated with the trapped mode is embedded in the continuous spectrum of the relevant operator. A numerical procedure based on a boundary integral technique is developed to search for embedded trapped modes for bodies of general shape. In addition two approximate solutions for trapped modes are found;the first is for long plates on the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the channel and the second is for slender bodies which are perturbations of plates perpendicular to the guide walls. It is found that embedded trapped modes do not exist for arbitrary symmetric bodies but if an obstacle is defined by two geometrical parameters then branches of trapped modes may be obtained by varying both of these parameters simultaneously. One such branch is found for a family of ellipses of varying aspect ratio and size. The thin plates which are parallel and perpendicular to the guide walls are found to correspond to the end points of this branch...|$|R

40|$|Crash {{cushions}} are devices deployed on {{the road}} network in order to shield fixed roadside hazards and the non-crashworthy ends of road safety barriers. However crash cushions vary in terms of configuration and operation, meaning that different devices may also vary in terms of ability to mitigate occupant risk. In this study, data derived from crash testing of eleven redirective crash cushions is used as the base input to a numerical procedure for calculation <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> risk indicators Occupant Impact Velocity (OIV), Occupant Ridedown Acceleration (ORA) and longitudinal Acceleration Severity Index (ASI) {{for a range of}} simulated impacting vehicles (mass 800 kg to 2, 500 kg) impacting each crash cushion at a range of impact speeds (18 m/s to 32 m/s). The results may be interpreted as demonstrating firstly that enhanced knowledge of the performance of a device over a range of impact conditions, i. e., beyond the crash testing, may assist in determining the crash cushion most suited to a particular application; secondly that a more appropriate conformance test for occupant risk would be a frontal impact by a small (light) vehicle travelling parallel to and aligned with the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the crash cushion; and thirdly that current documented numerical procedures for calculating occupant risk indicators may require review...|$|R

40|$|The {{recovery}} of three-dimensional (3 D) object information from biplane CT angiographic images {{is still a}} challenge in application of modelling coronary vessel trees. The proposed method of 3 D reconstruction is obtained from the two-dimensional (2 D) corresponding feature points by using triangulation projection based on the rotated mechanical angles of the CT angiographic machine. Those 2 D feature points are on the <b>centrelines</b> <b>of</b> vessels. This research also includes how to extract the interested coronary vessels from CT angiographic images and how to represent those vessels {{as a group of}} connected 2 D points that are on <b>centrelines</b> <b>of</b> them. One of the contributions in the paper is that we developed automatic searching algorithm to obtain the 2 D corresponding points from a pair of biplane skeleton images under the two constraints of epipolar lines and corresponding bifurcations. We apply the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm to register the corresponding bifurcations from an image sequence for the application of the proposed searching algorithm. The 3 D reconstruction applies the readings of rotated mechanical angles and isocentre of the CT angiographic machine (Siemens Axiom) to establish the biplane image relationships of rotation and translation, and then projects the 2 D <b>centrelines</b> <b>of</b> coronary vessels onto 3 D world coordinates. Another contribution of the paper is that we apply the back projection algorithm to project the 3 D points onto 2 D image planes for evaluating the accuracy of the 3 D reconstruction. The proposed method has been tested on patient data. Key Words: 3 D reconstruction, biplane angiographic image, coronary vessel. ...|$|R

Objectives 1) Characterize the effects of age, BMI and gender on serious-to-fatal MVC injury 2) Identify the crash modes and body regions where the effects <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics onthe numbers <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> with injuryis largest, and thereby aid in prioritizing the need forhuman surrogates that the represent different types <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics and adaptive restraint systems that consider these characteristics. MethodsMultivariate logistic regression was used to model the effects <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics (age, BMI, gender), vehicle and crash characteristics on serious-to-fatal injuries (AIS 3 +) by body region and crash mode using the 2000 - 2010 National Automotive Sampling System (NASS-CDS) dataset.
