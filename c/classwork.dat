25|$|The Air Service revamped {{the course}} and {{extended}} it to nine months but later trimmed it to six with two classes a year. The first part consisted of ground school, stressing military training as well as <b>classwork</b> more {{directly related to the}} business of flying.|$|E
25|$|River Dell {{is based}} on a day with six 56-minute periods on a four-day {{rotating}} bell schedule. Each student is given their own laptop to use for <b>classwork</b> both for school and home use. The school has a large number of electives and courses.|$|E
25|$|Eating {{disorders}} are relatively common {{among college students}} and can be caused due to changes in lifestyle and stress levels. Examples of common stressors with college students are relationships, <b>classwork,</b> and lack of sleep, which can cause students to exhibit eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or binge eating.|$|E
25|$|Equally {{important}} to the teachings were the extracurricular activities that White developed to supplement the <b>classwork.</b> Later on, a Friday evening guest lecturer series included Stieglitz, Steichen, Paul Strand and Francis Bruguière. He also had school alumni Paul Outerbridge, Doris Ulmann and Anton Bruehl speak {{as part of the}} same series.|$|E
25|$|The two {{processes}} are equivalent. The former process was advantageous {{in the past}} when only tables of test statistics at common probability thresholds were available. It allowed a decision to be made without the calculation of a probability. It was adequate for <b>classwork</b> and for operational use, but it was deficient for reporting results.|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School became the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School, as the Air Force tried {{to enter into}} the {{research}} of space. Collins applied for a new course offered into the basics of spaceflight (other students included Charles Bassett, Edward Givens and Joe Engle). Along with <b>classwork</b> they also flew up to about 90,000 feet in F-104 Starfighters. As they passed through the top of their huge arc, they would experience a brief period of weightlessness. Finishing this course he returned to fighter ops in May 1963.|$|E
25|$|On June 6, 2014, the ESPN program Outside the Lines {{broadcast}} {{an interview}} with Rashad McCants, who was a starter on the North Carolina basketball team that won the 2005 NCAA championship, in which McCants claimed to have taken phony classes and had tutors write his <b>classwork.</b> However, all sixteen {{other members of the}} 2005 team released a statement which disputed McCants's account. Additionally, coach Roy Williams, separately interviewed by the same program, disputed McCants's claims. In contrast, in a noted 2004 interview with television station WRAL, McCants compared attending UNC with being in jail.|$|E
25|$|LCMS pastors are {{generally}} {{required to have}} a four-year bachelor's degree (in any discipline), {{as well as a}} four-year Master of Divinity degree, which is usually obtained from one of these institutions: Concordia Seminary in St. Louis or the Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana or at the two seminaries run by the Lutheran Church–Canada. Candidates may earn their Master of Divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either St. Louis or Ft. Wayne. Seminary training includes <b>classwork</b> in historical theology, Biblical languages (Biblical Greek and Hebrew), practical application (education, preaching, and mission), and doctrine (the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod).|$|E
25|$|The primary-school {{curriculum}} {{consisted of}} Chinese, mathematics, physical education, music, drawing, and elementary instruction in nature, history, and geography, combined with practical work experiences {{around the school}} compound. A general knowledge of politics and moral training, which stressed love of the motherland, love of the party, and love of the people (and previously love of Chairman Mao), was {{another part of the}} curriculum. A foreign language, often English, is introduced in about the third grade. Chinese and mathematics accounted for about 60 percent of the scheduled class time; natural science and social science accounted for about 8 percent. Putonghua (common spoken language) was taught in regular schools and pinyin romanization in lower grades and kindergarten. The Ministry of Education required that all primary schools offer courses on morality and ethics. Beginning in the fourth grade, students usually had to perform productive labor two weeks per semester to relate <b>classwork</b> with production experience in workshops or on farms and relate it to academic study. Most schools had after-hour activities at least one day per week to involve students in recreation and community service.|$|E
25|$|The band holds tryouts usually {{two weeks}} before school starts. This is {{somewhat}} variable as the band staff tries to allow for members to perform in Drum Corps International World Championships in Indianapolis. In recent years, DCI Finals night was held on a Saturday night, while OSUMB Candidate Days (for all prospective band members who have not made the band before) would begin the following Sunday morning. Due to a tighter schedule in 2016, Candidate Days were held during DCI Finals, and full band tryouts began the following morning. Typically this is avoided however, to allow incoming freshmen to finish a drum corps tour and then learn the OSU style in the two days prior to full band tryouts. Once the band is picked and until school starts up, the band practices {{three times a day}} Monday through Friday. Once school starts, the band rehearses Monday-Friday from 4:10-6:15 PM. However, the Band Center doors are typically not locked until midnight, as many band members will do other <b>classwork</b> while practicing and memorizing their music for the week's show. Many shows must be learned in as little as four days, with all music and drill committed to memory.|$|E
25|$|An {{internal}} {{investigation by the}} university released in 2011 and another investigation commissioned by former North Carolina governor Jim Martin in 2012 found numerous academic and ethical issues with the AFAM department, including unauthorized grade changes and faculty signatures, classes with very little teaching taking place, and a disproportionate proportion of the student-athletes enrolled in affected classes. Then in 2014 began charges and counter-charges between university officials and former learning specialist Mary Willingham, including disputes about statistics and methods of analysis by Willingham alleging that certain student-athletes are not academically qualified for college. Additionally, former basketball player Rashad McCants, {{a member of the}} North Carolina basketball team that won the 2005 NCAA championship, said that he took substandard classes and had much of his <b>classwork</b> done by tutors. As a result of these revelations, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed the university on probation for one year, which ended in June 2016. The NCAA completed its investigation in October of 2017, finding no violations of the NCAA's rules and imposing no athletic punishments. It affected a variety of different people in different ways, including coaches, players, judges, politicians, academics, rivals, whistleblowers, lawyers, alumni, mascots, college administrators, the NCAA, state governors, and journalists. The controversy sparked debate as to whether the university was educating some of its student-athletes properly and the role of NCAA Division I athletics in colleges.|$|E
500|$|Brown became Ohio State's head {{football}} coach in 1941 and recruited Gillom to the school. Gillom played on Ohio State's freshman team that year as an end opposite Dante Lavelli. Gillom was expected to move up to the varsity team the following year as a blocking back, but {{was kicked out of}} school in January for failing to maintain his grades. Brown later said Gillom did not fail any courses and was back at Ohio State doing [...] "some extra reading in history that he can make up", but his struggles with <b>classwork</b> ultimately kept him off the Ohio State team in 1942. Gillom enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II before he played on the varsity team.|$|E
500|$|The Virginia Tech Review Panel report {{shed light}} on {{numerous}} efforts by Cho's family to secure help for him as early as adolescence. However, when Cho reached 18 and left for college, the family lost its legal authority over him, and their influence on him waned. Cho's mother, increasingly concerned about his inattention to <b>classwork,</b> his classroom absences and his asocial behavior, sought help for him during summer 2006 from various churches in Northern Virginia. According to Dong Cheol Lee, minister of One Mind Presbyterian Church of Washington (located in Woodbridge) Cho's mother sought help from the church for Cho's problems. Lee added that [...] " [...] problem needed to be solved by spiritual power... that's why she came to our church– because we were helping several people like him." [...] Members of Lee's church even told Cho's mother that he was afflicted by [...] "demonic power" [...] and needed [...] "deliverance." [...] Before the church could meet with the family, however, Cho returned to school to start his senior year at Virginia Tech.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky's early {{separation}} {{from his mother}} caused an emotional trauma that lasted {{the rest of his}} life and was intensified by her death from cholera in 1854, when he was fourteen. Her loss also prompted Tchaikovsky to make his first serious attempt at composition, a waltz in her memory. Tchaikovsky's father, who had also contracted cholera but recovered fully, sent him back to school immediately in the hope that <b>classwork</b> would occupy the boy's mind. Isolated, Tchaikovsky compensated with friendships with fellow students that became lifelong; these included Aleksey Apukhtin and Vladimir Gerard. Music, while not an official priority at school, also bridged the gap between Tchaikovsky and his peers. They regularly attended the opera and Tchaikovsky would improvise at the school's harmonium on themes he and his friends had sung during choir practice. [...] "We were amused," [...] Vladimir Gerard later remembered, [...] "but not imbued with any expectations of his future glory." [...] Tchaikovsky also continued his piano studies through Franz Becker, an instrument manufacturer who made occasional visits to the school; however, the results, according to musicologist David Brown, were [...] "negligible".|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, {{the school}} was honored by the Provincial Government for an {{innovative}} program called [...] "Successmaker", which used computer software to help educators bring struggling students up to their normal skill levels {{in a number of}} fundamental areas such as reading and mathematics [...] with an average improvement worth 8 months of <b>classwork.</b> [...] The program, run by Gen Gleason, First Nations skills teacher, was featured in the [...] "Bright Lights: stories of success and excellence from B.C. elementary schools" [...] booklet which was distributed to all elementary schools in the province.|$|E
2500|$|Westmoor {{began the}} Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) program in 2001. On a normal schedule, a twenty-minute period is {{designated}} for SSR on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. [...] Starting in the 2005–06 school year, this period recurs on a rotating basis {{at the beginning}} of the 1st through 6th periods. During SSR, students and teachers are excluded from <b>classwork,</b> reading textbooks, or writing. Westmoor believes that giving students 17 minutes a day to read instead of giving them a homeroom period or study hall will improve their productivity as a student.|$|E
2500|$|He found {{a copy of}} Adrien Marie Legendre's Éléments de Géométrie, which, it is said, he read [...] "like a novel" [...] and {{mastered}} at {{the first}} reading. At 15, he was reading the original papers of Joseph Louis Lagrange, such as the Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations which likely motivated his later work on equation theory, and Leçons sur le calcul des fonctions, work intended for professional mathematicians, yet his <b>classwork</b> remained uninspired, and his teachers accused him of affecting ambition and originality in a negative way.|$|E
2500|$|The Ramah movement’s Israel {{programs}} include the Ramah Israel Seminar, a seven-week study tour of [...] Israel, and Tichon Ramah Yerushalayim (TRY and USY High), the Ramah Jerusalem High School (CEEB #475600), {{a high school}} semester-program in Israel. Students in grades 10–12 may choose to come on a 2-month track (USY High) or a 4-month track (TRY) in the spring semester. The highlight {{of the program is}} the intensive Israel Core Course, an 18 credit hour study of Israel from ancient times to the present, and which includes both fieldwork and engaging <b>classwork.</b> All studies are accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, with all AP courses certified through the College Board's AP Course Audit program.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Tam sophomore Ari Hoffman won a Marin County science fair, {{showing that}} fruit flies exposed to {{different}} doses of radiation had increased mutation rates and reduced fertility {{in proportion to}} the dose. [...] He was subsequently disqualified from the Bay Area Science Fair when officials ruled that his experiment, which resulted in the premature death of 35 of the 200 drosophila, had violated rules on the use of live animals. [...] After widespread news coverage, Hoffman was contacted by Nobel laureate Edward B. Lewis, a geneticist who had begun his own work with fruit flies while in high school. [...] Lewis congratulated Hoffman for his work and sent him a check. The science fair prize was reinstated. (As of 2009, after graduating from Stanford University and completing <b>classwork</b> at the University of California San Francisco Medical School, Hoffman is a predoctoral fellow in bioethics in the Clinical Research Training Program at the intramural campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 6, 2014, the ESPN program Outside the Lines aired an {{interview}} with Rashad McCants, a starter on the NCAA championship-winning 2004–05 team, in which {{he claimed to have}} taken phony classes and had tutors write his <b>classwork</b> to stay academically eligible. Coach Roy Williams, separately interviewed by ESPN, as well as McCants's teammates, disputed McCants's claims. [...] Four months later, Kenneth L. Wainstein, a former federal prosecutor hired by the university to investigate academic fraud reported by the media, issued a 131-page report showing at least 3,100 students took [...] "paper" [...] classes with artificially high grades over an 18-year period, and athletes were funneled to these classes by academic advisers. Wainstein reported that varsity athletes made up 1,871, or roughly half, of the enrollment, with the men's basketball team accounting for 12.1 percent (226) the athletes. Although two former UNC football coaches admitted knowing that a lot of students took the classes, there is no evidence the coaches knew the classes were irregular, and Williams denied knowledge (Dean Smith and Bill Guthridge, Williams' predecessors, were not interviewed because of poor health).|$|E
6000|$|Quite {{early in}} the volume Miss Ailie knew that her sister's hold on life was loosening. [...] "How bright the world {{suddenly}} seems," [...] Mr. McLean read, [...] "when there is the tiniest improvement in the health of an invalid one loves." [...] Is it laughable that such a note as this is appended to a recipe for beef-tea? [...] "It is surely not very wicked to pretend to Kitty that I keep some of it for myself; she would not take it all if she knew I dined on the beef it was made from." [...] Other entries showed too plainly that Miss Ailie stinted herself of food to provide delicacies for Miss Kitty. No doubt her expenses were alarming her when she wrote this: [...] "An interesting article in the Mentor says that nearly all of us eat and drink too much. Were we to mortify our stomachs we should be healthier animals and more capable of sustained thought. The word animal in this connection is coarse, but the article is most impressive, and a crushing reply to Dr. McQueen's assertion that the editor drinks. In the school-room I have frequently found my thoughts of late wandering from <b>classwork,</b> and I hastily ascribed it to sitting up during the night with Kitty or to my habit of listening lest she should be calling for me. Probably I had over-eaten, and I must mortify the stomach. A glass of hot water with half a spoonful of sugar in it is highly recommended as a light supper." ...|$|E
