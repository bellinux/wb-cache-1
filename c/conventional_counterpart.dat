On 6 February 1987, a prototype AS350 Z (a modified AS350 B2) conducted its first flight with a fenestron tail-rotor fitted {{in the place of}} its <b>conventional</b> <b>counterpart.</b> The AS350 Z test program stretched across several years, the aircraft receiving additional modifications such as a new air intake based on that of the Eurocopter EC120.

However, access and economic aspects are barriers that could hamper their consumption. Thus, the availability and price of such {{cereal products}} were evaluated in Northwestern México. The products were categorized in 10 groups. The data were collected in five cities by store visitation (from November 2015 to April 2016). The availability in specialized stores and supermarkets was expressed as availability rates based on {{the total number of}} products. The price of the SF, SR, and low GI products were compared with their <b>conventional</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Availability rates were higher in supermarkets than in specialized stores by product numbers (14. 29 % versus 3. 76 %, respectively; p < 0. 001) and by product categories (53. 57 % versus 26. 92 %, respectively; p < 0. 001). Five categories of products labeled as SF, SR, and low GI (oats, cookies and crackers, flours, snacks, and tostadas/totopos) had higher prices than their <b>conventional</b> <b>counterparts</b> (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, in Northwestern Mexico, the availability of SF, SR, and low GI cereal-based foods is relatively low, and these foods are more expensive than their <b>conventional</b> <b>counterparts...</b>|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} {{traditional}} conventional-style cowled chassis, International produced several stripped-chassis variants for transit-style school buses. Using many chassis and powertrain components from the S-Series, the front-engine 1853FC (FC=Forward Control) was produced from 1981 to 1981. Unlike the conventional, it was powered exclusively by diesel engines. In 1990, the 1853FC {{was replaced by the}} more advanced 3900. As with its predecessor, it again shared powertrain and chassis components with its <b>conventional</b> <b>counterpart.</b> In fixing a key drawback of the 1853FC, the 3900 would significantly reduce the interior space needed for the engine, freeing up space for the driver's compartment and front stairwell. The 3900 was produced until 2010.|$|E
50|$|The HRCC (High Ratio Compact Chamber) Jetta engine {{benefited from}} the lessons learned in nearly five years of {{fundamental}} research and testing of lean burn concepts on single- cylinder test engines. In its gasoline form, it claimed a thermal efficiency some 10 percent better than the standard engine, along with an improvement in actual economy of five percent. The HRCC cylinder head had different combustion chamber geometry and relocated spark plug and valves; the inlet system was revised, too, as was the camshaft profile. In combination with reshaped pistons, it produced a compression ratio of 13:1 — extremely high for the time — yet could run on lower octane fuel than its <b>conventional</b> <b>counterpart.</b>|$|E

The devices based on photonic crystal structures usually have the advantage of substantial size reduction compared to their <b>conventional</b> <b>counterparts,</b> which may lead to miniaturization and large-scale integration of optical and optoelectronic devices. In this dissertation, several novel optical devices based on photonic crystals are designed and analyzed, including a compact power splitter, a compact polarizing beam splitter, an optical intersection of nonidentical optical waveguides, and a single mode coupled resonator optical waveguide. The simulation results show superior advantages compared to their <b>conventional</b> <b>counterparts.</b> In addition, a new fabrication method based on combining a custom-built blue laser writer and the technique of optical holography is developed for the purpose of mass production of useful photonic crystal devices...|$|R

50|$|Over time, the AS350 Écureuil/AStar has {{received}} further development; while the aircraft's design remains broadly similar, various aspects and {{systems such as}} the rotor system, powerplants, and avionics have been progressively improved. On 6 February 1987, a prototype AS350 B2 flew with a fenestron tail-rotor {{in the place of}} its normal <b>conventional</b> <b>counterpart.</b> On 1 March 1997, the first AS350 B3, equipped with an Arriel 2B engine, performed its first flight. Various conversion programs and addons for AS350s have been produced and are offered by multiple third-party 'aftermarket' aerospace firms in addition to those available directly from the type's prime manufacturer. New variants of the Arriel-powered AS350B, the AS350 B1, AS350 B2, and AS350 B3, were progressively introduced; the later B3 differing from preceding models by the increasing use of digital systems, such as the Garmin-built G500H avionics suite and FADEC engine control system.|$|E
5000|$|The use {{of genetically}} {{modified}} seeds to grow commodity and other crops in the U.S. has drawn criticism from organizations such as Greenpeace, The Non-GMO Project, and the Organic Consumers Association among others. Concerns center on both food safety and the erosion of agricultural biodiversity. [...] While the European Union regulates genetically engineered foods as they would any other new product requiring extensive testing to provide it is safe for human consumption, the U.S. does not. The Food and Drug Administration generally considers a food with origins from genetically modified organisms (GMO) to be as safe as its <b>conventional</b> <b>counterpart.</b> [...] Numerous studies have backed industry claims that GMO foods appear to be safe for human consumption, including an examination of more than 130 research projects conducted in the European Union prior to 2010 and work published by the American Medical Association's Council on Science and Public Health.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel triple-permanent-magnet-excited (TPME) hybrid-flux magnetic gear (MG) that integrates a transverse-flux MG and an axial-flux MG {{into a single}} unit. Compared with its <b>conventional</b> <b>counterparts,</b> the proposed MG transmits a relatively high-torque density. When compared with the transverse-flux MG, this new structure employs a new configuration on the high-speed rotor, an extra iron segment between the low-speed rotor and the high-speed rotor to modulate the magnetic field, and hence contributing to the transmission of additional output torque. It also employs permanent magnets on the iron segments to produce additional torque. The proposed TPME hybrid-flux MG can offer a much higher torque transmission capacity than its <b>conventional</b> <b>counterparts,</b> making it more competitive for low-speed high-torque applications. A 3 -D finite-element method {{is used for the}} analysis of the magnetic field and evaluation of the output torque. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R

The scope of the analysis covers developing and developed countries, six world regions, and all countries combined. Results from the statistical analyses indicate that GM crops perform better than their <b>conventional</b> <b>counterparts</b> in agronomic and economic (gross margin) terms.
