The result is a diffraction pattern, that can be frequency analyzed to determine {{the distance to the}} measured surface. The main advantage with <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> is that only a single ray-path is needed for measuring, thus giving an opportunity to measure for instance the depth of a finely drilled hole.|$|E

Registration is challenging in organs that are deformable and lack features suitable for use as alignment fiducials (e. g. liver, kidneys, etc.). However, provided intraoperative sensing of surface contours can be accomplished, a variety of rigid and deformable 3 D surface registration techniques become applicable. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> as a new method to sense organ surface shape. We also describe potential advantages of <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography,</b> including the promise of replacing open surgery with a laparoscopic approach. Our feasibility study investigated use of a tracked off-the-shelf <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> unit to perform a surface scans on several types of biological and synthetic phantom tissues. After first exploring baseline accuracy and repeatability of distance measurements, we performed a number of surface scan experiments on the phantom and ex vivo tissues {{with a variety of}} surface properties and shapes. These indicate that <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> is capable of generating surface point clouds of at least comparable (and perhaps eventually improved) accuracy in comparison to published experimental laser triangulation-based surface scanning results...|$|E
40|$|Brain shift compromises the {{accuracy}} of neurosurgical image-guided interventions if not corrected by either intraoperative imaging or computational modeling. The latter requires intraoperative sparse measurements for constraining and driving model-based compensation strategies. <b>Conoscopic</b> <b>holography,</b> an interferometric technique that measures the distance of a laser light illuminated surface point from a fixed laser source, was recently proposed for non-contact surface data acquisition in image-guided surgery and is used here for validation of our modeling strategies. In this contribution, we use this inexpensive, hand-held <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> device for intraoperative validation of our computational modeling approach to correcting for brain shift. Laser range scan, instrument swabbing, and <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> data sets were collected from two patients undergoing brain tumor resection therapy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The results of our study indicate that <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> is a promising method for surface acquisition since it requires no contact with delicate tissues and can characterize the extents of structures within confined spaces. We demonstrate that for two clinical cases, the acquired conoprobe points align with our model-updated images better than the uncorrected images lend-ing further evidence that computational modeling approaches improve {{the accuracy}} of image-guided surgical interventions {{in the presence of}} soft tissue deformations. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{advances}} in registration have extended intra-surgical image guidance from {{its origins in}} bone-based procedures to new applications in soft tissues, thus enabling visualization of spatial relationships between surgical instruments and subsurface structures before incisions begin. Preoperative images are gener-ally registered to soft tissues through aligning segmented volumet-ric image data with an intraoperatively sensed cloud of organ sur-face points. However, there is currently no viable noncontact min-imally invasive scanning technology that can collect these points through a single laparoscopic port, which limits wider adoption of soft-tissue image guidance. In this paper, we describe a system based on <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> {{that is capable of}} minimally inva-sive surface scanning. We present the results of several validation experiments scanning ex vivo biological and phantom tissues with a system consisting of a tracked, off-the-shelf, relatively inexpensive <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> unit. These experiments indicate that cono-scopic holography is suitable for use with biological tissues, and can provide surface scans of comparable quality to existing clinically used laser range scanning systems that require open surgery.

When defining a digitizing procedure {{of this type}} of features, two approaches could be applied: discrete or continuous scanning. Discrete Scanning (D) is performed with a static sensor, but the information for each single measurement comes from a constrained area. On the other hand, since Continuous Scanning (C) is carried out with a moving sensor, the information for each single measurement comes from a swept area. In this work, a comparison between these two approaches, when digitizing with a <b>Conoscopic</b> <b>Holography</b> sensor, is performed.

40|$|AbstractConoscopic Holography is a {{non-contact}} digitizing {{technique used}} in inspection and reverse engineering tasks. A laser beam is projected onto a surface, and its reflection generates a holographic pattern inside the sensor.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess angle-dependent {{systematic}} errors and measurement uncertainties for a <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> laser sensor mounted on a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). The main contribution of our work is the definition of a methodology for the derivation of point-sensitive systematic and random errors, which must be determined in order to evaluate the accuracy of the measuring system. An ad hoc three dimensional artefact has been built for the task. The experimental test has been designed so as to isolate the effects of angular variations from those of other influence quantities that might affect the measurement result. We have found the best measurand to assess angle-dependent errors, and found some preliminary results on the expression of the systematic error and measurement uncertainty as a function of the zenith angle for the chosen measurement system and sample material...|$|E
40|$|In {{the complex}} {{procedure}} {{for the conservation}} of a work of art, the effective monitoring of the surface treatment, together with the diagnosis {{of the state and the}} characteristics of the degradation, is an important step in order to establish a conservation protocol and, in particular, to define guidelines and hence allow for the conservator to adopt the correct cleaning procedure. The evaluation of the effects of the cleaning requires that the outermost layer of the artwork be inspected with complementary diagnostic techniques to gain information on both materials and surface morphology. In this work, following this integrated approach, a custom device based on laser <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> was jointly used with laboratory microscopy techniques for testing the performance of different mechanical procedures for the cleaning of silver alloy objects. Tarnishing is the main alteration phenomenon for silver alloy artworks, due to the interaction of silver with sulphur-containing compounds in the environment. Even if this modification does not affect the conservation of the objects, it heavily influences aesthetical features. Thus, one of the most important conservation treatments in this case is the removal of tarnishing. Many different cleaning techniques are proposed, based on mechanical, electrochemical, chemical and physical methods. The mechanical procedure, based on the use of an abrasive powder suspended in a liquid matrix, is of widespread use due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Here, a dry cleaning process based on the use of erasers is tested and compared with traditional mechanical methods. The proposed procedure is expected to effectively remove tarnishing and produce less morphological alteration of the surface than traditional methods. Silver alloy mockups were artificially tarnished and cleaned using five different erasers and two traditional mechanical methods (calcium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate suspended in water). The effects of these processes on the surface morphology were studied using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. These techniques were proven effective to detect the single defects locally; however, they cannot provide an objective measure of the average roughness at micrometric scale over the sample. To this aim, the surface structure was investigated with multiscale profilometry, using scanning <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> and atomic-force microscopy, in order to inspect the alteration of morphology from microscopic to nanoscopic scales. 3 D surface metrology is carried out using ISO- 25178 standards areal parameters. The multi-technique methodology is described, from the information provided by the single method and the limit of the performance to the multiscale integration. As reflective metal is challenging for optical techniques, the effectiveness of the optical profilometry device, based on <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> and custom setup, is discussed in term of its effective resolution. Preliminary results are presented, which indicate that the proposed dry cleaning methods are very efficient in removing tarnishing and that produces mechanical damages less or similar to traditional methods. The optical profilometry results are of particular significance since this technique allows an in-situ use and a real monitoring of actual artwork surfaces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, a <b>Conoscopic</b> <b>Holography</b> (CH) sensor {{integrated}} in a Machining Centre (MC) {{was used for}} analysing how the measurements taken {{are influenced by the}} location of the digitized surface within depth of field (DOF). With this aim, two different digitizing strategies were conducted on a stepped specimen with flat surfaces. In the first strategy each step of the specimen was located at different positions within DOF whereas the CH sensor was kept at a constant height along the scanning of all steps. In the second strategy the sensor height was adapted so that each step was scanned at the same distance within DOF. The comparison between both strategies was performed by calculating the discrepancies between measurements taken by the CH sensor and those obtained by a touch probe (TP) also installed in the MC. Finally, the study provides a series of recommendations for practical application of the sensor...|$|E
40|$|A new {{instrument}} {{was developed for}} chemical characterization of surfaces that combines the analytical power of Raman spectroscopy with the three-dimensional topographic information provided by <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography.</b> The figure schematically depicts the proposed hybrid instrument. The output of the conoscopic holographic portion of the instrument is a topographical map of the surface; {{the output of the}} Raman portion of the instrument is hyperspectral Raman data, from which the chemical and/or biological composition of the surface would be deduced. By virtue of the basic principles of design and operation of the instrument, the hyperspectral image data would be inherently spatially registered with the topographical data. In <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography,</b> the object and reference beams of classical holography are replaced by the ordinary and extraordinary components generated by a single beam traveling through a birefringent, uniaxial crystal. In the basic conoscopic configuration, a laser light is projected onto a specimen and the resulting illuminated spot becomes a point source of diffuse light that propagates in every direction. The laser beam is rasterscanned in two dimensions (x and y) perpendicular to the beam axis (z), and at each x,y location, the pattern of interference between the ordinary and extraordinary rays is recorded. The recorded interferogram constitutes the conoscopic hologram. Of particular significance for the proposed instrument is that the conoscopic hologram contains information on the z coordinate (height) of the illuminated surface spot. Hence, a topographical map of the specimen is constructed point-by-point by rastering the laser beam in the x and y directions and correlating the x and y coordinates with the z information obtained from the interferograms. Conoscopic imaging is an established method, and conoscopic laboratory instruments for surface metrology are commercially available. In Raman spectroscopy of a surface, one measures the spectrum of laser light scattered inelastically from a laser-illuminated spot on the surface. The wavelengths of the inelastically scattered light differ from that of the incident laser beam by amounts that correspond to the energies of molecular vibrations. The resulting vibrational spectrum can be used to identify the molecules. Raman spectroscopy is a standard laboratory technique for identifying mineralogical, biological, and other specific chemical compositions...|$|E

40|$|<b>Conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> (CH) is a {{non-contact}} interferometric {{technique used}} for surface digitization which presents several advantages over other optical {{techniques such as}} laser triangulation. Among others, the ability for the reconstruction of high-sloped surfaces stands out, and so does its lower dependence on surface optical properties. Nevertheless, similarly to other optical systems, adjustment of CH sensors requires an adequate selection of configuration parameters for ensuring a high quality surface digitizing. This should be done on a surface located {{as close as possible}} to the stand-off distance by tuning frequency (F) and power (P) until the quality indicators Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and signal envelope (Total) meet proper values. However, not all the points of an actual surface are located at the stand-off distance, but they could be located throughout the whole working range (WR). Thus, the quality of a digitized surface may not be uniform. The present work analyses how the quality of a reconstructed surface is affected by its relative position within the WR under different combinations of the parameters F and P. Experiments have been conducted on AISI 316 wire EDM machined flat surfaces. The number of high-quality points digitized as well as distance measurements between different surfaces throughout the WR allowed for comparing the metrological behaviour of the CH sensor with respect to a touch probe (TP) on a CMM...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the sequence of line crossings is still a current problem {{in the field of}} forensic documents examination. Optical examination, lifting technique, ESDA technique, and electron microscopy are the most widely used methods for the {{determination of}} the writing order of crossing texts. However, at present many examinations of intersecting lines result in an inconclusive opinion, particularly if the same type and colour of ink is involved. This paper presents the potentiality of the 3 D laser profilometry, which has been to determine the chronological sequence of homogenous ‘‘crossing lines’’. The laser profilometry, illustrated in this paper, has been developed on a <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> based system. It is a non-contact three-dimensional measuring system that allows producing holograms, even with incoherent light, with fringe periods that can be measured precisely to determine the exact distance to the point measured. This technique is suitable to obtain a 3 D micro-topography with high resolution also on surfaces with unevenness reflectivity (usual for the paper surface). The proposed technique is able to obtained 3 D profile in non-invading way. Therefore, the original draft are not physically or chemically modified, allowing a multi-analysis in different times. The experiments performed with line crossings database show that the proposed method is able of ‘‘positive identification’’ of writing sequence in the majority of the tests. In absence of a positive identification, the result has been "inconclusive" (no false determination did occur in this work) ...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{optical memory}} discs store {{information}} {{in the form of}} pits embossed on the disc. The minimum size of the pit marks is limited by the resolution of the optical system used to read the disc. Our investigations, presented in this thesis, are primarily concerned with the question, "Can an optical disc memory be designed so that an optical system can recover information from symbols (pit marks or otherwise) which are normally unresolved?" When an optical system can determine unresolved features of an object, then superresolution has been accomplished. We describe an experiment to recover information about lines with a width one fifth the minimum resolvable feature size. The result uncovers an important difference between an optical memory and a classical optical imaging system: in an optical memory, we can use a priori information about the finite number of possible stored states. The next investigation is for superresolution in depth, rather than for a lateral direction. We select the method of <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> and demonstrate the ability to measure the depth of a reflecting surface with an accuracy better than one-tenth the depth of focus of the optical system. To allow the design and analysis of a memory format, we formulate an integral method to calculate diffraction for large numerical aperture focused beams on nonperiodic two-dimensional structures. The numerical method is tested for numerical convergence and accuracy, and some comparisons of numerical results and experimental measurements are also shown. We then use the numerical method extensively to analyze a variety of formats and structures...|$|E
40|$|Facial {{prosthetics}} {{are becoming}} a necessary step for the recovery of injured veterans and civilians who have suffered severe facial burning. Current users of such prosthetics {{are not able to}} wear the prosthetic {{for an extended period of}} time due to uncomfortable conditions created by the silicone material. A solution for this problem was to develop a process for creating small holes similar to skin pores that will both ventilate and aid in the evaporation of accumulated sweat under the prosthetic. The main steps of this process were to create a flexible fixture capable of supporting and securing the prosthetic during processing, creating a process for using a computer measuring machine to scan the varying and unique contours of the human face, and a process for converting the data into code that can be read by a CNC laser to create the holes. The approach for this project was to first design and fabricate the flexible fixture. The fixture consists of a stainless steel base connected and supported with steel rods and various connecting hardware. The top portion of the fixture is a plaster of paris mold that will be unique to each prosthetic and allows the flimsy silicone to be secured without unnecessary damage. The next process was to use a computer measuring machine (CMM) to record all contours of the prosthetic. To accomplish this, linear scans across the surface of the face were completed using a ball-probe taking measurements of its position across 100 points. The ball-probe measured 60 degrees to each side from the middle of the face, incrementing 1 degree for each scan. After the data was collected, an Excel program was used to convert the data into G-code that allowed the CNC controller to process the information. With the fixture loaded into a 4 th axis indexer, which allows access to all portions of the face, the final processing step using the CNC laser was completed. The CNC laser used the points measured from the CMM to position itself for each individual cut. The completed prosthetic was successful in increasing the airflow and ventilation but still requires further research to fully solve the problem. The overall process is sound but will require additional equipment for a fully completed prosthetic. One of the recommended changes is to use a more accurate measuring system such as <b>conoscopic</b> <b>holography</b> or a structured light 3 -D scanner which will increase both the accuracy and efficiency of the scanning process. Another recommendation is to incorporate a 5 th axis into the head of the laser to reach areas of the prosthetic that are too steep to reach using just a 4 th axis. The current cost of both producing the fixture and running the processes is $ 1, 523. 96. This cost is justified because it represents less than 10 % of the total current cost for a completed prosthetic...|$|E
