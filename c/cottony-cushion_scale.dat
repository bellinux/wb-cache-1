50|$|Hermaphroditism is {{extremely}} {{rare in the}} insect world despite the comparatively common nature of this condition in the crustaceans. Several species of Icerya, including the pestiferous <b>cottony-cushion</b> <b>scale,</b> Icerya purchasi, {{are known to be}} hermaphrodites that reproduce by self-fertilising. Occasionally reproductively functioning males are produced from unfertilised eggs but generally individuals are monoecious and with a female-like nature but possessing an ovotestis which is part testis part ovary and sperm is transmitted ovarially from the female to her young. This hermaphroditic sexual self-sufficiency where a single individual can populate new territory has contributed to the invasive spread of the <b>cottony-cushion</b> <b>scale</b> insect away from its native Australia.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Cottony-Cushion</b> <b>Scale,</b> Icerya purchasi Maskell, is an {{important}} pest of citrus and ornamentals. The first objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the spatial distribution of this insect on the orange trees, in southwest Iran. The second objective was to develop sampling plans to determine sample sizes for fixed levels of precision and fixed-precision-level stop lines for sequential sampling. Population estimates were made by registering the number of various stages of the scale on 40 twigs at 10 days intervals from 2003 to 2004. Taylor`s power law and Iwao`s patchiness regression were used to analyze the spatial distribution of the pest. Taylor`s power law fitted the data better (R 2 = 0. 80) than Iwao`s regression model (R 2 = 0. 72), indicating that I. purchasi populations were aggregated. Optimal sample sizes for fixed precision levels of 0. 10 and 0. 25 were estimated with Taylor`s regression coefficients. Required sample sizes increased dramatically with increased levels of precision. The sampling plans presented should be a tool for research on population dynamics and pest management decision...|$|E

Citrus is Israel’s number one fresh fruit export {{and must be}} free of pests and blemishes. Pest management in citrus groves in Israel is more-or-less satisfactory biological control of most aphids, scales, whiteflies, and mites [1]. Insecticides are used to control four primary pest species for which biological controls are insufficient: Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), citrus mealybug, citrus rust mite, and California red scale. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Israel’s citrus groves {{has been based on}} the judicious use of relatively selective insecticides, in combination with biological control. It has been estimated that 100 % of the citrus in Israel is managed with IPM [2]. <b>Cottony-cushion</b> <b>scale</b> had a devastating effect on citrus groves in Israel in the early 1900 s and has been kept under effective control by the predatory vedalia beetle introduced in 1912. When Green’s mealybug appeared as a serious pest of citrus in the 1930 ’s it was controlled by a parasite introduced in 1940 from Japan [3]. Another parasite introduced in 1952 from the USA controlled the long-tailed mealybug. The Florida red scale, considered the most important pest of Israel in the 1950 s, was brought under complete control in most areas by a parasite imported from Hong Kong [3]. Four species of very damaging whiteflies have been introduced into Israel in the last few decades. The introductio...|$|E
