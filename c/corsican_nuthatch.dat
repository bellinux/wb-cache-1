5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> which is closely linked with Corsican pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|E
5|$|The nuthatches {{are all in}} {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch refers to the {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> has a pu-pu-pu {{call and}} a trilled hididididididi song.|$|E
50|$|Predation is an {{important}} cause for the breeding failure of the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch.</b> The most important predator {{is believed to be}} the great spotted woodpecker which is relatively abundant in the pine forests. The <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> takes no action to protect its nest from predation unlike other nuthatch species such as the Eurasian nuthatch that reduces the size of the entrance hole with mud or the red-breasted nuthatch that covers the inner surfaces with pine resin. Instead the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> excavates its own nest and creates only a narrow entrance hole of around 3.2 cm. This compares with the 5 - 6 cm hole made by the great spotted woodpecker for the entrance to its own nest.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} {{and four other}} species — the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> the Chinese nuthatch, the Algerian nuthatch and the Krüper's nuthatch — {{were thought to be}} a single species. These five make up a well-defined species group known as the [...] "Sitta canadensis group", and are sometimes considered to be a superspecies. Within the species group, DNA {{studies have shown that the}} {{red-breasted nuthatch}}, the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> and the Chinese nuthatch make up one clade and the Algerian nuthatch and Krüper's nuthatch make up a sister clade. The red-breasted nuthatch is monotypic across its extensive range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is a {{resident}} bird {{of the mountain}} forests of Corsica, and is closely associated with Corsican pine (Pinus nigra spp. laricio) preferably with some very old trees aged 300 years or more for nesting.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (Sitta whiteheadi) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} {{bird that}} is endemic to Corsica, where {{it is the only}} nuthatch. It is restricted to mature stands of Corsican pine (Pinus nigra spp. laricio) which grow at altitudes of from 800 to 1600 m.|$|E
5000|$|The Territorial Forests of Corsica, an area {{covering}} 13,223 hectares between 200 and 2057 metres altitude. There {{are three}} species of protected birds: the Northern goshawk ((Corsica ssp.) Accipiter gentilis arrigonii (Kleinschmidt, 1903)), the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos (Linnaeus, 1758)), and the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (Sitta whiteheadi Sharpe, 1884) {{in the high}} pine forests.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the genus}} the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> {{belongs to the}} canadensis group which also {{includes}} the red-breasted nuthatch (S. canadensis), the Chinese nuthatch (S. villosa), Krüper's nuthatch (S. krueperi) and the Algerian nuthatch (S. ledanti). [...] These six species usually excavate their own nests and all except the Algerian nuthatch specialize in extracting seeds from pine cones. All {{members of the group}} also exhibit sexually dimorphism in the colour of their head feathers. Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is most closely related to the Chinese nuthatch and that they diverged from a common ancestor around 0.96 million years ago. [...] The large distance separating the ranges of the two sister species is very unusual for Palaearctic passerines. The Yunnan nuthatch is a sister species to the canadensis group and has many common features.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> was {{discovered}} by the English collector John Whitehead in June 1883 when he shot a specimen while on a trip in the Corsican mountains. When he showed the skin to Bowdler Sharpe who was the curator of the bird collection at the British Museum, Sharpe recognised that the bird represented an undocumented species and published a short description. Whitehead returned to Corsica in May 1884 to collect additional specimens and discovered that the species was sexually dimorphic in colour; the bird he had shot the previous year had been a male bird. Sharpe used the additional specimens gathered by Whitehead to publish a fuller description of the species.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} months the diet of the <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch</b> {{consists}} almost entirely of seeds from Corsican pines. The birds use their long pointed bills to extract the seeds from mature cones that open in fine weather between November and March. Many of the individual seeds are hoarded by the birds in crevices in the bark. These cached seeds are recovered during bad weather when the cones do not open as unlike crossbills, nuthatches are unable to extract seeds from closed cones. In the spring, during the breeding season, the birds feed mainly on arthropods. In May 1884 when Whitehead opened the gizzards of birds that he had shot, he found that they contained small beetles and other insects.|$|E

50|$|The {{island has}} a natural park (Parc Naturel Régional de Corse, Parcu di Corsica), which protects rare {{animal and plant}} species. The Park was created in 1972 and {{includes}} the Golfe de Porto, the Scandola Nature Reserve (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), {{and some of the}} highest mountains on the island. Scandola cannot be reached on foot, but people can gain access by boat from the village of Galéria and Porto (Ota). Two endangered subspecies of hoofed mammals, the mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) and Corsican red deer (Cervus elaphus corsicanus) inhabit the park. The Corsican red deer was re-introduced after it was extinct due to over hunting. This Corsican subspecies was the same that survived on Sardinia, so it's endemic. There are other species endemic to Corsica especially in the upper mountain ranges, i.e. <b>Corsican</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> Corsican fire salamander and Corsican brook salamander and many plant subspecies.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Corsican</b> <b>Nuthatch</b> (Sitta whiteheadi) is red-listed as {{vulnerable}} to extinction by the IUCN {{because of its}} endemism, reduced population size, and recent decline. A further cause is the fragmentation and loss of its spatially-restricted favourite habitat, the Corsican pine (Pinus nigra laricio) forest. In this study, we aimed at estimating {{the potential impact of}} climate change on the distribution of the <b>Corsican</b> <b>Nuthatch</b> using species distribution models. Because this species has a strong trophic association with the Corsican and Maritime pines (P. nigra laricio and P. pinaster), we first modelled the current and future potential distribution of both pine species in order to use them as habitat variables when modelling the nuthatch distribution. However, the Corsican pine has suffered large distribution losses in the past centuries due to the development of anthropogenic activities, and is now restricted to mountainous woodland. As a consequence, its realized niche is likely significantly smaller than its fundamental niche, so that a projection of the current distribution under future climatic conditions would produce misleading results. To obtain a predicted pine distribution at closest to the geographic projection of the fundamental niche, we used available information on the current pine distribution associated to information on the persistence of isolated natural pine coppices. While common thresholds (maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity) predicted a potential large loss of the <b>Corsican</b> <b>Nuthatch</b> distribution by 2100, the use of more appropriate thresholds aiming at getting closer to the fundamental distribution of the Corsican pine predicted that 98 % of the current presenc...|$|E
40|$|The endemic <b>Corsican</b> <b>Nuthatch</b> Sitta whiteheadi {{population}} {{is small and}} currently restricted to mountain forests of Corsican Pine Pinus nigra laricio. An estimate of annual survival rate is an important parameter to allow evaluation of extinction risk. Adult Corsican Nuthatches were colour-ringed and resighted on territory in the Ascu Valley, central Corsica, from 1998 to 2005. Mark–recapture methods were used to estimate the annual apparent survival rate of male Corsican Nuthatches as 0. 616 (95 % CI 0. 524 – 0. 700), the best model being independent of time. The longest lifespan recorded for any individual was five years and seven months. During the study, there was no strong evidence that annual survival was affected by the variation in a key food source, Corsican Pine seeds...|$|E
