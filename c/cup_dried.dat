Methods: The research design was time series design. The participants were 27 nurses with shoulder pain at P University Hospital in Busan metropolitan city from July 6, 2009 to August 3, 2009. The <b>dry</b> <b>cupping</b> therapy was done 4 times, twice a week for 2 weeks. Before intervention, the severity and frequency of pain and fatigue were measured three times at one week intervals, and then those were measured after one week and two weeks of experimental treatment.

The utilization of <b>dry</b> <b>cupping</b> therapy on a 20 -year-old collegiate baseball pitcher with diagnosed thoracic outlet syndrome is presented. Background: Thoracic outlet syndrome is a relatively rare musculoskeletal condition affecting 1 / 100, 000 patients annually. <b>Dry</b> <b>cupping</b> therapy is an ancient therapeutic modality that utilizes various means of suction {{with the goal of}} decompressing myofascial layers. Treatment: Following diagnosis, patient was successfully treated in two weeks using <b>dry</b> <b>cupping</b> therapy. The patient experienced no further incidence of thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms and was able to complete the remainder of his competitive season. Uniqueness: The patient’s thoracic outlet syndrome was diagnosed at an early stage, leading to the need of clearance from a vascular specialist before returning to competition. To the author’s knowledge, there are currently no published case reports detailing the use of cupping therapy to treat thoracic outlet syndrome. Conclusion: Cupping therapy may be a viable treatment option when seeking to address tight musculature.

40|$|Context: The iliotibial band (ITB) is a muscle-like {{structure}} {{on the outside}} of the thigh and plays a vital role in movement and can become tight if overused. This tightness can lead to a wide array of injuries in an otherwise healthy individual. Previous research has proved the need to treat a tight ITB, but techniques previously researched have not proven to be effective in reducing ITB tightness. <b>Dry</b> <b>cupping</b> is a method in which suction is generated from a vacuum-sealed cup using a pump in order to alleviate pain, reduce tightness, and promote healing. Recently, cupping has been used as a therapeutic treatment to relieve muscular tightness. Currently, there is no research on the effectiveness of <b>dry</b> <b>cupping</b> in relieving lower extremity tightness, particularly ITB tightness Objective: To determine if <b>dry</b> <b>cupping</b> is an effective treatment intervention in releasing ITB tightness and increasing hip and knee range of motion in a physically active population. Design: Controlled laboratory study with randomization and clinician and participant blindness. Setting: Athletic Training Laboratory Patients or Other Participants: Forty healthy participants (17 males, 23 females; age: 21 ± 1. 8 years; height: 170. 94 ± 10. 81 cm; weight: 74. 20 ± 13. 67 kg) with ITB tightness as determined by a positive Ober’s test (- 12. 79 ± 6. 86 degrees). Participants were excluded if there was current pain and/or injury to the leg in the past year, had an intervention for ITB tightness in the past three months, blood flow dysfunctions, hemorrhagic disorders, cancer, or a possibility of pregnancy. Intervention(s) : <b>Dry</b> <b>cupping</b> or sham cupping. Participants were placed in a side-lying position with pillow between slightly bent knees. Four stationary cups were placed along the ITB for seven minutes. Cup placement was determined based off a scanning technique used to identify areas with adhesions. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Angle of hip adduction achieved during Ober’s test, active and passive hip flexion, and active and passive knee flexion. Results: There were no significant differences between groups for any measure (p 3 ̆e. 305). However, after running effect sizes between groups for immediate post and 24 hours after intervention, some variables had strong effects, namely Ober’s (immediate post: -. 66 (- 1. 3 - -. 03); 24 -hours post: -. 67 (- 1. 3 - -. 03)) and active and passive hip flexion (active 24 -hours post:. 67 (. 03 - 1. 3); passive 24 -hours post:. 66 (. 02 - 1. 29)). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a single intervention of <b>dry</b> <b>cupping</b> is probably effective in reducing ITB tightness and increasing hip flexion ranges of motion. These changes can be observed 24 hours post intervention in addition to immediately after the intervention. This study supports the assumption that <b>dry</b> <b>cupping</b> may be a safe and effective treatment option to combat ITB tightness seen by clinicians...|$|R
