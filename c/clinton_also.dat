50|$|The <b>Clintons</b> were <b>also</b> {{the first}} to use the East Room for most state dinners, rather than the much smaller State Dining Room. The reason was size: The State Dining Room could {{accommodate}} only about 136 people, while the East Room sat 260. The <b>Clintons</b> <b>also</b> used marqees, set up on the South Lawn of the White House, for state dinners, which allowed seating to run as high as 700 individuals. President George W. Bush, however, returned to the practice of hosting state dinners almost exclusively in the State Dining Room. The gold-upholstered chairs were often removed for meals and replaced with smaller chairs from elsewhere in the White House, as they proved too bulky to accommodate large numbers of guests around dining tables.|$|R

5|$|Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.

Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton {{created the}} William J. Clinton Foundation {{to address issues}} of global importance. This {{foundation}} includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and {{has worked with the}} Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict. In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.

5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. <b>Clinton</b> <b>also</b> pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
