Since Plasmodium falciparum was resistance to one or more/multi-drug and spreading out almost all over thecountry, and P. vivax resistance occurred in several endemic areas, the need of accuracy of the {{diagnosis was}} becomingincreasingly important. Methods: This paper discusses malaria laboratory situation analysis in two endemic areas. Two endemic areas representing Western and Eastern Part of Indonesia (Lampung and East Nusa Tenggara province) were selected. The respondents were laboratory microscopist from Province-Health Laboratories, Provinces had sufficient laoatory knowledge, except in Province Hospital laboratories.   Results: The East Nusa Tenggara Province Hospital, Lampung District Health Office and Health Center (HC) laboratories had not enough light and space to work, nor running water supply. The Guideline manual for malaria examination is very limited and only available in HC. Cross <b>check</b> <b>mechanism</b> did not work well due to budget limitation.

40|$|Description Logic (DL) formalisms {{have gained}} success in many {{application}} areas such as knowledge representation, database reasoning, multi-agent systems, semantic web, and ontology reasoning. The most explored reasoning approach for DLs is the tableau approach. Existing tableau-based DL systems essentially exploit the various kinds of the tree-model properties of DLs. It is known that the (standard) loop checking procedure is avoidable only in tableau algorithms for inexpressive DLs. Loop <b>checking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are vital for logics with universal modalities, TBox reasoning, and/or transitive roles. However, the standard loop checking rule has various disadvantages. From a practical perspective implementation in a DL prover usually requires quite considerable effort. The standard loop <b>checking</b> <b>mechanism</b> is very sensitive to a notion of a finite type in a particular DL. Since {{the notion of a}} type varies from one logic to another, small changes {{in the language of the}} underlying DL and/or in the tableau procedure can force considerable redesign and refactoring of the code related to the loop checking. In this paper we propose and study alternative loop <b>checking</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Our facilitation of loop checking uses inference rules which while being simple are also more general than standard loop <b>checking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> implemented in DL systems and remedy the mentioned problems. We focus on the description logic ALCIO(U). This is an extension of the basic DL ALC with inverse operator on roles, nominals (or objects/ABox elements) and the top role. As the language includes nominals and the universal modality, concept satisfiability with respect to (non-empty) TBox and (non-empty) ABox can be reduced to plain concep...|$|R

We show that the difficulty lies in the fact that we lack an effective detection tool suited for work with inheritance problems. Therefore, a formal <b>checking</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed to detect and resolve redundant inheritance.

This {{research focuses on}} spatial-domain watermarking techniques for digital image owner identification in order to design a robust and low computation approach which can withstand against different levels of reset removal attack which have been less considered by other researchers. This paper presents original innovative schemes based on multiple watermarks in which two different watermarks embed concurrently into the intermediate significant bits of the host image pixels. The main watermark is the original information about {{the owner of the}} digital image property. With the intention of preserving the imperceptibility, we propose embedding this watermark within a lower ISB bit-plane of the host image pixels. The second embedding water-mark (sub-watermark) which includes statistical information about the main watermark bit stream has the key role in our proposed scheme. This watermark which used much less pixels of the host image compared to the main watermark, generates based on the main watermark bit stream using binary bit-patterns. By counting these bit-patterns, a bit-pattern histogram could be drawn in the time of extracting process. By comparing this bit-pattern histogram with the original bit-pattern histogram, the owner of the host im-age can be identified. This is the proposed double <b>check</b> <b>mechanism</b> which approximately identifies the ownership of the image property. With the purpose of increasing the robustness of our approach, we proposed the sub-watermark embedding within a higher ISB bit-plane of the host image pixels. This double <b>check</b> <b>mechanism</b> is more useful when the main watermark replaces by a fake watermark or is totally destroyed by a strong attack. Experimental investigations on the proposed schemes revealed that {{in order to make a}} balanced trade-off between the imperceptibility and the robustness, two different bit-planes including 5 th and 2 nd can be used concurrently to embed the watermark and the sub-watermark respectively in separate pixels of the host image.
