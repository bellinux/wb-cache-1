40|$|Novel {{antibiotics}} {{are needed}} to overcome the challenge of continually evolving bacterial resistance. This {{has led to a}} renewed interest in mechanistic studies of once popular antibiotics like chloramphenicol (CAM). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CATs) are enzymes that covalently modify CAM, rendering it inactive against its target, the ribosome, and thereby causing resistance to CAM. Of the three major types of CAT (CAT I‐III), the CAM‐specific CAT III has been studied extensively. Much less is known about another clinically important type, <b>CAT</b> <b>I.</b> In addition to inactivating CAM and unlike <b>CAT</b> III, <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> confers resistance to a structurally distinct antibiotic, fusidic acid. The origin of the broader substrate specificity of <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> has not been fully elucidated. To understand the substrate binding features of <b>CAT</b> <b>I,</b> its crystal structures in the unbound (apo) and CAM‐bound forms were determined. The analysis of these and previously determined <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> ‐FA and <b>CAT</b> III ‐CAM structures revealed interactions responsible for <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> binding to its substrates and clarified the broader substrate preference of <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> compared to that of CAT III.

40|$|Mitochondrial {{carnitine}} palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) and microsomal carnitine acyltransferase <b>I</b> (<b>CAT</b> <b>I)</b> {{regulate the}} entry of fatty acyl moieties into their respective organelles. Thus, CPT <b>I</b> and <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> occupy prominent positions in the pathways responsible for energy generation in mitochondria and the assembly of VLDL in the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Previous attempts to determine the intrinsic kinetic properties of CPT <b>I</b> and <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> have been hampered by the occurrence of sigmoidal velocity curves. This was overcome, in this study, by the inclusion of recombinant acyl-CoA binding protein in the assay medium. For the first time, we have determined the concentrations of total functional enzyme (E(t)) by specific radiolabeling of the active site, the dissociation constants (K(d)) and the turnover numbers of CPT <b>I</b> and <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> toward the CoA esters of oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and docosahexaenoic acid (C 22 : 6). The data show that carnitine inhibits <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> at physiological concentrations which are not inhibitory to CPT I. Thus, carnitine concentration {{is likely to be}} a significant factor in determining the partitioning of acyl-CoAs between mitochondria and microsomes, a role which has not been previously recognized. Moreover, the finding that <b>CAT</b> <b>I</b> elicits a lower turnover toward the CoA ester of C 22 : 6 (25 s- 1) than toward that of C 18 : 1 (111 s- 1), while having similar K(d) values, suggests the use of this polyunsaturated fatty acid to inhibit VLDL biosynthesis...|$|R
