5|$|Silverthrone {{is part of}} the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, {{which is}} {{circumscribed}} by a group of epizonal intrusions. At another deeply eroded <b>caldera</b> <b>complex</b> called Franklin Glacier Volcano, the Pemberton Volcanic Belt merges with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, a northwest-trending belt of volcanic cones and fields extending from near the Canada–United States border east of Vancouver on the British Columbia Coast. The intrusions are thought to be subvolcanic bodies associated with a volcanic front that was active in the Miocene, during early stages of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate. With the notable exception of King Island, all the intrusive and eruptive rocks are calc-alkaline, mainly granodioritic bodies and dacite ejecta.|$|E
5|$|Java is a {{relatively}} small island compared to Sumatra, {{but it has a}} higher concentration of active volcanoes. There are 45 active volcanoes on the island excluding 20 small craters and cones in the Dieng volcanic complex and the young cones in the Tengger <b>caldera</b> <b>complex.</b> Some volcanoes are grouped together in the list below because of their close location. Mount Merapi, Semeru and Kelud are the most active volcanoes in Java. Mount Semeru has been continuously erupting since 1967. Mount Merapi has been named as one of the Decade Volcanoes since 1995. Ijen has a unique colourful caldera lake which is an extremely acidic natural reservoir (pH<0.3). There are sulphur mining activities at Ijen, where miners collect highly concentrated sulphur rocks by hand.|$|E

25|$|The Chilcotin Group is a north-south {{range of}} volcanoes in {{southern}} British Columbia running {{parallel to the}} Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The majority of the eruptions in this belt happened either 6–10 million years ago (Miocene) or 2–3 million years ago (Pliocene), although with some slightly more recent eruptions (in the Pleistocene). It {{is thought to have}} formed as a result of back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.

500|$|There is {{no single}} {{standard}} definition for a volcano. It can be defined from individual vents, volcanic edifices or volcanic fields. Interior of ancient volcanoes may have been eroded, creating a new subsurface magma chamber as a separate volcano. Many contemporary active volcanoes rise as young parasitic cones from flank vents or at a central crater. Some volcanic cones are grouped into one volcano name, for instance, the Tengger <b>caldera</b> <b>complex,</b> although individual vents are named by local people. The status of a volcano, either active or dormant, cannot be defined precisely. An indication of a volcano is determined by either its historical records, radiocarbon dating, or geothermal activities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{subduction}} zone {{has existed for}} at least 37 million years, and has created a line of volcanoes called the Cascade Volcanic Arc which stretches over [...] along the {{subduction zone}}. Several volcanoes in the arc are potentially active. Lassen Peak in California, which last erupted in 1917, is the southernmost historically active volcano in the arc, and Mount Meager, just north of Mount Cayley, which erupted about 2,350years ago, is generally considered the northernmost. A few isolated volcanic centers northwest of Mount Meager, such as the Silverthrone Caldera, which is a [...] wide, deeply dissected <b>caldera</b> <b>complex,</b> are considered by some geologists to be the northernmost member of the arc.|$|E
2500|$|The Toba {{eruption}} or Toba event {{occurred at}} the present location of Lake Toba, in Indonesia, about [...] Before Present (BP) according to potassium argon dating. [...] This eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of Toba during the Quaternary period, and is also recognized from its diagnostic horizon of ashfall, the youngest Toba tuff (YTT). It had an estimated volcanic explosivity index of 8 (the maximum rating attained by any known eruption on Earth); it made a sizable contribution to the 100×30km <b>caldera</b> <b>complex.</b> Dense-rock equivalent (DRE) estimates of eruptive volume for the eruption vary between [...] and [...] – the most common DRE estimate is [...] (about [...] ) of erupted magma, of which [...] was deposited as ash fall.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>caldera</b> <b>complex</b> at {{the peak}} of the volcano is made of at least six {{overlapping}} calderas and caldera segments (pictured). Calderas are formed by roof collapse following depletion and withdrawal of the subsurface magma chamber after an eruption. Each caldera thus represents a separate pulse of volcanic activity on the mountain. The largest and oldest caldera segment appears to have formed as a single, large lava lake. The size of a caldera is a reflection of the size of the underlying magma chamber. Using geometric relationships of caldera dimensions from laboratory models, scientists have estimated that the magma chamber associated with the largest caldera on Olympus Mons lies at a depth of about [...] below the caldera floor. Crater size-frequency distributions on the caldera floors indicate the calderas range in age from 350Mya to about 150Mya. All probably formed within 100 million years of each other.|$|E
50|$|The CVZ is {{characterized}} by a continental crust that reaches a thickness of approximately 70 km. Within this zone there are 44 major and 18 minor volcanic centers that are considered to be active. This volcanic zone also contains not less than six potentially active large silicic volcanic systems, which include those of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex, as are Cerro Panizos, Pastos Grandes, Cerro Guacha and La Pacana. Other silicic systems are Los Frailes ignimbrite plateau in Bolivia, and the <b>caldera</b> <b>complexes</b> of Incapillo and Cerro Galán in Argentina.|$|R
5|$|Cerro Azul {{is part of}} the South Volcanic Zone, {{which runs}} through central and western Chile and extends south to Argentina. This range {{includes}} at least nine <b>caldera</b> <b>complexes,</b> more than 70of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields that have been active in the Quaternary, and hundreds of minor eruptive centres. The South Volcanic Zone is the most volcanically active region in Chile, and produces around one eruption per year.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} accounting for many {{features of the}} Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex situated in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes which contains 50 recently active volcanoes. The dominant elements of the complex are several large nested <b>caldera</b> <b>complexes</b> which are the source structures for the major regionally distributed ignimbrite sheets that characterize the complex. The study of the complex reveals {{the importance of the}} intersection of subsidiary axis-oblique tectonic trends related to regional stress fields peculiar to individual oceanic ridge sections with the axis-parallel trends predominant at all spreading centers in localizing hydrothermal discharge zones...|$|R
2500|$|Silverthrone Caldera is {{the largest}} and best-preserved of the two caldera {{complexes}} in the northern Garibaldi chain, the other being the Franklin Glacier complex [...] to the east-southeast. The caldera has a diameter of [...] and contains breccia, lava flows and lava domes. Like Franklin to the east-southeast, the geology of Silverthrone is poorly known due to minimal studies. The region surrounding the Silverthrone complex is significantly jagged due to the mountainous terrain of the Coast Mountains. Near vertical flanks extend from near sea level to more than [...] in elevation. Silverthrone is significantly younger than the Franklin Glacier complex to the east-southeast and its volcanics likely have ages comparable to other volcanics throughout the Garibaldi chain. The oldest volcanics at the Silverthrone <b>Caldera</b> <b>complex</b> are composed of volcanic breccias, some of which became fused together by intense volcanic heat from when the deposits were first erupted. After these volcanics were deposited, a series of dacite, andesite and rhyolite lava flows were erupted upon volcanic breccia from the first volcanic phase. These eroded lava flows in total are [...] thick. Volcanics in the lower portion of this series of lava flows give a potassium-argon date of 750,000years while volcanics slightly above the lava flows are 400,000years old. The most recent volcanic activity produced a series of andesite and basaltic andesite lava flows down Pashleth Creek and the Machmell and Kingcome river valleys. The lava flow extending from near Pashleth Creek to down the Machmell River valley is over [...] in length. Its small amount of erosion indicates {{that it could be}} 1,000years old or younger.|$|E

40|$|We {{have carried}} out 2 -D {{numerical}} simulations using the discrete element method (DEM) to investigate density-driven deformation in Martian volcanic edifices {{and how it}} affects the development of <b>caldera</b> <b>complexes.</b> These simulations demonstrate {{that the presence of}} a dense and weak cumulate body within a volcanic edifice strongly influences the volcano morphology and enhances volcanic spreading. The settling of a cumulate body generates distinctive structural and morphological features characteristic of Olympus Mons and Arsia Mons, including low flank slopes and pronounced summit calderas. We show that gravitational spreading of a cumulate body can play a primary role in the long-term development of calderas. We conclude that a cumulate body that is both shallow and wide could generate a single large depression similar to the Arsia-type caldera, while our simulations of a narrow cumulate body are capable of generating summit subsidence that is similar in dimension to the Olympus Mons caldera...|$|R
