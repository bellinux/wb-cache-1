Because the foothills of Meta have 1000 ha cultivated with Tahiti lime (10 % of the total Colombian <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>area)</b> and are seen as an area to increase Tahiti lime production for exportation from Colombia (Cleves-Leguízamo et al. 2012), it is necessary to define whether P. longifila causes economic damage to this crop even if molecular analysis reveal the presence of cryptic species.|$|E
40|$|Citrus is {{the leading}} fruit of Pakistan and famous {{worldwide}} especially kinnow cultivar because of its pleasant taste and remarkable quality. The yield of citrus per hectare in Pakistan is almost half of potential due to non-adoption of recommended horticultural practices by citrus growers. Adopting a decision regarding the improvement of practices is usually influenced by various factors including farmers' socio-economic attributes. In {{order to determine the}} relationship between socio-economic aspects and the awareness and adoption of recommended citrus production practices the present study was carried out in Sargodha district from central Punjab, Pakistan. The Study was based upon cross sectional survey research design due to availability of sampling frame, probability (random sampling) was applied for sample selection. Through random sampling, 120 citrus growers were selected as sample. Structured questionnaire administered through interview was used as a research instrument. Analysis of the data collected from the targeted citrus growers revealed a highly significant influence of education on awareness and adoption. Moreover, significant association was found between <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>area</b> and awareness and adoption of improved practices. Age also showed significant association with awareness and adoption. Moreover, dominancy of middle aged farmers and illiteracyin the study area strongly point the need of provision of formal and non-formal education and training program for farmers. Young generation needs to be focused and reorientation of youth clubs may help in better way to gain the utmost outcome. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the environmental fate of herbicides (acetochlor, 2, 4 -D, diuron, clomazone, thidiazuron, paraquat, simazine, fluazifo-p-butil, clethodim, oxufluorfen, flumioxazin, carfentrazone-ethyl, ametrina, trifluralin and MSMA) in cotton, coffee and <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>areas,</b> applying the level I fugacity model. The methodology basically used the chemical and physical characteristics of the pesticides, environmental compartments and the fugacity equations. The preliminary evaluation of risk of contamination due to the use of these pesticides on the cultures studied was carried out swiftly, based on the chemical and physical properties of these products as the level I fugacity model was applied. For most of the herbicides evaluated, the water compartment was the most vulnerable. The prediction evaluation study using fugacity level I was found to be a relevant tool for the environmental fate of the herbicides studied for cotton, coffee and citrus cultures...|$|R

Na metodologia foram utilizadas basicamente as características físico-químicas dos herbicidas, os compartimentos ambientais e as equações de fugacidade. A avaliação preliminar do risco de contaminação pelo uso de herbicidas nas culturas de algodão, café e citros pode ser feita de forma expedita a partir das propriedades físico-químicas desses produtos, aplicando o modelo de fugacidade nível I. Para a maioria dos herbicidas avaliados, o compartimento água foi o mais vulnerável. O estudo de avaliação da predição em que se empregou o nível de fugacidade I demonstrou ser uma ferramenta importante no destino ambiental dos herbicidas estudados para as culturas de algodão, café e citros.

The present study aimed at exploring the potentials of lemon production {{and its impact}} on the changes in the livelihood pattern of the rural farmers as well as its impact on women empowerment. Based on qualitative and quantitative data collected from Mymensingh district in Bangladesh in 2015, this paper argues that life and livelihood of the citrus producer has significantly changed over the last decade. Income from the sale of lemon is the principal livelihood means and gender non-differentiated participation in the production process further enhanced the sustainability of the livelihoods.
