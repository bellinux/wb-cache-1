40|$|Induced-strain {{materials}} can produce very large forces and, hence, large energy density, but small actual displacements. A new concept for obtaining large-amplitude rotary displacements from small linear displacements generated by induced-strain material stacks is proposed. The concept utilizes {{the theory of}} twist-warping coupling in thin-wall open tubes. The theory of the proposed solid-state axial-to-rotary <b>converter-amplifier,</b> together with the appropriate bibliographical references, is given. A simple formula is generated for estimating the axial-to-rotary conversion-amplification coefficient from the geometrical length, L, and enclosed area, A, of the open tube. A largedisplacement induced-strain rotary (LARIS) actuator proof-of-concept demonstrator was built and tested to verify and validate the theoretical developments. The LARIS actuator consisted of a 28 mm diameter, 1. 2 m length open tube and a 120 m, - 1000 V PZT translator. The experimental set-up and the excitation and meas [...] ...|$|E
