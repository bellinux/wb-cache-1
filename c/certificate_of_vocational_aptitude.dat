40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} of complex technological equipment operators depends on many {{factors such as}} a development level of professionally important qualities, skills, professional experience, etc. Therefore, {{it is critical to}} define the attainment level of trainees and to assess the possibility of their permit to professional activity at the stage of training. The paper deals with a new assessment method of operators’ attainment level and offers an approach for determination of an individual training path. In this connection the model <b>of</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitude</b> on the basis of fuzzy logic was developed, this model allows to assess the integral level <b>of</b> the <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitude</b> and define the professionally important qualities (PIQs) to be developed. The professionally important qualities are differentiated into developing, conventionally developing and undeveloping ones. Such differentiation enables to form the quality functional of training in the manner that provides development of the developing PIQs and compensation of the undeveloping PIQs. The formation of a rule base for a certain operator's activity is performed by using special methods of expert assessment for each case. It allows to transfer the general <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitude</b> model to the specific spheres of operators’ labour. A special complex of methodology and hardware&software for measurement and assessment of PIQs has been developed for a practical application of the abovementioned method. For assessment of PIQs the following techniques are used: the quality assessment of a hand-eye tracking, a hand-eye coordination, response, an ability to sensory analysis, the examination of cognitive characteristics and peculiarities of the nervous system of trainees. The developed assessment system was used in the experimental investigations <b>of</b> the <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitude</b> <b>of</b> operators of transport-technological machines in the Interregional Forestry Resource Centre. It was found out that a choice of an individual training path {{based on the results of}} the assessment system under discussion provides improvement of training effectiveness and further development of professional skills...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development and the application of psycho-diagnostic test procedures for the <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitude</b> <b>of</b> the Deaf. The gained data serve as basis for a comparison of the average mathematical competences of deaf and hearing people. Additionally, the data are used to form and test hypotheses about possible reasons for the differences in achievement which have been found. The fact that the procedure <b>of</b> the <b>vocational</b> diagnostics differs in parts between hearing and deaf people can be explained due to the particular situation of the Deaf and their linguistic and cultural uniqueness. In order to clarify this, the “Aachen Test Battery <b>of</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Aptitude</b> <b>of</b> the Deaf (ATBG) ” which is based on the idea of culture fair diagnostics – meaning a diagnostics <b>of</b> the <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitude</b> based on sign language – is briefly described. Finally the composition of the test battery and the 23 individual test procedures will be presented briefly. The data which have been collected from hearing impaired people through the ATBG at Vocational Training Centres, Integration Centres, and other institutions concerned with vocational training and advanced <b>vocational</b> training <b>of</b> hearing impaired people, as well as data gained through investigations by the ATBG-team members at schools and vocational schools for hearing impaired students (N= 907), serve as basis for the analysis of the present paper. In {{order to be able to}} use the data collected through the ATBG tests for the analysis of the mathematical competences of the Deaf, it has to be proved that the test battery validly captures the characteristics that have to be measured. The analyses concerning the validity of the tests show that the translation and the adaptation of already existing procedures respectively, as well as the redesign of single test procedures of the ATBG for the diagnostic application of the ATBG at hearing impaired subjects have been successful. The multitude of the analyses and the variety of approaches of the analysis respectively – correlation studies, factor analysis, and non-metrical multi-dimensional scaling procedures – confirm these findings. After I firstly presented the ATBG approach in context with the diagnostics <b>of</b> the <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitude</b> and sign language and secondly showed that this approach is appropriate to capture performance features and behaviour features of hearing impaired people objectively, reliably, and validly, I will thirdly compare average competences of deaf and hearing people. Such comparisons are possible as many ATBG-test procedures are merely modifications of existing test procedures which have been developed and standardized for hearing people. The comparison of the mathematical skills were combined with the following research questions: (1) Do hearing and deaf people show systematic differences in performance concerning their mathematical skills? (2) Is it possible to identify potential causes for the differences in performance that have been found by means of a combination between the results of other studies and the analysis of the ATBG-data? In order to analyse the connection between mathematical skills and level of ability, I will contrast the results of international studies with hearing and deaf people with the data gained through the German ATBG-sample in the ability test procedures. The development of mathematical competences will be displayed with the help of various test procedures from the ATBG-test battery and the analysis of the influences of variables specific to the deaf (degree of hearing impairment, hearing status of the parents). Finally the influence of selected factors concerning special conditions of socialization of the Deaf will be evaluated by means of the analysis of the results from the ATBG-sample comprising linguistic and hearing-impaired-pedagogical aspects. Even though the results of the present study show very low mathematical skills in German deaf people compared to hearing people the study also identifies ways, in which this difference in performance can be reduced in the future. Low mathematical skills can neither be put down to ‘Deafness per se’ nor can they be determined by the intellectual ability level of the Deaf. The analyses indicate that bilingual education and schooling approaches, advancement of writing skills of the Deaf, the creation of surroundings which give deaf children and adolescents the possibility to make more experiences and improve their informal knowledge, as well as a mathematical-didactic approach which is adapted to the specific problems and abilities of the Deaf and thus supports their development of mathematical competences can improve the mathematical skills of the Deaf...|$|R
