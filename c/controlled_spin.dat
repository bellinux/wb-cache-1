5000|$|The {{balanced}} flight projectile patent can {{be found}} at the US Patent Office, <b>Controlled</b> <b>spin</b> projectile, [...] According to the patent a projectile engraved and launched in accordance with the patent should decelerate from supersonic flight through transonic to subsonic in a stable and predictable manner effective to a range beyond 3000 yards (2,743 m). It implies that among several other preconditions the rifle barrel has to have specific rifling dimensions to achieve a desired amount of axial air drag on the bullet's surface, which reduces the bullets spinrate to achieve balanced flight. The patent does not account for normally occurring differences in air density. More about balanced flight can also be found in the CheyTac Information Papers.|$|E

5000|$|Sock is {{primarily}} an aggressive baseliner. He {{can be considered}} a complete baseliner with both offensive and defensive abilities. The topspin on his forehand side helps him move his opponents far back behind the baseline to control points. His forehand and serve are his biggest weapons, and he also boasts an impressive second serve. He uses his groundstrokes either to overpower opponents from the baseline or to move them around the court and look for a winner. He can also flatten out both his forehand and his backhand to devastating effect, but Sock prefers to hit with <b>controlled</b> <b>spin</b> instead.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a charge-neutral spin- 1 exciton, realizable only in planar systems like graphene, can {{effectively}} be used for <b>controlled</b> <b>spin</b> transport in such media. The excitonic bound state is destabilized by quantum fluctuations, characterized by a threshold for excitation and melts in a smooth manner under thermal fluctuations. This planar exciton differs from the conventional ones, as it owes its existence to the topological Chern-Simons (CS) term. The parity and time-reversal violating CS term can arise from quantum effects in systems with parity-breaking mass-gap. The spinning exciton naturally couples to magnetic field, leading {{to the possibility of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>spin</b> transport. Being neutral, it is immune to adverse effects, afflicting spin transport by charged fermions. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, References upgrade...|$|E

The system comprises a magnetic quantum ring which is directly coupled to a magnetic quantum wire and subjected to an in-plane electric field perpendicular to the wire. Without directly changing system parameters, one can regulate spin currents simply by tuning the external electric field under a finite bias drop across the wire. For some particular field strengths {{a high degree of}} spin polarization can be achieved and thus the system can essentially be utilized as an externally <b>controlled</b> <b>spin</b> polarized device. A detailed comparison of spin current magnitudes obtained from other bridge setups is also examined to make the present investigation a self contained study.

40|$|Since the {{prediction}} of a new topological state of matter in graphene, materials acting as topological insulators have attracted wide attention. Shortly after the theoretical proposal for a mercury telluride (HgTe) -based two-dimensional topological insulator, the observation of the quantum spin Hall effect and non-local edge transport brought compelling experimental evidence for quantized conductance due to edges states. The spin orientation and propagation direction of such helical edge states are inherently connected, providing protection against backscattering. However, these features conversely render <b>controlled</b> <b>spin</b> operations such as spin switching difficult. Here we therefore propose constrictions as connectors between opposite edge (and spin) states in HgTe. We demonstrate how the coupling between edge states, which overlap in the constriction, can be employed both for steering the charge flow into different edge modes and for <b>controlled</b> <b>spin</b> switching. This {{gives rise to a}} three-state charge and spin transistor function. Unlike in a conventional spin transistor, the switching does not rely on a tunable Rashba spin-orbit interaction, but on the energy dependence of the edge state wavefunctions. Based on this mechanism, and supported by numerical transport calculations, we present two different ways to control spin- and charge-currents depending on the gating of the constriction...|$|E
