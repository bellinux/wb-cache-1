40|$|The {{electricity}} markets in Europe are growing together and therefore understanding of <b>cross-border</b> <b>flows</b> {{becomes more and}} more important. Due to Market Coupling the method for allocating cross-border transfer capacity is changing, from explicit to implicit auction. This results in strictly price driven <b>cross-border</b> <b>flows.</b> In this thesis a model for forecasting price driven <b>cross-border</b> <b>flows</b> is developed. The problem of finding the optimal <b>cross-border</b> <b>flows,</b> is modelled as a linear optimisation problem. The flows are found by minimising production cost in all involved areas for 24 hours at a time. The optimisation is subjected to constraints that derive from technical restrictions on the interconnecting cables. From simulation it is shown that the modelled flows are close to the real flows. The model is also compared with an existing model and the results are at least as good, sometimes even better. This is very good for a fully flexible model. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

A 2005 report by the Commission for Africa cites a European Commission estimate that [...] "stolen African assets equivalent to {{more than half of the}} continent's external debt are held in foreign banks accounts". As stated by the World Bank in 2004, [...] "corruption is... the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development. Corruption undermines development by distorting the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundation on which economic growth depends.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{forecasting}} power of international portfolio flows for local equity markets {{and attempt to}} attribute it to either better information about fundamentals {{on the part of}} international investors, or to price pressure. Price pressure is a potential explanation because flows have positive contemporaneous price impacts and are strongly positively autocorrelated. We find that <b>cross-border</b> <b>flows</b> forecast both individual country equity market prices and associated US closed-end country fund prices, even after controlling for closed-end fund purchases. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>flows</b> have no discernable impact on the difference, the closed-end fund discount. This fact is consistent with the information story, which says that cross-border inflows predict no change in the discount, but forecast positive changes in both net asset values and closed-end fund prices. This fact also contradicts the price pressure story, which predicts that cross-border inflows increase local country equity prices, thereby increasing the closed-end fund discount. We also use our approach to test for the presence of trend following in <b>cross-border</b> <b>flows</b> based on relative, as well as absolute returns. Like other studies, we find evidence of trend following based on absolute returns. Interestingly, however, we find also that flows are trend reversing based on relative returns. Flows therefore seem to be stabilizing with respect to notions of relative, but not absolute, value. ...|$|R

The decrease in cross-border loans to central and eastern Europe was more limited compared to Asia and Latin America, in large measure because of the higher degree of financial and monetary integration in Europe, and relatively sound banking systems in the region.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that migrant workers ' {{remittances}} have emerged as a major source of external financing for many developing countries, there is general dearth of literature on their developmental impact on the receiving country. There is a general feeling and limited evidence that such flows are less procyclical and more stable than private capital flows. In India, immigrant remittances have emerged as a major strength to the balance of payments, though the composition of such flows has undergone changes over time. The GATS has not as yet yielded desired liberalisation with respect to cross-border movement of workers. In fact, there is certain hardening of stance by industrialised countries in this respect.

Therefore, it {{is becoming more and}} more crucial to study the impact of these changes on the risk of cascading failures leading to blackout. We propose in this paper to emphasize important factors leading to blackouts, to review methodologies which were developed to simulate cascading failure mechanisms and to study specifically the impact of thermal effects on the risk of blackout for several changes in generation (variations in <b>cross-border</b> <b>flows,</b> wind farms penetration, shut-down of power plants). This is studied by applying to a test system the first level of a dynamic probabilistic blackout risk assessment developed previously. We show that taking into account thermal effects in cascading failures is important not only to have a good estimation of the risk of blackout in different grid configurations, but also to determine if a specific change in generation has a positive or a negative impact on the blackout risk.

These territories are a sort of bridge between the fully domestic and the fully international. Hong Kong and Macau higher education plays a dual role, as a destination in itself for higher education and as a stepping-stone for students' further international development. Patterns in Hong Kong are slightly different from those in Macau, and the territories may thus be usefully compared with each other as well as taken as a pair for comparison with other parts of the world. The paper begins by noting the literature on the ways that push and pull factors influence student mobility, and then turns to motivations in pursuit of academic and professional growth, economic benefit, individual internationalisation, and enhanced social status.
