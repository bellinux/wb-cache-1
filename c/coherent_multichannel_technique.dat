40|$|Acoustic <b>multichannel</b> {{equalization}} <b>techniques</b> {{such as the}} multiple-input/output inverse theorem (MINT), which aim {{to equalize}} the room impulse responses (RIRs) between the source and the microphone array, {{are known to be}} highly sensitive to RIR estimation errors. To increase robustness, it has been proposed to incorporate regularization in order to decrease the energy of the equalization filters. In addition, more robust partial <b>multichannel</b> equalization <b>techniques</b> such as relaxed multichannel least-squares (RMCLS) and channel shortening (CS) have recently been proposed. In this paper, we propose a partial <b>multichannel</b> equalization <b>technique</b> based on MINT (P-MINT) which aims to shorten the RIR. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of incorporating regularization to further increase the robustness of P-MINT and the aforementioned partial <b>multichannel</b> equalization <b>techniques,</b> i. e., RMCLS and CS. In addition, we introduce an automatic non-intrusive procedure for d etermining the regularization parameter based on the L-curve. Simulation results using measured RIRs show that incorporating regularization in P-MINT yields a significant performance improvement in the presence of RIR estimation errors, whereas a smaller performance improvement is observed when incorporating regularization in RMCLS and CS. Furthermore, it is shown that the intrusively regularized P-MINT technique outperforms all other investigated intrusively regularized <b>multichannel</b> equalization <b>techniques</b> in terms of perceptual speech quality (PESQ). Finally, it is shown that the automatic non-intrusive regularization parameter in regularized P-MINT leads to a very similar performance as the intrusively determined optimal regularization parameter, making regularized P-MINT a robust, perceptually advantageous, and practically applicable <b>multichannel</b> equalization <b>technique</b> for speech dereverberation...|$|R
50|$|Though cinema and soundtracks {{represent}} the major uses of surround techniques, its {{scope of application}} is broader than that as surround sound permits creation of an audio-environment {{for all sorts of}} purposes. <b>Multichannel</b> audio <b>techniques</b> may be used to reproduce contents as varied as music, speech, natural or synthetic sounds for cinema, television, broadcasting, or computers. In terms of music content for example, a live performance may use <b>multichannel</b> <b>techniques</b> {{in the context of an}} open-air concert, of a musical theatre or for broadcasting; for a film specific techniques are adapted to movie theater, or to home (e.g. home cinema systems). The narrative space is also a content that can be enhanced through <b>multichannel</b> <b>techniques.</b> This applies mainly to cinema narratives, for example the speech of the characters of a film, but may also be applied to plays for theatre, to a conference, or to integrate voice-based comments in an archeological site or monument. For example, an exhibition may be enhanced with topical ambient sound of water, birds, train or machine noise. Topical natural sounds may also be used in educational applications. Other fields of application include video game consoles, personal computers and other platforms. In such applications, the content would typically be synthetic noise produced by the computer device in interaction with its user. Significant work has also been done using surround sound for enhanced situation awareness in military and public safety application.|$|R

Recent progress in <b>coherent</b> (<b>multichannel)</b> SAR processing raises the need for accurate {{registration of}} data takes acquired with large baseline spans, high temporal coverage, and with different frequency and/or operational modes. In this paper, we discuss a SAR image-registration procedure, based on the use of external measures which allows obtaining a very accurate alignment of SAR images. The presented technique makes use of a digital elevation model and of the precise information about the acquisition flight tracks, to compute the warping functions that map the position of each pixel in the different takes, thus avoiding any approximation. The resulting algorithm is simple, robust, precise, and very efficient; as a matter of fact, it may achieve high accuracy even in critical areas, such as steep topography regions. Moreover, the availability of an analytical and exact model allows performing a detailed sensitivity analysis that can be useful in evaluating the applicability of this technique even to future high-precision satellite systems. Extensive testing, carried out on several real European Remote Sensing and ENVISAT datasets, clearly shows the effectiveness of such algorithm in registering critical SAR images.

The multichannel image segmentation problem, is a new field of great interest for the astronomical community. This paper presents an unsupervised method to automatically segment multispectral astronomical images, which is the first stage toward the automatic classification of astronomical objects. The proposed method relies on a hierarchical Markovian modeling on a quadtree [1, 2, 3], including the estimation of all involved parameters. The parameters of the prior model are automatically calibrated while the estimation of the noise parameters is solved by identifying generalized distribution mixtures [4, 5], using an Iterative Conditional Estimation (ICE) procedure.
