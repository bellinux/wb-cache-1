The main contributions of this paper are generally applicable insights into the design and seamless integration of context-awareness, dynamic service landscapes, and application adaptation management for applications in highly dynamic execution environments. These insights not only relate to the functional requirements and constraints, but also to non-functional aspects that have a strong influence on the user acceptance of such applications...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims at discussing some of {{the ways}} in which both the Basic Needs Theory of development in Jeffrey Haynes and the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Framework</b> (CDF) in John Rees, seek to reduce poverty in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). The Church´s role of providing basic needs within the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Framework</b> was also discussed. Conceptual and argumentation analysis methods were used. Most countries in Africa are confronted with worsening poverty, hunger, ill health and high unemployment. According to the World Bank (2009), about one in two persons lives on less than US$ 1. 25 per day, with almost 70 percent living in rural areas, thirty-two out of the forty-eight poorest countries are found in SSA. The International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1976 sought to alleviate poverty by Basic Needs Theory of development which urged the various governments to endeavor to provide basic needs (food, housing, clothing, and public services, and so on) to their citizens. According to Haynes, the theory failed because the developmental agenda became absorbed into the wider cold war ideological division, and also because of the unwillingness of the ruling elites and their supporters in many developing counties to facilitate the necessary financial transfers upon which the successful delivery of basic needs strategy pivoted. This led to the redefinition of the role of the state since it could not provide basic needs solely. As a result of this, Poverty Reduction Strategies such as Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative, and others were birthed. These Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) process was the main basis for implementing the CDF principles which are intended to translate a country’s poverty reduction strategy into a focused action plan. The CDF was proposed by the World Bank in early 1999 as a means by which countries can manage knowledge and resources to formulate and execute effective strategies for economic development and poverty reduction. The CDF, among others, stresses strong partnerships among governments and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and other development actors of which the church is part. According to Rees, the church (example the World Council of Churches) is skeptical to associate with the secular institutions including International Financial Institutions (IFIs). However, the Catholic and Lutheran churches’ social ministries mandate it to work with non-church institutions to bring about development. Thus the church has a holistic mission which allows it to seek justice to bring about transformation through empowerment and works for peace and reconciliation. In some parts of Africa, some churches have been very proactive in terms of provision of basic needs comprising the material, social, psychological and bodily as well as spiritual well-being. This is done through support and advocacy. The IFI´s decision to involve the church in its efforts to reduce poverty is not only laudable but also realistic since the church has long been involved in the provision of basic needs in SSA.

40|$|The {{scaling up}} of {{development}} policies, practices and partnerships is a strategic challenge. The upgrading of development ambition from investment operations and country strategies to global policies would extrapolate a secular trend that has propelled the development business from the pioneering phase of projects conceived as “privileged particles of development”; to the neo-classical phase of macro-economic adjustment; to {{the advent of}} environmentally and socially sustainable development and most recently {{to the adoption of}} country based <b>comprehensive</b> <b>development</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Because the global economy is increasingly interconnected, the development enterprise must be reshaped to reflect shared objectives, distinct accountabilities and reciprocal obligations between rich and poor countries. Because development is a social transformation process, the development paradigm must become holistic. Because incentives matter, development metrics must be reconsidered to emphasize results. The universal endorsement of the millennium development goals has helped to reverse a decline in the share of national incomes allocated to aid. But it has yet to generate binding commitments or concrete plans. Halfway to the 2015 deadline, progress is partial, halting and insufficient to meet most goals. To accelerate progress, scaling up is needed. Capacity building should strike the right balance between hierarchical, individualistic and relational conceptions of development. Projects should be used to experiment, innovate, learn and evaluate what works and does not work. To trigger an accelerated and self-sustaining reform of the global policies that shape development, new partnerships will be needed to mobilize skills and resources; to generate new ideas; to mobilize public opinion; to trigger judicious standard setting and to implement scaled up development programs. These new development coalitions are likely to take the form of global networks combining the legitimacy of governments, the ethics of the civil society and the innovative energies of the private sector...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} the World Bank’s millennial {{development}} report reveals that it sabotages its own good intentions by accepting a flawed premise. This paper shows that, in espousing economic growth as a hallmark of development, WB 2 K’s new unified approach, like traditional approaches, merely reinforces the problems it means to solve. The work of anthropologists, ecologists and alternative economists is used to show that economic growth 1) is thermodynamically unsustainable, 2) creates ecosystemic instability which, among things, increases the probability of human extinction, 3) drives population growth, exacerbating ecological problems, and 4) generates and supports hierarchical social structures which yield unequal resource distribution and which themselves are systemically unsustainable.

They do not necessarily represent {{the views of the}} World Bank, its Executive Directors, or the countries they Progress in poverty reduction depends primarily upon policy and institutional changes in low-income countries. The Bank's previous approach to inducing these changes has been through negotiated loan conditionalities. The empirical evidence suggests that this approach has been largely ineffective- where change occurred it was chosen by governments rather than induced by loans. I discuss various countervailing pressures which undermine the effectiveness of loan conditionalities. An alternative approach for the same objective of inducing change is to empower the domestic constituencies for change through knowledge and participation. I argue that this is likely to be more effective in promoting policy change, and that for institutional change, which is now usually the frontier of economic reform, {{it is likely to be}} essential.

40|$|Critics of the World Bank have {{variously}} attributed its proclaimed {{commitment to}} poverty reduction to empty rhetoric, hypocrisy, incompetence, confusion, or overload {{in the absence}} of a coherent agenda. This article argues that the commitment is genuine, but that it is not a first order goal: poverty reduction is an intended consequence of its principal objective, the transformation of social and governmental relations and institutions in the developing world in order to generalize and facilitate capitalist accumulation on a global scale, and build capitalist hegemony through the promotion of tightly controlled forms of 'participation ' and 'ownership'. This objective has been pursued consistently since the mid- 1990 s, with Wolfensohn as Director and Stiglitz while Chief Economist playing leading roles. It has been reflected in particular in the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Initiative, the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Framework,</b> and PRSPs (Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers) as means of governing low-income countries.

Microfinance as a form of development aid is a relatively new phenomenon. It is a form of a direct financial support of small entrepreneurs in developing countries. Since the 90 s commercial institutions have become increasingly involved in the process of microfinancing and projects and financing have gone beyond borders of individual states. After 2000 microfinance has become a part of the agenda of international organizations. In the last century, there was a dynamic development in the area of development theories. The change of development aid's paradigm, which took place during the 90 s, marked a culmination of this process. Since the 90 s the term <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Framework</b> is being used.

Despite its lasting appeal and controversial nature, insufficient research on its critical early stage {{has been done to}} provide useful analysis. When the clients lack appropriate capabilities to confront sustainability challenges, MEFs may end up functioning poorly in the post-event era and even hindering the progress of intended renewals. The {{purpose of this study is}} to enhance MEF clients' capabilities in meeting sustainability challenges at the early stage and ultimately producing responsible MEFs of enduring worth. Design/methodology/approach - The multiple-case study method was adopted due to its widely recognized reliance on multiple sources to facilitate in-depth analyses. Data were collected through archival records, documentation, direct observation and participant observation. Findings - By proposing a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>development</b> <b>framework</b> based on the findings of multiple-case studies, this paper corrects a misunderstanding of such a development being an end in itself, and contributes new insights into the definitional early stage of MEFs. Social implications - The fact that MEFs are a global phenomenon as well as a local undertaking leads to a need to develop a database of useful lessons and critical decisions from previous MEFs, to establish a best practice targets system in future research.

40|$|BACKGROUND: After-school {{programs}} (ASPs, 3 PM to 6 PM) {{have been}} called upon {{to increase the amount}} of daily physical activity children accumulate and improve the nutritional quality of the snacks served. To this end, state and national physical activity and nutrition (PAaN) policies have been proposed. Frontline staff who directly interact with children on a daily basis are charged with the responsibility to meet policy goals. Without appropriate skills, staffers’ ability to achieve such goals is limited. The gap between policies and improvements in PAaN must be bridged through professional development training. This article describes the development of an ASP staff professional development training program. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify relevant theoretical perspectives, empirical evidence, and recommended best practices relating to promoting PAaN of children. RESULTS: A <b>comprehensive</b> professional <b>development</b> <b>framework</b> was developed that incorporated the key elements identified from the review. These elements were distilled into 5 primary categories and conceptually referred to as the 5 Ms: mission—clearly defined policy/standards for PAaN; motivate—providing choices, developmentally appropriate activities, feedback, and encouragement; manage—structuring and managing the environment for safety, routines, and discipline; monitor—ongoing evaluation of PAaN; and maximize—incorporating all former Ms. CONCLUSIONS: The application of this training framework should lead to improved implementation and eventual achievement of policy goals for PAaN in ASPs.

Special attention is given to the World Bank's assessment tool at the core of its aid allocation mechanism, the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), and how this sits within the evolving. understanding of development projected by the World Bank. This reveals the persistence of the Washington Consensus agenda at the core of World Bank practices, often at variance with its rhetoric.

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} whether {{differences in the}} amount of time educators talk during a self-management education programme relate to the degree of change in participants’ reported beliefs about diabetes. Method: Educators trained to be facilitative and non–didactic in their approach were observed delivering the DESMOND self management programme for individuals newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Observers used 10 second event coding to estimate the amount of time educators were speaking during different sessions in the programme. Facilitative as opposed to didactic delivery was indicated by targets for levels of educator talk set for each session. Targets were based on earlier pilot work. Participants completed measures of perceived: duration of diabetes (timeline IPQ-R), understanding of diabetes (coherence IPQ-R), personal responsibility for influencing diabetes (personal responsibility IPQ-R), seriousness of diabetes (seriousness DIRQ), and impact on daily life (impact DIRQ), before and after the education programme. Results: Where data from the event coding indicated educators were talking less and meeting targets for being less didactic, a greater change in reported illness beliefs of participants was seen. However, educators struggled to meet targets for most sessions of the programme. Conclusion: The amount of time educators talk in a self-management programme may provide a practical marker for the effectiveness of the education process, with less educator talk denoting a more facilitative/ less didactic approach. This finding has informed subsequent improvements to a <b>comprehensive</b> quality <b>development</b> <b>framework</b> acknowledging that educators need ongoing support to facilitate change to their normal educational style...|$|R

RUP is widely known and many organizations {{have tried to}} adopt it. Being a framework, RUP has to, in some way, be tailored to the specific context of use, no software development project is alike. This paper presents {{a case study of}} a Norwegian SME that tried to adopt RUP in the simplest way, by introducing the methodology by providing comprehensive documentation and some simple training. Our study shows that the use of RUP had some positive effects but also that the use has been scattered. Interviews with users of RUP show that there is a great need of better training and practical support in getting most value out of RUP. The key message is that if you consider taking RUP into use you have to invest resources in it. Training and support are key success factors. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Biochemical Algorithms Library (BALL) is a <b>comprehensive</b> rapid {{application}} <b>development</b> <b>framework</b> {{for structural}} bioinformatics. It provides an extensive C++ class library of data structures and algorithms for molecular modeling and structural bioinformatics. Using BALL as a programming toolbox does not only allow to greatly reduce application development times but also helps in ensuring stability and correctness by avoiding the error-prone reimplementation of complex algorithms and {{replacing them with}} calls into the library that has been well-tested by {{a large number of}} developers. In the ten years since its original publication, BALL has seen a substantial increase in functionality and numerous other improvements. Results: Here, we discuss BALL’s current functionality and highlight the key additions and improvements: support for additional file formats, molecular edit-functionality, new molecular mechanics force fields, novel energy minimization techniques, docking algorithms, and support for cheminformatics. Conclusions: BALL is available for all major operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and MacOS X. It is available free of charge under the Lesser GNU Public License (LPGL). Parts of the code are distributed under the GNU Public License (GPL). BALL is available as source code and binary packages from the project web site a...|$|R
