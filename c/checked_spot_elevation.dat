We used Clinitek 50 ® which is a semiquantitative strip test to <b>check</b> <b>spot</b> urine sample from 81 patients with albustix one plus or less. The incidence of Clinitek 50 ® microalbuminuria was 17 %, 18. 2 % and 75 % in 47, 22 and 12 patients with albustix negative, trace or one plus respectively. Nineteen and 13 of the 21 Clinitek 50 ® positive patients were <b>checked</b> for <b>spot</b> urine DCA 2000 ® and two 12 -hour urine collection for immunoassay respectively. Around 60 % of these samples fell into the microalbuminuria range and 40 % into the overt albuminuria range by either technique. There was no false positive of Clinitek 50 ®. The lowest range of microalbuminuria detected by Clinitek 50 ® was 27 μg/minute (38 mg/day). We concluded that Clinitek 50 ® is a useful screening test as it is nonexpensive, easily operated and has a sensitivity close to the lower range of microalbuminuria...|$|R

30|$|Much prior {{research}} on {{learning to use}} topographic maps has focused on trying to facilitate comprehension of the topography by providing the user with additional visual information on the map, such as with shaded relief (e.g., Phillips, Lucia, & Skelton, 1975; Potash, Farrell, & Jeffrey, 1978; Rapp et al., 2007). A critical finding from this work is {{that the benefits of}} additional visual information are limited to reasoning about specific kinds of topographic map problems (e.g., shaded relief shows a moderate improvement over contour lines for landscape visualization tasks, but decreases accuracy for <b>spot</b> <b>elevation</b> problems; Potash et al., 1978). Furthermore, although visual enhancements have been found to help students understand other kinds of contour diagrams (Taylor et al., 2004), the effects of additional visual information during learning on students’ skills for topographic map use later on is still unknown.|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that caves in the Florida Peninsula {{are tied to}} Quaternary sea levels was proposed by hydrogeologists, without data, some 40 years ago. The hypothesis is a version of glacial control of cave levels, which is the logical combination of the water-table theory of speleogenesis and the concept that base level positions the water table. At the USA type example of glacial control of cave levels—Mammoth Cave in the Paleozoic rocks of Kentucky—the intermediary is base level determined by rivers. By hypothesis, the intermediary for Florida is glacioeustatic sea level. This paper presents elevation data that supports this hypothesis. Recent cave surveys in the air-filled caves and <b>spot</b> <b>elevations</b> from archived maps reveal prominent levels of passages centered at 5, 12, 21, and 30 m above sea level over broad areas. They do not follow the large-scale structure of the Floridan aquifer. Instead, they align with nearby, coastal marine terraces identified as modal peaks on frequency plots from various topographic data bases. Levels matching with the three highest terraces—Wicomico, Penholoway, and Talbott—are particularly clear. Lower levels, if they accord with sea-level stands, are likely composites. Data from cavities encountered in drilled wells (e. g., bit drops) and <b>spot</b> <b>elevations</b> from archived underwater cave maps demonstrate passage levels at depths of 15, 30, 70, and 90 – 120 m below the modern water table. The depths below water table {{are similar to the}} depths below sea level of distant submerged terraces and paleoshoreline features identified using multibeam bathymetric data in the Gulf of Mexico. The cave, bit-drop, and terrace data are all consistent with the concept that Quaternary sea level is the fundamental control on the cave-scale porosity within the Floridan aquifer. This conclusion does not {{rule out the possibility that}} lithologically favored positions, paleokarst features and confining units, and mixing zones are also involved in the location of caves levels in this near-coastal environment...|$|R
