40|$|Land tenure {{heterogeneity}} may be {{an obstacle}} to forested landscape-level management planning {{and the provision of}} ecosystem services. This research focused on the potential of combining participatory workshops and multiple criteria decision methods (MCDMs) to support the development and negotiation of targets for the supply of ecosystem services and help design the management plan needed to meet those targets. We describe an application to two forested landscapes with several ownership types in Portugal. The approach encompassed the design of two workshops involving more than 40 stakeholders (forests owners, the forest service, the forest industry, local municipalities and other nongovernmental organizations). The list of ecosystem services included carbon stocks, <b>cork,</b> <b>pine</b> cones, and forest inventory {{at the end of the}} planning horizon as well as volume flows from a range of forest species. Results demonstrated the potential of MCDM tools to help individual forest stakeholders set and adjust ecosystem services target levels. They further demonstrated the potential of MCDMs to facilitate the negotiation of these targets by the stakeholders and the reaching of meaningful solutions. Finally, they demonstrated that these tools provide valuable information to combine the negotiations of both targets and behaviors and programs needed to attain them.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Florestal e dos Recursos Naturais - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - ULThe {{interest}} in sustainable development and environmental management from {{non-wood forest products}} (NWFPs) has been growing during the past decade. These products are important in the bio-economy especially in regions where wood {{is not the most}} profitable product. As NWFPs cover a wide range of species they provide an array of alternatives to use more green products and are a relevant component of sustainable forest management. We present an approach to characterize the potential of most promising NWFPs in the Alentejo region. We used the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), one of many multi-criteria decision making methods, and a Delphi approach to support judgments collected from stakeholders and domain experts. In order to facilitate and manage the pairwise comparisons in the application of the AHP we selected seven regional NWFPs: boletus (Boletus edulis), cork (Quercus suber), pine nuts (Pinus pinea), pine resin (Pinus spp), yellow lavender (Lavandula viridis), honey from bees (Apis mellifera), and rabbit as game meat (Oryctolagus cuniculus). AHP incorporated the judgments (weights) from experts along a hierarchical decomposition of the problem into a set of criteria and sub-criteria, and generated a regionally explicit ranking of alternatives (NWFPs) by deriving priorities. The three NWFPs with the highest potential were <b>cork,</b> <b>pine</b> nuts and yellow lavender. In a second level of importance were boletus, pine resin, honey and rabbit. These results further reinforce that cork is the product with the greatest potential in Alentejo region. However, yellow lavender has a significant potential and could be an interesting opportunity for forest owners that aim diversifying the basket of products supplied. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the model is robust because the ranking of NWFPs did not change much with the weights of criteria. This model also provides forest owners with information to develop management strategies or to engage in related NWFPs businesse...|$|E

40|$|Above-ground {{invertebrates}} may repre- sent a {{high proportion}} of animal biomass, but few data are available on their fate after death. In Mediterranean ant communities, they are frequently scavenged by ants. Here, we assessed the conse- quences of Argentine ant invasion on the removal of arthropod corpses in Don˜ ana National Park (SW Spain). In three natural habitats that differed in their degree of vegetation cover (i. e. protection for ants against high temperatures), we experimentally pro- vided dead Drosophila, and observed their disap- pearance over a 60 -min period at different times of day and year. The habitats used were isolated <b>cork</b> oak trees, <b>pine</b> tree forest and dry scrubland; we compared invaded with uninvaded plots in each. Oak trees were the most invaded habitat, while scrubland was the least and the only one where the Argentine ant coexisted with native ant species. In accordance with this degree of invasion, the Argentine ant removed the highest percentage of dead flies in oak trees and the lowest in scrubland. Its performance as scavenger was higher than uninvaded ant communi- ties, but it was reduced at high temperatures, when native species were highly efficient. The saturated distribution of the Argentine ant colony seems to be the key to its efficiency. We discuss how the occurrence and scavenger efficiency of the Argentine ant could affect the nutrient cycling and the progres- sion of its invasionPeer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Algeria’s {{agricultural}} sector, which {{contributes about}} 8 {{percent of gross domestic}} product (GDP) but employs 14 percent of the workforce, is unable to meet the food needs of the country’s population. As a result, some 45 percent of food is imported. The primary crops are wheat, barley, and potatoes. Farmers also have had success growing dates for export. Cultivation is concentrated in the fertile coastal plain of the Tell region, which represents just a slice of Algeria’s total territory. Altogether, only about 3 percent of Algerian territory is arable. Even in the Tell, rainfall variability has a significant impact on production. Government efforts to stimulate farming in the less arable steppe and desert regions have met with limited success. However, herdsmen maintain livestock, specifically cow and sheep in the High Plateaus region. Algeria’s climate and periodic fires are not conducive to a thriving forestry industry. However, Algeria is a producer of <b>cork</b> and Aleppo <b>pine.</b> In 2005 roundwood removals totaled 7.8 million cubic meters, while sawnwood production amounted to only 13 million cubic meters per year. Algeria’s fishing industry does not take full advantage of the Mediterranean coast, in part because fishing is generally done from small family-owned boats instead of large commercial fishing trawlers. However, the government is attempting to boost the relatively small catch—slightly more than 125,000 metric tons in 2005—by modernizing fishing ports, permitting foreigners to fish in Algerian waters, and subsidizing fishing-related projects.|$|R
40|$|The Serra de Rodes {{catchment}} (NE Spain), {{enclosed in}} the Natural Park of Cap de Creus, represents a typical Mediterranean ecosystem. This semiarid environment, with hot summers and mild winters, has been progressively abandoned by farmers {{during the last}} century. Nowadays, most of hillside soils are abandoned and only small patches of vineyards and olive trees are cultivated with very low management and incomes. In this study, we have assessed the effects of land use and land use change on the main soil quality parameters. Along two altitudinal gradients, we selected 11 random environments representative of the current land uses, in sequence from cultivated to early abandonment. The different vegetation stages were grouped in four main land use types according {{to the age of}} abandonment: cultivated fields (vineyard and olive trees, 0 years), recent abandonment (dense and cleared shrubs, 5 years), mid-abandonment (cleared cork trees and dense olive trees, 25 years) and early abandonment (dense <b>cork</b> trees and <b>pine</b> trees reforestation, 50 years). Erosion plots were installed in the previously selected environments for soil physicochemical characterisation, throughout 1 -year observation, monitoring nutrient losses, runoff volume and sediment yield data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates significant differences in the main soil quality parameters such as soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (N), water holding capacity (WHC) and pH, among the selected environments under different land use conditions. Factor analysis of the principal components (PCA) enabled the identification of three soil quality indices: index of soil erosion and nutrient losses (SENL), index of soil quality and fertility (SQF) and index of vegetation cover and soil protection (VCP). Soil organic matter, nutrient supply, soil vegetation cover and soil compaction are critical for soil degradation in these environments and they must be managed appropriately in order to ensure continuous soil rehabilitation. Furthermore, the main conclusio...|$|R
