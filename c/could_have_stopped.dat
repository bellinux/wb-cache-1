5|$|In July 2000 it was {{announced}} that Punch magazine was to be prosecuted for contempt of court after publishing an article by former MI5 agent David Shayler. Shayler's article claimed MI5 <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the Bishopsgate bombing, which a spokesman for Attorney General Lord Williams claimed was a breach of a 1997 court injunction preventing Shayler disclosing information on security or intelligence matters. In November 2000 Punch and its editor were found guilty and fined £20,000 and £5,000 respectively. In March 2001 the editor successfully appealed against his conviction and fine, with an appeal judge accusing the Attorney General of acting like a press censor and ruling that the 1997 injunction was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 2002 this decision was overturned at the House of Lords, with five law lords ruling that editor James Steen's publication of Shayler's article was indeed in contempt.|$|E
25|$|The end of aid {{through the}} Plan <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the {{recovery}} but it {{coincided with a}} crucial point in the Korean War whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of Italian industrial production. In addition, the creation in 1957 of the European Common Market, with Italy as a founding member, provided more investment and eased exports.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighting}} shifts so that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are {{the only}} ones visible. Rosencrantz still does not understand why they must die. Still, he resigns himself to his fate and his character disappears. Guildenstern wonders when he passed the point where he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the series of events that has brought him to this point. He disappears as well. The final scene features the last few lines from Shakespeare's Hamlet, as the Ambassador from England announces that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.|$|E

25|$|An {{independent}} fire expert {{told the}} BBC having the ladder earlier <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the fire {{getting out of}} control. The London Fire Brigade told Newsnight the first attendance procedure for tower fires has now been changed from four engines to five engines plus a high ladder unit. Firefighters said inside the building they lacked sufficient 'extended duration' breathing apparatus. They had difficulty getting vital radio messages through due to 'overuse of the system' and from {{the need to get}} the signal through layers of concrete.|$|E
25|$|The engineer, Tom Harding, {{parked the}} train {{on the main}} line by setting the brakes and {{followed}} standard procedure by shutting down {{four of the five}} locomotives. Harding, who was the lone crew member under the MMA's work rules, which had been discussed with Transport Canada, could not park the train on the adjacent siding because MMA used it routinely to store empty boxcars for Tafisa, a particleboard factory in Lac-Mégantic's industrial park. The Nantes siding has a derail that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the train from accidentally departing. According to Transport Canada, it is unusual to leave an unattended train parked on a main line, but there were no regulations against it.|$|E
25|$|Each {{night from}} 3–8 January, the protests led to clashes between loyalists and police in East Belfast. Rioters threw petrol bombs, fireworks, bricks, stones and bottles; police responded with plastic bullets and water cannon. According to the Belfast Telegraph, {{much of the}} East Belfast {{violence}} was being directed by a few high-ranking members of the UVF East Belfast Brigade. They allegedly ignored orders from the UVF leadership to stop the violence. Police sources said that the East Belfast Brigade leader <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the rioting if he wished. Ten officers were injured on the first night. On 4 January, {{attempts were made to}} hijack cars and buses. In Newtownabbey, masked men broke into commercial premises and stole money. On 5 January, shots were fired at police during clashes in east Belfast. Loyalists claimed that trouble began when they came under attack from the Short Strand, an Irish nationalist enclave. The next night, loyalists protested near the Short Strand and then clashed with police nearby.|$|E

500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was revealed}} in a confession by Hayes {{just hours after}} the killings. Detectives testified that Hayes smelled strongly of gasoline throughout the interrogation. Each perpetrator blamed or implicated the other as the mastermind and {{driving force behind the}} spree. There were even attempts to blame William Petit as an accomplice. Komisarjevsky later kept a diary, entered into evidence, in which he chose to call Petit a [...] "coward" [...] and claimed that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the murders had he wanted to.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{out against}} the protesters, President Pranab Mukherjee's son Abhijit Mukherjee argued that the women protesters {{did not appear to}} him to be students, saying, [...] "What's {{basically}} happening in Delhi is a lot like Egypt or elsewhere, where there's something called the Pink Revolution, which has very little connection with ground realities. In India, staging candle-lit marches, going to discothèques... I can see many beautiful women among them– highly dented-painted... I have grave doubts whether they're students..." [...] The remark was widely condemned as sexist. His sister Sharmistha said that she and their father the president both disapproved. Then Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan also expressed disapproval. Abhijit quickly withdrew his comment and apologised. [...] Spiritual guru Asaram Bapu also provoked extensive criticism from the public by saying that the victim was also to blame for her own assault because she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> the attack if she had [...] "chanted God's name and fallen {{at the feet of the}} attackers".|$|E
500|$|Cotto's second title defense {{took place}} on February 26, 2005 in the Rubén Rodríguez in Bayamón, Puerto Rico against Demarcus Corley. During the fight Cotto practiced a boxing style that was more {{aggressive}} than usual, trading hits with Corley {{over the course of}} the first round. During the fight both boxers were deducted one point following illegal low blows. Cotto scored three knockdowns before the fight was stopped by the referee at 2:45 of the fifth round following a combination by Miguel. Corley claimed that the referee stopped the fight prematurely stating that [...] "the ref just stopped the fight premature. If he wanted to stop the fight, he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> it when I had [...] hurt." [...] Just a few days after retaining the crown versus Corley, Cotto received a personal blow, when his stablemate and friend, former 2004 Olympian Joseph Serrano, was shot in the head upon leaving the Bairoa gym. Serrano survived the shot, but was in critical but stable condition at a local hospital.|$|E
50|$|Although the Mujahideen and Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{soldiers}} {{crimes were}} proven, {{and it was}} agreed by the court that he had effective control over that unit during that time, the judges concluded that Delić <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> known about those murders at the time so he <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> them.|$|R

500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to have usually been {{accompanied}} by {{members of her family}} and the [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family.

500|$|It {{has also}} been surmised that he wrote the portion {{covering}} the 1440s, with the remainder being {{the work of an}} anonymous author writing in the 1470s. Even so, out of the numerous medieval chronicles of this period, it is the one which has caused most debate among historians about its authorship. This is generally because, although it continues after Gregory's death, it also appears to have been written in the same neat hand throughout, albeit with the last three years being stylistically different from the preceding ones. Indeed, a late Victorian antiquarian, Kriehn, posited that William Gregory was in fact never the chronicle's original composer. Kriehn's suggestion was rejected by C.S.L. Kingsford, and Gregory's authorship of {{the first part of the}} Chronicle has been generally accepted ever since. Kingsford suggested a continuator, and identified a break in compositional style at the 1454-point, and that therefore it was there that another author took over. Kingsford's contemporary, James Gairdner, believed Gregory <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> writing at points in his career as distant as the year of his mayoralty in 1451, to his death in 1467.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked so hard on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth, and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, [...] "to get it all out". During a scene in which Roxy and Ronnie argued in the Minute Mart, Womack took a bottle of paint stripper from the shelves, but forgot to stop at the counter to pay for it before exiting.|$|E

500|$|The opening {{months of}} Newcastle's 2008–09 season were blighted by {{ownership}} and managerial turmoil, {{as well as}} numerous injury problems. This manifested itself on the pitch as the club struggled to direct itself clear of the relegation zone. However a highlight was Given saving a Kevin Nolan penalty in a 1–0 win over Bolton Wanderers. On 2 January 2009, following the 5–1 defeat at home against Liverpool, the player's lawyer released {{a statement saying that}} his client was [...] "considering his future" [...] at Newcastle, and requested permission to talk to representatives of Manchester City on 28 January after the club made a bid of £5million which was subsequently rejected. Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear had already stated that the club was [...] "not interested at all in selling him", and described the amount on offer for Given as [...] "insulting". However, on 30 January, it was reported that Newcastle had given permission for Given to enter talks with his suitors. After a transfer fee initially reported to be around £8million was agreed between the clubs, Given signed for Manchester City on 1 February, with the transfer window set to close the following day. The news was disappointing for Newcastle fans who felt that Given left the club in a poor situation with many thinking that had Given delayed his decision to leave until the summer, Newcastle would have subsequently survived relegation to the Championship because Given was such a fantastic goalkeeper who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> many of the goals that the Toon conceded {{towards the end of the}} dreadful campaign. Although the fee for Given was expected to be around £8million, in February 2009 Newcastle United managing director Derek Llambias revealed at a supporters panel meeting that Given had been sold for an initial £5.9million. Given was 34 games away from breaking Newcastle United's appearance record held by Jimmy Lawrence.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{weeks after}} the book's initial publication, HarperCollins and the author made several {{corrections}} to the Kindle edition of the book.

2500|$|In {{the same}} month, United Nations human rights experts {{called for an}} end to extrajudicial killings of {{suspected}} drug dealers, about 900 of whom had been executed since the May election, accusing Duterte of [...] "incitement to violence and killing, a crime under international law". In response, Duterte threatened to leave the UN and form a separate organization with China and African nations.
