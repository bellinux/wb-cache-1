5|$|Rodman {{garnered}} as much {{publicity for}} his public antics. He dated Madonna and <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> tried to conceive {{a child with}} him.

5|$|The couple {{returned}} to Nevada in March 1863, {{accompanied by a}} baby girl, named Margaret Persia Bowers. The Bowers never divulged where they had acquired the child. Some contemporary sources <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> was born on their European crossing to an unwed mother who died during childbirth.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with {{religious}} matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.|$|E
50|$|The action {{takes place}} at a {{roadside}} cafe along a South Australian high way. A married woman arrives, <b>claiming</b> <b>she</b> has lost her memory. Then her husband arrives, <b>claiming</b> <b>she</b> is faking amnesia and that his wife tried to kill him.|$|R

Supersonic faced felony vandalism charges, but through a plea did minimal jail time and community service.|$|R
50|$|When {{they arrive}} home, a man arrives with Brenda <b>claiming</b> <b>she</b> tried to hang herself after the party. Ives {{declares}} he can't marry Julie if Brenda {{is prepared to}} die for love of him. Julie, distraught, rushes {{out to the car}} where Brenda is waiting and begins to drive it at high speeds, <b>claiming</b> <b>she</b> is going to kill them both as neither of them can have Ives. Brenda begs her not to do it, <b>claiming</b> <b>she</b> didn't really try to kill herself, and only pretended to do so to get Ives back for rejecting her.|$|R
5|$|Laika {{died within}} hours from overheating, {{possibly}} {{caused by a}} failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially <b>claimed,</b> <b>she</b> was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{announced}} in February 2012, shortly after Sia <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> would be retiring. Some online music stores offered Sia's music DVD TV Is My Parent as a bonus. Overall, critical reception of the album was positive, though many reviewers criticized select tracks. Best Of... debuted at number 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart the week of 15 April and reached a peak position of number 27 the following week.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E

5|$|Anne's {{second cousin}} George of Hanover (her {{eventual}} successor) visited London {{for three months}} from December 1680, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them. Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle {{as part of a}} scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance. Other rumours <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> was courted by Lord Mulgrave (later made Duke of Buckingham), although he denied it. Nevertheless, {{as a result of the}} gossip, he was temporarily dismissed from court.|$|E
5|$|Capitalising on anti-French sentiment, {{the paper}} {{went on to}} discuss Bảo Đại's {{upbringing}} in France, claiming that he was already womanising as a teenager because of his European upbringing. Bảo Đại later married an ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress Nam Phương, who had been raised Catholic. The editorials accused her of being a French agent and <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> had treated the queen mother badly, a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials were successfully using sex to turn {{the head of state}} into a puppet of France.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{she visited}} India at the {{invitation}} of Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who had been impressed by Princess Andrew's interest in Indian religious thought, and for her own spiritual quest. The trip was cut short when she unexpectedly took ill, and her sister-in-law, Edwina Mountbatten, who happened to be passing through Delhi on her own tour, had to smooth things with the Indian hosts who were taken aback at Princess Andrew's sudden change of plans. She later <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> had had an out-of-body experience. Edwina continued her own tour, and died the following month.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Nunn's wife Beula {{filed for}} divorce from a {{hospital}} bed where she lay dying of cancer. She <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> was trying to preserve some of her estate for her children. A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside. Some property issues were still pending {{at the time of}} Beula's death in 1995. During the divorce proceedings, Nunn's son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between him and his father. A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family. The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fiancée, Amanda Ross.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by London Clubs, who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James's Street to {{the basement of the}} Ritz. A new company was formed in June 1998, the Ritz Hotel Casino Ltd., which was granted legal permission to open a casino. After very quick refurbishment, it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership, although members are permitted to invite a guest. As of 2006 the Ritz Club was divided into four main areas—the restaurant, bar, lounge and the private gaming room, situated in the former Banqueting Hall. In July 2014, London High Court heard a case against the club, in which Nora Al-Daher <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> was 'taken advantage' of and asked for £2 million in losses.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Scott {{left her}} former record label Hidden Beach Recordings. During the album's recording, she was sued by Hidden Beach, which <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> had left without {{fulfilling}} a six-album contract. The lawsuit was settled in 2011, with Hidden Beach planning to release in August a compilation album The Original Jill Scott from the Vault, Vol. 1, {{the first in}} a planned album series of Scott's previously unreleased recordings. In 2010, Warner Bros. Records signed Scott to a deal that gave her direct control over her marketing and promotion. In a strategy to re-establish Scott's presence with fans, she signed a multi-tour deal with Live Nation/Haymon Ventures to expand her concert touring. Scott co-headlined a national, 20-date arena tour with the recording artist Maxwell, called , in 2010.|$|E

She <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> did not know why she was ordered to travel and her colleague Stephens claims he was also ordered with threats to travel to Bali by Chan, who showed him some photographs of his family, as they were going about their daily lives, saying that they would be killed if he did not co-operate.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, {{legislators in}} the U.S. Congress {{released}} the proposed 2017 federal budget, which included partial {{funding for the}} electrification project, but restricts its distribution unless Secretary Chao signs off on the grant. The proposed budget includes $100million of the $647million grant, with the balance expected in future years. Secretary Chao <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> could not sign the grant without the full grant being budgeted, which was disputed by Caltrain and both California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris. On May 22, the FTA announced its intent to sign the funding grant, restoring the final piece of funding for the electrification project. The official grant was finally signed on May 23.|$|E
5|$|The {{first point}} regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were {{reported}} missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators {{were able to}} locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, {{they were unable to}} determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing her}} job, Boisselier moved with her middle child, a son, to Quebec, where her eldest {{daughter}} was a student. Boisselier began {{to travel to}} discuss Clonaid, eventually becoming a high-profile speaker. Around that time, she reached the rank of Bishop within Raëlism. She {{was one of the}} 25 members closest to Raël and joined the group's Order of Angels, which promoted free love and femininity. She moved to the United States and began teaching at State University of New York at Plattsburgh for a short time before moving to Hamilton College in 2000 to teach chemistry. Her association with Clonaid was publicized in the U.S. in February 2001, and she resigned her academic position that May, although she had a three-year contract. She <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> was initially popular at Hamilton College, but felt that she was disrespected after her association with Clonaid was publicized.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film The Silence of the Lambs. Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> {{was not interested in}} upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E
5|$|Cooke {{resolved}} to kill Sharp herself. The next time Sharp was in Bowling Green on business, she {{sent a letter}} to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and <b>claimed</b> <b>she</b> had broken off all contact with him. She asked Sharp to visit her at her plantation before he left town. Sharp questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would eventually have to return to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for Sharp to return. He never did.|$|E
