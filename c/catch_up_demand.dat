40|$|Abstract. The {{growth of}} {{localized}} and sustainable food systems is widely recog-nized in many Western countries {{as a response}} to the increasingly evident crisis of conventional food systems. However, despite the growing consumer demand, the producer capacity to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with <b>demand</b> emerges as a critical point. The authors reckon that participation in alternative food chains not only needs a new market opened, but also appropriate farming styles. Adopting new farming styles requires radical changes to knowledge and skills, material assets, organizational patterns, communication practices, etc. To that end, the direct interaction with consumers as well as the co-operation and co-ordination with other farmers be-come crucial. On the basis of a deep analysis carried out through a case-study – the innovation cycles activated by farmers adhering to Solidarity-based Purchase Groups (GAS) in Tuscany, Italy – the article explores the complex processes linked to transition, and tries to contribute to a theory of alternative food networks by representing changes in the farm as an outcome of interaction within hybrid net-works through the definition of new codes, cognitive frames, norms, rules and organizational patterns...|$|R

In relation to the UK, it has been argued that locally high levels of cycling are more likely to result from factors other than cycle facilities. These include an existing cycling culture and historically high levels of cycle use, compact urban forms, lack of hills and lack of barriers such as high speed intersections.|$|R

50|$|Typically, {{there is}} no {{assigned}} monetary value to an SREC. SREC prices are ultimately determined by market forces within the parameters set forth by the state. If {{there is a shortage}} in SREC supply, pricing will rise, resulting in an increase {{in the value of the}} incentive for solar systems and an intended acceleration in solar installations. As SREC supply <b>catches</b> <b>up</b> to SREC <b>demand,</b> pricing will likely decrease, resulting in an intended deceleration in solar installations. Over time, SREC markets are designed to find the equilibrium price that encourages enough installation to meet the growing demand set forth by the RPS. Generally speaking, SREC prices are a function of (1) a state's solar alternative compliance payment (SACP), (2) the supply and demand for SRECs within the relevant state, and (3) the term or length over which SRECs are sold.|$|R
40|$|We are {{becoming}} more and more dependent upon a broad range of more or less ubiquitous communication technologies, and these are increasingly integrated with our PCs.

None of these two scenarios are desirable. The aim of this paper is to investigate how people manage communication patterns as an integral part of their daily work. Empirical investigation of complex work in a Swedish pharmaceutical company showed a variety of means for managing communication patterns. Based on the fieldwork we present SwitchIT, an application for pro-actively managing communication modes, and discuss the theoretical implications of applying the concepts of communication overflow and communication deficiency to describe communication patterns. It is concluded that there is a need for collaborative technology supporting the negotiation of communication. 1...|$|R

But there are almost no contributions made on the sub-item according to the effects on the number or quality of offered apprenticeship training positions. In Germany for some years the supply of apprenticeship training positions (ATPs) cannot <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with the <b>demand</b> created by young high-school graduates.

Primarily the aim of this empirical study is {{to find out more about}} the entrepreneurs behaviour and attitude in connexion with offering ATPs. What makes entrepreneurs in newly founded or young companies offer ATPs? Are there any correlations or dependencies or causal connexions on the start-ups' success, the companies' size, age, industry, or entrepreneurs' market expectations? What are the restraints that keep entrepreneurs away from offering ATPs? In public discussion industrial organisations and unions argue heatedly about the level of apprenticeship pay, administrative / red tape barriers or the productivity of ATPs. Do such factors have an influence on the entrepreneurs' decision on installing ATPs? And to what extend? The second aim of the study is to deduce proposals how the number of ATPs in young and newly founded companies could be increased...|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} {{an article of faith}} in {{international}} trade negotiations that farmers in developing countries have much to gain from agricultural trade liberalization. This paper assesses the evidence for such claims. It concludes that the promise of agricultural trade liberalization is overstated, while the costs to small-scale farmers in developing countries are often very high. Relying on World Bank data and analyses, United Nations trade data, and other economic modeling carried out to inform the current round of World Trade Organization negotiations, this paper shows that rich countries are the main beneficiaries of agricultural trade liberalization, gaining markets in both the global North and South. Only a limited number of developing countries – for example, Argentina and Brazil – can compete effectively in global markets. Most developing countries are left out of the export boom but suffer the negative effects of rising imports, as they reduce their own tariffs and farm supports. Meanwhile, farm prices do not remain high for long after liberalization, as supplies, fed by rising yields and new land under cultivation, <b>catches</b> <b>up</b> to rising <b>demand.</b> While the current commodity boom, fueled in part by the demand for agro-fuels, may keep prices high for a few years, it is unlikely to fundamentally alter the structure of global agriculture and the long-term trends toward lower prices. agriculture, trade, commodities, rural development, liberalization...|$|R
