40|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} in corporate law can be addressed by two main alternatives: a requirement {{of a majority of}} the minority vote or the imposition of duties of loyalty and fairness. A comparison of Delaware, the UK, Canada, and Israel reveals that while the conflicts {{of interest}} problem within publicly-traded corporations receives different treatment in the different jurisdictions — either a fairness rule or a majority of the minority rule — <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporations</b> receive the same treatment of an imposition of duties of loyalty and fairness. This article explains this finding, demonstrating that determining which of these rules is adopted is, in fact, a choice between liability rule protection and property rule protection. This choice depends on the total and relative transaction costs. These costs include both the negotiation costs attendant upon a property rule, as well as the adjudication costs associated with a liability rule. The sum of these costs is influenced by the efficacy of the judicial system and of extralegal mechanisms such as the market for corporate control, the capital market, and the types of investors active in the market. Because the different jurisdictions have different relative costs, due to differences in the economy and the legal systems, publicly-traded corporations are treated differently in each system. However, sometimes conflict of interest situations share the same main characteristics — as with closely-held corporations—leading to the domination of one solution, and thus the same solution is applied for <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporations</b> in the different jurisdictions...|$|R

This article examines the differences between the US corporate law market, and the European one - to the extent that one exists. The basic idea is that, in Europe, there is a stronger competition for the (first) incorporation of rather small, closely-held corporations; while in the US a small <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporation</b> usually incorporates locally, where its shareholders and directors are located, and reincorporates - often in Delaware - when it is growing and, usually, when it goes public. Discussing the possible causes and consequences of this very important, but often overlooked difference, European regulatory competition is described as cost-based, i. e. relying primarily on the costs of incorporation; while US regulatory competition is considered as affecting more directly the rules concerning the internal affairs of the corporation (and directors 2 ̆ 7 powers and liabilities in particular), and takeover regulation...|$|E
40|$|As {{it appears}} in most casebooks, the Wilkes v. Springside Nursing Home, Inc. case {{tells the story of}} a falling-out among the {{shareholders}} in a <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporation</b> and the resulting freeze-out of one of the owners, Mr. Stanley Wilkes. The opinion indicates that the heart of the dispute arose out of Mr. Wilkes’s refusal to allow the sale of a piece of corporate property (the “Annex” at 793 North Street) to one of the other shareholders, Dr. Quinn, at a discount. In real life, that transaction did indeed cause a significant rift in the shareholders’ relationship, but, as this article discusses, it was really more like the straw that broke the camel’s back than the primary cause of their altercation. The seeds of the dispute were planted well before the Annex was sold to Dr. Quinn. The unhealthy dynamic that had developed among the shareholders and which eventually resulted in Stanley Wilkes being frozen out of the business had been festering for a long time. The complicated relationship among the shareholders was informed by the somewhat unsavory reputation of Dr. Quinn, the country club “get along” attitude of Messrs, Riche and Connor, and the moral rectitude of Mr. Wilkes.

40|$|Most workers 2 ̆ 7 {{compensation}} schemes {{are designed}} to provide a swift and sure source of benefits to injured workers by placing on employers the risks and burdens of modern industry. In keeping with this policy, Washington 2 ̆ 7 s Industrial Insurance Act 2 (IIA) requires injured workers to relinquish the right to sue at common law for damages sustained on the job, and it requires employers to accept liability for a measure of damages set out by the statute. However, if a worker 2 ̆ 7 s injuries are caused by the negligence of a third person who is not in the worker 2 ̆ 7 s same employ, the IIA 2 ̆ 7 s third-party provision allows the worker to pursue an independent cause of action against the third person in addition to his workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation claim. This type of third-party liability provision has prompted considerable debate as to whether an injured employee may ever sue his employer or a co-employee as a third-party tortfeasor. Attempts by injured workers to circumvent the exclusive remedy principle in this way have given rise to the dual capacity and dual persona doctrines, under which the employer or co-employees of an injured worker may be found independently liable for the worker 2 ̆ 7 s injuries, regardless of whether the worker also recovered workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation benefits. These doctrines are premised on the concept that when an employer or co-employee also serves in a distinct nonemployment capacity toward the employee, or has a legal persona other than that of employer or co-employee, the exclusive remedy principle will not bar the employee 2 ̆ 7 s common-law remedies. The application of the dual capacity and dual persona doctrines has an enormous impact on employers, particularly employers who run small businesses or closely-held corporations. For example, many individuals who serve as the sole shareholder, director, and officer of a small, <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporation</b> also, as individuals, own the land on which the corporation is located. Under a recent judicial decision in Washington State, these small businesses, and the individuals who run them, may be subject to a new threat of liability. This Note will first explain the structure of Washington 2 ̆ 7 s IIA and the exclusive remedy principle. Next, it will explore the third-party provision of the IIA and the judicially-created doctrines that have made employers and co-employees vulnerable to tort suits by injured workers regardless of the exclusive remedy principle. Finally, this Note will discuss the Washington Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in Evans v. Thompson and argue that the court should not have allowed consideration of the dual persona doctrine on remand because the doctrine, if applied, will circumvent the exclusive remedy principle and put the landowners at unjustifiable risk of being held liable for workplace injuries...|$|E

40|$|Beginning in 2013, {{the federal}} {{government}} mandated that general business corporations include contraceptive and early abortion coverage in large employee health plans. Internal Revenue Code Section 4980 D imposes a substantial excise tax on health plans violating the mandate. Indeed, for one company – Hobby Lobby – the expected annual tax is nearly one-half billion dollars. Dozens of “for profit” businesses have challenged the mandate on free exercise grounds, asserting claims under the First Amendment as well as under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. So far, courts {{have been reluctant to}} hold corporations have religious rights of their own; as a result, standing of a corporation to assert the religious beliefs and rights of owners has become the primary issue in the thirty-six separate cases moving through the courts. Courts are split on whether to grant standing; however, a large majority has used a variation of prudential or associational standing to grant preliminary injunctions against enforcement of the tax. On November 26, 2013, the Court granted certiorari in the Hobby Lobby and Conestoga cases, arising from the 10 th and 3 d Circuits. The 10 th, sitting en banc, essentially ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby by paving the way for a preliminary injunction; in contrast, the 3 d ruled against Conestoga. During the period it lacked an injunction, Hobby Lobby chose not to comply with the mandate, while Conestoga has complied (though it continues to raise constitutional objections). This article discusses the relationship of morality and religion to general business corporations. It concludes that over the past few decades, movements for social justice and corporate social responsibility have intertwined business corporations and moral issues, blurring the line between religion and commerce. It also concludes that courts should permit associational standing for <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporations</b> – particularly those electing S status for tax purposes – if the owners have unanimous (or near-unanimous) beliefs.

40|$|When {{professionals}} and other persons who offer their goods and/or {{services to the}} public conduct their businesses through corporations, the Treasury has acknowledged that for federal income tax purposes it must treat those corporations as separate and distinct from their controlling shareholder-employees, even where {{there is only a}} single shareholder-employee, provided that the corporation has a business purpose and the taxpayer consistently respects the corporate form. However, the Treasury has refused to accord equal dignity to incorporated workers who offer their services not to the public at large but to a single recipient or a small number of recipients. The rationale for denying the separate taxpayer status of these 2 ̆ 2 loan-out 2 ̆ 2 corporations is that the party 2 ̆ 2 borrowing 2 ̆ 2 the services of the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s employee is the true employer under common law rules designed to distinguish between independent contractors and employees. This Article examines the tax benefits of incorporating a service business and the principles which have evolved to prevent taxpayer abuse of those benefits, and evaluates the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s rationale for using worker reclassification to deny loan-outs the tax benefits available to other <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporations.</b> The examination reveals that the common law worker classification standards are not an appropriate test of whether a corporation or its employee is the principal in a transaction. Although paternalism and administrative convenience arguments may favor classifying workers as employees under some circumstances, these arguments deserve little weight where the worker makes the affirmative decision to form a loan-out, thus acknowledging employee status and disputing only the identity of the employer. In effect, the government 2 ̆ 7 s position in the loan-out cases denies the taxpayer the opportunity to select the employment contract that will provide the greatest after-tax returns. Taken to its logical consequence, the government 2 ̆ 7 s worker reclassification approach to disregarding loan-outs would treat any controlled corporation as the agent of its controlling shareholder, a position inconsistent with settled principles of tax law. It is also unnecessary, in light of the anti-abuse rules which are already available to distinguish fraudulent transactions. The Article concludes that the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s effort to disregard properly formed loan-outs through worker reclassification lacks a sound basis in policy and that it increases, rather than decreases, the inequities of the tax system...|$|R
40|$|The Affordable Care Act’s {{requirement}} that eligible religious organizations submit a notice objecting to providing their employees contraceptive coverage if they religiously object to contraception or abortifacients {{is as simple}} as filing a piece of paper. But to a collection of Catholic petitioners, complying with this requirement gives rise to “scandal” and causes them to “materially cooperate” with sin. Filing a piece of paper may seem far outside any exercise of religion, but these groups sincerely believe that the one page notice burdens their religious beliefs. Zubik v. Burwell, like Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, presents a conflict between the ACA and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a statute that gives religious groups a shield and a sword against federal laws and regulations that interfere with their free exercise of religion. In Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court held that RFRA prohibits the Government from forcing certain <b>closely-held,</b> religious <b>corporations</b> to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees. Here, the author argues that the Court should extend Hobby Lobby and hold that the accommodation impermissibly burdens these religious groups’ beliefs under the demanding RFRA statute...|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} - Planning Buy-Sell Agreements In The Hospitality Industry - by John M. Tarras, Assistant Professor, School of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management at Michigan State University, the author {{initially}} observes: “The {{vast majority of}} hospitality firms (restaurants, hotels, etc.) would be considered <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporations.</b> As such, they have unique planning problems compared to large, publicly-traded hospitality firms. One area of special concern to the closely-held hospitality firm is the planning and adoption of a buy-sell agreement. ” The above thesis statement outlines {{the heart of the}} article; the buy-sell agreement in regard to smaller [closely held, as Tarras calls them] corporations. The theory is narrow and pro-active, spanning the gap between personal-to-corporate stock manipulations. “The primary purpose of a buy-sell agreement is to contribute to the orderly transfer of a shareholder 2 ̆ 7 s stock in a hospitality firm upon some future incident [typically retirement, withdrawal of a shareholder, disability, or death], as Tarras defines the concept. “The hospitality firm or the other shareholders would be committed to purchase the departing shareholder 2 ̆ 7 s stock at an agreed upon price and method, and to ensure that ample cash will be obtainable for such an impending sale. The buy-sell agreement provides a market for the shareholder or the shareholder 2 ̆ 7 s estate for the sale of otherwise illiquid stock,” the author further provides as canons of buy-sell agreements. In defining the buy-sell agreement with restrictive clauses, Tarras demonstrates, “…many closely-held hospitality firms desire to limit ownership to those individuals, either family or principal corporate employees, who are essential to the well-being of the firm. ” Tarras says, another element of the buy-sell agreement is to furnish the departing shareholder with liquidity. “…there typically is some form of cash down payment with the remainder denoted by an interest-bearing promissory note [usually 5 to 15 years],” he informs. “The departing shareholders may require that the hospitality firm pledge the assets of the firm and that the remaining shareholders personally guarantee the promissory note. ” “…the most frequent reason for establishing buy-sell agreements is for estate planning purposes,” Tarras says. There are tax advantages and liabilities for both the seller and buyer of stock via the buy-sell agreement, and the author enumerates many of these. One, big advantage of the buy-sell agreement is that it provides for the running of the company with a minimum of disruption through the stock-cash transition process, Tarras offers...|$|R
40|$|On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court held, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., {{that the}} {{requirement}} imposed on employer group {{health insurance plans}} to provide coverage for certain contraceptives unduly burdened the free exercise rights of three <b>closely-held</b> <b>corporations</b> {{in violation of the}} Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). The contraception mandate was imposed by regulations implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, itself a very controversial piece of legislation a part of which was upheld recently by the Court in a perhaps a case more controversial than Hobby Lobby Stores. RFRA was enacted to reinstate the religious protections that Congress believed the Court had abdicated in an earlier decision. It was inevitable that RFRA would meet the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. RFRA has not presented significant problems thus far because most federal actions do not implicate religious beliefs. However, a significant portion of health insurance is delivered to individuals through their employers. This system, aided and abetted by tax incentives, had its genesis as a mechanism to avoid wage controls during World War II. Until the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, whether an employer offered coverage and the scope of such coverage was a choice made by the employer without government coercion. The legislation’s employer mandate generated significant opposition because it made mandatory what was theretofore voluntary. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act went further, however, by setting forth required levels of coverage of which contraception services are but a piece. In effect, the federal government has intruded to an extraordinary degree into the details of individual health care – a highly personal matter – and has enlisted employers to assist it in its efforts. Consequently, due to the confluence of employer paymasters, personal health care decisions, and government fiat, the fact that RFRA has surfaced in this context should surprise no one. Hobby Lobby Stores is the opening salvo in what promises to be a contentious political and legal war between two uncompromising sides that hold their competing values dear. Part I of this article provides an overview of the contraception mandate and RFRA. Part II analyzes the Court’s decision in Hobby Lobby Stores. The Court, in its most controversial holding, stated that for-profit corporations enjoy the protections provided by RFRA. It then proceeded to examine whether the contraception mandate violated RFRA. According to the majority, the contraception mandate placed a substantial burden on the corporations’ right to free exercise and that the government had other, less restrictive, means at its disposal to accomplish what the mandate was designed to achieve. This part also analyzes Justice Ginsburg’s vigorous dissent. Part III critiques the Court’s decision and takes exception with its reasoning with respect to corporate rights. It asserts that individual and corporate rights exist for different reasons and these differences justify the denial of certain rights in a corporate context. Free exercise rights are not analogous to the free speech rights for which the Court recently recognized corporate personhood in Citizens United. Moreover, the Court’s recognition of corporate rights by derivation from individual rights of association misunderstands the nature of the modern corporation. Part III also argues that the Court should have used this occasion to place some principled limitation on the concept of the “exercise” of religion. RFRA protects free exercise but does not enshrine the presence of a clear conscience as an entitlement. Ironically, government actions that disturb conscience are a catalyst for, rather than a burden on, religious exercise. Alternatively, the Court should have scrutinized the claim that the burden imposed by the contraception mandate was substantial by reference to some objective standard. Unfortunately, the Court’s failure to do either insures that courts often will reach the final prong of the statute – the least restrictive means test. In this respect, Hobby Lobby Stores was an abdication of the judicial humility that the Court displayed in the seminal case of Chevron U. S. A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Using a dataset of Chinese {{judicial}} opinions arising in {{over fifty}} cases, this paper analyses {{the development and}} current implementation of shareholder derivative actions in the courts of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), {{both before and after}} the derivative lawsuit was explicitly authorized in the PRC’s 2006 Company Law effective January 1, 2006. In addition, we describe the very unique ecology of enterprise organization and corporate governance in modern China, and critique the formal design of the derivative action and offer reform suggestions. We find the design of the Chinese derivative lawsuit to be, in some respects, innovative and appropriate for Chinese circumstances. For instance, the statutory scheme permits “horizontal” claims against controlling or oppressive shareholders in addition to “vertical” claims against orthodox insiders and fiduciaries. At the same time, we find certain design flaws, including standing-based obstacles for plaintiffs, a lack of clarity regarding demand, demand excuse and refusal, and an unnecessary distinction regarding the required wrong underlying derivative actions directed at corporate fiduciaries, on one hand, and others (such as controlling shareholders), on the other. In implementation, we find extremely robust – even overly-aggressive – use of the mechanism by both plaintiffs and deciding judges before and after its formal recognition in law. As in other applications of the corporate law before the courts in China, this use of the derivative action seems to be entirely limited to the <b>closely-held</b> form of <b>corporation.</b> The absence of application with respect to the widely-held, joint stock, form of company is striking because the derivative lawsuit itself was included in the 2006 PRC Company Law revision precisely so as to give minority shareholders in such widely-held companies a way to hold insiders and controlling shareholders accountable at law for rampant malfeasance. In addition, we note the way in which some PRC courts are wary or uncomprehending of the underlying corporate law doctrines for which the derivative action is a necessary vehicle, particularly the duty of care. A final updated and edited version of this paper will be published as “Pathway to Minority Shareholder Protection: Derivative Actions in the People’s Republic of China” in D. Puchniak et al.

40|$|The current rage in dispositional tax {{planning}} for <b>closely-held</b> C <b>corporations</b> is to bifurcate the sale transaction into two components comprising: (a) a sale by (i) the target C corporation’s shareholders of their target C corporation stock or (ii) the target C corporation of its assets; and (b) a sale by {{some or all}} of the target C corporation’s shareholders of “personal goodwill” associated with the business conducted by the target C corporation. The documented purchase price paid for the first component of the transaction (either the stock of the C corporation or the assets of the C corporation) is based on a fair market value determination that excludes consideration of the personal goodwill component of the transaction. If successful, this {{tax planning}} technique allows the selling shareholders to report only shareholderlevel capital gain on the personal goodwill component of the transaction and allows the buyer to claim that this portion of the purchase price is allocable to an acquired intangible, i. e., goodwill, that is amortizable over fifteen years under § 197. More specifically, from the selling shareholders’ perspective, if the first component of the transaction involves a sale of the target C corporation’s assets, the portion of the purchase price attributable to the personal goodwill component of the transaction does not bear the burden of a corporate level of taxation. From the buyer’s perspective, if the first component of the transaction involves a purchase of the target C corporation’s stock, the portion of the purchase price attributable to the personal goodwill component of the transaction is not capitalized into the stock. This planning is premised on the position that certain goodwill associated with the target C corporation’s business can be, and is in fact, owned for tax purposes, by one or more shareholders. If all goodwill associated with the target C corporation’s business activities were in fact owned for tax purposes by the target C corporation, then the personal goodwill component of the transaction is properly viewed as a sale by the target C corporation of such goodwill creating a corporatelevel gain, followed by a distribution from the target C corporation to the shareholders, which in turn creates a shareholder-level gain. If, however, the personal goodwill can be, and in fact is, owned by the selling shareholders and can be, and in fact is, sold by the selling shareholders to the buyer for tax purposes, then its disposition is not subject to corporate-level taxation. Although this planning has garnered much attention recently and could provide significant tax benefits if effective, we believe it deserves further scrutiny before being accepted as an appropriate component of dispositional tax planning for closely-held businesses. This planning technique also highlights the continuing horizontal equity problems associated with the current tax law’s treatment of closely-held businesses. In Part II of this article, we discuss the place that this tax planning technique occupies within a historical context. In Part III, we set forth a substantive discussion of the issues raised by the technique.
