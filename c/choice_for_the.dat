Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E

5|$|As {{a gateway}} to the west, and Persia in particular, Lahore had a strong {{regional}} style which was heavily influenced by Persian architectural styles.

Aurangzeb chose an architectural plan {{similar to that of}} Shah Jehan's <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jama Masjid in Delhi, though built the Badshahi mosque on a much larger scale. Both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble inlay, which is a departure from typical mosque design in Lahore, in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work.|$|E

Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E

Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates optimal <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{e-tailer}} with inventory rationing, hybrid channel strategies, {{and service}} level constraint under multiperiod environment. Based on different operational conditions, five mathematical models are proposed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> e-tailer who faces {{two types of}} fuzzy demand and a framework is designed to illustrate the e-tailer’s operation in different models. This paper presents the advantages of inventory rationing and hybrid channel strategies and analyzes the influences of channel differences variability on optimal <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> e-tailer, where the channel differences include margin difference of priority and margin difference of channel. Through computer simulation, <b>the</b> optimal <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> e-tailer under different multiperiod environments are obtained, and the influences of margin difference of priority and margin difference of channel on the e-tailer’s optimal choices are also examined.
