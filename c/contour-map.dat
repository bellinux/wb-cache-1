40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of parts with sculptured cavities from prismatic stock, rough machining usually constitutes most of the machining time owing to the {{significant difference between the}} stock and the part shape. When using 21 / 2 -D milling or a <b>contour-map</b> approach to do the rough machining, the appropriate selection of tool-path pattern for each cutting layer can significantly reduce rough machining time and hence increase productivity. In this paper, the commonly used toolpath patterns are summarised. A knowledge-based parametric approach for optimising the toolpath pattern of a given cutting layer is proposed. Then, a novel methodology is developed to calculate an arbitrary polygon area and locate the concave cavities in the polygon. Procedures for cutting-layer-shape analysis and the optimal comprehensive tool-path pattern generation are also built and proposed in this paper. These procedures can not only be applied to sculptured cavity parts with simple islands, but also to parts with arbitrarily-shaped islands. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the reasoning process. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Huge {{amounts of}} rich context social network data are {{generated}} everyday from various {{applications such as}} FaceBook and Twitter. These data involve multiple social relations which are community-driven and dynamic in nature. The complex interplay of these characteristics poses tremendous challenges on the users who {{try to understand the}} underlying patterns in the social media. We introduce an exploratory analytical framework, ContexTour, which generates visual representations for exploring multiple dimensions of community activities, including relevant topics, representative users and the community-generated content, as well as their evolutions. ContexTour consists of two novel and complementary components: (1) Dynamic Relational Clustering (DRC) that efficiently tracks the community evolution and smoothly adapts to the community changes, and (2) Dynamic Network <b>Contour-map</b> (DNC) that visualizes the community activities and evolutions in various dimensions. In our experiments, we demonstrate ContexTour through case studies on the DBLP dataset. The visual results capture interesting and reasonable evolution in Computer Science research communities. Quantitatively, we show 85 - 165 X performance gain of our DRC algorithm over the baseline method. 1...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} <b>contour-mapping</b> {{principal}} stress distributions is described. In the polarimeter developed, a reference {{beam of light}} consists of the two orthogonal linearly polarized components that interfere with their counterpart orthogonal components of an elliptically polarized signal beam of light. Two crossed interference patterns are formed over a MOS TV camera so that the significant parameters for determining a principal stress distribution can be recorded in a computer. The major advantage is that not only {{each of the two}} principal stresses but also the principal stress-difference can be independently determined, and no use of any optical component for polarization alignment makes it possible to follow a rapid change in stress distribution within the maximum frame rate 2066 s of the MOS TV camera. 1...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{digitizing}} techniques {{which are}} operable without human interpretation of <b>contour-mapped</b> data and which thus may be performed semi-automatically; line following and raster scanning. After {{a comparison of}} these techniques the author concentrates on raster scanning, as this technique facilitates creation of matrix data, the data structure most widely used in spatial analysis performed by digital computers. The author proposes the quantization method of computing matrix data and shows that quantized data may be used not only for overall computations but also to determine geometrical properties of surfaces - giving the possibility of error estimation-shown by the contour map. In particular such an approach enables pre-determination of a scanning parameter track spacing before digitizing to satisfy the required accuracy of analysis. The different aspects of utilising data obtained by raster scanning are discussed; storage, display in contour map form - the algorithm to produce the type of map where the contour lines pass exactly through the sample points taken during scanning is included...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of the new U. S. /Canadian Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) by the STS- 114 Discovery's crew "will be the most complicated space robotics job of the shuttle program," say Paul Hill, lead flight director. The OBSS is a laser-and-imaging-sensor- equipped 50 -ft. extension to the existing 50 -ft. arm, increasing the shuttle's reach to 100 ft. The return-to-flight mission will debut the autonomous robotic self-inspection capability to detect and possibly aid the repair {{of the type of}} damage that doomed Columbia and her crew, were it to occur again. With 3 D imaging and laser <b>contour-mapping</b> capability, the OBSS will enable the diagnosis of cracks in reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) wing and nose areas and thermal protection system (TPS) tiles beyond the view of the standard manipulator arm. Given the major changes to the shuttle external tank, no damage is expected. But the OBSS is a direct response to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board's recommendations. The new boom and a significant amount of its supporting software was developed by MacDonald Dettwiler heads. Space and Advanced Robotics Ltd. (MD Robotics) in Brampton, Ontario, a key contractor in the shuttle program for 25 years.

60|$|Had {{teachers}} been {{guided by}} Nature's hints, {{not only in}} making drawing a part of education but in choosing modes of teaching it, {{they would have done}} still better than they have done. What is that the child first tries to represent? Things that are large, things that are attractive in colour, things round which its pleasurable associations most cluster--human beings from whom it has received so many emotions; cows and dogs which interest by the many phenomena they present; houses that are hourly visible and strike by their size and contrast of parts. And which of the processes of representation gives it most delight? Colouring. Paper and pencil are good in default of something better; but a box of paints and a brush--these are the treasures. The drawing of outlines immediately becomes secondary to colouring--is gone through mainly with a view to the colouring; and if leave can be got to colour a book of prints, how great is the favour! Now, ridiculous as such a position will seem to drawing-masters who postpone colouring and who teach form by a dreary discipline of copying lines, we believe that the course of culture thus indicated is the right one. The priority of colour to form, which, as already pointed out, has a psychological basis, should be recognised from the beginning; and from the beginning also, the things imitated should be real. That greater delight in colour which is not only conspicuous in children but persists in most persons throughout life, should be continuously employed as the natural stimulus to the mastery of the comparatively difficult and unattractive form: the pleasure of the subsequent tinting should be the prospective reward for the labour of delineation. And these efforts to represent interesting actualities should be encouraged; in the conviction that as, by a widening experience, simpler and more practicable objects become interesting, they too will be attempted; and that so a gradual approximation will be made towards imitations having some resemblance to the realities. The extreme indefiniteness which, in conformity with the law of evolution, these first attempts exhibit, is anything but a reason for ignoring them. No matter how grotesque the shapes produced; no matter how daubed and glaring the colours. The question is not whether the child is producing good drawings. The question is, whether it is developing its faculties. It has first to gain some command over its fingers, some crude notions of likeness; and this practice is better than any other for these ends, since it is the spontaneous and interesting one. During early childhood no formal drawing-lessons are possible. Shall we therefore repress, or neglect to aid, these efforts at self-culture? or shall we encourage and guide them as normal exercises of the perceptions and the powers of manipulation? If by furnishing cheap woodcuts to be painted, and simple <b>contour-maps</b> to have their boundary lines tinted, we can not only pleasurably draw out the faculty of colour, but can incidentally produce some familiarity with the outlines of things and countries, and some ability to move the brush steadily; and if by the supply of tempting objects we can keep up the instinctive practice of making representations, however rough; it must happen that when the age for lessons in drawing is reached, there will exist a facility that would else have been absent. Time will have been gained; and trouble, both to teacher and pupil, saved.|$|R
