25|$|Quarries {{that produce}} {{dimension}} stone or crushed stone (used as <b>construction</b> <b>aggregate)</b> are interconvertible. Since most quarries can produce either one, a crushed stone quarry {{can be converted}} to dimension stone production. However, first the stone shattered by heavy and indiscriminate blasting must be removed. Dimension stone is separated by more precise and delicate techniques, such as diamond wire saws, diamond belt saws, burners (jet-piercers), or light and selective blasting with Primacord, a weak explosive.|$|E

A developed industrial park includes a wide variety of manufacturers.|$|E
500|$|The cost of <b>construction</b> <b>aggregate</b> in Afghanistan is high (around $250 to $650 {{per cubic}} metre) because of {{security}} and transport costs, therefore Foley attempted to minimise its use. [...] A series of trials using various foundation systems was carried out at Camp Bastion to assess the capacity of a geosynthetic cell system called Neoweb. [...] Neoweb is supplied flat but unfolds to form a hollow honeycomb structure that can be backfilled with aggregate and overlain with a wearing course. [...] The specification of Neoweb allowed a 75percent reduction in aggregate and a two-thirds cost saving compared to traditional road-building methods. [...] The Neoweb layer acts as a semi-rigid slab foundation and is designed to allow the surfacing layer to hold together under heavy vehicles and in harsh weather. [...] The foundation also {{makes it harder for}} insurgents to plant IEDs under or in the road.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{municipalities}} {{that operate}} incineration facilities have higher recycling rates than neighboring {{cities and counties}} that do not send their waste to incinerators.. In a country overview from 2016 [...] by the European Environmental Agency the top recycling performing countries are also the ones having the highest penetration of incineration, even though all material recovery from waste sent to incineration (e.g. metals and <b>construction</b> <b>aggregate)</b> is per definition not counted as recycling in European targets. [...] The recovery of glass, stone and ceramic materials reused in construction, as well as ferrous {{and in some cases}} non-ferrous metals recovered from combustion residue thus adds further to the actual recycled amounts. Metals recovered from ash would typically be difficult or impossible to recycle through conventional means, as the removal of attached combustible material through incineration provides an alternative to labor- or energy-intensive mechanical separation methods.|$|E
2500|$|Recycling {{dimension}} stone can occur when structures are demolished, along with recycling timber and recycling <b>construction</b> <b>aggregate</b> {{in the form}} of concrete. The material most likely to be recycled is concrete, and this represents the largest volume of recycled construction material. [...] Not too many structures incorporate {{dimension stone}}, and even fewer of them have dimension stone worth saving. [...] Stone recycling is usually done by specialists that monitor local demolition activity, looking for stone-containing houses, buildings, bridge abutments, and other dimension stone structures scheduled for demolition. Particularly treasured are old hand-carved stone pieces with the chisel marks still on them, local stones no longer quarried or that are quarried in a different shade of color or appearance. There is no national or regional trade in reclaimed stone, so a large storage yard is required, since the recovered stone may not be quickly sold and reused. The recycled dimension stone is used in old stone buildings being renovated (to replace deteriorated stone pieces), in fireplace mantels, benches, veneer, or for landscaping (like for retaining walls).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide an overview of the western North American coastal market for BC <b>construction</b> <b>aggregates.</b> This information may assist the provincial government in considering ways to support First Nations business partnerships and Coastal communities to better position themselves to capture a share of this expanding export market. Background Natural <b>construction</b> <b>aggregates</b> include sand and gravel and crushed stone or rock, which is used in its natural state or after mechanical processing, including crushing, washing and sizing. Aggregate is the chief raw material used in Portland cement concrete and asphalt, which are universally used for construction and road paving purposes. Most commercially produced aggregates are used in public works projects, thus any changes in costs maybe passed on to the public through higher costs of public service and higher taxes. An important characteristic of the industry is that it is very competitive (i. e. narrow margins), the dominant companies are often highly integrated with cement companies having subsidiaries in the both the ready-mix and aggregate business.
