500|$|Jasmine's {{singing voice}} is {{provided}} by Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga. Salonga's Tony Award-winning performance in the musical Miss Saigon helped her garner the interest of casting director Albert Tavares, who proceeded to leave a note for the singer on the stage door before leaving a show he had attended. Salonga's agent then scheduled her audition, at which she performed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] from The Little Mermaid. Salonga finally began recording a demo of [...] "A Whole New World" [...] a few days later. With the casting of Salonga, Larkin became one of Disney's first voice actors to not provide the singing voice of the character she voices, and thus Jasmine {{marked the first time}} Disney decided to separate a character's speaking and singing voices. Describing Salonga as [...] "an incredible singer", Larkin herself was pleasantly surprised by how much Salonga's voice resembled her own when she first heard [...] "A Whole New World", joking, [...] "the filmmakers almost had me <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sang it".|$|E
500|$|The album sold {{a million}} copies in the United States, and five million worldwide. Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one. [...] "I returned feeling so burned out and I was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't go near music for quite a while", she said.|$|E
500|$|The toll of {{international}} celebrity on Wong's personal life {{manifested itself in}} bouts of depression and sudden anger, as well as excessive smoking and drinking. Feeling irritable when she disembarked in Hong Kong, Wong was uncharacteristically rude to the awaiting crowd, which then quickly turned hostile. One person shouted: [...] "Down with Huang Liu Tsongâ€“ the stooge that disgraces China. Don't let her go ashore." [...] Wong began crying and a stampede ensued. After she left for a short trip to the Philippines, the situation cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her father and her siblings, Wong visited {{his family and his}} first wife at the family's ancestral home near Taishan. Conflicting reports claim that she was either warmly welcomed or met with hostility by the villagers. She spent over 10days in the family's village and some time in neighboring villages before continuing her tour of China. After returning to Hollywood, Wong reflected on her year in China and her career in Hollywood: [...] "I am <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could never play in the Chinese Theatre. I have no feeling for it. It's a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I'm 'too American' and by American producers because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts." [...] Wong's father returned to Los Angeles in 1938.|$|E

500|$|Patton's [...] "big break" [...] came in 2002, when he {{was cast}} to replace Steve Burns as Joe, the second host of the Nickelodeon children's {{television}} program Blue's Clues. [...] He was up for a part in [...] at the time, but considered the role as Joe [...] "a happy accident". [...] Patton became a [...] "household name" [...] and has been called [...] "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents". [...] He was subjected to [...] "the same kind of scrutiny" [...] as Burns, {{who was involved in}} Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role. [...] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions. [...] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences. [...] He said, [...] "I am <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do. [...] There's a tape out there, somewhere, with both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken, which we did at the screen test. I haven't seen the tape, but I know somewhere it still exists". [...] Beginning in September 2000, Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to [...] "think of [...] as children's TV", but rather as [...] "acting and telling the truth".|$|E
500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of fear. I however was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to forget everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E

2500|$|As the {{political}} fight ensued, Kelly {{knew he had}} talked to the journalist involved but {{felt that he had}} not said exactly what was reported. He also told his friend and colleague Olivia Bosch that his meeting with Andrew Gilligan had been [...] "unauthorised" [...] and therefore outside his terms of employment. On 30 June 2003, he wrote to his line manager at the Ministry of Defence to report his contact with Gilligan though he added [...] "I am <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not his primary source of information." ...|$|E
