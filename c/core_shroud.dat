50|$|In 1990, Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) was {{discovered}} in core shrouds, resulting in a heightened awareness of <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> maintenance. Routine <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> inspections became mandatory in most nuclear power plants worldwide because if a <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> were to collapse, a nuclear meltdown could occur.|$|E
50|$|Core shrouds crack {{because the}} heat from the nuclear {{reactions}} combined with the constant flowing water eventually wear out the steel plates. One method used to fix this problem is reinforcing the <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> plates. This is done using an anchor bolt, which is used to attach additional steel plates to the <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> surface, thereby reinforcing the structure. This is the most common method used to fix cracks in the <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> since it is easy and relatively safe. Replacement of the <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> is also an option, but it is not recommended because the cracked plates must be removed manually, leaving the laborers susceptible to radiation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> is {{composed}} of multiple cylindrical thermal shields stacked {{on top of each}} other. In between each thermal shield is a horizontal, stainless steel cylindrical plate that helps keep the thermal shields in place. The plates are then welded together with the thermal shields so that they create one solid structure.Vertical tie bolts are then used to reinforce each horizontal plate with their adjacent thermal shields, stabilizing the cylindrical <b>core</b> <b>shroud.</b> The thermal shields are needed because the <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> exists near the nuclear reactor core where heat is constantly present. The thermal shields prevent heat from damaging the <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> by absorbing or reflecting the heat.|$|E

It is here that the cold water is heated, and the heated water flows back up the gap between the wall of the reactor pressure vessel and the outside wall of the <b>core</b> <b>shroud.</b> This creates steam, since the water is heated, which is then used to drive the steam turbine, which powers the generator and creates electricity.

The goal of this study is a contribution to better understand the welding and neutron-irradiation induced changes in the HAZ that may promote intergranular cracking. The evolution of residual stresses, microstructure, microchemistry, mechanical properties, and the stress corrosion behaviour of two welded austenitic stainless steels have been investigated, before and after irradiation. Slow Strain Rate Tensile (SSRT) tests were performed. Flat tensile samples, containing the weld and HAZ were fabricated from type AISI 304 and AISI 347 stainless steels. SSRT corrosion tests were performed at 290 ºC in low conductivity water with 200 ppb dissolved oxygen. Reference tests were performed in inert gas (argon). The irradiated HAZs presents typical irradiation-induced defects with slightly increased density. The tensile tests reveal a significant hardening of the material that is clearly related to the irradiation induced microstructure.

40|$|Recently, the U.

The advantages of VT are that these tests generally involve much less radiation exposure and time to perform the examination than do volumetric examinations such as ultrasonic testing. The issues relative to the reliability of VT in determining the structural integrity of reactor components were examined. Some piping and pressure vessel components in a nuclear power station are examined using VT because they are either in high radiation fields or their component geometry precludes the use of ultrasonic testing (UT) methodology. Remote VT with radiation-hardened video systems has been used by nuclear utilities to find cracks in pressure vessel cladding in pressurized water reactors, <b>core</b> <b>shrouds</b> in boiling water reactors, and to investigate leaks in piping and reactor components. These visual tests are performed using a wide variety of procedures and equipment. The techniques for remote VT use submersible closed-circuit video cameras to examine reactor components and welds.

40|$|Today CFD is an {{important}} tool for engineers in the automotive industry who model and simulate fluid flow. For the complex field of Under hood Thermal Management, CFD has become a very important tool to engineer the cooling airflow process in the engine bay of vehicles. To model the cooling airflow process accurately in CFD, it is of utmost importance to model all components in the cooling airflow path accurately. These components are the heat exchangers, fan and engine bay blockage effect. This paper presents CFD simulations together with correlating measurements of a cooling airflow system placed in a test rig. The system contains a heavy duty truck louvered fin radiator <b>core,</b> fan <b>shroud,</b> fan ring and fan. Behind the cooling module and fan a 1 D engine silhouette is placed to mimic the blockage done by a truck engine behind the fan. Furthermore a simple hood is mounted over the module to mimic the air guiding done by the hood in an engine bay. The measurements monitor pressure and flow over the system. Supporting this examination {{is a set of}} 48 velocity probes in the radiator that measures the local velocity. The simulations of this system are correlated to measurements. Furthermore to support these simulations, specific simulations and measurements are conducted using the radiator only and the fan only. This is done to see how well each separate component is predicted in CFD and correlated back to measurements. This work is the continuation of work presented in [5] and identified in this paper is that one can simulate the cooling airflow system rather well with steady state CFD.

50|$|The {{low-pressure}} coolant injection {{function is}} the emergency mode of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system. The LPCI function can be operated at reactor vessel pressures below 465 psi.

Combined with the Core Spray system to keep steam pressure low, the LPCI is designed to suppress contingencies by rapidly and completely flooding the core with coolant. The LPCI system was first introduced with Dresden units 2 and 3. The LPCI system can also use the RHR heat exchangers to remove decay heat from the reactor and cool the containment to cold conditions. Early versions of the LPCI system injected through the recirculation loops or into the downcomer.

40|$|The {{effects of}} neutron {{irradiation}} on austenitic stainless steels, usually {{used for the}} manufacturing of internal elements of nuclear reactors (e. g. the <b>core</b> <b>shrouds),</b> are the alteration of the microchemistry and the microstructure, and, as a consequence, of the mechanical properties. The present study is aimed at extending knowledge upon the impact of neutron-irradiation on the heat affected zone (HAZ) of welded materials, which {{was influenced by the}} thermal cycles upon fusion welding. Two types of austenitic stainless steels welds, AISI 304 and AISI 347, referred to as test materials, have been produced by FRAMATOME ANP (Germany) using a welding procedure that was a compromise between the conditions applied to real reactor components and the restrictions concerning dimensions and the allowable deformation imposed by this research project. The welded test materials have been irradiated with neutrons in a High Flux Reactor in Petten (The Netherlands) at a temperature of around 573 K (approximate operating temperature of light water reactors) to 0. 3 dpa and 1 dpa. A welded AISI 304 type austenitic stainless steel, so-called in-service material, originating from a decommissioned light water reactor in Mol (Belgium) which had operated for 25 years and having accumulated different dose levels, to a maximum of 0. 3 dpa, was also studied. The effect of neutron irradiation on the HAZ was evaluated by studying the microstructure and mechanical properties before and after irradiation. The characterisation of the microstructure was made by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties were determined by performing microhardness measurements and tensile testing. Tensile tests were conducted on small flat specimens at two deformation temperatures: room temperature and about 573 K. For the unirradiated and very low dose irradiated materials, optical microscopy observations showed that the grain size is larger in the HAZ as compared to the base material (BM) due to the high temperatures reached during welding. The HAZ extends over around 600 µm {{on both sides of the}} weld. TEM observations showed that the HAZ contains a higher dislocation density than the BM due to the thermal cycles upon welding. The HAZ also contains small ferrite islands dispersed in the austenite matrix. Concerning the irradiated materials, TEM observations have shown that the austenitic matrix contains a large number of irradiation-induced defects. These defects are black dots, too small to be identified in TEM, and Frank loops, which can be either of vacancy or of interstitial type. In the in-service material the irradiation-induced defect density was found to be higher in the HAZ as compared to the BM. The higher defect density in the HAZ may be due to the higher grain size in the HAZ as compared to the BM, leaving less sinks (e. g. grain boundaries) for irradiation-induced defects annihilation. No irradiation-induced defects have been observed by TEM in the bcc ferritic interphase, which confirms that the irradiation-induced defects accumulate at a smaller rate in bcc materials than in fcc ones. Following tensile testing at room temperature the microstructure of unirradiated materials contains mainly twins. Following tensile testing at high temperature, the microstructure appears composed of dislocation cells. These results are independent on the specimen position from the fusion line. In the case of irradiated materials the deformation microstructure contains mainly stacking faults and twins. It seems to present no significant dependence on the material type, the irradiation dose and the test temperature. Tensile tests performed on all irradiated materials revealed an increase in the yield strength (radiation hardening) and a decrease of the uniform elongation (loss of ductility), at both deformation temperatures. Radiation hardening presents lower values in the HAZ as compared to the BM. The loss of ductility is higher in the HAZ as compared to the BM. Radiation hardening was analysed using the dispersed obstacle hardening model. It was found that the measured radiation hardening cannot be explained solely by the presence of the irradiation-induced defects observed in TEM. Smaller irradiation-induced features (not resolvable in TEM) apparently also contribute to radiation hardening. In conclusion, the HAZ presents a resistance to neutron-irradiation that is similar to the one of the BM, in terms of accumulation of irradiation-induced defects (black dots and Frank loops) and changes in mechanical properties (hardening and loss of ductility). The degradation of the mechanical properties of the HAZ clearly results from irradiation and not from welding. It seems that the threshold dose for peculiar deterioration of the HAZ, in terms of apparition of cracks or microcracks, was not reached in the present study...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea of the}} {{representation}} of reflectors by boundary conditions in static and dynamic reactor calculations is investigated. Analytical, group-diffusion theory boundary conditions relating neutron flux to normal current at core-reflector interfaces {{in terms of the}} reflector parameters are derived and applied for the implicit treatment of reflectors. Kirchhoff's formula of optics, translated into the neutron-diffusion language, is the general relation from which boundary conditions for various reflector configurations (slab, wedge, elbow), geometrically separable or not, are obtained. The integral form of these boundary conditions in space and/or time generally being unswited for computer implementation, a reduction to simle, approximate algebraic forms is carried out. The finite diffusion length and/or the finite neutron lifetime in various reflector materials are exploited in the above reduction. The bulk of the applications of the reflector-replacement method are for two-dimensional, light water-reflected reactor models with typical, step-like core-reflector interfaces, in steady state. With these models it is found that, if the reflector is viewed as consisting of many, narrow channels perpendicular to the interface and the transchannel leakage is neglected, (so that the one-dimensional- slab boundary conditions can be used to represent the reflector), the accuracy of the method, is extremely good for large, <b>shrouded</b> <b>cores,</b> decreases with core-size and is poor when the surface of a small, unshrouded core contains reentrant corners. In the latter case the accuracy is improved by either the explicit treatment of a light water buffer zone, about 2 cm thick, adjacent to the core and {{the representation}} {{of the rest of the}} reflector by one-dimensional-slab boundary conditions, or the employment of numerical corrections generated internally during the computation or the employment of simple, analytical corrections derived from the infinite-wedge-shaped reflector configuration. The replacement of light water reflectors in transients and the replacement of heavy water or graphite reflectors in steady state or transients are studied in a preliminary way. Excellent results are obtained from the implicit treatment of light water reflectors of one-dimensional-slab geometry in fast transients. Heavy water or graphite reflectors are found to be more difficult to replace by boundary conditions because of their longer diffusion lengths and neutron lifetimes. In all cases, the computational cost is reduced by about 40 % when the reflector is treated implicitly. "November, 1975. "Also issued as an Sc.

5000|$|... == Water-moderated {{reactors}} == Inside {{the core}} of a typical pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor are nuclear fuel rods equivalent to the diameter of a large gel type ink-pen, each about 4 m long, which are grouped by the hundreds in bundles called [...] "fuel assemblies". Inside each fuel rod, pellets of uranium, or more commonly uranium oxide, are stacked end to end. Also inside the core are control rods, filled with pellets of substances like boron or hafnium or cadmium that readily capture neutrons. When the control rods are lowered into the core, they absorb neutrons, which thus cannot take part in the chain reaction. Conversely, when the control rods are lifted out of the way, more neutrons strike the fissile uranium-235 (U-235) or plutonium-239 (Pu-239) nuclei in nearby fuel rods, and the chain reaction intensifies.

50|$|The RPV and Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) have {{significant}} improvements, {{such as the}} substitution of RIPs, eliminating conventional external recirculation piping loops and pumps in the containment that in turn drive jet pumps producing forced flow in the RPV. RIPs provide significant improvements related to reliability, performance and maintenance, including a reduction in occupational radiation exposure related to containment activities during maintenance outages. These pumps are powered by wet-rotor motors with the housings connected {{to the bottom of}} the RPV and eliminating large diameter external recirculation pipes that are possible leakage paths. The 10 internal recirculation pumps are located at the bottom of the annulus downcomer region (i.e., between the <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> and the inside surface of the RPV). Consequently, internal recirculation pumps eliminate all of the jet pumps in the RPV, all of the large external recirculation loop pumps and piping, the isolation valves and the large diameter nozzles that penetrated the RPV and needed to suction water from and return it to the RPV. This design therefore reduces the worst leak below the core region to effectively equivalent to a 2 in leak. The conventional BWR3-BWR6 product line has an analogous potential leak of 24 or more inches in diameter. A major benefit of this design is that it greatly reduces the flow capacity required of the ECCS.|$|E

Initial test results are given for specimens irradiated in the Halden reactor. Impurities introduced by shielded metal arc welding that may affect susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking are described. Results of calculations of residual stresses in <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> weldments are summarized. Crack growth rates of high-nickel alloys under cyclic loading with R ratios from 0. 2 - 0. 95 in water that contains a wide range of dissolved oxygen and hydrogen concentrations at 289 and 320 C are summarized...|$|E
40|$|In December 2006, the Boiling Water Reactor Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP) {{issued a}} letter mandating two-sided {{coverage}} for the volumetric examination of BWR <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> welds. In this letter, they noted that: “Ultrasonic flaw detection and sizing performance is degraded by stainless steel or nickel allow weld metal. The base metal examination volumes {{on both sides of}} the weld should be examined using sound beams that have not passed through the weld metal. Whenever possible, stainless steel or nickel-alloy weld joints should be examined by scanning on both of the two components that are jointed by the weld. When one side of the weld is examined using only beams that have passed through the weld metal, that side of the weld should be considered to have received a “best effort” examination. ” This long awaited letter and the associated new requirements coupled with continued customer interest in improved coverage and reduced outages have supported AREVA’s comprehensive program to modify their <b>core</b> <b>shroud</b> inspection tools and techniques. The basic approach was to address all welds from the annulus between the vessel and the shroud so as to minimize interference with refueling, to examine horizontal, vertical, and ring segment welds with maximum coverage, and to complete the task in the shortest possible time. This paper will discuss: the UT techniques adopted to achieve twosided phased array coverage of the welds; the tool modifications particularly regarding the reduction in tool height to maximize coverage; software features to enhance the tool ergonomics and minimize the possibility of operator errors; and auxiliary tool features to facilitate completion of the inspection in the shortest possible time and with minimal dependence on site resources including the polar crane. The tool has been deployed to two sites following the improvements discussed herein and those field performances are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|In October 1996, the BWRVIP issued Revision 2 of BWRVIP- 01 titled "BWR <b>Core</b> <b>Shroud</b> Inspection and Flaw Evaluation Guideline. " This {{document}} provides simplified {{methods for}} addressing though-wall cracking in BWR core shrouds utilizing linear elastic fracture mechanics techniques. When applying these methodologies, one {{should note that}} they are conservative, and do not address the interaction of part through-wall flaws in combination with through-wall flaws. In some instances, required safety factors have not been met due to these conservatisms. In order to address the possibility of through-wall flaws adjacent to part through-wall flaws, more sophisticated finite element analysis techniques have been utilized. This paper describes methods for addressing this potential condition, with examples provided for problems utilizing classical solutions, and finite element analysis techniques for a 90 symmetric representation of the postulated cracking and a 360 representation for the actual cra [...] ...|$|E
