5|$|Airports with {{international}} flights have <b>customs</b> <b>and</b> immigration facilities, which allow right of entry. These {{change over time}} but are generally designated by law. However, as some countries have agreements that allow connecting flights without <b>customs</b> <b>and</b> immigrations, such facilities do not define an international airport.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{travelers}} and the aircraft can clear <b>customs</b> <b>and</b> immigration at the departure airport. As {{one example of}} this, are airports in Canada with United States border preclearance facilities. This allows flights from those airports to fly into US airports {{that do not have}} <b>customs</b> <b>and</b> immigration facilities. Luggage from such flights can also be transferred to a final destination in the U.S. through the airport of entry.|$|E

50|$|<b>Custom</b> <b>and</b> usage {{evidence}} is highly {{relevant to a}} determination of whether an actor used reasonable care under the circumstances. Such evidence tends to show that taking the omitted precaution that resulted in harm was technologically and economically feasible and that the harm itself was foreseeable. <b>Custom</b> <b>and</b> usage {{evidence is}} not treated as negligence per se: the jury or fact finder must still determine if the <b>custom</b> <b>and</b> usage is reasonable. Thus, <b>custom</b> <b>and</b> usage are merely evidence of {{what ought to be}} done (often highly persuasive evidence), but evidence of <b>custom</b> <b>and</b> usage must still be reconciled with the reasonable person standard. <b>Custom</b> <b>and</b> usage are not conclusive evidence of negligence.|$|R

5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, English {{merchant}} law was still {{based on the}} Lex mercatoria, a medieval series of <b>customs</b> <b>and</b> principles used to regulate trading.
