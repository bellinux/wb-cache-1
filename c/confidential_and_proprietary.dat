The herbicide 2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) conjugated with poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) was prepared via a melt transesterification route. The resultant bioactive oligomer was then {{mixed with a}} blend of polylactide (PLA) and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) with different loadings; to manufacture films {{to be used as}} a bioactive, biodegradable mulch to deliver the herbicide to target broadleaf weed species. The biological targeting of the MCPA-PHBV conjugate in the mulch film was investigated under glasshouse conditions using faba bean (Vicia faba) as a selective (non-target) model crop species having broadleaf morphology. The presence of the MCPA-PHBV conjugate in the biodegradable PBTA/PLA blend was shown to completely suppress the growth of broadleaf weed species, whilst displaying only a mild effect on the growth of the model crop. The degradation of the mulch film under glasshouse conditions was quite slow. The release of the MCPA-PHBV during this process was detected using NMR, GPC, EDS and DSC analyses, indicating that the majority of the MCPA diffused out after MCPA-PHBV conjugate bond scission. These data provide a strong “proof of concept” and show that this biodegradable, bioactive film is a good candidate for future field applications and may be of wide agricultural applicability...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{are smart}} when facing solely {{technical}} attacks; they invented technical strategies {{to defend against}} technical attacks. However, when facing a social engineering attack, a socio-technical attack, humans become the weakest link of security defense. By exploiting vulnerabilities of trust relationships, social engineers physically and psychologically manipulate victims to gain <b>confidential</b> information <b>and</b> <b>proprietary</b> assets. In spite of the severity and universality of social engineering, unfortunately, {{there is no better}} solution but training and educating at present. When dealing with identity verification in face-to-face interactions, threats from social engineering are particularly serious. Verifying human identity and limits of their authority rely on experience and intuition which is far from accurate. After investigation, vulnerabilities of current identity management solutions are discovered. By referring to the protocols used in European ePassport, as well as the growing popularity and security properties of smart devices and biometrics, we decide to use smart card, fingerprint, and Near Field Communication (NFC) -enabled smart phone as main technologies of the mechanism. Due to lack of ideal fingerprint smart card, we use fingerprint sensor enabled smart phone [...] Nexus 5 X and programmable Java card for implementation. The tests and evaluation present the availability and possibility to prevent face-to-face social engineering attacks. Future improvements and expectations of the mechanism are also mentioned in the thesis. Keywords: Social Engineering, Electronic Identity (eID), Smart Card, Biometric...|$|R
40|$|The {{protective}} order is {{perhaps one of}} the most useful and “taken for granted” discovery devices contemplated by the Colorado and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In civil litigation, in which <b>confidential,</b> <b>proprietary,</b> <b>and</b> trademark information is routinely demanded through written discovery requests, the parties often ward off heated discovery disputes through the entry of a joint {{protective order}}. The purpose of this type of protective order is to permit the parties to produce business information—for example, information concerning the design and testing of a particular product—without fear that the information will be disseminated publicly, and with a court order that the information be used only for purposes of the present litigation. The United States Federal District Court for the District of Colorado discussed the usefulness of such “blanket” protective orders in Gillard v. Boulder Valley School District Re. -...|$|R

These employees used their positions, which provided them access to Citibank customers, to induce four customers into giving out the personal identification numbers to their accounts, allowing the employees to illegally siphon funds out of those accounts.

50|$|A {{non-disclosure}} agreement (NDA), {{also known as}} a confidentiality agreement (CA), confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA) or secrecy agreement (SA), is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of <b>confidential</b> <b>and</b> <b>proprietary</b> information or trade secrets. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information.|$|E
5000|$|Cook's initial {{assignment}} {{was to take}} over a Bulletin service, titled [...] "New and Unorthodox Methods of Petroleum Exploration". This service was supported by six oil companies who received the periodic Bulletins, considered <b>confidential</b> <b>and</b> <b>proprietary.</b> It had been expected initially that [...] "new" [...] oil-finding methods would be referred to the Bulletin for study by client oil companies, but this happened rarely or never. So Cook sought out the unconventional techniques by following up leads from research and ads in oil and gas trade journals. He arranged to meet with proponents to see their ideas and equipment in action, traveling the Western states, and attended geophysical and oil trade conventions and exhibits. Cook became president of the San Antonio Geophysical Society for a year, and worked on the national convention of his main professional society, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG). Cook published several papers in the SEG joumal, [...] "Geophysics", which proved a very good way to publish his findings relating to exploration.|$|E

40|$|Provenance in {{scientific}} workflows is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, recording {{information about the}} module executions used to produce a data item, {{as well as the}} parameter settings and intermediate data items passed between module executions, enables transparency and reproducibility of results. On the other hand, a scientific workflow often contains private or <b>confidential</b> data <b>and</b> uses <b>proprietary</b> modules. Hence, providing exact answers to provenance queries over all executions of the workflow may reveal private information. In this paper we discuss privacy concerns {{in scientific}} workflows – data, module, and structural privacy - and frame several natural questions: (i) Can we formally analyze data, module, and structural privacy, giving provable privacy guarantees for an unlimited/bounded number of provenance queries? (ii) How can we answer search and structural queries over repositories of workflow specifications and their executions, providing as much information as possible to the user while still guaranteeing privacy? We then highlight some recent work in this area and point to several directions for future work...|$|R
