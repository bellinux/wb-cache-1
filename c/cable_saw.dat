50|$|Wire saws {{are similar}} in {{principle}} to band saws or reciprocating saws, but they use abrasion to cut rather than saw teeth. Depending on the application, diamond material {{may or may not}} be used as an abrasive. The wire can have one strand or many strands braided together (<b>cable).</b> A single-strand <b>saw</b> can be roughened to be abrasive, abrasive compounds can be bonded to the cable, or diamond-impregnated beads (and spacers) can be threaded on the <b>cable.</b> Wire <b>saws</b> are often cooled and lubricated by water or oil.|$|R
50|$|Cable {{is first}} seen in {{conflict}} with Stryfe's Mutant Liberation Front, the United States government, and Freedom Force. The New Mutants intervened and he asked for their help against the Mutant Liberation Front. <b>Cable</b> <b>saw</b> them as potential soldiers in his war against Stryfe. He became their new teacher and leader, and outfitted them. He came into conflict with Wolverine, noting that the two had an old feud between them. Cable and the New Mutants teamed up with Wolverine and Sunfire against the MLF. Cable also led the New Mutants against the Genoshans.|$|E
5000|$|The Report of the Cable Systems Committee of 1984 {{recommended}} the upgrading {{of the current}} cable systems in Ireland. There seemed {{at this time to}} be no mandate for community or local broadcasts. According to the committee Ireland's cable network had evolved to gain better access to [...] "off‐air" [...] signals coming from Britain. In 1961 the limited use of aerials saw the development of Irish cable. In 1966 RTÉ was given the task of providing cabled services to the Ballymun area. <b>Cable</b> <b>saw</b> restrictions put in places as RTÉ sought to establish itself as a television broadcaster. Only areas with over the air access to ITV and BBC signals were permitted to have cable services (to improve receptions they already had), within those areas only one building or ten houses could use the one link, in 1970 this was increased to 500. This was to try to prevent RTÉ having a monopoly, but they remained in the market with RTÉ Relays.|$|E
40|$|EarthSaw{trademark} is a {{proposed}} technology {{for construction of}} uniform high quality barriers under and around pits and trenches containing buried radioactive waste without excavating or disturbing the waste. The method works by digging a deep vertical trench {{around the perimeter of}} a site, filling that trench with high specific gravity grout sealant, and then cutting a horizontal bottom pathway {{at the base of the}} trench with a simple <b>cable</b> <b>saw</b> mechanism. The severed block of earth becomes buoyant in the grout and floats on a thick layer of grout, which then cures into an impermeable barrier. The ''Interim Report on task 1 and 2 '' which is incorporated into this report as appendix A, provided theoretical derivations, field validation of formulas, a detailed quantitative engineering description of the technique, engineering drawings of the hardware, and a computer model of how the process would perform in a wide variety of soil conditions common to DOE waste burial sites. The accomplishments of task 1 and 2 are also summarized herein Task 3 work product provides a comprehensive field test plan in Appendix B and a health and safety plan in Appendix C and proposal for a field-scale demonstration of the EarthSaw barrier technology.

The decks were all life and commotion; the sailors on the forecastle singing [...] "Ho, cheerly men!"

2500|$|Jeeps {{were used}} by every service of the U.S. military. An average of 145 were {{supplied}} to every Army infantry regiment. Jeeps were used for many purposes, including <b>cable</b> laying, <b>saw</b> milling, as firefighting pumpers, field ambulances, tractors and, with suitable wheels, would even run on railway tracks. An amphibious jeep, the model GPA, or [...] "seep" [...] (Sea Jeep) was built for Ford in modest numbers but {{it could not be}} considered a huge success—it was neither a good off-road vehicle nor a good boat. As part of the war effort, nearly 30% of all Jeep production was supplied to Great Britain and to the Soviet Red Army.|$|R

50|$|Cameron {{traveled}} to continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States in March 1923, investigating foreign operating procedures and innovations. He returned the next year, steadfast in {{his belief that}} trams were superior to buses and that overhead wires were more cost effective than conduit electric collection systems; confirming the view regarding conduit collection he held before his travels. Under Cameron's direction, the MMTB also created a General Scheme for the future development of Melbourne's trams, including new lines, extensions to existing lines, and the abandonment or conversion to electric traction of the cable tram system. Cameron's plan for electrification of the <b>cable</b> system <b>saw</b> resistance from City of Melbourne, Collins Street churches, and town planning groups, who complained that electric trams were noisy, would hold up traffic, and that the electric wires and poles were an eyesore.|$|R
50|$|Mining and {{quarrying}} industries commonly use a wire saw to cut hard stone {{into large}} blocks that {{can then be}} shipped to processing plants to be further refined (in the case of ore dressing) or shipped to distributors (in the case of granite or marble for building). These wire saws are large machines that use diamond-impregnated beads on a <b>cable.</b> The <b>saws</b> allow {{the bottom of a}} quarry slab to be cut free (after the cable is passed through access drill holes); with the bottom cut, back and side charges (explosives) can cleanly cleave the slab. Quarry saws on this principle date back centuries; before the era of steel cables with diamond cutters, there were fiber ropes that drew sand through the kerf. The sand (flushed with water) cut the stone (albeit more slowly than diamond does today).|$|R
50|$|In 1976, the {{regulation}} was {{expanded to include}} cable systems in communities with 3,500 or more subscribers. <b>Cable</b> companies <b>saw</b> {{the regulation}} {{by the federal government}} as an unlawful intrusion into their business practices and immediately started to challenge its legality. In the court case United States v. Midwest Video Corp., the Midwest Video Corporation sued the FCC for overstepping its authority in requiring Public-access television channels. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC’s requirements for local origination facilities. However, in 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Midwest Video Corp. stating that the FCC’s new requirements exceeded the agency’s statutory powers as granted to them by Congress and as required by cable operators to provide Public-access television. The FCC was interfering with the agency's First Amendment rights. After the Supreme Court's decision, PEG advocates started work on what became the Cable Communications Act of 1984.|$|R

40|$|This book {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} aspects of modelling the mechanical behaviour of manufacturing, processing, transportation or other systems {{in which the}} processed or supporting material is travelling through the system. Examples of such applications include paper making, transmission <b>cables,</b> band <b>saws,</b> printing presses, manufacturing of plastic films and sheets, and extrusion of aluminium foil, textiles and other materials.   The work focuses on out-of-plane dynamics and stability analysis for isotropic and orthotropic travelling elastic and viscoelastic materials, with and without fluid-structure interaction, using analytical and semi-analytical approaches.  Also topics such as fracturing and fatigue {{are discussed in the}} context of moving materials. The last part of the book deals with optimization problems involving physical constraints arising from the stability and fatigue analyses, including uncertainties in the parameters.   The book is intended for researchers and specialists in the field, providing a view of the mechanics of axially moving materials. It can also be used as a textbook for advanced courses on this specific topic. Considering topics related to manufacturing and processing, the book can also be applied in industrial mathematics...|$|R

5000|$|Boyce {{claims that}} he began getting {{misrouted}} cables from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) discussing the agency's desire to depose the government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in Australia. Boyce claimed the CIA wanted Whitlam removed from office {{because he wanted to}} close U.S. military bases in Australia, including the vital Pine Gap secure communications facility, and withdraw Australian troops from Vietnam. For these reasons some claim that U.S. government pressure was {{a major factor in the}} dismissal of Whitlam as Prime Minister by the Governor General, Sir John Kerr, who according to Boyce, was referred to as [...] "our man Kerr" [...] by CIA officers. Through the <b>cable</b> traffic Boyce <b>saw</b> that the CIA was involving itself in such a manner, not just with Australia but with other democratic, industrialized allies. Boyce considered going to the press, but believed the media's earlier disclosure of CIA involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état had not changed anything for the better.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Marble had {{the middle}} watch that night, {{and of course}} I was on deck from midnight until four in the morning. It proved misty most of the watch, and for quite an hour we had a light drizzling rain. The ship, the whole time, was close-hauled, {{carrying}} royals. As everybody seemed to have {{made up his mind}} to a quiet night, one without any reefing or furling, most of the watch were sleeping about the decks, or wherever they could get good quarters, and be least in the way. I do not know what kept me awake, for lads of my age are apt to get all the sleep they can; but I believe I was thinking of Clawbonny, and Grace, and Lucy; for the latter, excellent girl as she was, often crossed my mind in those days of youth and comparative innocence. Awake I was, and walking in the weather-gangway, in a sailor's trot. Mr. Marble, he I do believe was fairly snoozing on the hen-coops, being, like the sails, as one might say, barely [...] "asleep."
