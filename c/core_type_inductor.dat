Both Klebsiella <b>core</b> <b>types</b> share the same inner core and the outer-core-proximal disaccharide, GlcN-(1, 4) -GalA, but they differ in the GlcN substituents.

40|$|Abstract—A single-ISA {{heterogeneous}} chip multiprocessor (HCMP) is {{an attractive}} substrate to improve single-thread performance and energy efficiency in the dark silicon era. We consider HCMPs comprised of non-monotonic <b>core</b> <b>types</b> where each <b>core</b> <b>type</b> is performance-optimized to different instruction-level behavior and hence cannot be ranked – different program phases achieve their highest performance on different cores. Although non-monotonic heterogeneous designs offer higher performance potential than either monotonic heterogeneous designs or homogeneous designs, steering applications to the best-performing core is challenging due to performance ambiguity of <b>core</b> <b>types.</b> In this paper, we present a unified view of selecting non-monotonic <b>core</b> <b>types</b> at design-time and steering program phases to cores at run-time. After comprehensive evaluation, we found that with N <b>core</b> <b>types,</b> the optimal HCMP for single-thread performance is comprised of an “average <b>core</b> ” <b>type</b> coupled with N- 1 “accelerator <b>core</b> ” <b>types</b> that relieve distinct resource bottlenecks in the average core. This inspires a complementary steering algorithm in which a running program is continuously diagnosed for bottlenecks on the current core. If any are observed, the program is migrated to an accelerator core that relieves any of the bottlenecks and does not worsen any of them. If no accelerator core satisfies this condition, then the average core is selected. In our evaluation, we show that a 4 -core-type HCMP improves single-thread performance up to 76 % and 15 % on average over a homogeneous chip multiprocessor, and our steering algorithm is able to capture most of this performance gain. Further, we show that our steering algorithm on a 4 -core-type HCMP is, on average, 33 % more power-efficient (BIPS 3 /watt) than a homogeneous chip multiprocessor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—While {{heterogeneous}} CPU/GPU {{systems have}} been traditionally implemented on separate chips, each with their own private DRAM, heterogeneous processors are integrating these different <b>core</b> <b>types</b> on the same die with access to a common physical memory. Further, emerging heterogeneous CPU-GPU processors promise to offer tighter coupling between <b>core</b> <b>types</b> via a unified virtual address space and cache coherence. To adequately address the potential opportunities and pitfalls that may arise from this tighter coupling, {{it is important to}} have a deep understanding of application- and memory-level demands from both CPU and GPU cores. This paper presents a detailed comparison of memory access behavior for parallel applications executing on each <b>core</b> <b>type</b> in tightly-controlled heterogeneous CPU-GPU processor simulation. This characterization indicates that applications are typically designed with similar algorithmic structures for CPU and GPU cores, and each <b>core</b> <b>type’s</b> memory access path has a similar locality filtering role. However, the different core and cache microarchitectures expose substantially different memory-level parallelism (MLP), which results in differ-ent instantaneous memory access rates and sensitivity to memory hierarchy architecture.

40|$|A {{commercial}} flagship superscalar core is {{a highly}} tuned machine. Designers spend significant effort to tune the register-transfer-level (RTL) model, circuits, and layout to optimize performance and power. Nonetheless, the one-size-fits-all microar-chitecture still suffers from suboptimal performance and power on individual applications. A single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core, with its multiple diverse core designs, has potential to exploit application diversity. However, tuning multiple <b>core</b> <b>types</b> will incur insurmountable design effort. This paper proposes {{a new class of}} single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core processor, called design-effort alloy (DEA). Only one of the <b>core</b> <b>types,</b> called the high-effort core (HEC), is tuned using a high-effort design flow. Much less effort is spent on tuning other <b>core</b> <b>types,</b> called low-effort <b>cores</b> (LECs). We begin with synthesizable RTL designs of a palette of out-of-order superscalar <b>core</b> <b>types.</b> A LEC and HEC is designed for each core type: the LEC is based on design automation and the HEC is derived from its LEC counterpart, using frequency and energy scaling factors that account for RTL, circuit, and layout optimizations. The resulting HECs have more than a 2 x frequency advantage with only a 1. 3 x increase in energy consumption compared to their corresponding LECs. From the palette of <b>core</b> <b>types,</b> we find the best 4 -core-type DEA processor for 179 SPEC SimPoints (program phases). Our study yielded the following key results: 1) The DEA processor’s HEC is the same <b>core</b> <b>type</b> in the best high-effort homogeneous multi-core, owing to most program phases demonstrating “average ” instruction-level behavior and favoring this balanced core. 2) The DEA processor yields a speedup in BIPS 3 /W of 1 %- 87 %, and a geometric-mean speedup of 25 %, on 20 out of 179 SimPoints over the best high-effort homogeneous multi-core. Thus, untuned LECs operating at less than half the frequency of the HEC nonetheless accelerate program phases with “outlier ” instruction-level behav-ior. I...|$|R

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} developing a vaccine against O 111 strains of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli that exhibit different mechanisms of virulence is to target either the core or the polysaccharide chain (O antigen) of their lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, due to structural variations found in both these LPS components, to use them as antigen targets for vaccination, {{it is necessary to}} formulate a vaccine able to induce a humoral immune response that can recognize all different variants found in E. coli O 111 strains. In this study, it was demonstrated that, despite differences in composition of oligosaccharide repeat units between O 111 ab and O 111 ac LPS subtypes, antibodies against one O 111 subtype can recognize and inhibit the adhesion to human epithelial cells of all categories of O 111 E. coli (enteropathogenic E. coli [EPEC], enterohemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC], and enteroaggregative E. coli [EAEC]) strains regardless of the nature of their flagellar antigens, mechanisms of virulence, or O 111 polysaccharide subtypes.

The central oligosaccharide of the LPS called core is usually conserved within genus but five <b>core</b> <b>types</b> called R 1 -R 4 and K- 12 have been recognized in E. coli. Structural data on the Shigella core are limited to S. sonnei, S. flexneri and one S. dysenteriae strain, which all share E. coli <b>core</b> <b>types.</b> In this work, we elucidated the core structure in 14 reference strains of S. dysenteriae and S. boydii.
