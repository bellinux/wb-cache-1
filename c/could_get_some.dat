5|$|Warren was {{personally}} responsible for the safety aspects of the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico. There was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours. Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> rest. Fortunately, no problems arose with the test.|$|E

25|$|In 1994 {{the company}} was still having {{financial}} difficulties. There were rumours that Euro Disney was getting close to having to declare bankruptcy. The banks and the backers had meetings to work {{out some of the}} financial problems facing Euro Disney. It was in March 1994 that Team Disney went into negotiations with the banks so that they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> help for their debt. As a last resort, the Walt Disney Company threatened to close the Disneyland Paris park, leaving the banks with the land.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{wonder you}} think so," [...] said Harry, laughing; [...] "but if I were you, I'd go home {{as soon as}} I <b>could,</b> and <b>get</b> <b>some</b> dry clothes." ...|$|R
25|$|For example, at {{the request}} of some of their customers, Verizon created usage {{controls}} that meter service and can switch phones off, so that children <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep. There have also been attempts to limit use by persons operating moving trains or automobiles, coaches when writing to potential players on their teams, and movie theater audiences. By one measure, nearly 40% of automobile drivers aged 16 to 30 years old text while driving, and by another, 40% of teenagers said they could text blindfolded.|$|E
2500|$|As Pascal {{scholars}} observe, Pascal {{regarded the}} many-religions objection as a rhetorical ploy, a [...] "trap" [...] {{that he had}} no intention of falling into. If, however, any who raised it were sincere, they would want to examine the matter [...] "in detail". In that case, they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> pointers by turning to his chapter on [...] "other religions".|$|E
2500|$|Portola's {{expedition}} encountered {{large numbers}} of exceptionally friendly natives, many of whom lived in Syuxtun, a village just {{in back of the}} beach between present-day Chapala and Bath streets. Indeed, the natives [...] – which the Spaniards dubbed the Canaliños for the [...] "canoes" [...] (actually tomols) they used so skillfully – so irritated their guests with gifts and boisterous music that Portola changed the location of his camp on August 19 so the party <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was quite}} right," [...] said his mother. [...] "Let there {{not be one}} word of opposition, you know; only swamp it. You <b>could</b> <b>get</b> up <b>some</b> charades, and have {{something}} going on all the evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lance laughed. [...] "I was hungry. Look!" [...] he said, gayly tossing some silver {{into the}} air. [...] "Do {{you think you}} <b>could</b> <b>get</b> me <b>some</b> breakfast for that, and have enough left to buy {{something}} for yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish we <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him <b>some</b> sort {{of regular}} {{employment}} {{and give him}} a chance to go to school," [...] said Dave. [...] "Let us ask Uncle Dunston about it. He knows quite a number of people in Chicago." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wallace {{considered}} Happy Chandler, {{the former}} baseball commissioner and two-term {{former governor of}} Kentucky, {{as his running mate}} in his 1968 campaign as a third-party candidate; as one of Wallace's aides put it, [...] "We have all the nuts in the country; we <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> decent people–-you working one side of the street and he working the other side." [...] Wallace invited Chandler, but when the press published the prospect, Wallace's supporters objected: Chandler had supported the hiring of Jackie Robinson by the Brooklyn Dodgers.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Bertinot {{checked on}} Joan at 12:30a.m. on March 19. [...] While {{she had not}} improved, she {{appeared}} to have stabilized. Her blood pressure had elevated slightly and she was responding to the peritoneal dialysis. [...] Bertinot felt he could now leave the hospital to get some rest, but Dr. Lanza said he would stay a while longer and would call Dr. Bertinot if anything should change. John Hill also felt he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep and retired to a couch in a hospital records room. [...] By 1:30a.m., both Dr. Lanza and Dr. Hicks had left the hospital. Joan, who had been heavily sedated, was coherent at times. [...] When Hill told her he would be down the hall if needed, she asked the nurse attending her to see {{that her husband was}} made comfortable there.|$|E
2500|$|The F-86 was {{vulnerable}} to the diminutive Folland Gnat, nicknamed [...] "Sabre Slayer." [...] The Gnat is credited by many independent and Indian sources as having shot down seven Pakistani Canadair Sabres in the 1965 war. while two Gnats were downed by PAF fighters. The PAF's F-104 Starfighter of the PAF was the fastest fighter operating in the subcontinent {{at that time and}} was often referred to as [...] "the pride of the PAF". However, according to Sajjad Haider, the F-104 did not deserve this reputation. Being [...] "a high level interceptor designed to neutralise Soviet strategic bombers in altitudes above 40,000 feet," [...] rather than engage in dogfights with agile fighters at low altitudes, it was [...] "unsuited to the tactical environment of the region." [...] In combat the Starfighter was not as effective as the IAF's far more agile, albeit much slower, Folland Gnat fighter. Yet it zoomed into an ongoing dogfight between Sabres and Gnats, at supersonic speed, successfully broke off the fight and caused the Gnats to egress. An IAF Gnat, piloted by Squadron Leader Brij Pal Singh Sikand, landed at an abandoned Pakistani airstrip at Pasrur and was captured by the Pakistan Army. The pilot claimed that most of his equipment failed and even if he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> chance on that, the Starfighters snuffed it. This Gnat is displayed as a war trophy in the Pakistan Air Force Museum, Karachi. Sqn Ldr Saad Hatmi who flew the captured aircraft to Sargodha, and later tested and evaluated its flight performance, was of view that Gnat was no [...] "Sabre Slayer" [...] when it came to dog fighting. The Pakistan Air Force had fought well in countering the much large Indian Air Force and supported the ground forces.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, why don't {{you have}} a shot? We aren't such flyers here. If you know {{one end of a}} bat from the other, you <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into <b>some</b> sort of a team. Were you at school {{anywhere}} before you came here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{man made}} {{a sign of}} acquiescence, though there was malice in his eyes. [...] "I can get even with him, anyway, and it's a sure thing he'd have sent me {{up out of the}} way if he <b>could.</b> <b>Get</b> me <b>some</b> paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will come}} and see him to-morrow. Can't {{you tell us how}} he manages to subdue these wild animals? I always wanted to know about it," [...] said Rose, {{wondering}} if she <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>some</b> hints for the taming of men.|$|R
6000|$|... "If only we <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sort of {{a message}} to the Rover boys and the others," [...] sighed Nellie. [...] "Dora, can't we manage it somehow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He nodded. He hesitated {{over his}} answer {{because he thought}} it sounded boyish. He blushed. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> one I know to make me a sword." ...|$|E

50|$|After leaving Hudson Fur Storage, {{the thieves}} {{returned}} to a hideout Flynn had rented at 5 Golf Avenue in East Providence.

6000|$|Waynefleet {{made the}} young man a little {{inclination}} that was formally courteous. [...] "I am {{glad to see you}} are evidently recovering," [...] he said.

6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I understand; {{and that}} is all right," [...] {{interrupted}} the storekeeper, hastily. [...] "I expected to stay, up to last night, but now I must go. If I <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> <b>some</b> one here besides you, some one who understood customers. Phil can help some, but he is too young." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'He {{would be}} a fine-looking young fellow,' I said, 'if he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of it off. I suppose it is good living and idleness that has done it.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think we}} will smoke, and perhaps, if you made {{yourself}} very agreeable to the steward in the smoking room, you <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> coffee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allow me to hint to you, Archer, {{that if you}} <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> {{food and}} drink for these ladies, instead of {{discussing}} my personal appearance, {{it would be much}} more practical." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] I said. [...] "It's {{getting so}} desperate that I had {{thought for a}} moment, since we can't make our way south, whether I wouldn't try to steer west and make an attempt to reach the {{mailboat}} track. We <b>could</b> always <b>get</b> <b>some</b> quinine from her, at least. What do you think?" ...|$|R
25|$|In late August 1951, Kalchinian, a {{recovering}} drug addict, met Sherman at a doctor's office {{where they were}} both getting treatment for their addiction. They talked about drugs, and Kalchinian eventually asked Sherman if he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him <b>some</b> as his own methadone program wasn't working. Sherman resisted, citing his own efforts to get clean.|$|R

6000|$|... "I believe so," [...] said Mrs. Keith. [...] "He {{certainly}} {{holds his}} opinions firmly, and was once {{looked upon as}} an authority on frontier defence.

His honesty is remembered by men who hold him in esteem." ...|$|R
60|$|Before they decamped for a march, it was needful to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> provisions, if possible, {{and this}} made them the more desirous {{of finding out}} some conversible creatures, {{but it was in}} vain. They killed a wild cow and a deer, and this was all they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> for <b>some</b> time; and with this they set forward, taking their course east, and rather northerly, in order to come into the same {{latitude}} they set out in, at their first embarking on the river.|$|R
500|$|In 1959 the {{features}} editor of The Sunday Times, Leonard Russell, suggested to Ian Fleming that he take a five-week, all-expenses-paid trip {{around the world}} for a series of features for the paper. Fleming declined, saying he was a terrible tourist who [...] "often advocated the provision of roller-skates at the door of museums and art galleries". Russell persuaded him, pointing out that Fleming <b>could</b> also <b>get</b> <b>some</b> material for the Bond books in the process.|$|R
