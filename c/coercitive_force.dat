40|$|MA 956 {{superalloy}} is a ferritic stainless material which {{develops a}} fine, dense, and well-adhered α-alumina layer upon heat treatment at elevated temperatures. This unique capability makes MA 956 attractive for surgical implants. In this work, the magnetic {{behavior of the}} material before and after thermal oxidation treatment required to develop the alumina layer is investigated. The thermal oxidation treatment yields a microstructure of elongated grains and {{a significant change in}} the texture. Despite these strong microstructural differences between the as-received and heat-treated materials, the hysteretic behavior is not greatly affected by them.

The <b>coercitive</b> <b>force</b> and residual magnetization of the material are somewhat lower under heat-treated conditions than in the as-received condition. | MA 956 superalloy is a ferritic stainless material which develops a fine, dense, and well-adhered α-alumina layer upon heat treatment at elevated temperatures.

This article {{attempts}} {{to draw attention}} to what has been globalization and avaluate the impact of this phenomenon on Human Rights. Historically, this kind of fundamental legal garantees, known as Human Rights, were created against the Nation-State, that is to say, they were conceived to protect citizens against the arbitrariness of public power.

Characterizations of the milled powders were carried by X-ray diffraction, a vibratory sample magnetometer at 300 K and Mössbauer spectrometry. It is observed {{the formation of the}} α-bcc-Fe (Cr,Si) phase after 3 hours of milling. The grain size decreases with the increase of the milling time and attains 10 nm at 15 hours. At the temperature of 300 K, the saturation magnetization (Ms) decreases with the milling time. Its value at 10  h of milling time is 167. 4  emu/g. Also, the <b>coercitive</b> <b>force</b> decreases with the milling time. These variations are related to the microstructural changes and the increase of defects induced by milling processes.
