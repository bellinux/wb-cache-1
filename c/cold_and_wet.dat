5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} {{agricultural}} production {{was determined by}} the land and climate. The <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Bone evidence indicates that there was a significant growth in the fish trade around 1000. This increased marine exploitation of the Highlands and Islands may have been {{as a result of the}} arrival of Scandinavian settlers in this period.|$|E
5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} very fond of and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955.|$|E
5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was {{successful}} enough for Lehmann to commission David {{to write a}} sequel, to show the dishes of rural France. This was French Country Cooking, which David finished writing in October 1950. Minton was employed to illustrate the work, and David gave him detailed instructions about the type of drawings; she was more pleased with them than those for her first work. Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live {{for a short time}} in France. She was motivated by a desire to gain a wider knowledge of life in the French countryside, and to put distance between her and her husband. She left London in March 1951 for Ménerbes, Provence. She spent three months in Provence; although the weather was initially <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet,</b> it soon turned warmer and she enjoyed herself so much that she considered buying a house there. In June 1951 she left Ménerbes and travelled to the island of Capri to visit Norman Douglas. When she left in late August, she toured briefly around the Italian Riviera researching for an article for Go, before returning to London.|$|E

25|$|The Hürtgen Forest {{occupies}} a rugged {{area between the}} Rur river and Aachen. The dense conifer forest is broken by few roads, tracks and firebreaks; vehicular movement is restricted. In the autumn and early winter of 1944, the weather was <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> and often prevented air support. Ground conditions varied from wet to snow cover.|$|E
25|$|A similar dish {{consumed}} in the Indian states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh is known as pakhal, pokhalo, pakhala or pakhal bhat. It differs from panta bhat in seasoning as yoghurt is sometimes added prior to the fermentation process. This <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> food, is suitable for summer mornings, but in winter dry foods, such as chira (flattened rice) and muri (puffed rice) are more preferred.|$|E
25|$|Heavy rains {{in autumn}} 1314 began {{several years of}} <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> winters. The already weak harvests of the north {{suffered}} and the seven-year famine ensued. The Great Famine was the worst in European history, reducing the population by at least ten percent. Records recreated from dendrochronological studies show a hiatus in building construction during the period, {{as well as a}} deterioration in climate.|$|E

25|$|During El Niño, winters and springs are {{generally}} <b>colder</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> across southern {{portions of the}} region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Niña, the opposite happens, meaning the cool <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> weather tends to stay further north.|$|R

25|$|On location, {{shooting}} {{conditions were}} often <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet,</b> causing Vigo to become ill {{and develop a}} fever. He was already suffering from tuberculosis and was bedridden for portions of the filming. Vigo refused {{to take a break}} and would often fight with executives at Gaumont over the film. He worked until the film was almost complete and a rough cut had been made.|$|E
25|$|Short cloaks or capes, usually hip-length, {{often with}} sleeves, or a {{military}} jacket like a mandilion, were fashionable. Long cloaks were worn in <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> weather. Gowns were increasingly old-fashioned, and were worn by older men for warmth indoors and out. In this period robes began their transition from general garments to traditional clothing of specific occupations, such as scholars (see Academic dress).|$|E
25|$|By July, the {{settlement}} at Risdon Cove had been abandoned, {{and many of}} Bowen's initial party, {{with the exception of}} the few free settlers, returned to Sydney. By the time of Bowen's eventual departure, few permanent houses had been built, and the winter of 1804 was a particularly wet one, making conditions in the new settlement very unpleasant. Most suffered from the <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet,</b> and disease soon broke out.|$|E
25|$|Winters in Georgia are {{determined}} by the Pacific Ocean. During El Niño, the jet stream is located along the Southern U.S., allowing for <b>colder</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> conditions with greater snowfall. The opposite phase, La Niña, keeps the jet stream further north, thus winters are warmer and drier across Georgia.|$|R
2500|$|In Mediterranean climates, {{soldiers}} typically wore hobnailed [...] "open boots" [...] (caligae). In <b>colder</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> climates, an enclosing [...] "shoeboot" [...] was preferred. Some of the Vindolanda tablets {{mention the}} despatch of clothing - including cloaks, socks, and warm underwear - by families to their relatives, serving at Brittania's northern frontier.|$|R
50|$|The area {{bore the}} German name Reiche Ried until 1847, when German {{geographical}} names were replaced with Hungarian ones. Gazdagrét, {{a translation of}} Reiche Ried, refers to the rich harvest the orchards brought due to the rainfalls coming from Western Hungary. The climate of the neighbourhood is noticeably <b>colder</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> {{than that of the}} Inner City.|$|R
25|$|Average annual {{temperature}} is 18.6°C, {{with the average}} low being at 13°C and average high at 29°C. The daily temperature varies greatly during day and night. The region experiences subtropical maritime climate, which is influenced by monsoon and ocean currents and its geographic location. Matsu has four seasons, where during winter it is <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet,</b> during summer and spring it is foggy and during autumn the weather is generally stable.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the newly}} arrived CURV-III aboard the John Cabot {{was unable to}} launch due to an {{electrical}} fault. Just after midnight Pisces V was ordered to the surface, leaving the men once again alone. They were now running out of both oxygen and the lithium hydroxide to scrub the carbon dioxide from the deteriorating atmosphere in the submersible. Both men were <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> and suffering from severe headaches.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{went back}} on the road, to <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> Minnesota, where {{the first game of}} the series against the Minnesota Twins on April 29 was {{postponed}} because of the poor weather, rescheduled as part of a double-header two days later. The action got back under way on April 30 at Target Field as Zack Greinke improved to 5–0 on the season and the Dodgers racked up their 10,000th win since joining the National League with a 6–4 victory.|$|E
50|$|Solidago ouachitensis {{is likely}} a relict {{of times when}} {{conditions}} were <b>colder</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter.</b> It only occurs in the cooler, moister sites in the Ouachita Mountains, usually in wet forest habitat on north-facing slopes.

25|$|In {{spite of}} those factors, the Outlaws {{averaged}} 21,038 fans (in a 40,000-seat stadium), 14th in the league. It {{might have been}} even higher if not for brutally <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet</b> early-season weather and what amounted to season-long lame duck status. While Tulsa as a USFL host city {{had a number of}} legitimate problems, fan turnout was surprisingly respectable, especially compared to the unsustainable attendance numbers seen by USFL teams in Chicago (7,455), Washington (7,694) and Los Angeles (15,361). They were also one of eight teams whose average attendance was 45 percent or more of listed capacity. The Outlaws would draw decent crowds of 25,403, 21,625, 22,017 and 29,324 later in the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{seriousness}} of the spring equinox drift is widely discounted {{on the grounds that}} Passover will remain in the spring season for many millennia, and the text of the Torah is generally not interpreted as having specified tight calendrical limits. Of course, the Hebrew calendar also drifts with respect to the autumn equinox, and {{at least part of the}} harvest festival of Sukkot is already more than a month after the equinox in years 1, 9, and 12 of each 19-year cycle; beginning in AM 5818 (2057 CE), this will also be the case in year 4. (These are the same year numbers as were mentioned for the spring season in the previous paragraph, except that they get incremented at Rosh Hashanah.) This progressively increases the probability that Sukkot will be <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet,</b> making it uncomfortable or impractical to dwell in the traditional succah during Sukkot. The first winter seasonal prayer for rain is not recited until Shemini Atzeret, after the end of Sukkot, yet it is becoming increasingly likely that the rainy season in Israel will start before the end of Sukkot.|$|E
25|$|The {{stand by}} diver will be {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as short a time as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually more of a problem than <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>wet.</b> It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a helmet, the standby diver may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to sort it out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew know as much as possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible.|$|E
5000|$|Climate: The plains have a {{temperate}} climate, characterised by warm, dry {{summers and}} cool winters. The Southern Alps {{are responsible for}} the relatively low rainfall, and also lead to a foehn wind, the [...] "Canterbury Nor'Wester". This strong, hot and dry wind is most common in spring and summer, and on occasion reaches damage-causing strength. In the mountain country of the Southern Alps, conditions are much <b>colder</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Malham has an Oceanic climate, but is {{generally}} <b>colder</b> <b>and</b> <b>wetter</b> than most settlements in Britain. It has {{a relatively low}} altitude of around 200 metres, but is partly surrounded by fells. This exposed position means the temperature range is limited, due to little pooling of cold air. Extremes of temperature (since 1960) range from 28.2 C during August 1990, [...] down to -13.5 C during March 2001.|$|R
50|$|Bidar city {{is known}} for its Bidri {{handicraft}} products, and its rich history. Bidar is also considered one of the holiest place for Sikh pilgrimage. Unlike other places in the region, Bidar is the <b>coldest</b> <b>and</b> <b>wettest</b> place in north Karnataka. For the year 2009-10, Bidar was ranked 22nd among the cleanest cities in India, and 5th cleanest in Karnataka. SH4 passes through Bidar and the whole city is integrated with 4 lane road.|$|R
