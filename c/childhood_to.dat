5|$|By {{featuring}} {{the life of}} John of Lancaster from early <b>childhood</b> <b>to</b> young adulthood, Heyer conveys a full glimpse of medieval life – court intrigues {{as well as the}} lives of ordinary people are part of the story. Furthermore, while near to major historical players, John's apartness from power allows Heyer to create a fuller depiction of his life without having to change major historical events.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} found that environmental uncertainty leads people to behave differently {{depending on their}} childhood environment. For example, economic uncertainty leads people from poor <b>childhoods</b> <b>to</b> become more impulsive while leading people from wealthy <b>childhoods</b> <b>to</b> become less impulsive. Drawing on life history theory, we examine the psychological mechanism driving such diverging responses to uncertainty. Five experiments show that uncertainty alters people’s sense {{of control over the}} environment. Exposure to uncertainty led people from poorer <b>childhoods</b> <b>to</b> have a significantly lower sense of control than those from wealthier childhoods. In addition, perceptions of control statistically mediated the effect of uncertainty on impulsive behavior. These studies contribute by demonstrating that sense of control is a psychological driver of behaviors associated with fast and slow life history strategies. We discuss the implications of this for theory and future research, including that environmental uncertainty might lead people who grew up poor to quit challenging tasks sooner than people who grew up wealthy...|$|R

5|$|The book {{begins as}} a chronological {{narrative}} of Suzuki's life with photographs {{of his family and}} friends. The first five chapters cover the same time period as the first autobiography, from <b>childhood</b> <b>to</b> age fifty. Later chapters use a memoir style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with indigenous groups and his personal relationships with individual members. A travelogue of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 a year. From <b>childhood</b> <b>to</b> old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E

5|$|Bookends is {{a concept}} album that explores a life journey from <b>childhood</b> <b>to</b> old age. Side one of the album marks {{successive}} stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon, who joined the recording when Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.|$|E

5|$|As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} the national team of both countries. Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since <b>childhood.</b> <b>To</b> further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games, proving more effective when coming on in the second half. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the move away from figurative {{painting}} to impressionism and abstraction, continued the decline of portrait painting. The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in {{the twentieth century}} were the four members of the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. Of their number Francis Cadell (1883–1937), emerged as a significant painter of still lives and single figure compositions, particularly with interior backdrops, before moving closer to abstraction. Of the next significant movement, known as The Edinburgh School, Cecile Walton (1891–1956) referenced classical forms, particularly in her ironic self-portrait Romance (1920), which draws on Titian's Venus of Urbino and Manet's Olympia. Her close friend Dorothy Johnstone's portraits, such as the young girl in September Sunlight (1916), made use of interior natural light. The work of James Cowie (1886–1956), who painted a number of girls in interior settings, is similar in theme to that of Johnstone, but had a more distant and elegiac feel that can be seen in Falling Leaves (1934), which has been read as a commentary as a commentary on the transition from <b>childhood</b> <b>to</b> adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Ofuji was {{responsible}} for creating the basic scenario from which Brotherhoods main writers would work: working from the character sheets created by the writers of Final Fantasy XV, he created the entire scenario based on each character's background characteristics, such as Ignis' love of baking and Prompto's childhood obesity. The anime focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and includes interpersonal scenes {{that could not be}} included in the game. Its storyline details the backstory of Noctis from his <b>childhood</b> <b>to</b> the game's opening, along with the backstories of his companions. The first and last episodes tie directly into the events of , a free tech demo showing Noctis' journey through a dreamworld during a near-death experience. The anime also serves as an introduction for potential players to the characters. In previous Final Fantasy games, the player party was built up gradually {{over the course of the}} game. In Final Fantasy XV, the complete party will be available from the start, and since the backstory moments could not be fitted into the game, the anime serves as a similar means of allowing players to sympathize with them. Each episode's event also helped detail some of the characters' different social classes, with the cited example being the contrast between Prompto's small house and hard-working parents when compared to Gladiolus' more luxurious life.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>childhood</b> exposure <b>to</b> air pollution and diagnosis with chronic non-respiratory health outcomes in adulthood. This prospective cohort study uses data collected in the 1970 / 1980 s from 395 children, including exposure to air pollution. Over thirty years later, a survey collected data on various health outcomes, including diagnosis with arthritis, high blood pressure, long-term skin conditions, and hay fever allergies. Logistic regression modeling was performed to examine the relative contribution of <b>childhood</b> exposure <b>to</b> air pollution on chronic non-respiratory health outcomes in adulthood. <b>Childhood</b> exposure <b>to</b> SO 2 emerged as {{a significant predictor of}} arthritis (OR = 2. 73, 95 % CI 1. 20 - 6. 18) and high blood pressure (OR = 2. 82, 95 % CI 1. 23 - 6. 47). Other significant predictors include respiratory symptoms during childhood, family income during childhood and adulthood, property tenure, employment status, residential exposures, life events, physical activity, and body mass index. <b>Childhood</b> exposure <b>to</b> air pollution did not emerge as a significant predictor of long-term skin conditions or hay fever allergies. Findings contribute to the debate on the health effects of air pollution, indicating that the health impacts of <b>childhood</b> exposure <b>to</b> air pollution may include chronic inflammatory disorders in adulthood. </p...|$|R
