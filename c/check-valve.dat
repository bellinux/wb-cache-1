5000|$|The actual {{construction}} of the Icyball is slightly more complex than described above, to improve the efficiency: The connecting tube runs to {{the lower part of}} the warm ball, allowing the ammonia vapor to bubble through the water speeding absorption, and also serving to stir the solution so heat is better transported to the finned walls.

The operation of the liquid check valve was somewhat similar to the water seals (J-traps) used in plumbing drains. Mechanical check valves require too much pressure to function properly in this application. To minimize the amount of water transferred to the cold ball during the recharge cycle, trapping structures were placed in the upper part of the connecting tube, allowing only gas to pass, and directing water back to the warm side ball.|$|E

5000|$|A chest {{drainage}} system is typically {{used to collect}} chest drainage (air, blood, effusions). Most commonly, {{drainage system}}s use three chambers {{which are based on}} the three-bottle system. The first chamber allows fluid that is drained from the chest to be collected. The second chamber functions as a [...] "water seal", which acts as a one way valve allowing gas to escape, but not reenter the chest. Air bubbling through the water seal chamber is usual when the patient coughs or exhales but may indicate, if continual, a pleural or system leak that should be evaluated critically. It can also indicate a leak of air from the lung. The third chamber is the suction control chamber. The height of the water in this chamber regulates the negative pressure applied to the system. A gentle bubbling through the water column minimizes evaporation of the fluid and indicates that the suction is being regulated to the height of the water column. In this way, increased wall suction does not increase the negative pressure of the system. Newer drainage systems eliminate the water seal using a mechanical <b>check-valve,</b> and some also use a mechanical regulator to regulate the suction pressure. Systems which employ both these are dubbed [...] "dry" [...] systems, whereas systems that retain the water seal but use a mechanical regulator are called [...] "wet-dry" [...] systems. Systems which use a water seal and water column regulator are called [...] "wet" [...] systems. Dry systems are advantageous as tip-overs of wet systems can spill and mix with blood, mandating the replacement of the system. Even newer systems are smaller and more ambulatory so the patient can be sent home for drainage if indicated.|$|E
40|$|Objective There is {{agreement}} that symptomatic sacral men-ingeal cysts with a <b>check-valve</b> mechanism and/or large cysts representing space-occupying lesions should be trea-ted surgically.

Methods In ten patients presenting with sciatica and neuro-logical deficits, myelography, computed tomography (CT) myelography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MR imag-ing) detected sacral meningeal cysts with a <b>check-valve</b> mechanism. One patient had two primary cysts. Ten cysts were type 2 and one cyst was type 1. Nine of the ten patients had not undergone previous surgery, while the remaining case involved recurrent cyst. For the seven patients with normal (i. e., not huge or recurrent) type 2 cysts and no previous surgery (eight cysts), suture after collapse of the cyst wall was performed. For the recurrent type 2 cyst, duraplasty and suture with collapse of the cyst wall were performed to eliminate the <b>check-valve</b> mechanism. For the remaining type 2 cyst, a primary root was sacrificed because of the huge size of the cyst. For the type 1 cyst, {{the neck of the}} cyst was ligated.

40|$|International audienceDeep aquifer {{monitoring}} is {{a challenge}} in terms of representativeness of the sample. Such monitoring is often done when pumping isnot adequate due to: 1) too deep water table level, 2) no willing to add disturbance to the aquifer (low recharge rate) or 3) too difficultmanagement at surface of discharge waters. Deep sampling may rely {{on the use of}} sampling bottles but these have a fixed volumeand need to lower and to remove the bottle each time a sample is needed. Ball <b>check-valves</b> and pressure gas drive samplers have been developed to overcome this bias such as the US U-tube system.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 11, 2014). [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] A number of {{oscillating}} heat pipes (OHPs) with unbalanced structures were investigated {{in an effort}} to develop methods enabling OHPs to be gravity independent. The unbalanced structures investigated herein include the effects of uneven turn and check valves. Two 2 -D and two 3 -D tubular uneven-turn OHPs, four miniature uneven-turn OHPs, and one OHP with <b>check-valves</b> were investigated. At the same time, the theoretical analysis of the maximum channel diameter was conducted in order to find the primary factor affecting the channel size in an OHP. A model was developed that attempts to determine the maximum channel diameter by considering the contact angle effect. It is found that the contact angle significantly affects the maximum channel diameter of an OHP. In order to verify that the uneven-turn structure can generate the oscillating motion in an OHP, a heat pipe with 3 turns in the condenser and 6 turns in the evaporator was first tested. The heat pipe with uneven turns can generate and maintain oscillating motion. When the turn number increases with 16 turns in the condenser and 20 turns in the evaporator, the heat transfer performance can be further increased. An experimental investigation of a new 3 -D OHP with uneven turn design was conducted in order to further develop a gravity independent OHP. Experimental results show that the uneven turn OHP developed herein can start the oscillating motion in the negative vertical position (the evaporator being above the condenser) and demonstrate that the uneven turn OHPs can significantly reduce the effect of gravity on the heat transport capability in an OHP. Three miniature OHPs (18 -turn acetone OHP, 18 -turn water OHP, and 20 -turn acetone OHP) were developed and tested to determine whether the uneven-turn OHPs can function in a high-g environment. Experimental results demonstrate that these miniaturized uneven turn designs are extremely capable in high gravity environments and will operate effectively in any orientation. An OHP with check valves has been successfully developed and tested to determine the check valve effect on the oscillating motion and heat transfer performance in an OHP. Experimental results show that the OHP with check valves can function well in both the inverted and vertical positions with little variation between the two positions in performance once startup occurred, while the control OHP without check valves which had the same channel layout was not able to achieve startup in the inverted position. This shows that the check valves allowed the OHP to operate in the inverted position first achieving startup and then maintain oscillating motion...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a 13 -year-old boy suffering from congenital bronchial atresia of the anterior and apicoposterior {{segments of the}} left upper lobe with corresponding emphysema, and emphysema with bronchial atresia in the anterobasal segment of the left lower lobe. The aetiology of congenital localized emphysema is not always clear. In the group with a demonstrable <b>check-valve</b> mechanism, which permits air to enter but not to leave the lung, there is either internal stenosis or external compression of the bronchus. The condition is called idiopathic if no cause can be identified, but {{in some of these}} cases microscopical examination has disclosed alveolar fibrosis which prevents the rigid alveoli from collapsing on expiration. In these cases the <b>check-valve</b> mechanism exists at an alveolar level. In the small group of rare cases of bronchial atresia, air which enters through a collateral ventilation cannot be expired by the same route, and in these cases there is likewise a <b>check-valve</b> mechanism at an alveolar level; this is associated with the occurrence of localized emphysema, characterized by the presence of normal bronchial ramifications which arise from a bronchial sac with a blind proximal ending. The bronchial atresia is believed to occur after the 15 th week of intrauterine life, probably as a result of vascular insufficiency.

40|$|Glaucoma is an {{eye disease}} that {{gradually}} steals vision. Open angle glaucoma {{is one of}} the most common glaucoma forms, in which eye fluid (aqueous humor) produced by the ciliary body cannot be drained away normally by patients’ eyes. The accumulated eye fluid inside the anterior chamber causes high intraocular pressure (IOP), which is transmitted onto the retina in the back of the eyeball (globe), continuously suppressing and damaging the patient’s optic nerves; this may lead to total blindness if not treated properly. The current most-popular IOP monitoring technique is to use applanation tonometry, which applies applanation force onto the cornea and measures the resulting deformation in order to calculate the IOP. Even though applanation tonometry can provide quite useful information about patients’ IOP, continuous monitoring of IOP is required for ophthalmologists to understand the IOP fluctuation of the patients, something which still cannot be achieved via current applanation approach. In addition, applanation tonometry requires skillful operation performed by well-trained professionals, such as ophthalmologists, making continuous IOP monitoring impractical. In this work, we have developed a telemetric IOP sensor that is capable of monitoring IOP wirelessly and continuously. As the quality factor drops when a telemetric IOP sensor is implanted in the anterior chamber, due to the high loss tangent of the saline-based aqueous humor (0. 2) compared to air (0. 0), a modified IOP sensor is developed to monitor IOP with sensing coil that is left exposed after implantation in order to avoid interruption from the eye fluid. Another approach is also proposed and tested to demonstrate that the quality factor can also be recovered by covering the sensing coil with low loss tangent materials. Currently glaucoma is treated mostly by taking oral medications or applying eye drops. However, some glaucoma patients do not respond to those medications. Therefore, another physical approach, using a glaucoma drainage device (GDD), is necessary in order to drain out excessive eye fluid and serve as a long-term way to manage the increased IOP. Current commercially available glaucoma drainage devices do not have reliable valve systems to stop the drainage when the IOP falls into the normal range. Therefore, we have developed a dual-valved GDD to fulfill the “band-pass” flow regulation which drains out eye fluid only when IOP is higher than 20 mmHg, and stops drainage (closes the valve) when IOP is lower than 20 mmHg to prevent hypotony. The key component of GDD is a normally closed (NC) <b>check-valve,</b> which only opens to drain away the excess fluid when the pressure is higher than 20 mmHg. The proposed paradigm of our NC <b>check-valve</b> is to have a couple of parylene-C pre-stressed slanted tethers to provide the desired cracking pressure. The slanted tethers are achieved in this thesis by: 1) slanted photoresist generated by gray-scale photolithography, 2) pop-up mechanism, and 3) self-stiction bonding mechanism. The built-in residual tensile stress can be controlled by mechanical stretching or thermal annealing. The protecting mechanism preventing the unwanted drainage when the eyes experience sudden unpredicted high IOP is achieved by utilizing a normally open (NO) <b>check-valve.</b> A “minimally invasive implantation” procedure is proposed in the thesis to implant the GDD subconjunctivally. The small size of the device allows its insertion using a # 19 -gauge needle. To accurately design the desired cracking pressure and also predict the lifetime of the NC <b>check-valve,</b> parylene-C’s mechanical, thermal, and polymer properties are investigated. The results show that the properties of parylene-C are highly process-temperature-dependent and therefore can be tailored by adjusting the thermal annealing process. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{replication}} of the ϕ 29 bacteriophage inside a bacterial host cell, a DNA packaging motor transports the viral DNA into the procapsid against a pressure difference {{of up to}} 40 ± 20 atm. Several models have been proposed for the underlying molecular mechanism. Here we have used molecular dynamics simulations to examine {{the role of the}} connector part of the motor, and specifically the one-way revolution and the push-roll model. We have focused at the structure and intermolecular interactions between the DNA and the connector, for which a near-complete structure is available. The connector is found to induce considerable DNA deformations with respect to its canonical B-form. We further assessed by force-probe simulations to which extent the connector is able to prevent DNA leakage and found that the connector can act as a partial one-way valve by a <b>check-valve</b> mechanism via its mobile loops. Analysis of the geometry, flexibility, and energetics of channel lysine residues suggested that this arrangement of residues is incompatible with the observed DNA packaging step-size of ∼ 2. 5  bp, such that the step-size is probably determined by the other components of the motor. Previously proposed DNA revolution and rolling motions inside the connector channel are both found implausible due to structural entanglement between the DNA and connector loops that have not been resolved in the crystal structure. Rather, in the simulations, the connector facilitates minor DNA rotation during the packaging process compatible with recent optical-tweezers experiments. Combined with the available experimental data, our simulation results suggest that the connector acts as a <b>check-valve</b> that prevents DNA leakage and induces DNA compression and rotation during DNA packaging...|$|E

The major part of this work {{has been carried out}} in animals (Fromherz and Pellmont, 1952; Benson, O'Gara and Van Winkle, 1952), although there is one clinical report of observations on the respiratory effect in man (Hamilton and Cullen, 1953). Quantitative evaluation of the respiratory effect of these substances either alone or in combination is lacking, and it was for this reason that the present study was initiated. METHODS. Nine healthy male volunteers between the ages 21 and 33 were used as sub jects. All observations were made while the subject was in the reclining position. A nose clip and rubber mouthpiece were worn, the latter connected to a <b>check-valve</b> arrangement the input of which led from a Douglas bag and the output to a gasmeter. Respiratory fre quency was recorded on continuously moving paper by a galvanometer which was acti vated by a strain gauge pneumograph device. Observations were made on each inspired ga...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a low-cost, PDMS-membrane {{micropump}} with two one-way ball check-valves for lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic applications. The micropump consists of two functional PDMS layers, one holding the ball check-valves and an actuating chamber, and the other covering the chamber and holding a miniature permanent magnet on top for actuation. An additional PDMS layer is used to cover the top magnet, and thereby encapsulate the entire device. A simple approach was used to assemble a high-performance ball <b>check-valve</b> using a micropipette and heat shrink tubing. The micropump can be driven by an external magnetic force provided by another permanent magnet or an integrated coil. In the first driving scheme, a small do motor (6 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length) with a neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnet embedded in its shaft was used to actuate the membrane-mounted magnet. This driving method yielded a large pumping rate with very low power consumption. A maximum pumping rate of 774 μ L min(- 1) for deionized water was achieved at the input power of 13 mW, the highest pumping rate {{reported in the literature}} for micropumps at such power consumptions. Alternatively, we actuated the micropump with a 10 -turn planar coil fabricated on a PC board. This method resulted in a higher pumping rate of 1 mL min(- 1) for deionized water. Although more integratable and compact, the planar microcoil driving technique has a much higher power consumption...|$|E
30|$|Changes in {{atmospheric}} pressure {{are related to}} {{a higher incidence of}} spontaneous primary pneumothorax. Atmospheric pressure changes from day to day are usually small. However, during flying or diving significant changes in pressure will occur. Therefore it might be expected that patients with a predisposition for air trapping, such as cystic lesions not connected to the airways, have a considerable risk of developing a pneumothorax. Especially in diving, pulmonary barotrauma may result in serious complications. The increased risk of pneumothorax associated with changes in {{atmospheric pressure}} can be explained by a change in transpulmonary pressure in regions with air trapping, and not in direct connection with the airways, resulting in a higher pressure compared to the atmosphere (Scott et al. 1989; Suarez-Varel et al. 2000; Bense 1984; Bulajich et al. 2005; Haga et al. 2013). Air trapping may be caused by peripheral airway inflammation with a <b>check-valve</b> mechanism resulting in obstruction of the airway (Smit et al. 2004; Cottin et al. 1998). In addition, lung cysts, emphysematous blebs or bullae may predispose to air trapping (Edmonds et al. 1992). Examples of diseases with cystic lesions in the lung are lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome (BHD). BHD is an autosomal dominant condition caused by germline mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene, clinically characterized by skin fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts (recurrent) spontaneous pneumothorax and an increased risk of renal cell cancer. Pneumothorax may be the first and only manifestation of BHD both in isolated and familial cases. Approximately 90  % of BHD patients show multiple lung cysts on standard CT. Lung function generally remains unaffected, demonstrated by normal spirometry and diffusion capacity (Johannesma et al. 2014 a).|$|E
30|$|Knowledge of the {{development}} of the lungs and airways in children is helpful for understanding the specific findings and presentation in acute emergencies. The collateral pathways of ventilation in the lungs (channels of Lambert and pores of Kohn) are underdeveloped until the age of approximately 8  years. In addition children have more mucus production in the bronchial tree than adults [1, 2]. The smaller calibre of their airways combined with softer walls may lead to earlier and more symptomatic airflow disturbances, even with minor amounts of oedema and mucus. This can be illustrated by an example considering a thickening of the tracheal mucosa of 1  mm: In an adult with a tracheal diameter of 20  mm this 1 -mm thickening causes a reduction of the tracheal lumen of 17.5 %. In a baby with a tracheal diameter of 5  mm the same thickening of 1  mm causes a lumen reduction of 63.8 %. Narrowing of the tracheal lumen by infectious oedema or extrinsic mechanical obstruction may cause an acute <b>check-valve</b> mechanism of the airways causing air trapping. In infants there is also a closer relationship between the thoracic organs, and pathological processes in the thoracic cavity may have an earlier and more severe impact on the neighbouring organs. The thymus is a soft tissue mass that does not compress the airways or the vessels in the anterior mediastinum. The presence (of a thymic shadow) is normal until the age of 4 – 5  years and does not cause any clinical symptoms. It is a well-known pitfall and should not be mistaken for a mediastinal tumour.|$|E
40|$|A simple design {{concept for}} check valves {{has been adopted}} for {{microfluidic}} devices that consist mostly of (1) deformable fluorocarbon polymer membranes sandwiched between (2) borosilicate float glass wafers into which channels, valve seats, and holes have been etched. The first microfluidic devices in which these check valves are intended to be used are micro-capillary electrophoresis (microCE) devices undergoing development for use on Mars in detecting compounds indicative of life. In this application, {{it will be necessary}} to store some liquid samples in reservoirs in the devices for subsequent laboratory analysis, and check valves are needed to prevent cross-contamination of the samples. The simple <b>check-valve</b> design concept is also applicable to other microfluidic devices and to fluidic devices in general. These check valves are simplified microscopic versions of conventional rubber- flap check valves that are parts of numerous industrial and consumer products. These check valves are fabricated, not as separate components, but as integral parts of microfluidic devices. A check valve according to this concept consists of suitably shaped portions of a deformable membrane and the two glass wafers between which the membrane is sandwiched (see figure). The valve flap is formed by making an approximately semicircular cut in the membrane. The flap is centered over a hole in the lower glass wafer, through which hole the liquid in question is intended to flow upward into a wider hole, channel, or reservoir in the upper glass wafer. The radius of the cut exceeds the radius of the hole by an amount large enough to prevent settling of the flap into the hole. As in a conventional rubber-flap check valve, back pressure in the liquid pushes the flap against the valve seat (in this case, the valve seat is the adjacent surface of the lower glass wafer), thereby forming a seal that prevents backflow...|$|E
40|$|One-dimensional {{water-hammer}} modeling {{involves the}} solution of two coupled non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). These equations result from applying the principles of conservation of mass and momentum to flow through a pipe, and usually {{the assumption that the}} speed at which pressure waves propagate through the pipe is constant. In order to solve these equations for the interested quantities (i. e. pressures and flow rates), they must first be converted to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by either approximating the spatial derivative terms with numerical techniques or using the Method of Characteristics (MOC). The MOC approach is ideal in that no numerical approximation errors are introduced in converting the original system of PDEs into an equivalent system of ODEs. Unfortunately this resulting system of ODEs is bound by a time step constraint so that when integrating the equations the solution can only be obtained at fixed time intervals. If the fluid system to be modeled also contains dynamic components (i. e. components that are best modeled by a system of ODEs), {{it may be necessary to}} take extremely small time steps during certain points of the model simulation in order to achieve stability and/or accuracy in the solution. Coupled together, the fixed time step constraint invoked by the MOC, and the occasional need for extremely small time steps in order to obtain stability and/or accuracy, can greatly increase simulation run times. As one solution to this problem, a method for combining variable step integration (VSI) algorithms with the MOC was developed for modeling water-hammer in systems with highly dynamic components. A case study is presented in which reverse flow through a dual-flapper check valve introduces a water-hammer event. The predicted pressure responses upstream of the <b>check-valve</b> are compared with test data...|$|E
