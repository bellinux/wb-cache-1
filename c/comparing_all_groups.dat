Forty eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this experiment. They were divided into six groups of eight each and maintained under ideal laboratory conditions. Group I was taken as control and group II treated with the standard drug diclofenac potassium @ 3 mg/kg/celecoxib @ 10 mg/kg (in case of COX– 2 assay) on 7 th day of study. The methanolic extract of Nelumbo nucifera seeds of red and white varieties @ 400 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg were fed to group III, IV, V and VI respectively, for 7 days. All groups of lotus seed extracts were revealed anti-inflammatory activity in Carragenin induced inflammation as well as in COX- 2 enzyme inhibition assay.

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates, at a proteomic level, changes in protein {{abundance}} in sunflower {{leaves in the}} absence or presence (at 50 or 700 mg) of cadmium (as CdCl 2). At {{the end of the}} cultivation period (45 days), proteins are extracted from leaves with phenol, separated by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2 -D DIGE), and excised from the gels. The differential protein abundances (for proteins differing by more than 1. 8 fold, which corresponds to 90 % variation) are characterized using nESI-LC-MS/MS. The protein content decreases by approximately 41 % in plants treated with 700 mg Cd compared with control plants. By <b>comparing</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> of plants evaluated in this study (Control vs. Cd-lower, Control vs. Cd-higher and Cd-lower vs. Cd-higher), 39 proteins are found differential and 18 accurately identified; the control vs. Cd-higher treatment is that presenting the most differential proteins. From identified proteins, those involved in energy and disease/defense (including stress), are the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain, transketolase, and heat shock proteins are the most differential abundant proteins. Thus, at the present study, photosynthesis is the main process affected by Cd in sunflowers, although these plants are highly tolerant to Cd. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the periapical tissue response after root end filling with intermediate restorative material (IRM) and filling of the root-end resection bone defects with autogenous bone or a bone graft substitute {{in comparison to}} empty controls. Materials and Methods: Vital roots of the second, third and fourth mandibular premolars in six healthy mongrel dogs were apectomized. The root canals were prepared and sealed with IRM following a standardized surgical procedure. The resection bone defects were either filled with autogenous bone (PB) {{or one of the}} bone graft substitutes; CERAMENT TM |BONE VOID FILLER, ChronOS ?, Tigran TM PTG, Easygraft ? CLASSIC or left empty. After 120 days the animals were sacrificed and the specimens were analyzed radiologically and histologically. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were performed for statistical evaluation. Results: 34 sections were analyzed histologically. The evaluation revealed a variation in the outcome amongst the tested options, regarding reestablishment of the periapical bone healing and inflammatory infiltration in the sections. According to the tested variables, there was no statistical significant difference between the materials when <b>comparing</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> as a whole. When comparing individual materials to each other there was statistical differences among some of the tested materials. Conclusion: The healing outcome after periapical surgery of a five-wall resection defect could not be increased by infill with autogenous bone or bone graft substitutes. The most important factor for the healing outcome in periapical surgery is the quality of the root-end sealing. The healing outcome after some of the tested bone substitutes, might be improved by longer healing time. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The luteal phase after ovarian {{hyperstimulation}} for {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) is insufficient. Therefore, luteal phase supplementation is routinely applied in IVF. It may be postulated that premature luteolysis after ovarian hyperstimulation is due to supraphysiological steroid levels in the early luteal phase. In the present study, high doses of steroids are administered after the LH surge in normo-ovulatory volunteers in order to investigate whether this intervention gives rise to endocrine changes and a shortening of the luteal phase. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: Forty non-smoking, normal weight women, between 18 and 37 years of age, with a regular menstrual cycle (24 – 35 days), received either high dosages of estradiol (E 2), progesterone (P), E 2 CPor no medication. Blood sampling was performed every other day from {{the day of the}} LH surge until LHC 14. Duration of the luteal phase and endocrine profiles were the main study outcomes. Results: Early luteal phase steroid concentrations achieved by exogenous administration were comparable with levels observed following ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF. No difference in the luteal phase length was observed <b>comparing</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups.</b> However, a significant decrease in LH levels could be observed 6 days after the mid-cycle LH surge (P! 0. 001) in women receiving P, resulting in accelerated decrease of inhibin A production by the corpus luteum (PZ 0. 001). Conclusion: The present intervention of high-dose steroid administration shortly after the LH surge failed to induce a premature luteolysis regularly in cyclic women. It seems that the induced transient suppression in LH allowed for a timely recovery of corpus luteum function. Other additional factors may be held responsible for the distinct reduction in luteal phase length observed after ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF...|$|E
40|$|Background. A {{simple and}} {{reliable}} method {{is needed to}} assess disease activity and monitor the efficacy of therapy in polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM). This study used in vitro proton (1 H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to explore whether excretion of urinary metabolites {{can be used as}} a reliable marker of disease in PM and DM patients. Methods. Urine samples were obtained from PM/DM patients (n= 34), healthy controls (50) and subjects with known muscle?wasting conditions including adult?onset muscular dystrophy (8), stroke patients (10), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on steroids (13) and not on steroids (16) and patients with alcoholic myopathy (12). Levels of urinary metabolites were then correlated with creatine kinase (CK) activities and quadriceps muscle strength. Results. Creatine was detected in the urine in 26 of 35 patients with PM/DM, four of 60 cases with other medical disorders (including one with adult?onset dystrophy, one with a stroke and two with RA who were not on steroids) and 10 of 50 healthy controls. The urinary creatine/creatinine ratio exceeded 0. 4 in 20 patients with PM/DM but no patients with other medical disorders and no healthy controls. These differences were highly significant (P< 0. 001) by Kruskal–Wallis test (<b>comparing</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups)</b> and by Mann–Whitney U?tests (comparing individual groups with PM/DM cases). Citrate, glycine, choline?containing compounds and taurine levels were significantly increased in PM/DM when compared with controls. There were positive correlations between CK activities and choline?containing compounds (r= 0. 78, P= 0. 0006) and also between CK activities and betaine (r= 0. 57, P= 0. 026). Conclusions. This study shows significant differences in the urinary levels of creatine, choline?containing metabolites, betaine and citrate in PM/DM subjects compared with controls, although further work is required to elucidate the underlying metabolic processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Glucocorticoids such as {{prednisolone}} and dexamethasone {{are critical}} drugs used in multi-agent chemotherapy protocols {{used to treat}} acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and response to glucocorticoids is highly predictive of outcome. The NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model of ALL is a clinically relevant model in which the mice develop a systemic leukemia which retains the fundamental biological characteristics of the original disease. Here we report a study evaluating the NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model to investigate glucocorticoid-induced gene expression. Cells from a glucocorticoid-sensitive xenograft derived from a child with B-cell precursor ALL were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice. When highly engrafted the mice were randomized into groups of 4 to receive dexamethasone 15 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection or vehicle control. Leukemia cells were harvested from mice spleens at 0, 8, 24 or 48 hours thereafter, and gene expression analyzed on Illumina WG- 6 _V 3 chips, <b>comparing</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> to time 0 hours. Results The 8 hour dexamethasone-treated timepoint had {{the highest number of}} significantly differentially expressed genes, with fewer observed at the 24 and 48 hour timepoints, and with minimal changes seen across the time-matched controls. When compared to publicly available datasets of glucocorticoid-induced gene expression from an in vitro cell line study and from an in vivo study of patients with ALL, at the level of pathways, expression changes in the 8 hour xenograft samples showed a similar response to patients treated with glucocorticoids. Replicate analysis revealed that at the 8 hour timepoint, a dataset with high signal and differential expression, using data from 3 replicates instead of 4 resulted in excellent recovery scores of > 0. 9. However at other timepoints with less signal very poor recovery scores were obtained with 3 replicates. Conclusions The NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model provides a reproducible experimental system in which to investigate clinically-relevant mechanisms of drug-induced gene regulation in ALL; the 8 hour timepoint provides the highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes; time-matched controls are redundant and excellent recovery scores can be obtained with 3 replicates. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{utility of}} the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin is limited due to its cardiotoxicity. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} efficacy of fullerenol C 60 (OH) 24 in preventing single, high-dose doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats with malignant neoplasm. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that fullerenol C 60 (OH) 24, has strong antioxidative potential. Experiment was performed on adult female Sprague Dawley rats with chemically induced mammary carcinomas. All 32 rats (2 - 5 groups) received i. p. applications of 1 -methyl-l-nitrosourea (MNU; 50 mg/kg body weight) on the 50 th and 113 th day of age. Animals were randomly divided into five groups as follows: (1) Untreated control group - rats received saline only; (2) Cancer control group - rats received MNU and saline; (3) Dox group - rats received MNU and Dox 8 mg/kg; (4) Full/Dox group -rats received MNU and Full 100 mg/kg 30 min before Dox 8 mg/kg; (5) Full group - rats received MNU and Full 100 mg/kg. Tumor incidence was 4. 94 +- 0. 576 per rat. The animals were sacrificed 2 days after the application of doxorubicin and/or fullerenol, and the serum activities of CK, LDH and α-HBDH, as well as the levels of MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, GR and TAS in the heart, were determined. The results obtained from the enzymatic activity in the serum show that the administration of a single dose of 8 mg/kg in all treated groups induces statistically significant damage. There are significant changes in the enzymes of LDH and CK (p < 0. 05), after an i. p. administration of doxorubicin/fullerenol and fullerenol. <b>Comparing</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> with untreated control group, point to the conclusion {{that in the case of}} a lower oc-HBDH/LDH ratio, results in more serious the liver parenchymal damage. The results revealed that doxorubicin induced oxidative damage and that the fullerenol antioxidative influence caused significant changes in MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, GR and TAS level in the heart (p < 0. 05). Ultra structural analysis of heart tissues from rats treated with doxorubicin and indicated that the hearts of the rats were protected from doxorubicin-induced subcellular damage. Doxorubicin/fullerenol rats did not appear to show significant cardiac damage although occasional focal loss of cristae in the mitochondria was observed. Therefore, it is suggested that fullerenol might be a potential cardioprotector in doxorubicin-treated individuals...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Secondary {{brain damage}} is {{characterized}} by delayed tissue damage developing after the mechanically caused primary lesion. Due to its hyperosmotichyperoncotic properties HyperHaesTM (HHES) can restore impaired posttraumatic local cerebral perfusion could and thereby influence secondary brain damage. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) improves microcirculatory hemodynamics, reduces oxidative stress and reduces posttraumatic inflammatory response. Can NAC lower vascular damage and influence the size of posttraumatic contusion volume? Possible beneficial effects of both substances on cerebral blood flow, brain edema and impact on development of secondary brain damage after the so-called controlled cortical impact injury (CCII) were investigated in rats. Materials and methods: 132 male isoflurane-anaesthetized Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to a left temporo-parietal focal contusion. Within 15 minutes following trauma, either HHES or physiological saline (4 ml/kg b. w.) was administered intravenously. Two additional groups received three intraperitoneal injections of NAC or physiological saline (163 mg/kg b. w.) directly after trauma as well as 2 and 4 hours after trauma. Arterial blood gases (ABG), core body temperature, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored. Regional cerebral blood flow was recorded by a laser Doppler probe in pericontusional areas before trauma and at 30 minutes, 4, and 24 hours after trauma. 24 hours following trauma animals were sacrificed for brain removal. Brain swelling and water content were measured gravimetrically. Posttraumatic contusion volume was determined planimetrically using triphenyl-tetrazoliumchloride staining at 24 hours and additionally at 7 days after trauma in HHES and controls. Results: Temperature and ABG remained stable. No significant changes in MABP were seen between the groups. ICP was significantly lower directly after HHES infusion. Pericontusional perfusion at 4 hours {{in the placebo group}} was significantly impaired (56. 5 ± 6. 2 %) in comparison to baseline as well as to HHES treated animals (85. 2 ± 12. 1 %). Focal perfusion in NAC treated animals did not differ statistically from controls. A period of posttraumatic hyperperfusion was observed in all groups 24 hours after trauma. A tendency towards a decrease in posttraumatic hemispheric swelling was observed in the HHES group (placebo: 8. 9 ± 0. 6 % vs. HHAES: 8. 3 ± 0. 3 % and NAC: 8. 9 ± 0. 6 %). Posttraumatic water content was significantly increased in traumatized vs. non-traumatized hemispheres in all groups. No significant changes were seen in traumatized hemispheres <b>comparing</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> (placebo: 80. 1 ± 0. 08 % vs. HHES: 79. 95 ± 0. 05 % and NAC 80. 15 ± 0. 3 %). Contusion volume was significantly decreased following HHES administration (23. 4 ± 3. 5 mm 3) versus placebo group (39. 6 ± 6. 2 mm 3) 7 days after trauma, although no significant reduction could be shown after 24 hours. In the NAC group contusion volume and the percentage of damaged tissue following CCI were reduced versus placebo (53. 5 ± 4. 7 mm 3 vs. 66. 3 ± 5. 3 mm 3), however, without reaching statistical significance. Conclusion: HHES reverses posttraumatic pericontusional hypoperfusion and significantly reduces contusion volume 7 days after trauma. Although NAC with its antioxidant potency shows no effect on perfusion alterations, it still induces a reduction in contusion volume following CCII...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{the last}} years cardiac surgery for {{congenital}} heart disease (CHD) reduced dramatically mortality modifying prognosis, but, at the same time, increased morbidity in this patient population. Respiratory and cardiovascular systems are strictly anatomically and functionally connected, so that alterations of pulmonary hemodynamic conditions modify respiratory function. While very short-term alterations of respiratory mechanics after surgery were investigated by many authors, not as much works focused on long-term changes. In these subjects rest respiratory function may be limited by several factor: CHD itself (fetal pulmonary perfusion influences vascular and alveolar development), extracorporeal circulation (CEC), thoracotomy and/or sternotomy, rib and sternal contusions, pleural adhesions and pleural fibrosis, secondary to surgical injury. Moreover inflammatory cascade, triggered by CEC, can cause endothelial damage and compromise gas exchange. Aims: The project was conceived to 1) determine severity of respiratory functional impairement in different CHD undergone to surgical correction/palliation; 2) identify the most and the least CHD involved by pulmonary impairement; 3) find a correlation between a specific hemodynamic condition and functional anomaly, and 4) between rest respiratory function and cardiopulmonary exercise test. Materials and methods: We studied 113 subjects with CHD undergone to surgery, and distinguished by group in accord to pulmonary blood flow (group 0 : 28 pts with normal pulmonary flow; group 1 : 22 pts with increased flow; group 2 : 43 pts with decreased flow; group 3 : 20 pts with total cavo-pulmonary anastomosis-TCPC) followed by the Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Unit, and we compare them to 37 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. In Pediatric Pulmonology Unit all pts performed respiratory function tests (static and dynamic volumes, flow/volume curve, airway resistances-raw- and conductance-gaw-, lung diffusion of CO-DLCO- and DLCO/alveolar volume), and CHD pts the same day had cardiopulmonary test. They all were examined and had allergological tests, and respiratory medical history. Results: restrictive pattern (measured on total lung capacity-TLC- and vital capacity-VC) was in all CHD groups, and up to 45 % in group 2 and 3. <b>Comparing</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups,</b> we found {{a significant difference in}} TLC between healthy and group 2 (p= 0. 001) and 3 (p= 0. 004), and in VC between group 2 and healthy (p= 0. 001) and group 1 (p= 0. 034). Inspiratory capacity (IC) was decreased in group 2 related to healthy (p 32. Comparing group 3 and 2, the most involved categories, we found difference in VO 2 max and VE/VCO 2 slope (respectively p= 0. 02 and p< 0. 0001). We evidenced correlation between rest and exercise tests, especially in group 0 (between VO 2 max and FVC, FEV 1, VC, IC; inverse relation between VE/VCO 2 slope and FVC, FEV 1 and VC), but also in group 1 (VO 2 max and IC), group 2 (VO 2 max and FVC and FEV 1); never in group 3. Discussion: According with literature, we found a frequent impairment of rest pulmonary function in all groups, but especially in group 2 and 3. Restrictive pattern was the most frequent alteration probably due to compromised pulmonary (vascular and alveolar) development secondary to hypoperfusion in fetal and pre-surgery (and pre-TCPC) life. Parenchymal fibrosis, pleural adhesions and thoracic deformities can add further limitation, as showed by the correlation between group 3 and number of surgical intervention. Exercise tests were limited, particularly in group 3 (complex anatomy and lost of chronotropic response), and we found correlations between rest and exercise tests in all but group 3. We speculate that in this patients hemodynamic exceeds respiratory contribution, though markedly decreased...|$|E

PBC had lower progenitor cells compared to controls (P< 0. 005). No differences were found between CC and HC. Committed progenitor cells in non-adherent cell fraction were increased in AIH- 1 (P< 0. 05) but decreased in PBC compared to controls (P< 0. 05). Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU) and erythroid-burst CFU were increased in AIH- 1 <b>compared</b> to <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> (P< 0. 001). PBC had these CFUs decreased compared to controls (P< 0. 005). Stromal cells failed to support normal hemopoiesis in PBC. Conclusions: We demonstrated {{for the first time that}} AIH- 1 had increased hemopoietic progenitor cells and normal stromal function. In PBC, progenitor cells and BM microenvironment were defective. Further studies will determine the significance of these novel findings. (C) 2003 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} whether use of Spanish language sayings, or dichos, improved group climate within multi-ethnic chronic pain groups. Use {{of this form}} of figurative language fits within psychological theory identifying use of metaphor {{as a means of}} promoting change and creating new meaning. Further, metaphor use is consistent with the broader aims of experiential therapy. Group climate was measured by group members' self reports using the Group Climate Questionnaire-Short Form. A pilot study involving Latino Americans in medical and non-medical contexts aided in categorizing dichos as high versus low-relevance. It was anticipated that clients would rate high-relevance sessions as involving greater engagement, and less conflict and avoidance than low-relevance groups. Participants were recruited from four multidisciplinary pain management clinics offering similar programs. Once every four to six weeks, group leaders were provided with a list of either high or low-relevance dichos, and were blind to the existence of dichos categories. Three hierarchical regression analyses were employed to determine whether dichos relevance, characterized as low, mixed or highly relevant, contributed to variance in group conflict, avoidance and engagement. Dichos familiarity was the last variable entered into the regression equation, with gender, ethnicity and acculturation score entered in sequential fashion. Consistent with predictions, low-relevance groups yielded higher conflict scores than <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> combined. Also, high-relevance groups predicted lower avoidance when <b>compared</b> to <b>all</b> <b>groups.</b> In contrast to hypotheses, high-relevance groups predicted lower ratings of group engagement when <b>compared</b> to <b>all</b> <b>groups.</b> Post-hoc analysis indicated the mixed-relevance groups yielded significantly higher engagement scores than the low and high-relevance groups. Implications of these findings are discussed in relation to impact on approaches to group therapy with Latino American clients, and within the chronic pain population. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are offered...|$|R
40|$|The {{main problem}} facing the {{longevity}} of total joint replacements is wear particle-induced osteolysis, particularly around the acetabular component. Ovine Total Hip Replacement surgery was performed with roughened femoral heads {{in order to enhance}} wear debris generation in vivo. The resistance to aseptic loosening of acetabular components with different surface coatings was investigated. Implants remained in vivo for 1 year. Sheep were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six experimental groups where the acetabular cup was fixed utilising an: (a) cemented polyethylene acetabular cup, (b) metal backed grit blasted surface, (c) metal backed plasma sprayed titanium porous coating, (d) metal backed sintered beaded coating, (e) Hydroxyapatite (HA) -coated grit blasted surface (f) and HA-coated porous components. Ground Reaction Force (GRF) was used to asses the functional performance of the implants and data was collected pre-operatively and at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks post op. Wear debris generated was analysed and radiographs taken prior to preparation of thin sections. Fibrous tissue (FT) thickness and bone contact at 1 mm intervals along the acetabular bone-implant interface was calculated. GRF data demonstrated significant differences between experimental <b>groups.</b> In <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> there was an increase in the function of the hip after surgery and up to 24 weeks but thereafter the function of the group with the grit blasted surface reduced whereas the function of the other groups did not significantly change. Average wear particles generated were < 1 microm in size. The cemented group demonstrated a significantly thicker average FT layer (2. 69 mm) when <b>compared</b> with <b>all</b> other <b>groups</b> (p< 0. 05 in all cases) except the grit blasted group (1. 56 mm). HA porous coated cups demonstrated significantly least fibrous tissue adjacent to its interface when <b>compared</b> with <b>all</b> other <b>groups</b> (cemented p< 0. 05, grit blasted p= 0. 029, porous p< 0. 05, sintered beads p< 0. 05 and HA grit blasted p< 0. 05). Significantly increased bone contact to HA-coated porous cups (73. 33 %) when <b>compared</b> with <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> was identified except HA-coated grit blasted cups where no significant difference was demonstrated. Radiographic signs of loosening were visible in <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> except the HA-coated porous group. Results demonstrated that HA porous coated acetabular components significantly enhanced bone ingrowth in the presence of wear particles, preventing their migration and reducing osteolysis. Non-HA-coated porous and sintered beaded components provided a more effective seal against the ingress of wear debris when compared with cemented cups...|$|R
40|$|Background: Much {{research}} has been conducted on the subject of problem behavior and the relationship with executive functions in adolescents and adults. Substantially less is known about the development of executive functions in young children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and/or Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD). Aim: The first aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the development in inhibition performance of children aged 3. 5 to 7 years with and without ADHD and/or DBD over a period of 18 months. The second aim was to examine the differences in inhibition performance between the three clinical groups (ADHD, ADHD + DBD, DBD) and the control group. The final aim of the present study was to investigate the degree in which rule breaking behavior occurs within an inhibition task between the three clinical groups and the control group. Method: A battery of seven executive function tasks, specially developed for young children, were used to assess the performance of inhibition of the four groups during three points in time over a period of 18 months. 	 	Results: The results show a significant increase in inhibition performance for the clinical groups after 18 months, indicating an inhibition development. Secondly, compared to the control <b>group</b> <b>all</b> three clinical <b>groups</b> showed significant differences in inhibition performance, where the three clinical groups showed significant lower inhibition results than the control group. Finally, when frequency of rule breaking behavior is <b>compared,</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> show a decrease in this behaviour after 18 months. Furthermore, the clinical groups exhibit more rule breaking behaviour than the control group. Conclusion: Clinical groups showed impairments in inhibition performance compared to the control group...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Healthy {{bone marrow}} cell (BMC) {{infusion}} improves renal function and limits renal injury {{in a model}} of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in rats. However, BMCs derived from rats with CKD fail to retain beneficial effects, demonstrating limited therapeutic efficacy. Statins {{have been reported to}} improve cellular repair mechanisms. Methods: We studied whether exposing CKD rat BMCs ex vivo to pravastatin improved their in vivo therapeutic efficacy in CKD and compared this to systemic in vivo treatment. Six weeks after CKD induction, healthy BMCs, healthy pravastatin-pretreated BMCs, CKD BMCs or CKD pravastatin-pretreated BMCs were injected into the renal artery of CKD rats. Results: At 6 weeks after BMC injection renal injury was reduced in pravastatin-pretreated CKD BMC recipients vs. CKD BMC recipients. Effective renal plasma flow was lower and filtration fraction was higher in CKD BMC recipients <b>compared</b> to <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> whereas {{there was no difference between}} pravastatin-pretreated CKD BMC and healthy BMC recipients. Mean arterial pressure was higher in CKD BMC recipients <b>compared</b> to <b>all</b> other <b>groups.</b> In contrast, 6 weeks of systemic in vivo pravastatin treatment had no effect. In vitro results showed improved migration, decreased apoptosis and lower excretion of pro-inflammatory Chemokine (C-X-C Motif) Ligand 5 in pravastatinpretreated CKD BMCs. Conclusions: Short ex vivo exposure of CKD BMC to pravastatin improves CKD BMC function and their subsequent therapeutic efficacy in a CKD setting, whereas systemic statin treatment did not provide renal protection...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{assessed}} {{the presence of}} oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation in thyroid neoplasia. METHODS: Using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry, we assessed levels of DNA damage (8 -oxo-dG) and lipid peroxidation (4 -HNE) in 71 follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA), 45 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and 17 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and matched normal thyroid tissue. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic 8 -oxo-dG and 4 -HNE expression was significantly higher in FTA, FTC, and PTC tissue compared to matched normal tissue (all p values <. 001). Similarly, elevated nuclear levels of 8 -oxo-dG were seen in all in FTA, FTC, and PTC tissue compared to matched normal (p values <. 07, <. 001, <. 001, respectively). In contrast, {{a higher level of}} 4 -HNE expression was detected in normal thyroid tissue compared with matched tumor tissue (p <. 001 for <b>all</b> <b>groups).</b> <b>Comparing</b> <b>all</b> 3 <b>groups,</b> 4 -HNE levels were higher than 8 -oxo-dG levels (p <. 001 for <b>all</b> <b>groups)</b> except that cytoplasmic levels of 8 -oxo-dG were higher than 4 -HNE in all (p <. 001). These results were independent of proliferation status. CONCLUSION: High levels of DNA damage and lipid peroxidation in benign and malignant thyroid neoplasia indicates this damage is an early event that may influence disease progression...|$|R
