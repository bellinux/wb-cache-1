Their average age was 17. 6  ±  5. 0 years. All patients underwent posterior 3 -dimensional operation and thoracoplasty. The pulmonary function was examined preoperatively, 3 months, and 24 months after the operation. The correlation between the postoperative decrease ratio of pulmonary function parameters and postoperative recovery time was analyzed by Pearson correlations. ResultsThe average Cobb's angle in the coronal plane was corrected from 99. 1 ° ±  17. 6 ° preoperatively to 49. 8 ° ±  11. 8 ° postoperatively, with the average correction ratio of (44. 3  ±  12. 6) %. There were significant decrease in the pulmonary function parameters 3 months after the operation [vital capacity (VC), 14. 4 %; percentage of the VC with measured/predicted value (VC%), 14. 7 %; forced vital capacity (FVC), 15. 7 %; percentage of the FVC with measured/predicted value (FVC%), 16. 6 %; the first second forced expiratory volume (FEV 1), 13. 2 %; the percentage of FEV 1 with measured/predicted value (FEV 1 %), 12. 9 %] (P    0. 05).

In the blind mode, <b>correction</b> <b>operations</b> of multiple ES operations and multiple EPP operations are performed in a lump after EPR pairs are shared between the sender and the receiver.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a time-domain {{receiver}} design scheme for {{high data rate}} single carrier multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) underwater acoustic communications. In this scheme, each received packet is artificially partitioned into blocks for processing. The MIMO channel is initially estimated using training blocks {{at the front of}} transmitted packets from all transducers. With the estimated MIMO channel, one data block following the training blocks is equalized. The phase rotation in the equalized data block is compensated by a group-wise phase <b>correction</b> <b>operation,</b> before symbol detection. The newly detected data block along with K − 1 previous data (or pilot) blocks are utilized to re-estimate the channel, which is employed to equalize the next new data block. The block-wise processing procedure is repeated until all blocks in the received packet are processed and demodulated. The proposed receiver scheme is tested with MakaiEx 05 experimental data measured at Kauai, Hawaii, in September 2005. Processing results show that it works effectively with 2 × 8 BPSK, QPSK and 8 PSK transmissions at the symbol period of 0. 1 milliseconds.
