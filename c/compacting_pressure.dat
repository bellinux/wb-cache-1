30|$|Densification {{of biomass}} waste {{materials}} {{has provided a}} great boost to the utilization of wood and agricultural waste for domestic and industrial fuel. However, the processes involved {{in the production of}} this fuel make it more expensive than fossil fuel. This is because densification of wood waste into fuel briquettes is not simple. This paper reports the results of research conducted to determine the effect of species, particle size and <b>compacting</b> <b>pressure</b> on relaxed density and compressive strength in cleft of briquettes produced from sawdust of tropical hardwoods. Briquettes were made using a laboratory hydraulic press. <b>Compacting</b> <b>pressure</b> was varied from 10 to 50 MPa at an interval of 10 MPa. Species used were Triplochiton scleroxylon, Ceiba pentandra, Aningeria robusta, Terminalia superba, Celtis mildbreadii and Piptadenia africana. The results indicate that species, <b>compacting</b> <b>pressure</b> and particle size of sawdust at 5 % level of significance have significant effect on the relaxed density and compressive strength in cleft of briquettes produced. The multiple correlation coefficient (R) and adjusted R 2 for the regression model between relaxed density of briquettes, and species density, particle size and <b>compacting</b> <b>pressure</b> were 0.93 and 0.87, respectively. Additionally, the multiple correlation coefficient and adjusted R 2 for the regression model between compressive strength of briquettes, and species density, particle size and <b>compacting</b> <b>pressure</b> were 0.83 and 0.69, respectively. The regression models suggest that species density, particle size and <b>compacting</b> <b>pressure</b> are good predictors of relaxed density and compressive strength in cleft of briquettes produced from sawdust of tropical hardwoods.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{the major}} {{contributing}} factors to the bond formed during this densification {{may be the}} mechanical interlock of the fibres of the biomass and adhesive force between the particles. Increase in fibre length of the biomass raw material resulting from increased particle size could lead to mechanical interlocking of relatively longer fibres [14] which, therefore, result {{in the formation of}} a stronger bond and increased compressive strength in cleft. Additionally, a strong significant positive correlation between compressive strength in cleft and <b>compacting</b> <b>pressure</b> of briquettes produced was established (Pearson’s r = 0.670, p-value = 0.000; N = 450; 1 -tailed, α = 0.05). This result means that the compressive strength in cleft of the briquettes produced increased with increasing <b>compacting</b> <b>pressure.</b> Increased <b>compacting</b> <b>pressure</b> result in increased binding force between the particles [13].

40|$|The {{theoretical}} and experimental {{analyses of the}} friction welding pressure influence on the plastic deformation level {{and the quality of}} the friction welded joint are presented in this paper. The joint of the tempering and the High-Speed steel was realized by the friction welding. The objective was to relate the two basic process parameters - the friction and <b>compacting</b> <b>pressures</b> - to plastic deformation parameters during the friction welding of two the steels. The fact that materials are dissimilar additionally complicates the welding procedure and its analysis. The friction welding is a specific and complex process, since in the joint zone material is heated and plasticized with necessary action of the multi-step pressure to realize the joint. The total deformations in the axial and radial directions are directly dependent on the applied welding pressure. Considering that geometry and shape of the friction welded joint directly depend on the friction pressure, some welded joints' basic shapes obtained with various pressures are presented.

Powder metallurgy {{is one of}} the promising methods for the enhancement of material mechanical properties and, due to the introduced plastic deformation, can also have a positive influence on corrosion resistance.

Electrochemical corrosion properties analyzed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy carried out in HBSS (Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution) and enriched HBSS were correlated with the metallographic analysis of the corrosion process.
