25|$|The {{planet was}} claimed, in September 2010, {{to have been}} {{detected}} by astronomers in the Lick–Carnegie Exoplanet Survey, led by principal investigator Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and <b>co-investigator</b> R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The discovery was made using radial velocity measurements, combining 122 observations obtained over 11 years from the HIRES instrument of the W. M. Keck Observatory with 119 measurements obtained over 4.3 years from the HARPS instrument of the ESO 3.6 m Telescope at La Silla Observatory. In addition, brightness measurements of the star were confirmed with a robotic telescope from Tennessee State University.|$|E
25|$|Phoenix was a {{partnership}} of universities, NASA centers, and the aerospace industry. The science instruments and operations were a University of Arizona responsibility. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, managed {{the project and}} provided mission design and control. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, Colorado, built and tested the spacecraft. The Canadian Space Agency provided a meteorological station, including an innovative Laser-based atmospheric sensor. The <b>co-investigator</b> institutions included Malin Space Science Systems (California), Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (Germany), NASA Ames Research Center (California), NASA Johnson Space Center (Texas), MDA (Canada), Optech Incorporated (Canada), SETI Institute, Texas A University, Tufts University, University of Colorado, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), University of Michigan, University of Neuchâtel (Switzerland), University of Texas at Dallas, University of Washington, Washington University in St. Louis, and York University (Canada). Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Bristol provided hardware for the mission and {{were part of the}} team operating the microscope station.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{observation}} was {{to take advantage of}} the large collecting area and sensitivity of the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope to survey the X ray brightness of solar-mass stars in the 2 Gyr old NGC 752 cluster in order to chart out the dependence of coronal X ray emission of Sun like stars as a function of age. Dr. Simon's stated role as one of the <b>co-investigators</b> in the project was limited to assisting the project's European Principal Investigator with the analysis and interpretation of the X ray measurements, and to assist in summarizing the results for publication. The observation was executed successfully, and approximately 130 X ray sources were detected in the XMM field of view and subsequently measured to obtain X ray count rates. To date neither the measurements nor the raw data have been distributed by the European P. I. to the <b>co-investigators,</b> It is expected that the measurements will be distributed to the <b>co-investigators</b> by the end of 2004, and once that is done, the scientific analysis by Dr. Simon can then begin. At present, since the data and measurements have not been shared with the <b>co-investigators,</b> there are no results to report...|$|R

25|$|ASU is also {{involved}} with NASA {{in the field}} of space exploration. To meet the needs of NASA programs, ASU built the LEED Gold Certified, 298,000-square-foot Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building IV (ISTB 4) at a cost of $110million in 2012. The building includes space for the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) and includes labs and other facilities for the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. One of the main projects at ISTB 4 includes the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES). Although ASU built the spectrometers aboard the Martian rovers Spirit and Opportunity, OTES will be the first major scientific instrument completely designed and built at ASU for a NASA space mission. Phil Christensen, the principal investigator for the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), is a Regents' Professor at ASU. He also serves as the principal investigator for the Mars Odyssey THEMIS instruments, as well as <b>co-investigator</b> for the Mars Exploration Rovers. ASU scientists are responsible for the Mini-TES instruments aboard the Mars Exploration Rovers. The Center for Meteorite Studies, which is home to rare Martian meteorites and exotic fragments from space, and the Mars Space Flight Facility are on ASU's Tempe campus.|$|E
500|$|On June 14 and 22, 2005, Deep Impact {{observed}} two {{outbursts of}} activity from the comet, {{the latter being}} six {{times larger than the}} former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission <b>co-investigator</b> for JPL pointed out that [...] "it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this thing. You have to rely {{on the fact that the}} Impactor is a smart spacecraft as is the Flyby spacecraft. So you have to build in the intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing." [...] On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed. A 6m/s (20ft/s) velocity change was needed to adjust the flight path towards the comet and target the impactor at a window in space about [...] wide.|$|E

2500|$|Like the 1970s era Viking spacecraft, Phoenix used rocket motors for {{its final}} descent. Experiments {{conducted}} by Nilton Renno, mission <b>co-investigator</b> from the University of Michigan, {{and his students}} have investigated how much surface dust would be kicked up on landing. Researchers at Tufts University, led by <b>co-investigator</b> Sam Kounaves, conducted additional in-depth experiments to identify {{the extent of the}} ammonia contamination from the hydrazine propellant and its possible effects on the chemistry experiments. In 2007, a report to the American Astronomical Society by Washington State University professor Dirk Schulze-Makuch, suggested that Mars might harbor peroxide-based life forms which the Viking landers failed to detect because of the unexpected chemistry. The hypothesis was proposed long after any modifications to Phoenix could be made. One of the Phoenix mission investigators, NASA astrobiologist Chris McKay, stated that the report [...] "piqued his interest" [...] and that ways to test the hypothesis with Phoenixs instruments would be sought.|$|E
2500|$|A recent {{pilot study}} {{funded by the}} National Institutes of Health {{evaluated}} HR in lowering stress among Somali and Oromo refugee women who had experienced violence and torture in their homelands, but for whom Western-style psychotherapeutic treatment of trauma was not culturally [...] appropriate.

[...] In a post-intervention focus group, [...] "many women reported using new strategies to calm down, quiet their minds and make healthier decisions." [...] <b>Co-investigator</b> Cheryl Robertson, Assistant Professor in the School of Nursing at the University of Minnesota, was quoted as saying, [...] "This is a promising intervention that doesn't involve the use of highly trained personnel.
