40|$|Abstract-This paper studies optimum signal {{combining}} {{for space}} diver-sity reception in <b>cellular</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> systems. With optimum combining, the signals {{received by the}} antennas are weighted and combined to maxi-mize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Thus, with cochan-ne 1 interference, space diversity is used not only to combat Rayleigh fading of the desired signal (as with maximal ratio combining) but also to reduce the power of interfering signals at the receiver. We use analytical and computer simulation techniques to determine the performance of optimum combining when the received desired and interfering signals are subject to Rayleigh fading. Results show that optimum combining is significantly better than maximal ratio combining even {{when the number of}} interferers is greater than the number of antennas. Results for typical. <b>cellular</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> systems show that optimum combining increases the output signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver by several decibels. Thus, systems can require fewer base slation antennas and/or achieve increased channel capacity through greater frequency reuse.

40|$|Abstract—An {{analytical}} model is developed to investigate in-tegrated CS/PS CDMA cellular systems with SIR-based power control. Because packet {{data are not}} very sensitive to delay, a defer-first-transmission transmission mode is usually applied to packet data transmission. In the mixed CS/PS environment, link-level congestion control is designed to delay packet data, if nec-essary, to guarantee real-time delivery quality for CS traffic such as voice and CS data. In interference-limited CDMA cellular sys-tems, because interference (both intracell and intercell) is the limit to spectral efficiency, congestion control {{is driven by the}} total re-ceived interference level at the BS. With congestion control at link level and SIR-based power control, the intracell and intercell in-terferences are closely related to each other. A recursive process is developed to evaluate the performance of such a CDMA system. Numerical results such as system capacity and data delay, both with and without power control error considered, are presented.

40|$|The use of antenna arrays at the basestations of <b>cellular</b> land <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> {{systems has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a means of}} increasing capacity. The capacity can be increased by either hosting multiple mobiles per channel in each cell and/or reducing reuse distances. Hosting multiple mobiles per channel in each cell is possible by applying techniques, which customize the antenna patterns with nulls in the directions of co-channel mobiles. This introduces additional sources of interference since in practice, {{it is not possible to}} null out co-channel mobiles perfectly. Local scattering, uncertainties in the mobile position estimates and imperfections in the array response modeling, are the cause. The interference between co-channel cells, is also affected by the introduction of antenna arrays, due to the directivity of the resulting antenna patterns.

40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} hard handoff {{algorithms}} based on op-timizing the tradeoff between link quality {{and rate of}} handoffs is considered. For handoff algorithms based on this criterion, adap-tation is precisely {{defined in terms of}} remaining on a locus of de-sirable operating points as system parameters (such as mobile ve-locity) change. A rule based on a linear cost criterion is used to select desirable operating points. For this rule, it is shown that the optimal handoff algorithm, which is impractical, is easily adapted by fixing a single tradeoff parameter at an appropriate value. The same adaptation property is shown to hold for an easily imple-mentable approximation to the optimal algorithm, the locally op-timal (LO) handoff algorithm. This is in contrast to the poor adap-tation of hysteresis based approaches which require lookup tables for adaptation. Practical estimators for all relevant system parame-ters based on a short window of pilot signal strength measurements are also discussed. It is shown that the LO algorithm adapts well when these simple estimators are used. A hysteresis-threshold ap-proximation to the adaptive LO algorithm is also developed.

40|$|Multi-carrier (MC) {{modulation}} {{has been}} recently proposed for code-division multiple access (CDMA) <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> communications, by modulating an identical symbol on multiple carriers of same magnitude. Certain phase offsets {{assigned to each}} carrier define a code that is given to a specific user. We introduce a CDMA system based on multi-carrier spread spectrum (MC-SS) with one identical code for all users. In general, the employment of a multi carrier transmission technique would increase the dynamic range of the correspondent low-pass time signal, and therefore would require a highly linear power amplifier. It is shown in this paper that by carefully designing the code of a MC-SS signal a significant decrease of several orders of magnitude in dynamic range can be obtained. The dynamic range of the resulting multi-carrier signal is of the same range as of conventional direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS-SS) signals using OQPSK combined with raised-cosine filtering.
