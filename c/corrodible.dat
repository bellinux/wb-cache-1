They are made of corrosion resistant alloys such as stainless steel 316 L, titanium and cobalt-chromium alloys; in addition, their manufacturing process is well developed. Currently, <b>corrodible</b> metals have been proposed for making stents that can degrade after serving its function (biodegradable stents). This article discusses applicability of the current laser-cutting-based stent manufacturing process for making biodegradable stents: from materials production to stent fabrication until implantation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to advance the development of cost effective, low-temperature hydrogen fuel cells, by creating non-noble anode electrocatalysts for application in acidic electrolytes. The electrocatalytic activity of nanocrystalline tungsten carbides, WC and W 2 C, towards the anodic oxidation of hydrogen is presented. The tungsten carbides, which were synthesised by solid-state reduction of W(VI) using carbon, are both electrocatalytic. The WC phase shows greater electrocatalysis than the W 2 C phase, and also shows {{a greater degree of}} passivity against corrosion. Silver was co-deposited on the WC phase which results in ca. 25 % higher electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen electrode reactions relative to WC alone. WC synthesised with Co or Ni additions shows reduced passivity because of the formation of <b>corrodible</b> Ni 2 W 4 C and Co 3 W 10 C 3. 4 phases, neither of which show any significant electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, Ni and Co catalyse the crystal growth of WC during thermal synthesis. This lowers the catalytic performance of electrodes relative to those fabricated from nanocrystalline WC. The Frey-Farthing-Chen electrodeoxidation of NiTa 2 O 6, CoTa 2 O 6 and NiWO 4 in the presence of carbon produces TaC or WC particulate electrocatalysts and <b>corrodible</b> Ni or Co containing side-products. TaC shows increased passivity against corrosion but reduced electrocatalytic activity relative to WC. The electrocatalytic activity of the carbides was not enhanced by this synthetic procedure or by the presence of Ni or Co. A compositional range of amorphous, Ni-C and Co-C thin films were synthesised. Ni-C thin films show higher catalytic activity than Co-C thin films of equivalent metal concentration. Films containing less than 20 atm% metal passivate in sulphuric acid. Films containing more than 20 atm% metal do not passivate fully in acid but still show much greater corrosion resistance than the pure metals.

The interest toward these <b>corrodible</b> or absorbable metals has been rapidly growing.

The dense reinforcing technique can provide more confinement for concrete {{and increase the}} performance of concrete such as ductility and peak strength. However, {{the application of the}} dense reinforcement is not practical with conventional reinforcing method since the movement of gravels would be interrupted.

40|$|A hull {{is defined}} as the body of the ship. It {{is also one of the}} major parts of the ship since it carries most of the load. In general, many naval {{structures}} such as ships, combatants and small boats are generally made up of steel and aluminium. Even though steel and aluminium provide excellent strength and stiffness value it is highly <b>corrodible</b> and therefore subjected to frequent maintenance schedules. In recent research basalt fiber has grown great importance in naval application. Basalt is generic name for solidified lava which poured out the volcanoes. Basalt is 1 / 3 of earth Crust [...] Basalt fibers were found to have fairly good mechanical properties than other fibers. It exhibits greater tensile strength, very high heat resistance, high impact strength, and strong alkali resistance and low moisture absorption. Basalt products can be used from very low temperatures (about – 200 C) up to the comparative high temperatures 700 – 800 C.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 169 - 178. Two {{independent}} {{investigations into}} aspects of marine fouling {{were conducted in}} Simonsbay and Table Bay during 1979 to 1981. The development of macrofouling communities on six test materials was examined at 10 m and 20 m depths in Simonsbay for periods ranging from one month to one year. Community development was similar on inert non-reactive materials, aluminium, stainless steel, fibre glass and polyvinylchloride, but was reduced on non-wettable silicon rubber and <b>corrodible</b> mild steel. Macrofouling was characterized by seasonal succession with minimum colonization rates during winter, when adverse weather and low temperature conditions prevailed. The nature of fouling differed with depth. At 10 m depth, mussel and barnacle-dominated communities developed rapidly, while at 20 m depth, ascidian and barnacle-dominated communities developed more slowly. The role of primary film formation in the colonization of substrata by invertebrates was investigated in short-term studies conducted in Simonsbay and Table Bay. Surface-bound antibiotics, streptomycin and penicillin, were used to inhibit bacterial proliferation, while a herbicide, diuron, was employed to prevent diatom growth. The colonization by invertebrates was monitored on these surfaces and compared to surfaces where primary film development was normal, or where it was advanced by pre-culturing in laboratory seawater. It was found that invertebrates attached soon after panel exposure and that differences {{in the degree of}} primary film development were of little consequence to their settlement. The apparent discrepancy of these observations with previous findings is discussed, with special reference to the location of test sites in relation to mature communities...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the oral}} cavity, many {{bacteria}} can only survive by adhering to hard surfaces. The roughness and free energy of these surfaces {{play an important}} part in this process. Precision dental alloys may undergo corrosion, but findings show that this does not seem to cause problems of biocompatibility. The release of metallic ions into the oral cavity may both inhibit bacterial growth and influence bacterial adhesion. The object {{of the present study was}} to bring to light any possible correlation between corrosion and/or ionic release and bacterial adhesion with regard to 18 different types of dental alloy, both before and after polishing. METHODS: Electrochemical analyses were carried out (cyclic potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarisation tests). <b>Corrodible</b> elements were analysed through Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy of specimens of each alloy. The inhibition of bacterial adhesion and growth was determined using bacteria specific to the oral cavity. RESULTS: All the alloys examined show a tendency towards spontaneous passivation with low values of anodic current. The evaluation of ionic release confirmed the biocompatibility of the tested materials and the solutions conditioned with the alloys did not inhibit bacterial growth. There was no significant bacterial adhesion after polishing. Bacteria adhere to unpolished alloys in a specific manner and are inhibited from doing so in the presence of alloys for gold-resin restorations containing silver and copper. CONCLUSIONS: When polished, all the alloys are resistant to in vitro electrochemical corrosion and bacterial adhesion. The possibility cannot be excluded that bacterial adhesion occurs after the materials have been in place in the oral cavity for some time. The alloys which were found to inhibit bacterial attack may be more suitable, while not representing a biological risk for the surrounding tissues...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the design of}} a thruster-solution for a mass-market Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle with respect to performance and cost while increasing reliability, efficiency and durability of the system. With a relatively new and unexplored market, delivery of high quality is very important to make an impact with consumers. Factors such as performance, build quality and portability are important to be able to stay competitive in the market. The objective is to design a thruster for the BluEye Explorer P 1, a portable Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle, with the existing thruster-solution as a guideline. Motor selection, protection of <b>corrodible</b> materials and propeller design are some of the problems encountered. The required performance of a motor and propeller is dependent on the total drag force exerted on the system. By using the dimensions of the Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle and its systems in combination with computational fluid dynamics analysis, necessary data is obtained to calculate the drag force on the body and the necessary power to operate the vessel. Appropriate motor alternatives are chosen through a process of elimination assisted by a computational script based on extensive propeller series. Suitable propeller designs are optimized and analyzed, resulting in a low-voltage DC solution with an operation depth of up to 100 meters. Cost-wise, the thruster is estimated to be one third of the price of the existing motor and propeller; in-house production brings the price down drastically compared to outsourcing. With the extensive propeller series and the aid of computational design programs such as OpenProp, the final product is ready to commence the production phase. Compared with the existing design, the thruster-solution is slightly bigger, but in return grants higher output...|$|E
40|$|Increases in {{the spatial}} scale and {{intensity}} of activities that produce marine anthropogenic sound highlight the importance of understanding the impacts and effects of sound on threatened species such as marine turtles. Marine turtles detect and behaviorally respond to low-frequency sounds, however few studies have directly examined their behavioral responses to specific types or intensities of anthropogenic or natural sounds. Recent advances {{in the development of}} bio-logging tools, which combine acoustic and fine-scale movement measurements, have allowed for evaluations of animal responses to sound. Here, we describe these tools and present a case study demonstrating the potential application of a newly developed technology (ROTAG, Loggerhead Instruments, Inc.) to examine behavioral responses of freely swimming marine turtles to sound. The ROTAG incorporates a three-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to record the turtle's pitch, roll, and heading; a pressure sensor to record turtle depth; a hydrophone to record the turtle's received underwater acoustic sound field; a temperature gauge; and two VHF radio telemetry transmitters and antennas for tag and turtle tracking. Tags can be programmed to automatically release via a timed <b>corrodible</b> link several hours or days after deployment. We describe an example of the data collected with these tags and present a case study of a successful ROTAG deployment on a juvenile green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in the Paranaguá Estuary Complex, Brazil. The tag was deployed for 221 min, during which several vessels passed closely (< 2 km) by the turtle. The concurrent movement and acoustic data collected by the ROTAG were examined during these times to determine if the turtle responded to these anthropogenic sound sources. While fine-scale behavioral responses were not apparent (second-by-second), the turtle did appear to perform dives during which it remained still on or near the sea floor during several of the vessel passes. This case study provides proof of concept that ROTAGs can successfully be applied to free-ranging marine turtles to examine their behavioral response to sound. Finally, we discuss the broad applications that these tools have to study the fine-scale behaviors of marine turtles and highlight their use to aid in marine turtle conservation and management...|$|E
40|$|The {{adaptation}} of standard integrated circuit (IC) technology for biosensors in drug discovery pharmacology, neural interface systems, environmental sensors and electrophysiology requires electrodes to be electrochemically stable, biocompatible and affordable. Unfortunately, the ubiquitous IC technology, complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS), does not meet the first of these requirements. For devices intended only for research, modification of CMOS by post-processing using cleanroom facilities has been achieved by others. However, to enable adoption of CMOS as a basis for commercial biosensors, the economies of scale of CMOS fabrication must be maintained by using only low-cost post-processing techniques. The scope of this work was to develop post-processing methods that meet the electrochemical and biocompatibility requirements but within the low-cost constraint. Several approaches were appraised with the two most promising designs taken forward for further investigation. Firstly, a process was developed whereby the <b>corrodible</b> aluminium is anodised to form nanoporous alumina and further processed to optimise its impedance. A second design included a noble metal in the alumina pores to enhance further the electrical characteristics of the electrode. Experiments demonstrated {{for the first time the}} ability to anodise CMOS metallisation to form the desired electrodes. Tests showed the electrode addressed the problems of corrosion and presented a surface that was biocompatible with the NG 108 - 15 neuronal cell line. Difficulties in assessing the influence of alumina porosity led to the development of a novel cell adhesion assay that showed for the first time neuronal cells adhere preferentially to large pores rather than small pores or planar aluminium. It was also demonstrated that porosity can be manipulated at room temperature by modifying the anodising electrolyte with polyethylene glycol. CMOS ICs were designed as multiple electrode arrays and optimised for neuronal recordings. This utilised the design incorporating a noble metal deposited into the porous alumina. Deposition of platinum was only partially successful, with better results using gold. This provided an electrode surface suitable for electric cell-substrate impedance sensors (ECIS) and many other sensor applications. Further processing deposited platinum black to improve signal-to-noise ratio for neuronal recordings. The developed processes require no specialised semiconductor fabrication equipment and can process CMOS ICs on laboratory or factory bench tops in less than one hour. During the course of electrode development, new methods for biosensor packaging were assessed: firstly, a biocompatible polyethylene glycol mould process was developed for improved prototype assembly. Secondly, a commercial ‘partial encapsulation’ process (Quik-Pak, U. S.) was assessed for biocompatibility. Cell vitality tests showed both methods were biocompatible and therefore suitable for use in cell-based biosensors. The post-processed CMOS electrode arrays were demonstrated by successfully recording neuronal cell electrical activity (action potentials) and by ECIS with a human epithelial cell line (Caco 2). It is evident that these developments may provide a missing link that can enable commercialisation of CMOS biosensors. Further work is being planned to demonstrate the technology in context for specific markets. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} strength, elasticity, and durability, {{a variety of}} metal alloys are {{commonly}} used in medical implants. Traditionally, corrosion-resistant metals have been preferred. These permanent materials can cause negative systemic and local tissue effects in the long-term. Permanent stenting can lead to late-stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis. Metallic pins and screws for fracture fixation can corrode and fail, cause loss of bone mass, and contribute to inflammation and pain at the implant site, requiring reintervention. <b>Corrodible</b> metallic implants {{have the potential to}} prevent many of these complications by providing transient support to the affected tissue, dissolving at a rate congruent with the healing of the tissue. Alloys of iron and manganese (FeMn) exhibit similar fatigue strength, toughness, and elasticity compared with 316 L stainless steel, making them very attractive candidates for bioresorbable stents and temporary fracture fixation devices. Much attention {{in recent years has been}} given to creating alloys with ideal mechanical properties for various applications. Little work has been done on determining the blood compatibility of these materials or on examining how their surfaces can be improved to improve cell adhesion, however. We examined thethrombogenic response of blood exposed to various resorbable ferrous stent materials through contact with porcine blood. The resorbable materials induced comparable or lower levels of several coagulation factors compared with 316 L stainless steel. Little platelet adhesion was observed on any of the tested materials. ^ Endothelialization is an important process after the implantation of a vascular stent, as it prevents damage to the vessel wall that can accelerate neointimal hyperplasia. Micromotion can lead to the formation of fibrous tissue surrounding an orthopedic implant, loosening, and ultimately failure of the implant. Nanoscale features were created on the surfaces of noble metal coatings, silicon, and bioabsorbable materials through ion beam irradiation in order to improve endothelialzation and bone cell adhesion. Gold, palladium, silicon, and iron manganese surfaces were patterned through ion beam irradiation using argon ions. The surface morphology of the samples was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while surface chemistry was examined through x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle goniometry measurements. It was not possible to create nanoscale surface features on the surfaces of the gold and palladium films. At near normal incidence, irradiation produced ripples on the surfaces of Si(100), while oblique incidence irradiation produced nanoislands in the presence of impurities on the surface. Iron manganese irradiation resulted in the formation of blade-shaped structures for ion energies between 500 eV and 1000 eV, and significant iron enrichment at the surface. ^ Chemical treatment can also be used to create surface features that will enhance cell adhesion. Ti 6 Al 4 V is one of the most commonly used alloys for permanent orthopedic devices. The creation of a porous surface in order to improve osteoblast adhesion was achieved through chemical etching using acid-peroxide solutions. While phosphoric acid etched the grain boundaries, sulfuric and nitric acid preferentially etched grains of particular orientations, creating a spongy, porous morphology that has the potential to aid in osseointegration. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{fracture}} management {{with open}} reduction and internal fixation with metallic implant, secondary procedure of removal of implant is often required. Such procedure causes additional surgical risks to patients, including anaesthetic risks, wound infection, bone infection, soft tissue adhesion and joint stiffness. The procedure is also costly {{to the patient}} and society. If the fixation implant is self-resorbable, the need for secondary surgery will be completely eliminated and the social resources can be saved. Making use of the corrosion process, metals can be developed into new generation of resorbable (or biocorrodible, biodegradable) implants. An ideal bioresorbable orthopaedic implant should provide adequate mechanical support that matches the bone healing process. The implant should resorb progressively as the bone heals. Many current resorbable materials are biomechanically inferior to conventional metallic implants. Magnesium based alloys are popularly studied because of their mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Implants made of magnesium based alloy are expected to resorb {{in the human body}} with no harmful effect. The major research challenge is to identify an alloy that performs satisfactorily in the following aspects: biocompatibility, degradation rate, hydrogen gas formation (gas product from the reaction between Mg and water), and mechanical strength. In addition, there is no standard evaluation method for the biodegradable alloys. It is because the interaction between the degradable implants and the physiological environment is too complicated to mimic. The in vitro and the in vivo results often mismatch. This research involved the design and the tests of three Mg based alloys. Zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) were chosen as the alloying elements for corrosion resistance and mechanical enhancement. Mg- 1 Zn- 1 Mn, Mg- 3 Zn- 1 Mn, Mg- 5 Zn- 1 Mn (in wt. %) were developed and compared. The study was divided into three parts: material characterization, in vitro studies, and in vivo (animal) studies. The SEM/EDX confirmed that the surface properties of the alloys were consistent after the surface treatment. From the mechanical test, the yield strengths and the densities of the alloys were found to be close to that of the natural bones. The theoretical calculation showed that the amount of Mn determined the threshold implant mass of the test alloys. The hydrogen evolution test showed that the Mg- 1 Zn- 1 Mn was the least <b>corrodible.</b> The elution test showed that the Mg- 1 Zn- 1 Mn was the least cytotoxic and the cytotoxicity was affected by the pH changes brought by the alloys. The live cell imaging captured the interaction between the alloys and the cells. The subcutaneous implantation showed that the Mg- 3 Zn- 1 Mn formed the smallest gas pocket. In the six-month femoral implantation study (Mg- 3 Zn- 1 Mn excluded), the Mg- 1 Zn- 1 Mn showed the least volume loss and the steadiest degradation behaviour. It was also found to associate with better bone responses. Concluding from all the results, the Mg- 1 Zn- 1 Mn demonstrated better potential to become biodegradable orthopaedic products. This work evaluated the potentials of the new alloys and proposed some suggestions for the mismatch results. Moreover, quantitative investigation of biomechanical properties, long term degradation behaviour, and toxicity are recommended to be carried out in the future. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The Electrochemical Hydrogen Compressor EHC was {{evaluated}} against DOE applications for compressing hydrogen at automobile filling stations, in future hydrogen pipelines {{and as a}} commercial replacement for conventional diaphragm hydrogen compressors. It was also evaluated as a modular replacement for the compressors used in petrochemical refineries. If the EHC can be made inexpensive, reliable and long lived then it can satisfy all these applications save pipelines where the requirements for platinum catalyst exceeds the annual world production. The research performed did not completely investigate Molybdenum as a hydrogen anode or cathode, it did show that photoetched 316 stainless steel is inadequate for an EHC. It also showed that: molybdenum bipolar plates, photochemical etching processes, and Gortex Teflon seals are too costly for a commercial EHC. The use of carbon paper in combination with a perforated thin metal electrode demonstrated adequate anode support strength, but is suspect in promoting galvanic corrosion. The nature of the corrosion mechanisms are not well understood, but locally high potentials within the unit cell package are probably involved. The program produced a design with an extraordinary high cell pitch, and a very low part count. This {{is one of the}} promising aspects of the redesigned EHC. The development and successful demonstration of the hydraulic cathode is also important. The problem of corrosion resistant metal bipolar plates is vital to the development of an inexpensive, commercial PEM fuel cell. Our research suggests that there is more to the corrosion process in fuel cells and electrochemical compressors than simple, steady state, galvanic stability. It is an important area for scientific investigation. The experiments and analysis conducted lead to several recommended future research directions. First, we need {{a better understanding of the}} corrosion mechanisms involved. The diagnosis of experimental cells with titration to determine the loss of membrane active sites is recommended. We suspect that the corrosion includes more than simple galvanic mechanisms. The mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are poorly understood. Shunt currents at hydraulic cathode ports were problematic, but are not difficult to cure. In addition to corrosion there is evidence of high component resistivity. This may be due to the deposition of organic compounds, which may be produced electrochemically on the surface of the metal support screens that contact carbon gas diffusion layers (GDLs) or catalyst supports. An investigation of possible electro-organic sythesis mechanisms with emphasis on oxalates formation is warranted. The contaminated cell parts can be placed in an oxidizing atmosphere at high temperature and the weight loss can be observed. This would reveal the existence of organic compounds. Investigation into the effects of conductivity enhancers such as carbon microlayers on supporting carbon paper is also needed. Corrosion solutions should be investigated such as surface passivation of 316 SS parts using nitric acid. Ultra thin silane/siloxane polymer coatings should be tried. These may be especially useful in conjunction with metal felt replacement of carbon paper. A simple cure for the very high, localized corrosion of the anode might be to diffusion bond the metal electrode support screen to bipolar plate. This will insure uniform resistance perpendicular to the plane of the cell and eliminate some of the dependence of the resistance on high stack compression. Alternative materials should be explored. Alternatives to carbon in the cell may be helpful in any context. In particular, alternatives to carbon paper GDLs such as metal felts and alternatives to carbon supports for Pt such as TiC and TiB 2 might also be worthwhile and would be helpful to fuel cells as well. Some alternative to the metals we used in the cell, Mo and 316 SS, are potentially useful. These include Al/Mg/Si alloys. Corrosion resistant materials such as Nb and Mo might prove useful as cladding materials that can be hot stamped. Several cost reduction areas should be explored. Such as the water pumps used in pressure washers. The power consumption of these pumps is a concern, but their cost is surprisingly low. Two components of unit cell construction proved to be extremely costly. The first of these is photoetching, where selective etching of alloys present a <b>corrodible</b> composition in the cell. An alternative to photoetching may be hot stamping. An investigation of materials for hot stamping and the dimension tolerance attainable with this process should be first on the agenda. Hot stamping of clad materials should also be studied. Photoetched electrode supports can be replaced with expanded metal screens (Dexmet). The other high cost area is the use of Gortex TFE seals. Analytic’s prior experience with Acrylic seals shows they can probably replace TFE...|$|E
