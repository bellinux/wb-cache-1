5|$|As well as English, England has {{two other}} {{indigenous}} languages, Cornish and Welsh. Cornish died {{out as a}} <b>community</b> <b>language</b> in the 18th century but is being revived, and is now protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is spoken by 0.1% of people in Cornwall, and is taught to some degree in several primary and secondary schools.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, Māori were {{discouraged}} from speaking {{their own language}} (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a <b>community</b> <b>language</b> only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation, being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 3.7% of the population. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori. Many places have both their Māori and English names officially recognised.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Māori {{language}} (te reo Māori) {{was permitted}} in native schools to facilitate English instruction, {{but as time}} went on official attitudes hardened against any use of the language. Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a <b>community</b> <b>language</b> only in a few remote areas. The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Māori. The future of the language {{was the subject of a}} claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Māori was declared an official language in 1987. In the 2013 census, 21.3percent of Māori people—and 3.7percent of all respondents, including some non-Māori people—reported conversational fluency in the language. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Māori. Many places have officially been given dual Māori and English names in recent years.|$|E

25|$|The Cornish {{language}} is a language from the Brythonic branch of the Celtic language family, {{closely related to the}} other Brythonic languages of Welsh and Breton, and less so to the Goidelic languages of Irish, Scots Gaelic and Manx. The language continued to function visibly as a <b>community</b> <b>language</b> in parts of Cornwall until the late 18th century, and it was claimed in 2011 that the last native speaker did not die until 1914.|$|E
25|$|The Irish {{language}} survived as a <b>community</b> <b>language</b> in New Brunswick {{into the}} twentieth century. The 1901 census specifically enquired as to the mother tongue of the respondents, defining it as a language commonly spoken in the home. There were several individuals and a scattering of families in the census who described Irish as their first language and as being spoken at home. In other respects the respondents had less in common, some being Catholic and some Protestant.|$|E
25|$|The <b>community</b> <b>language</b> {{learning}} (CLL) is {{a method}} proposed by Charles A. Curran during the 1970s. It {{is based on the}} counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the learning group, encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the students themselves who determine the content of the lesson. Notably, it incorporates translation and recording techniques.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} Cumbric {{could well have}} survived {{into the middle of}} the 12th century as a <b>community</b> <b>language</b> and even lasted into the 13th on the tongues of the last {{remaining}} speakers. Certain areas seem to be particularly dense in Cumbric place-names even down to very minor features. The two most striking of these are around Lanercost east of Carlisle and around Torquhan south of Edinburgh. If the 1262 names from Peebles do contain traces of Cumbric personal names then we can imagine Cumbric dying out between 1250 and 1300 at the very latest.|$|E
25|$|Penwith is {{believed}} to be the last part of Cornwall where Cornish was spoken as a <b>community</b> <b>language.</b> Dolly Pentreath, known as the last recorded speaker (but arguably not the very last) came from Paul in Penwith. A year following the death of Dolly Pentreath in 1777 Daines Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.|$|E
25|$|The Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year {{language}} preservation {{plan that}} involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion {{programs as well}} as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation & Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and <b>community</b> <b>language</b> programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.|$|E

In England, where the dominant language is English, some 300 <b>community</b> <b>languages</b> are in use, the most widespread being Urdu, Cantonese, Punjabi, Bengali, Arabic, Turkish, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Gujerati, Hindi and Polish. The research was jointly conducted by the Scottish Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (Scottish CILT) at the University of Stirling, and the SOAS-UCL Centre for Excellence for Teaching and Learning 'Languages of the Wider World' (LWW CETL), between February 2007 and January 2008.

25|$|In 1997, the Cultural Affairs Department of Chief Dull Knife College {{applied to}} the Administration for Native Americans for an {{approximately}} $50,000 language preservation planning grant. The department wanted to use this money to assess {{the degree to which}} Cheyenne was being spoken on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Following this, the department wanted to use the compiled data to establish long-term <b>community</b> <b>language</b> goals, and to prepare Chief Dull Knife College to implement a Cheyenne Language Center and curriculum guide. In 2015, the Chief Dull Knife College sponsored the 18th Annual Language Immersion Camp. This event was organized into two weeklong sessions, and its aim was to educate the younger generation on their ancestral language. The first session focused on educating 5-10 year olds, while the second session focused on 11- to 18-year-olds. Certified Cheyenne language instructors taught daily classes. Ultimately, the camp provided approximately ten temporary jobs for fluent speakers on the impoverished reservation. The State of Montana has passed a law that guarantees support for tribal language preservation for Montana tribes. Classes in the Cheyenne language are available at Chief Dull Knife College in Lame Deer, Montana, at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, and at Watonga High School in Watonga, Oklahoma.|$|E

500|$|In 2013 the White House {{published}} {{a response to}} a petition that gained over 37,000 signatures to officially recognize American Sign Language as a <b>community</b> <b>language</b> and a language of instruction in schools. The response is titled [...] "there shouldn't be any stigma about American Sign Language" [...] and addressed that ASL is a vital language for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in children's lives when they can access languages most effectively. Scholars such as Beth S. Benedict advocate not only for bilingualism (using ASL and English training) but also for early childhood intervention for children who are deaf. [...] York University psychologist Ellen Bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism, arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life.|$|E
