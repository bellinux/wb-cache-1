5|$|The {{circumference}} {{of the track}} was a large 452 yards with long straights of 160 yards. An 'outside Sumner' hare was used and race distances consisted of 300,500, 525 and 700 yards. The kennel facilities were at nearby Cefn Mably in St Mellons and the leading event was the Glamorgan Cup held over 500 yards. In 1932 a notable greyhound called Beef <b>Cutlet</b> made his debut at the track at Arms Park. Beef <b>Cutlet</b> won the Glamorgan Cup and set a new track record, in 28.41sec. Cutlet’s Waterhall kennels based trainer John Hegarty would later become a Racing Manager at the track.A neighbouring track, the White City closed in 1939 and the Welsh Greyhound Derby {{was transferred to the}} Arms Park from White City, Cardiff in 1945. This was one of the three races that formed the triple crown along with the English Greyhound Derby and Scottish Greyhound Derby. The track continued to host the race annually.|$|E
50|$|Initially the patties {{were made}} of ground beef or veal. The chicken version {{appeared}} probably in 1830-1840s when Darya Pozharskaya inherited the inn after her father's death. There are numerous references by the contemporaries mentioning both veal <b>cutlets</b> Pozharsky and their versions made of minced chicken and coated with breadcrumbs. The <b>cutlets</b> are mentioned in particular by Leitch Ritchie (1836), Victor d’Arlincourt (1843) and Théophile Gautier (1875). The first complete recipes of Pozharsky <b>cutlets</b> were published in a Russian cookbook in 1853; the cookbook included a recipe for chicken <b>cutlets</b> and one for fish <b>cutlets.</b> Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva notes in The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art (1899-1916) that the same <b>cutlets</b> can also be made from game (grouse, partridge etc.).|$|R

These were minced meat <b>cutlets</b> similar to the Pozharsky <b>cutlets,</b> but shaped like a croquette with a bar of cold butter placed in the middle.

50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 20th century, industrially produced, semi-processed ground meat <b>cutlets</b> were {{introduced}} in the USSR.

50|$|In 1936, Anastas Mikoyan, who at {{the time}} was People's Commissar of Food Industry of the USSR, went on a trip to the United States to boost {{economic}} cooperation and study the development of the US economy. During his visit to the United States Mikoyan studied the system of Macy's department store in New York. There Mikoyan took notice of the mass production of hamburger patties and ordered 22 hamburger-producing appliances. However, due to subsequent World War II, the production of patties in the Soviet Union failed and the so-called Mikoyan <b>cutlets</b> appeared instead. The <b>cutlets</b> were usually made of pork or beef. Some varieties bore names of well known Russian restaurant dishes, such as Kiev <b>cutlets</b> or Pozharsky <b>cutlets,</b> but their ingredients had little in common with the original dishes. While Mikoyan <b>cutlets</b> were mass-produced for ordinary people, being sold from 3 to 5 kopeks each, Mikoyan's factories supplied Soviet government with first-class sausages, hams and other delicacies.|$|R

25|$|Vienna is {{well known}} for Wiener Schnitzel, a <b>cutlet</b> of veal (Kalbsschnitzel) or pork (Schweinsschnitzel) that is pounded flat, coated in flour, egg and breadcrumbs, and fried in {{clarified}} butter. It is available in almost every restaurant that serves Viennese cuisine and can be eaten hot or cold. The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a <b>cutlet</b> of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include Tafelspitz (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with Geröstete Erdäpfel (boiled potatoes mashed with a fork and subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, Apfelkren (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and Schnittlauchsauce (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread).|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between the old time côtelette de volaille and the modern chicken <b>cutlet</b> Kiev-style is that the elaborate stuffings of the former are replaced by butter. The use of butter for chicken cutlets has been known in Russian cuisine {{at least since the}} invention of the Pozharsky <b>cutlet</b> {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. The Pozharsky cutlets are breaded ground chicken patties for which butter is added to minced meat. This results in an especially juicy and tender consistency. The dish was a widely appraised invention of the 19th-century Russian cuisine which was also adopted by French haute cuisine and subsequently by the international cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Among other entrees {{similar to}} chicken Kiev, the {{aforementioned}} chicken Cordon Bleu with a cheese and ham filling instead of butter is particularly {{popular in the}} West. The recipe of Karađorđeva šnicla, a Serbian breaded veal or pork <b>cutlet,</b> was inspired by chicken Kiev.|$|E

25|$|Like {{most cities}} in Italy, Milan has {{developed}} its own local culinary tradition, which, {{as it is}} typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently rice than pasta, butter than vegetable oil and features almost no tomato or fish. Milanese traditional dishes includes cotoletta alla milanese, a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) <b>cutlet</b> pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese Wiener Schnitzel). Other typical dishes are cassoeula (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with Savoy cabbage), ossobuco (braised veal shank served with a condiment called gremolata), risotto alla milanese (with saffron and beef marrow), busecca (stewed tripe with beans), and brasato (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).|$|E
25|$|In some cases, Japanese cuisine in Indonesia often slanted to suit Indonesian taste. Hoka Hoka Bento in {{particular}} is Indonesian-owned Japanese fastfood restaurant chain that cater to Indonesian clientele. As the result the foods served there have been adapted to suit Indonesians' taste. Examples of the change include stronger flavour compared to authentic subtle Japanese taste, the preference for fried food, {{as well as the}} addition of sambal to cater to Indonesians' preference for hot and spicy food. Japanese food popularity also had penetrated street food culture, as modest Warjep or Warung Jepang (Japanese food stall) offer Japanese food such as tempura and takoyaki, at very moderately low prices. This is also pushed further by the Japanese convenience stores operating in Indonesia, such as 7-Eleven and Lawson offering Japanese favourites such as oden, chicken katsu (deep-fried chicken <b>cutlet),</b> chicken teriyaki and onigiri.|$|E
25|$|Russian food {{historian}} William Pokhlyobkin {{claimed that}} chicken Kiev {{was invented in}} 1912 as Novo-Mikhailovskaya kotleta in а St. Petersburg Merchants' Club located near the Mikhailovsky palace, and was renamed kotleta po-kiyevski in 1947 by a Soviet restaurant. However, these claims collide with primary sources. The cookbook by Alexandrova-Ignatieva (including editions before and after 1912) describes indeed Novo-Mikhailovsky cutlets and mentions that they were invented in the club near the Mikhailovsky palace. However, in the provided recipe these cutlets are made from minced meat similarly to the Pozharsky <b>cutlet,</b> with the only difference being the meat pounded by a tenderizer until it gets minced. This allows one to remove tendons from the meat and results in a more tender consistency of the ground meat than after {{the use of a}} grinder. The author also remarks that not only breasts but also other parts of chicken can be prepared this way and added to the mixture of meat and butter.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{potentiality}} of MRI {{to quantify}} fat content in flesh and subcutaneous fat in fish <b>cutlets</b> was investigated. Low measurement time {{was aimed at}} in a view to handling large number of samples needed in selective breeding programs for example. Results on fresh and frozen-thawed <b>cutlets</b> were compared to assess this way of conservation. As MRI generates unwanted spatial variations of the signal, a correction method was developed enabling the measurement on several <b>cutlets</b> simultaneously in less than 3 min per sample. For subcutaneous fat, the results were compared with vision measurements. High correlations between both techniques were found (R 2 = 0. 77 and 0. 87 for the ventral and dorsal part). Fat in flesh was validated vs NMR measurements. No statistical difference was found between fresh and frozen-thawed <b>cutlets.</b> RMSE was respectively 0. 8 % and 0. 89 %. These results confirmed the potentiality of MRI for fat measurement in fish particularly for {{a large number of}} samples...|$|R

Harrod explained [...] "Turnips don't deserve their unloved image, {{they add}} a wonderful freshness to a dish."

500|$|Mikoyan spearheaded {{a project}} to produce a home cookbook, which would {{encourage}} {{a return to the}} domestic kitchen. The result, The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food ( [...] , Kniga o vkusnoi i zdorovoi pishche), was published in 1939, and the 1952 edition sold 2.5 million copies. Mikoyan helped initiate the production of ice cream in the USSR and kept the quality of ice cream under his own personal control until he was dismissed. Stalin made a joke about this, stating, [...] "You, Anastas, care more about ice cream, than about communism." [...] Mikoyan also contributed to the development of meat production in the USSR (particularly, the so-called Mikoyan <b>cutlet),</b> and one of the Soviet-era sausage factories was named after him.|$|E
2500|$|Later, [...] "chicken cutlets Kiev-style" [...] {{were listed}} in Apportionments for dinners, {{separate}} dishes {{and other products}} of public catering (1928) which served as a standard reference for Soviet catering establishments. The book also included other items for chicken cutlets, such as [...] "cutlet de volaille" [...] and [...] "cutlet à la Maréchale". The book demanded renaming of many traditional restaurant dishes to replace the (mostly French-style) [...] "bourgeoise" [...] names with simple [...] "proletarian" [...] forms. In particular, the [...] "cutlet Kiev-style" [...] had to be renamed into [...] "chicken <b>cutlet</b> stuffed with butter". This program was not realised immediately (at least not completely), and its successor, The Directory of Apportionments for Catering (1940), published by the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry, still included the traditional names. In post-World War II publications of this directory and in other Soviet cookery books, such as Cookery (1955), the [...] "Kiev-style" [...] name was retained, but the terms de volaille and à la Maréchale were indeed dropped in favour of simple names such as [...] "chicken <b>cutlet</b> stuffed with milk sauce" [...] and [...] "chicken <b>cutlet</b> stuffed with liver". As {{a result of this}} policy, the names de volaille and à la Maréchale disappeared from menus of Soviet restaurants.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Poland {{fell under}} Soviet / Communist occupation. Some {{restaurants}} were nationalized. The communists envisioned a net of lunch rooms called [...] "bufet" [...] for the workers at various companies, and milk bars for the public. The majority of restaurants that survived the 1940s and 1950s were state-owned. Workplace lunch rooms promoted mostly inexpensive meals, including soups of all kinds, meatballs and pork chops, and staples such as placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), placki z jablkami (apple pancakes), kopytka (potato gnocchi), leniwe (farmer's cheese gnocchi served sweet) and pierogi.
