50|$|Initially a truce between X-O and the Government was formed, {{but this}} irritated CIA agent Peter Garrett and his associate, Ms. Mandrake of the IRS.

The Armorines {{attacked}} X-O and may have even defeated him, but their attack was <b>called</b> <b>off</b> by <b>orders</b> from General Kendall. Colonel Gardner was arrested for ordering the attack, and Kendall took his place as head of the Armorines.

50|$|Further French {{assaults on}} the Allied {{positions}} were <b>called</b> <b>off</b> under <b>orders</b> from war minister Carnot, who {{was concerned about}} supply lines being cut by rebels behind the front. The commanders in the field were unhappy about this decision, but appeals were interrupted by {{the overthrow of the}} Committee of Public Safety and its leader, Maximilien de Robespierre (28 July 1794). During the political chaos that ensued in the French army, the Allies launched an assault on Savona. Ignoring Carnot's orders, the commander of the Army of Italy launched a counter-offensive and secured supply routes to Genoa following victory at the First Battle of Dego. Following this the French consolidated the front and awaited further opportunities.|$|R
5|$|Discussions {{were held}} {{during the second}} wave of strikes, when Brendan Barber {{announced}} {{on the afternoon of}} Friday 30 October that proposals had been put to both Royal Mail and the CWU for them to consider over the weekend. Talks resumed on the Monday, however this news was overshadowed by the announcement that a further two days of strikes would be held on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. It was also announced that these would be all out strikes with everybody walking out at the same time rather than the rolling strike action that had been adopted previously, thus leading to a complete stoppage throughout the course of the action. These were later <b>called</b> <b>off</b> in <b>order</b> for further talks to take place.|$|R

5000|$|The Schweinfurt-Regensburg {{missions}} are a famous example. On August 17, 1943, some {{months after the}} Luftwaffe's JG 1 and JG 11 fighter wings began using the BR 21 heavy-calibre long-range unguided rockets (one pair per Bf 109G or Fw 190A) to break up massed bomber formations from beyond {{the range of the}} defensive machine guns of the bombers, 230 USAAF bombers launched a mission against the ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt and another 146 against the aircraft factories in Regensburg. Of this force, 60 aircraft were lost before returning to base and another 87 had to be scrapped due to irreparable damage. The Germans claimed 27 fighters lost, serious enough but paling in comparison to the losses {{on the part of the}} US forces. The Second Raid on Schweinfurt on October 14, 1943, remembered as [...] "Black Thursday", was even more bloody; of the 291 aircraft on the mission, 60 were lost outright, with a further 17 damaged beyond repair. Daylight missions into Germany were <b>called</b> <b>off</b> in <b>order</b> to rebuild the forces.|$|R

Alo gets Mini's gynaecologist to allow her to go to Alex's party as long as she won't dance or drink.

5000|$|As {{of the end}} {{of season}} 4, the {{government}} has concluded Operation Bartowski, stripped Castle of its equipment, and sold off the Buy More/Castle complex. Concurrently, Beckman terminated the civil service employment of Chuck, Sarah and Morgan (although all three were employed by the CIA, not by her NSA), and arranged either a retirement or second dismissal of Casey from the Marine Corps. Beckman's involvement with Chuck and the Intersect Project appeared not to have concluded, as the Intersect-embedded sunglasses meant for Chuck were addressed as a gift from Beckman. In [...] "Chuck Versus the Frosted Tips", Beckman came to Chuck to hire Carmichael Industries to help capture a man named Zorn to prevent him from selling CIA secrets. Later, Sarah calls Beckman regarding the Intersect glasses, only to learn that she had never sent any glasses; it is implied that Clyde Decker was responsible. At the end of the episode, Beckman clandestinely meets with Chuck, warning him that since Morgan has outed himself as the Intersect, Decker has put a kill order on him. Subsequently, after Morgan was hidden at Castle, Beckman arrived to remove the Intersect before going to <b>call</b> <b>off</b> the kill <b>order.</b> Unfortunately, all but one assassins had been <b>called</b> <b>off,</b> which Decker announced was the Viper. When Team Bartowski catches the Viper, Beckman and Decker tell her that the hit is off.|$|R
500|$|The two {{destroyer}} minesweepers {{were supposed}} to sweep the entrance to Seeadler Harbour between Hauwei and Ndrilo Islands but fire from at least one Japanese [...] gun on Hauwei Island prevented them from entering the harbour. Captain Emile Dechaineux, commanding the destroyers supporting the forces ashore, brought Ammen, Bush, Mullany and Warramunga around and bombarded the island. The Japanese guns ceased fire but came alive again when another {{attempt was made to}} sweep the channel. Dechaineux then <b>called</b> <b>off</b> the effort, <b>ordering</b> the DMSs to join him. The destroyers bombarded Japanese guns covering the entrance to Hyane Harbour to allow the LSTs to leave unmolested. One LST left with between 20 and 30truckloads of stores still aboard.

Dechaineux escorted them part of the way until he received an order from Admiral Barbey for Ammen, Mullany, Warramunga, and Welles to remain off Los Negros. Ammen and Mullany bombarded Hauwei Island again in the morning, setting off a couple of ammunition dumps, but still came under accurate fire from four or five guns, and Dechaineux was forced to inform Barbey that he was unable to overcome the island's guns.|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Among Parkinsonian axial signs, {{dysarthria}} {{represents an}} important disabling symptom able to lead towards {{a significant reduction}} of oral communication. Several methods of dysarthria assessment have been used but aerodynamic evaluation is rare in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To highlightthe importance of aerodynamic parameters measurements in assessment of parkinsonian dysarthria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a dedicated system (EVA 2), 24 parkinsonian patients were recorded after withdrawal of L-dopa for at least 12 h (condition <b>called</b> <b>OFF</b> DOPA) in <b>order</b> to evaluate intra-oral pressure (IOP), mean oral air flow (MOAF) and laryngeal resistance (LR) on six /p/ during realization of the sentence "Papa ne m'a pas parle' de beau-papa" ("Daddy did not speak to me about daddy-in-law") which corresponds to a breath group. 50 control subjects were recorded in parallel in order to define reference measurements. RESULTS: It appeared that there is in Parkinson's disease aerodynamic impairments which were evidenced by the fall in IOP and that of MOAF in patients compared with control subjects. The {{difference between the two}} groups was statistically significant. In addition a greater instability of LR in patients compared with control subjects was also noted. CONCLUSION: Our results show that measurements of aerodynamics parameters, by reflecting the dysfunction induced by disease, may well be relevant factors in parkinsonian dysarthria evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Chilli {{is one of}} the {{important}} spices and cultivated around the world for its peculiar hot taste. Chilli crops prone to affect by seedling disease <b>called</b> damping <b>off.</b> In <b>order</b> to overcome this problem, efforts have been made to evaluate the efficiency of the biocontrol agent Trichoderma harizanum for controlling the damping off disease in chilli. T. harizanum was isolated from the garden soil and identified through microscopic and recommended standard methods. The antagonistic activity of the T. harizanum was evaluated against the pathogenic fungi responsible for damping disease i. e., Fusarium oxysporium, Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria alternata proved the efficiency to inhibit the growth of all the above pathogens. The T. harizanum was formulated with talcum powder and applied as foliar spray on damping off diseased chilli plants. After 49 days of treatment, T. harizanum treated chilli plants showed more plant height (75 %), number of leaves (60 %), buds (10 %) and fruits (6 %) than control. Hence we concluded that, T. harizanum can be recommended not only for the control of damping off disease in chilli plants and also to enhance the growth of the plants.
