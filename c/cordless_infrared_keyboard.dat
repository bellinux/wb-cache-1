5000|$|Input/Output: {{cassette}} port, light-pen port, two joystick ports, RGB monitor port, composite video port, television adapter output port, audio port, wired <b>keyboard</b> port, <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> sensor, serial port, two cartridge slots ...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> is {{optionally}} available. Originally, the dBox {{was designed}} as a [...] "multimedia terminal", with applications such as pay-per-view ordering, e-mail, and home banking in mind so support for a keyboard was a design consideration.|$|R
50|$|The Webplayer is {{essentially}} a compact x86 PC and was manufactured by Acer under contract by Boundless Technologies and {{is also known as}} the Boundless iBrow. Input came through an <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> with an integrated trackball, and the webplayer came with a modem for connecting to the Internet.|$|R
50|$|Apricot Computers {{designed}} the Apricot Portable to be transportable for easy accessibility wherever one may be. It {{consisted of a}} screen monitor and a wireless, <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> that made up its main parts. It also included other notable features such as a built-in disk drive and a software bundled set.|$|R
5000|$|The PCjr {{initially}} shipped with {{a wireless}} chiclet keyboard called the [...] "Freeboard", powered by four AA batteries to provide infrared line-of-sight wireless communication. The keycaps are blank; labels appear between keys to permit overlays. The chiclet keyboard was unpopular, and IBM {{replaced it with}} a typewriter-styled model that is otherwise identical. With 62 keys compared to the PC's 83, function keys and others need multiple keystrokes. Certain room lights cause interference with the <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> sensor, as do multiple nearby keyboards. As mentioned previously, the keyboard can also operate with an optional modular telephone-style cable, eliminating battery usage and IR interference.|$|R
5000|$|The Audrey is a touchscreen, passive matrix LCD {{device and}} came {{equipped}} with a stylus. All applications were touch-enabled. Since the standard <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> was only needed for typing tasks, it could be hung {{out of the way}} on the rear of the unit. The stylus was to be placed in a receptacle {{on the top of the}} screen with an LED that flashed when email arrived. Buttons on the right side of the screen were used to access the web browser, email application, and calendar, and a wheel knob at the bottom selected different [...] "channels" [...] of push content.|$|R
50|$|Signal {{sent from}} the {{keyboard}} {{is incompatible with}} other <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> receivers however. Despite the red LED only blinking when the keyboard is being used, the keyboard constantly transmits a signal (apparently remaining battery strength) unless it is left unused for a few minutes, in which then it would automatically shut itself off. It can be turned back on by just pressing any of the keys on the keyboard or pressing the mouse button. The mouse can be replaced {{in the event of}} the cord or the mouse breaking down. The back of the keyboard includes a groove in which the mouse can be clipped on for storage.|$|R
50|$|The {{detached}} wireless <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> {{promised a}} degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's couch with the computer connected to a TV set as a display. For infrared wireless operation, it was powered by common AA cells. A keyboard cord option, which plugged into the keyboard with a modular 4-position telephone plug and {{into the back of}} the computer with a 6-pin (2x3) header connected, was also available for increased security and reliability and to eliminate dependence on batteries; the keyboard IR receiver was automatically disabled when the keyboard cord was attached to the computer.|$|R
5000|$|The Olivetti Envision (400/P75) was an Italian {{multimedia}} {{personal computer}} produced in 1995. It {{came with a}} choice of two processors: one based on the Intel 486 DX4 100mhz processor and one based on the Intel Pentium P75 processor. It had an <b>infrared</b> <b>keyboard</b> and an internal modem, and it was compatible with audio CDs, CD-ROMs, Photo CDs and Video CDs. It came with preinstalled programs that allowed it to work as a fax and an answering machine when connected to the telephone line. It had three possible operating modes: simple mode (limited to the use of an infrared remote control to control the volume and the reproduction of photo, video or audio CDs); intermediate mode (with a simplified Windows shell replacement called Olipilot that gave access to a limited set of programs); advanced (the standard Windows 95 graphical user interface).|$|R
5000|$|The eMate 300 {{featured}} a 6.8" [...] 480x320 resolution 16-shade grayscale display with a backlight, stylus pen, <b>keyboard,</b> <b>infrared</b> port, and standard Macintosh serial/LocalTalk ports.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>infrared</b> {{wireless}} laptop <b>keyboards</b> {{and mice}} use protocols similar to Consumer IR devices. Some PC remote controls used for controlling computer media players, controlling presentation software, or other applications also use Consumer IR style protocols. Some computer remotes, keyboards, and mice may also use IrDA protocol though IrDA {{was designed for}} very short range use.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, Plantronics {{created a}} line of <b>cordless</b> {{products}} using <b>infrared</b> technology. Though the technology utilized was the same one being used by television remote controls, the link did not require a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) telecommunications approval. One of the first products used the infrared beam to create a communications link between a small transmitter and a base unit which {{was connected to the}} telephone network. This product was the first [...] "echo-free" [...] speakerphone for use in conference rooms. The small transmitter could be handheld or clipped to clothing to ensure a good pickup of the speaker's voice.|$|R
50|$|The set top unit {{came with}} a {{separate}} battery-powered <b>infrared</b> wireless <b>keyboard</b> and an integrated 1200/75 baud 7-bit modem, and used a domestic television set for display. Internally {{it was based on}} an Intel 8088 processor, the same as used in the original IBM PC, with 127K ROM and 48K RAM, and display circuitry based on a 6845 CRTC. These provided a high resolution raster display, in 16 colors chosen from a palette of 256 - rather more than could be supported by the Commodore 64, Atari 800 or Apple IIe home computers of the time. However, unlike those machines the Sceptre was strictly a dedicated terminal. There was no possibility of using it for independent computing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of an incandescent bulbs control system through an universal remote control unit making it suitable for household market {{and the needs of}} modern lighting technology. It describes the lighting background and how modern technological developments have given the way to solutions currently proposed for any domotic system, it explains the approach to these solutions, and introduces justification and scope of the present project. The paper details also the technical bases to be used to carry out the project implementation, this is, the study of the infrared communication protocols and the selection of the most appropriate, the use of the microcontroller and its benefits to the requirements of the system. Subsequently it describes the design phase including the power supply, zero crossing detector, power circuit, <b>infrared</b> sensor, <b>keyboard</b> and the microcontroller programming algorithms, as well as the explanation of the device operation control. Finally, it shows the result of the device tests demonstrating optimum performance...|$|R
