5000|$|Bolger is {{particularly}} {{known for his}} Square Boats (derogatorily known as [...] "Bolger Boxes"). Bolger reasoned that a simple rockered bottom and vertical sides gives the most volume, and form stability, on a given beam. After experimenting and studying traditional sharpies and the writings of small-boat historian Howard I. Chapelle and others, he developed {{the theory that the}} optimum <b>chine</b> <b>line</b> for a sailing sharpie should represent a regular curve without breaks, changes in radius or straight sections. He further reasoned that the curve of side and bottom should match as much as possible to reduce turbulence. He further reasoned that the sharpie was an ideal shape for a trailer sailer with either leeboards or bilgeboards to provide lateral plane. [...] Bolger felt that the traditional sharpie shape Chapelle had documented based on traditional New England sharpies (with a slightly different chine profile) was inefficient and prone to causing steering difficulties.|$|E
50|$|The Rhodes Bantam is {{a strict}} one-design class {{sailboat}} designed by Philip Rhodes in 1945. The first boat {{was launched in}} 1945 in Skaneateles. More than 1500 have been built. It {{can be used for}} day sailing and will comfortably hold 2 adults and 2 children. It is also used for racing, usually with a crew of two. Originally it was built of wood and could be purchased either complete, or as a kit. In the 1960s, when fiberglass gained popularity as a hull material, it became possible to buy either a fiberglass hull kit or a finished boat. The Bantam may be classified as a centreboard dinghy. In addition to the Main sail, it typically has a genoa jib and spinnaker. It uses a centerboard for stability. It has a hard <b>chine</b> <b>line</b> which permits planing when on a beam reach or when sailing downwind with spinnaker.The class was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Active fleets existed in the Finger Lakes Region (e.g. Cuyuga Lake, Skaneateles Lake), Pennsylvania, Ohio, the Midwest and even Florida. The Rhodes Bantam Class Association sponsored a yearly regatta which rotated through the home ports of various fleets.|$|E
40|$|Many {{traditional}} data bases, {{which involved}} smooth-sided forebodies, {{are no longer}} relevant for designing advanced aircraft. The current work provides data {{on the impact of}} chined-shaped fuselage cross section on the stability of a generic fighter configuration. Two different chined-shaped fuselages were tested upright and inverted. It was found that a fuselage with a 30 " included chine angle resulted in significantly higher values of fuselage with a 100 " included chine angle. This difference was attributed to the more beneficial vortical interaction between the stronger forebody vortices coming off of the sharper chine edges and the wing vortices. The longitudinal stability of the configuration with the sharper chine angle was also better because, based on pressures and flow visualization, the vortex burst over the wing was delayed until significantly higher values of a. Unstable rolling moment derivatives were also delayed to higher values of a for the sharper chine angle cross section. Furthermore, it was found that directional stability of both of the upright configurations, which had larger lofts in cross section above the <b>chine</b> <b>lines</b> than below the <b>chine</b> <b>lines.</b> was better than for the inverted configurations...|$|R
50|$|Boat {{building}} requires enough space, under cover, so {{that the}} builder can easily move around the hull during construction, or the boat can be built on a trailer so the hull can be {{moved out of the}} shelter for construction sessions. It also requires space at the bow and stern not only for working but for sighting down the gunwale and <b>chine</b> <b>lines</b> to check they are fair. Have the bow at the garage door end for this reason. This is especially important in stitch-and-glue construction where no jig is used, as the ply panels are very floppy until the glue sets.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a mathematical method for producing hard-chine ship hulls {{based on a}} set of numerical parameters that are directly related to the geometric features of the hull and uniquely define a hull form for this type of ship. The term planing hull is used generically to describe the majority of hard-chine boats being built today. This article is focused on unstepped, single-chine hulls. B-spline curves and surfaces were combined with constraints on the significant ship curves to produce the final hull design. The hard-chine hull geometry was modeled by decomposing the surface geometry into boundary curves, which were defined by design constraints or parameters. In planing hull design, these control curves are the center, <b>chine,</b> and sheer <b>lines</b> as well as their geometric features including position, slope, and, {{in the case of the}} chine, enclosed area and centroid. These geometric parameters have physical, hydrodynamic, and stability implications from the design point of view. The proposed method uses two-dimensional orthogonal projections of the control curves and then produces three-dimensional (3 -D) definitions using B-spline fitting of the 3 -D data points. The fitting considers maximum deviation from the curve to the data points and is based on an original selection of the parameterization. A net of B-spline curves (stations) is then created to match the previously defined 3 -D boundaries. A final set of lofting surfaces of the previous B-spline curves produces the hull surface...|$|R

Methods: Patients receiving platinum-based doublets in the first-line setting for AdvNS-NSCLC from 2010 to 2012 in two Chinese tertiary hospitals were identified to create the retrospective study cohort. Propensity score methods were used to create matched treatment groups for head-to-head comparisons on HCTC between pemetrexed–platinum and other platinum-based doublets. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to rank studied platinum-based doublets for their associations with the log 10 scale of HCTC for nonchemotherapy drugs and nondrug care. Results: Propensity score methods created matched treatment groups for pemetrexed–platinum versus docetaxel–platinum (61 pairs), paclitaxel–platinum (39 pairs), gemcitabine–platinum (93 pairs), and vinorelbine–platinum (73 pairs), respectively. Even though the log 10 scale of HCTC for nonchemotherapy drugs and nondrug care associated with pemetrexed–platinum was ranked lowest in all patients (coefficient – 0. 174, P= 0. 015), which included patients experiencing any hematological adverse events (coefficient – 0. 199, P= 0. 013), neutropenia (coefficient – 0. 426, P= 0. 021), or leukopenia (coefficient – 0. 406, P= 0. 001), pemetrexed–platinum had the highest total HCTC (median difference from RMB 1, 692 to RMB 7, 400, P< 0. 001) among platinum-based doublets because of its higher drug acquisition costs (median difference from RMB 4, 636 to RMB 7, 332, P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Among Chinese patients receiving platinum-based doublets in the first-line setting for AdvNS-NSCLC, the higher acquisition costs for nonplatinum cytotoxic drugs associated with pemetrexed–platinum could be partially offset by its significantly lower hospital costs for nonchemotherapy drugs and nondrug care.
