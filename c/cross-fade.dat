500|$|On the Sgt. Pepper album, {{the start}} of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] is {{cross-faded}} with the applause {{at the end of}} the previous track [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)". On The Beatles 1967–1970 LP, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] fades in through the Sgt. Pepper <b>cross-fade,</b> but on [...] and the CD version of 1967–1970, the song starts cleanly, without any fade or <b>cross-fade.</b> Also, the [...] "1967–1970" [...] CD does not have the sped up ending, and instead it just ends after the E Major chord has faded enough so nobody could hear it.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, the reprise was re-released on {{the album}} Love, which was a {{theatrical}} production by Cirque du Soleil. The updated version is a remix featuring samples of other Beatles' songs and fades out before the <b>cross-fade</b> into [...] "A Day in the Life".|$|E
500|$|The final {{recording}} session {{occurred on}} 5 August, when McCartney {{made a number}} of tape loops at Abbey Road, including bells, birds, bubbles and chirping crickets. Martin mixed the track into stereo on 13 August, and made 11 attempts at a final mix, combining the tape loops with the <b>cross-fade</b> into [...] "Sun King", replacing the earlier organ note. He made another attempt at a final mix on 21 August, and this was used for the finished master.|$|E

40|$|In earlier research, we {{applied a}} linear {{weighted}} <b>cross-fading</b> function to ensure smooth concatenation. However, this can cause unnaturally shaped spectral trajectories. We propose context-sensitive <b>cross-fading.</b> To train this system, a perceptually validated cost function is needed, {{which is the}} focus of this paper. A corpus was designed to generate a variety of formant trajectory shapes. A perceptual experiment was performed and a multiple linear regression model was applied to predict perceptual quality ratings from various distances between <b>cross-faded</b> and natural trajectories. Results show that perceptual quality could be predicted well from the proposed distance measures. Index Terms: perceptual score, formant frequency, crossfading function, concatenation error...|$|R

500|$|While {{promoting}} 2014's The Endless River, Nick Mason named A Saucerful of Secrets as his favourite of Pink Floyd's studio albums. “I {{think there}} are ideas contained there that we have continued to use {{all the way through}} our career,” he says. “I think [...] was a quite good way of marking Syd ’s departure and Dave ’s arrival. It’s rather nice to have it on one record, where you get both things. It’s a <b>cross-fade</b> rather than a cut.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{track was}} {{completed}} in Abbey Road Studios. McCartney overdubbed a lead vocal onto the basic track on 1 July, and further vocals and sound effects were added on 15 July. On 30 July, a reduction mix {{was made of the}} original eight track tape, so further overdubs could be made, and a rough mix of the Abbey Road medley was put together. The <b>cross-fade</b> from [...] "You Never Give Me Your Money" [...] into the next track, [...] "Sun King", proved to be problematic, and the group made several attempts before deciding to merge the songs via an organ note. McCartney completed the instrumental overdubs the next day, on 31 July, by adding a bass guitar part and additional piano overdubs, including some punched-in honky-tonk piano in place of the original.|$|E
50|$|A {{cross-over}} {{can either}} be used between two unrelated pieces of music or between two sounds that are similar; {{in both of these}} cases, one would like the sound to be one continuous sound without any bumps. When applying a <b>cross-fade</b> between two very different pieces of music (relating to both tone and pitch), one could simply use a <b>cross-fade</b> between the two pieces, make a few minor adjustments. This is because the two sounds are different from one another. In the case of a <b>cross-fade</b> between two sounds, that are similar, phase-cancellation can become an issue. The two sounds that are cross-faded should be brought into comparison with one another. If both sounds are moving upward they will have a cumulative effect - when added together, this is what one wants. What is not desirable is when both sounds are moving in a different direction, since this can lead to cancelations. This leads to no sound on areas where the amplitudes cancel out one another; there will thus be silence {{in the middle of the}} <b>cross-fade.</b> This occurrence is rare though since the parameters have to be the same. Commonly a <b>cross-fade</b> will result in a gradual reduction in the amount of the sample whose pitch is lower, and an increase will be found on the pitch that is higher. The longer a <b>cross-fade,</b> the more likely a problem will occur. One also does not want the effect of the <b>cross-fade</b> to be very prominent in the middle of the notes, since if different notes are between the edit point there will be a time when both of the sounds can be heard simultaneously. This overlapping is not expected from a normal singing voice, no reference to Overtone singing.|$|E
50|$|The duo also {{directed}} the song's music video, which featured faces blended {{into each other}} using analogue <b>cross-fading.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Cross-fading</b> usually {{involves}} the sounding {{of a combination}} of one or two sounds at the same time. While <b>cross-fading</b> one does not want {{the second part of the}} fade to start playing before the first part is finished; one wants the overlapping parts to be as short as possible. If edit regions aren’t trimmed to a zero-crossing point one will get unwelcome pops in the middle. A sound at the lowest velocity can fade into a sound of a higher velocity, in the order of: first the first sound then the second. All possible without fading out the sounds that are already present. This in turn is a form of Layering that can be used in the mix. The same effect (as was created with velocity) can be applied to a controller. This allows continued monitored control; the <b>cross-fading</b> function can also be controlled on some instruments by the keyboard position. These sounds on the MIDI keyboard can be programmed.|$|R
50|$|The eight track {{tape was}} then turned over, and Campbell played against the reverse {{sound of the}} track, {{including}} his initial first four bars ensuring that he played another long “G” near the same point which could be <b>cross-faded</b> against the original - the tape was then turned over to normal setup, and he selected just 4 bars from the reverse recording which are bars 4-7 inclusive - this was <b>cross-faded</b> with the original at bar 4 - lhe then picked up from bar 8 through to bar 16 as normal, so in fact, only 4 bars are actually “reversed”.|$|R
50|$|The Korg Wavestation {{went further}} still, {{allowing}} {{each of the}} four sound sources to produce not just a static tone, but a complex wave sequence, by playing back or <b>cross-fading</b> one wave after another.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{software}} applications that feature virtual cross-fades, for instance, burning-software for {{the recording of}} audio-CDs. Also many DAW’s (Pro Tools, Logic exc.) have this function. <b>Cross-fade</b> is normally found on samplers and usually based on velocity. The purpose of a <b>cross-fade</b> it to utilize a smooth changeover between two cut pieces of audio. Velocity cross-fading can be incorporated through a MIDI transformation device and where more than one note can be assigned to a given pad (note) on the MIDI keyboard; velocity cross-fading may be available.|$|E
5000|$|Initially {{released}} on two 45rpm vinyl LPs, the album's twelve songs are segued together into four colour coded (red, green, blue, black), <b>cross-faded</b> suites. As such, {{the album was}} included in Pitchfork Media's 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".|$|R
5000|$|Cacophonous {{feedback}} fade-outs {{ending a}} song {{are most often}} used to generate rather than relieve tension, often <b>cross-faded</b> too after a thematic and musical release. Examples include Modwheelmood's remix of Nine Inch Nail's [...] "The Great Destroyer"; and the Jesus and Mary Chain's [...] "Teenage Lust", [...] "Tumbledown", [...] "Catchfire", [...] "Sundown", and [...] "Frequency".|$|R
5000|$|The pair's {{innovation}} {{extended to}} their videos {{for their own}} songs, notably [...] "Wide Boy" [...] and [...] "Cry". The latter's groundbreaking 1985 video consisted of faces blending into one other using analog <b>cross-fading,</b> anticipating the digital effect of morphing, later used {{in a similar way}} in Michael Jackson's 1991 video, [...] "Black or White".|$|R
5000|$|The 1996 remaster was remixed by Jon Astley. On the remaster, {{the end of}} [...] "They Are All in Love" [...] is {{cross-faded}} with [...] "Blue, Red and Grey." [...] The original album did not feature this <b>cross-fade.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{exponential}} curve shape {{is in many}} ways the precise opposite of the logarithmic curves. The fade-in works as follows: it increases in volume slowly and then it shoots up very quickly {{at the end of the}} fade. The fade-out drops very quickly (from the maximum volume) and then declines slowly again over the duration of the fade. Simply stated a linear fade could thus be seen as an exaggerated version of an exponential fade in terms of the apparent volume. Thus the impression that would be gathered from an {{exponential curve}}’s fade would sound as though the sound was rapidly accelerating towards the listener. Natural ambience can also be repressed by using an exponential fade-out. A <b>cross-fade,</b> in the exponential shape, will have a perceivable dip in the middle, which is very undesirable in music and vocals. This depends largely on the length of the <b>cross-fade,</b> a long <b>cross-fade</b> on ambient sounds can sound perfectly satisfactory (the dip can add a little breath to the music). Exponential crossfades (or a curve with a similar shape) have a smaller drop in the middle of the fade.|$|E

5000|$|Track 8.2, the outro of {{the album}} {{at the end of}} track 8, {{consists}} of a cover of [...] "Sono L'Antechristo" [...] by Diamanda Galás, and is <b>cross-faded</b> in from [...] "Blood Libels" [...] from 6:18 on. It is unmentioned in the track listing on the release, but referred to in the credit prints.|$|R
2500|$|On The Beatles album, {{the end of}} [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R" [...] is <b>cross-faded</b> {{with the}} start of the next track [...] "Dear Prudence". On The Beatles 1967–1970, [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R" [...] fades out before the cross fade of Dear Prudence starts. This is also the case on the remixed version of the song from Love.|$|R
50|$|Froggy again {{improved}} his sound system further and, like Levan, became experienced at <b>cross-fading.</b> It {{was not long}} after this that the Soul Mafia, using the system deployed by him, were playing to audiences at Knebworth. His creation continued as a hired-out concern in the mid-1980s 'rare-groove' scene as well as during the early rave movement.|$|R
