40|$|Abstract The {{analytical}} scanning {{electron microscope}} (SEM) {{has been used to}} deter-mine the presence and distribution of atomic elements in mineralogy. How-ever, the detection of light elements such as carbon is difficult to obtain with standard energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and usual pro-ceedings for SEM. This study proposes a new protocol to detect calcium carbonate by SEM/EDS using sediments from the Jaguaribe River estuary, NE Brazil, as a model. Handmade gold mounting discs (Au stubs) were used as sample support and samples were adhered with inexpensive glue (Loctite Super_Bonder) or directly disposed on the Au stubs. CaCO 3 and NaCl for chemical analysis were used as control and counterproof to the <b>carbon</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape.</b> Control salts EDS analyses indicate that the method was efficient to detect light elements. Sediments obtained from dif-ferent depths in the core sampled at the Jaguaribe River estuary consist of particles and aggregates with diverse morphology that covers a wide range of particle or aggregate size.

40|$|Clostridium difficile Ã a maior causa de colite associada ao uso de antibiÃticos, com significante morbidade e mortalidade. Glutamina (Gln), um aminoÃcido nÃo-essencial, Ã a maior fonte combustÃvel para a dinÃmica das cÃlulas intestinais. Alanil-glutamina (Ala-Gln) Ã um dipeptÃdeo, altamente solÃvel e bem tolerado. O objetivo deste estudo foi analisar as alteraÃÃes induzidas pela toxina A (TcdA) do Clostridium difficile na morfologia e elementos do citoesqueleto das cÃlulas epiteliais intestinais e o efeito do tratamento com Gln e Ala-Gln, utilizando tÃcnicas avanÃadas de microscopia. Placas de cultura de cÃlulas com doze poÃos, previamente acrescidas de lamÃnulas de vidro, com diÃmetro de 13 mm, IEC- 6, 5 x 105 foram semeadas e cultivadas por 24 horas em meio DMEM. Depois, as cÃlulas foram incubadas por 24 h de acordo com os seguintes grupos: Controle, TcdA (10 ng / mL), TcdA + Gln (10 mM) e TcdA + Ala-Gln (10 mM). As cÃlulas foram fixados em formol a 4 % por 14 h, depois foram examinados na microscopia de forÃa atÃmica (AFM), microscopia eletrÃnica de varredura (SEM), microscopia {{confocal}} e fluorescente. Para o SEM as amostras foram fixadas em porta amostras fita adesiva de carbono e cobertos com uma pelÃcula de ouro 15 mm para adquirir condutividade por pulverizaÃÃo catÃdica. Para microscopia de fluorescÃncia e o confocal, as cÃlulas foram permeabilizadas com PBS/Triton depois foram marcados com RhoA- FITC, Faloidina âRodamina e DAPI e as imagens capturadas atravÃs de um microscÃpio invertido de fluorescÃncia ou confocal. Um immunoblotting foi realizado com os mesmos grupos. A membrana PVDF foi incubada com o anticorpo RhoA overnight, em seguida ativado pelo kit Amershan. O controle protÃico foi feito por &# 945;-tubulina. TambÃm realizarmos experimentos de proliferaÃÃo celular e estresse oxidativo. Observou-se que a TcdA causa intenso encolhimento celular restando mÃltiplas extensÃes filamentosas. Esta alteraÃÃo na forma foi associada ao colapso do citoesqueleto de F-actina demonstrada na microscopia de fluorescÃncia. Um aumento da produÃÃo RhoA foi detectada no grupo tratado com Gln e Ala-Gln. Demonstramos que a morfologia das cÃlulas intestinais e organizaÃÃo do citoesqueleto foram dramaticamente alteradas pela TcdA e que a suplementaÃÃo com Ala-Gln e Gln impediu o dano celular epitelial intestinal induzida pela TcdA provavelmente por aumentar a expressÃo RhoA. A TcdA induziu uma reduÃÃo de 8, 4 % na proliferaÃÃo celular, enquanto o Ala-Gln e Gln aumentou 13, 2 % e 12, 7 %, respectivamente. A TcdA induziu as cÃlulas ao dano oxidativo, que foi revertido com o uso de Gln e Ala-Gln. Nossos resultados fornecem justificativa para o uso potencial de Ala-Gln e Gln como terapia adjuvante na doenÃa causada pelo Clostridium difficile. InvestigaÃÃo de alteraÃÃes morfolÃgicas e citoesqueleto usando avanÃadas tÃcnicas de microscopia pode auxiliar na avaliaÃÃo da atividade de proteÃÃo ou terapÃutica de drogas contra os efeitos TcdA. Clostridium difficile is {{the major}} cause of antibiotic-associated colitis, a disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Glutamine (Gln), a non-essential aminoacid, is a major fuel for the dynamic intestinal cell population. Alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln) is a dipeptide that is highly soluble and well tolerated. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the changes induced by Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) in intestinal epithelial cell morphology and cytoskeletal element and the effect of Gln and Ala-Gln treatment, using advanced microscopic techniques. Twelve well cell culture plates, with 13 mm diameter glass coverlids, were seeded with 5 x 105 IEC- 6 cells and grown for 24 h in DMEM media. Afterwards, the wells were incubated for 24 h as follow: control, TcdA (10 ng/mL), TcdA + Gln (10 mM) and TcdA + Ala-Gln (10 mM). The cells were than fixed in 4 % formaldehyde for 14 h and afterwards they were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Fluorescent microscopy. For the SEM the samples were fixed to samples holders with <b>carbon</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> and covered with a 15 mm gold film for conductivity by sputter. To fluorescent microscopy the cells were permeabilizided with PBS/Triton after that they were marked with stained with FITC-RhoA, Rodhamine-phallodin and DAPI performed using an inverted fluorescence microscope. An immunoblotting was realized with the same groups. The PVDF membrane was incubated with RhoA antibody overnight and afterwards activated by Amershan kit. The proteic control was made by &# 945;- tubulin. Also performed experiments of cellular proliferation and oxidative stress. As observed by AFM, SEM and Fluorescent microscopy TcdA caused intense cell shrinkage with multiple extensions. This change in shape was associated with collapse of the F-actin cytoskeleton demonstrated by fluorescent microscopy. An increase of RhoA production was detected in the groups treated with Gln e Ala-Gln. We demonstrated that TcdA dramatically altered the intestinal cell morphology and cytoskeleton organization and that Ala-Gln and Gln supplementation consistently prevented the intestinal epithelial cell damage induced by TcdA probably by increasing RhoA expression. The TcdA induced a reduction of 8. 4 % in cell proliferation while the Ala-Gln and Gln increased by 13. 2 % and 12. 7 %, respectively. The TcdA induced cells to oxidative damage, which was reversed by the use of Gln and Ala-Gln [...] Our findings provide rationale for the potential use of Ala-Gln and Gln as adjuvant therapy in Clostridium difficile disease. Investigation of morphological and cytoskeleton changes using advanced microscopic techniques may aid in the evaluation of the protective or therapeutic activity of drugs against TcdA effects...|$|E

From each stool sample, a single Kato-Katz thick smear was prepared and examined quantitatively. Additionally, the first stool sample was subjected to the FLOTAC technique and helminth eggs were counted. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> were checked for the presence of Enterobius vermicularis eggs. Using pooled results as a diagnostic 'gold' standard, the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, E. vermicularis, Hymenolepis nana and Dicrocoelium dendriticum were 54. 4 %, 13. 3 %, 11. 1 % and 11. 1 %, respectively. Infection intensities were low. When compared to triplicate Kato-Katz, a single FLOTAC was more sensitive for the diagnosis of A. lumbricoides (89. 5 % versus 39. 5 %) and D. dendriticum (88. 9 % versus 33. 3 %), but less sensitive for H. nana (66. 7 % versus 88. 9 %).
