5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an archiepiscopal <b>cross</b> <b>on</b> their arms. Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross, as {{is found in the}} arms of Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|Class II {{stones are}} {{carefully}} shaped slabs dating after {{the arrival of}} Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a <b>cross</b> <b>on</b> one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic <b>cross</b> <b>on</b> the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.|$|E

The chief of Ichisi cooperated fully, and {{informed}} the Spanish about the nearby paramount chief, Ocute. De Soto erected a wooden <b>cross</b> <b>on</b> one of the mounds before heading to Ocute.|$|E

5|$|During Ezana's reign a {{major change}} in both the Aksumite kingdom and its coinage took place {{as a result of the}} change of the {{official}} religion to Christianity, one of the first states ever to do so. While Ezana's coins in the first half of his reign are almost identical to those of Aphilas, barring minimal weight reductions, those of his second half employ revolutionary designs. With his conversion to Christianity, Ezana began to feature the <b>Cross</b> <b>on</b> his coins, the first time the Christian cross had ever been featured in coinage in the world. Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before Constantine I's weight reform in 324, indicating a conversion before this date or perhaps a few years after, as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately. Along with the adoption of the <b>Cross</b> <b>on</b> his coins came, of course, the abandonment of the star and crescent symbol on the coins. Later Christian coins reflect the adoptment of the 4.54 g standard by Constantine, with theoretical weights in Aksumite coins likewise dropping to 1.70 g for the gold coins.|$|E

5|$|Saint Michael the Archangel appears {{often in}} heraldic settings.

5|$|About 250 Pictish stones {{survive and}} have been {{assigned}} by scholars to three classes. Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the 7th century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals including fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries, with a <b>cross</b> <b>on</b> one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic <b>cross</b> <b>on</b> the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow.

5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining <b>cross</b> <b>on</b> its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a <b>cross</b> <b>on</b> the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|After a {{good run}} of form with Tottenham {{and being the}} third top goal scorer in the Premier League just behind Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero with 16 goals on 19 March 2015, Kane was named by manager Roy Hodgson in the England squad to face Lithuania in a UEFA Euro 2016 {{qualifying}} match and Italy in a friendly. He made his international debut at Wembley Stadium, replacing Wayne Rooney {{in the second half}} of the match against Lithuania, and scoring just 80 seconds later with a header from a Raheem Sterling <b>cross.</b> <b>On</b> 30 March 2015, the day before the Italy match, Hodgson announced that Kane would start alongside Rooney, and he played the full 90 minutes of the 1–1 draw at Juventus Stadium.|$|E
