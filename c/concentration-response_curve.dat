The goal of this in	vitro {{study was to examine the}} effect of indigo carmine on phenylephrine-induced contractions in an isolated rat aorta and to determine the associated cellular mechanism with particular focus on the endothelium-derived vasodilators. Methods: The <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> for phenylephrine were generated in the presence or absence of indigo carmine. Phenylephrine <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> were generated for the endothelium-intact rings pretreated independently with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, and a low-molecular-weight superoxide anion scavenger, tiron, in the presence or absence of indigo carmine. The fluorescence of oxidized dichlorofluorescein was measured in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells cultured in the control, indigo carmine alone and tiron plus indigo carmine. Results: Indigo carmine (10 - 5 M) increased the phenylephrine-induced maximum contraction in the endothelium-intact rings with or without indomethacin, whereas indigo carmine produced a slight leftward shift in the phenylephrine <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> in the endothelium-denuded rings and L-NAME-pretreated endothelium-intact rings. In the endothelium-intact rings pretreated with tiron (10 - 2 M), indigo carmine did not alter phenylephrine <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> significantly. Indigo carmine (10 - 5 M) increased the fluorescence of oxidized dichlorofluorescein in the vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas tiron abolished the indigo carmine-induced increase in oxidized dichlorofluorescein fluorescence.

The P 2 X 4 receptor mutations H 140 A and H 286 A did not significantly alter ethanol inhibition of ATP-activated current. By contrast, the mutation H 241 A changed the mechanism by which ethanol inhibits receptor function; viz., ethanol inhibition was not associated with an increased EC 50 value of the ATP <b>concentration–response</b> <b>curve,</b> instead, ethanol decreased the maximal response to ATP without affecting the EC 50 value of the ATP <b>concentration–response</b> <b>curve.</b> Ethanol inhibition of the H 241 A mutant was voltage independent between − 60 and + 20 [*]mV and ethanol did not alter the reversal potential of ATP-activated current.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{investigated}} the responsiveness {{of the mouse}} basilar artery to acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin (BK), noradrenaline (NA), 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), histamine (His) and angiotensin (Ang) II in order to characterize the related receptor subtypes in vitro. ACh and BK induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of precontracted arteries with U- 46619 (a thromboxane A 2 analogue). Atropine (a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist) and Nω-nitro-L-arginine (a NO synthase inhibitor, L-NNA) shifted the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curve</b> for ACh to the right, whereas pirenzepine, methoctramine and pFHHSiD (muscarinic M 1, M 2 and M 3 antagonists, respectively) had no significant effect. L-NNA and HOE 140 (a B 2 antagonist) shifted the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curve</b> for BK to the right, whereas des-Arg 9 -[Leu 8]-BK (a B 1 antagonist) and indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) had no significant effect. NA failed to produce any vasomotor action. His and Ang II induced concentration-dependent contraction. Diphenhydramine (a H 1 antagonist) shifted the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curve</b> for His to the right, whereas cimetidine (a H 2 antagonist) had no significant effect. Losartan (an AT 1 antagonist) shifted the concentra-tion-response curve for Ang II to the right, whereas PD 123319 (an AT 2 antagonist) had no significant effect. These {{results suggest that the}} H 1 and AT 1 receptor subtypes might {{play an important role in}} arterial contraction, whereas muscarinic receptor subtypes apart from M 1, M 2 and M 3, and B 2 receptors on the endothelium, might modify these contractions to relaxations...|$|E
40|$|Relaxant {{responses}} to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, procaterol, have been examined on preparations of guinea-pig pulmonary artery (beta 2 -adrenoceptors only), rat and rabbit pulmonary artery and rat aorta (beta 2 greater than beta 1), and these responses have been compared with responses of dog left circumflex coronary artery (beta 1 only). Low concentrations of procaterol (3 nM to 100 nM) relaxed KC 1 -contracted preparations of rat aorta and pulmonary artery from rat, rabbit and guinea-pig whereas high concentrations (greater than 1 microM) were required to relax preparations of the dog left circumflex coronary artery. The dissociation constant (KP value) for procaterol on beta 1 -adrenoceptors was 4. 9 microM (determined on dog coronary artery) and on beta 2 -adrenoceptors was 0. 008 microM (rabbit pulmonary artery). Procaterol therefore had a beta 2 :beta 1 selectivity value of 612. KP values obtained on guinea-pig atria for procaterol, on which the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curve</b> was biphasic, confirmed that both beta 2 - and beta 1 -adrenoceptors mediate responses of this tissue. The KP values were 0. 009 microM (data from {{the first phase of}} the control <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curve)</b> and 3. 5 microM (data from the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curve</b> in the presence of the beta 2 -selective antagonist, ICI 118, 551, 10 nM). Data obtained on rat atria indicated that chronotropic responses of preparations from some rats, but not others, involved a minor population of beta 2 -adrenoceptors, but the beta 2 -adrenoceptors, when present, were less important than in guinea-pig atria.

40|$|The {{influence}} of norepinephrine on {{the diameter of}} single pial arteries and arterioles was investigated by adding the drug to the perivascular space with micropipettes. The mock spinal fluid solution in which the norepinephrine was dissolved contained 0, 11, or 22 mEq/liter of bicarbonate. These concentrations of bicarbonate were by themselves found to dilate, cause no change, and constrict the pial vessels, respectively. <b>Concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> with 11 mEq/liter of bicarbonate over the concentration range of 5 X 1 O" * to 5 mmoles/liter of norepinephrine showed significant constriction at 5 X 10 ~ 2 mmoles/liter and maximal constriction (40 % of diameter) at 2. 5 mmoles/liter. In bicarbonate-free solution, {{the slope of the}} <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> was less, and at 22 mEq/liter of bicarbonate norepinephrine had no effect. The pial arteries seemed to be less sensitive than the mesenteric and the cremasteric arteries to norepinephrine.

40|$|Ring {{segments}} (I mm in diameter) of the {{pulmonary artery}} obtained from 16 patients undergoing thoracic surgery were mounted in tissue baths. Cumulative <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> of some prostanoids and amines were obtained, and Emax and pEC 50 values calculated. Noradrenaline, phenylephrine, clonidine and serotonin (5 -HT) showed low intrinsic activities. Prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha) induced strong contractions with an Emax of 126 % {{of the preceding}} K+ (124 mM) -induced contraction, but its potency was low (pEC 50 = 5. 70). The thromboxane receptor agonists U- 46619 and U- 44069 induced strong contractions (Emax = 139 % and 133 % respectively) and were significantly more potent than the other drugs used (pEC 50 = 8. 43 and 8. 30 respectively). The thromboxane receptor antagonist BM- 13. 505 (10 (- 8) to 10 (- 6) M) caused rightward parallel shifts of the U- 46619 <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> without reduction of Emax, indicating competitive antagonism...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} with rat vas deferens to verify whether agmatine, an endogenous ligand for adrenoceptors and imidazoline receptors, can influence sympathetic neurotransmission, {{with respect to}} contractions induced by transmural nerve stimulation, contractions induced by exogenous noradrenaline, and overflow of endogenous noradrenaline. It was shown that agmatine (a) caused a dose-dependent potentiation of electrically induced twitches, up to about 70 % in relation to controls, (b) shifted to the right the inhibitory <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> for clonidine on electrically induced twitches, indicating competitive antagonism at presynaptic ol-adrenoceptors, with a pA(2) value of 4. 12 +/- 0. 10, (c) shifted to the right the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>curves</b> for noradrenaline-induced contractions, indicating competitive antagonism at postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors as well, with a pA(2) value of 4. 03 +/- 0. 10, and (d) caused a dose-dependent increase of KCl-induced overflow of noradrenaline, up to about 90 % in relation to controls. It is concluded that agmatine has multiple effects on sympathetic neurotransmission in rat vas deferens.
