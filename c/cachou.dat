Cough tablets have taken the name lozenge, based on their original shape, a diamond.|$|E
5000|$|Senegalia catechu is a deciduous, thorny tree which {{grows up}} to 15 m in height. The plant is called khair [...] in Hindi, and kachu in Malay, {{hence the name}} was Latinized to [...] "catechu" [...] in Linnaean taxonomy, as the type-species from which the {{extracts}} cutch and catechu are derived. Common names for it include kher, catechu, <b>cachou,</b> cutchtree, black cutch, and black catechu.|$|E
5000|$|Catechu ( [...] or [...] ) is {{an extract}} of acacia trees used {{variously}} {{as a food}} additive, astringent, tannin, and dye. It is extracted from several species of Acacia, but especially Senegalia catechu (Acacia catechu), by boiling the wood in water and evaporating the resulting brew. It {{is also known as}} cutch, black cutch, <b>cachou,</b> cashoo, khoyer, terra Japonica, or Japan earth, and also katha in Hindi, kaath in Marathi, khoyer in Assamese and Bengali, and kachu in Malay (hence the Latinized Acacia catechu chosen as the Linnaean taxonomy name of the type-species Acacia plant which provides the extract).|$|E

The following year she sang a duet with Renaud Hantson on his EP track [...] "Chasseur solitaire". The track is on Hantson's 1997 album Seulement humain and the 2006 re-release of the album. Her track Mauvaise herbe was used on the soundtrack of the 1998 movie Les Kidnapeurs. On February 12, 1999 at the Bataclan, Aurélie Saada {{played the role of}} The Colonel in Herbert Pagani's musical Megalopolis. She performed alongside Francis Lalanne, Dominique Guillo, Veronica Antico, Fabrice La Villehervé and <b>Cachou.</b> That same year the audio of the show was recorded and released on CD. Aurélie also performed in the 1999 production of Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov and in the 2001 production Becket or the Honour of God by Jean Anouilh.|$|E
