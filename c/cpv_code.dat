50|$|CPV {{codification}} {{consists of}} a main vocabulary which defines {{the subject of the}} contract, and a supplementary vocabulary to add further qualitative information. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure made up with codes of up to 9 digits (an 8 digit code plus a check digit). This combination of digits is associated with a wording that describes the type of supplies, works or services defining the subject of the contract. A Call for Tender is quite often described by more than one <b>CPV</b> <b>Code,</b> aiming to give a better and more detailed description of the object of the contract. Commercial organisations promoting public contracts to their members or readers generally use CPV codes to identify business sectors likely to be interested in specific tenders, along with NUTS Codes which indicate the country and region within which the contract is to be performed.|$|E
50|$|The light-touch regime (LTR) is a {{specific}} set of rules for certain service contracts which tend to be of lower interest to cross-border competition. Those service contracts include certain social, health and education services, defined by Common Procurement Vocabulary (<b>CPV)</b> <b>codes.</b> The list of services to which the Light-Touch Regime applies is set out in Schedule 3 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (Annex A). This regime allows for significantly fewer procedural limitations and only applies to services contracts valued over €750,000 (£589,148 in the UK).|$|R
40|$|We have mapped and {{determined}} the nucleotide {{sequence of the}} cowpox virus (<b>CPV)</b> gene <b>coding</b> for the protein of A-type inclusion bodies (ATI). The ATI gene was mapped to {{the central part of}} the largest HindlII restriction fragment of the CPV genome. Vaccinia virus (VV) also contained a similar sequence at the equivalent position in its genome, which even under stringent conditions hybridized with the CPV ATI gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the upstream region of the coding frame contained a sequence closely resembling the VV late promoter consensus sequence and that the gene encoded a protein of Mr 150000...|$|R
40|$|Let G be a {{connected}} graph and c a proper coloring of G. For i= 1, 2,…,k define the color class Ci as {{the set of}} vertices receiving color i. The color <b>code</b> <b>cP(v)</b> of a vertex v in G is the ordered k-tuple (d(v,C 1),…,d(v,Ck)) where d(v,C 1) is the distance of v to Ci. If all distinct vertices of G have distinct color codes, then c is called a locating-coloring of G. The locating-chromatic number of graph G, denoted by cL(G) is the smallest k such that G has a locating coloring with k colors. In this paper we discuss the locating-chromatic number of amalgamation of stars Sk,m. Sk,m is obtained from k copies of star K 1,m by identifying a leaf from each star. We also determine a sufficient condition for a connected subgraph HÍ Sk,m satisfying cL(H) ≤ cL(Sk,m) ...|$|R
