5000|$|Yumi Fuller hasn't {{set foot}} in her {{hometown}} of Liberty Falls, Idaho—heart of the potato-farming industry—since she ran away at age fifteen. Twenty-five years later, the prodigal daughter returns to confront her dying parents, her best friend, and her conflicted past, and finds herself caught up in an altogether new drama. The post-millennial farming community has been invaded by Agribusiness forces at war with a posse of activists, the Seeds of Resistance, who travel the country in a <b>camping</b> <b>car,</b> [...] "The Spudnik," [...] biofueled by pilfered McDonald's French-fry oil. The novel offers a quirky cast of characters and a wickedly humorous appreciation of the foibles of corporate life, globalization, political resistance, youth culture, and aging baby boomers. It is a celebratory tale of the beauty of seeds, roots, and growth—and the capacity for renewal that resides within us all.|$|E

5000|$|Stoves {{with two}} or more burners that may be {{operated}} together or separately are common for use in base <b>camp,</b> <b>car</b> <b>camping</b> and other situations involving cooking for larger groups. The folding [...] "suitcase" [...] style by Coleman is {{the best known of}} this design, and is intended to be used on a flat, stable surface such as a tabletop. This type of stove may have a separate fuel tank for each burner, or more commonly a single tank shared by both burners. Multiple burner stoves generally use compressed gas, alcohol or Naphtha (also known as White gas or Coleman fuel).|$|R

50|$|Other materials, notably {{cotton and}} wool, {{have also been}} used for {{sleeping}} bags. Wool repels water nicely and also resists compression, but it weighs much more than any alternative. Cotton suffers from high water retention and significant weight, but its low cost makes it an attractive option for uses like stationary <b>camping</b> or <b>car</b> <b>camping</b> where these drawbacks are of little consequence. Cotton insulation does not provide warmth if it becomes wet (due to the sleeping bag falling into water), so cotton-insulated sleeping bags are not used by professionals or serious hikers.|$|R

40|$|Early during Dictyostelium {{development}} {{a fundamental}} cell-fate decision establishes the anteroposterior (prestalk/prespore) axis. Signaling via the 7 -transmembrane <b>cAMP</b> receptor <b>CAR</b> 4 {{is essential for}} creating and maintaining a normal pattern; car 4 -null alleles have decreased levels of prestalk-specific mRNAs but enhanced expression of prespore genes. car 4 − cells produce all of the signals required for prestalk differentiation but lack an extracellular factor necessary for prespore differentiation of wild-type cells. This secreted factor decreases the sensitivity of prespore cells to inhibition by the prestalk morphogen DIF- 1. At the cell autonomous level, CAR 4 is linked to intracellular circuits that activate prestalk but inhibit prespore differentiation. The autonomous action of CAR 4 is antagonistic to the positive intracellular signals mediated by another <b>cAMP</b> receptor, <b>CAR</b> 1 and/or CAR 3. Additional data indicate that these CAR-mediated pathways converge at the serine/threonine protein kinase GSK 3, suggesting that the anterior (prestalk) /posterior (prespore) axis of Dictyostelium is regulated by an ancient mechanism that is shared by the Wnt/Fz circuits for dorsoventral patterning during early Xenopus development and establishing Drosophila segment polarity...|$|R
