50|$|There are no {{naturally}} occurring coniferous {{forests in the}} Rhön, but notable species of wild flower such as the <b>lady's</b> slipper orchid, <b>creeping</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> and burning-bush {{are found in the}} forests of mixed pine.|$|R
50|$|Some of Scotland's {{flowering}} plant species have extremely restricted ranges in the country. These include Diapensia lapponica, found {{only on the}} slopes of Sgurr an Utha, Argyll and Mountain Bearberry, recorded at only a few mainland locations, and on Skye and Orkney. The pinewoods of Strathspey contain rare species such as <b>Creeping</b> <b>Lady's</b> <b>Tresses,</b> Twinflower and the One-flowered Wintergreen. Plans to protect the Intermediate Wintergreen, also found here, were introduced in 2008. Other nationally rare species include Tufted Saxifrage, Alpine Catchfly, Sword-leaved Helleborine, Norwegian Sandwort, Dark-red Helleborine, Iceland Purslane, Small Cow-wheat and Yellow Oxytropis.|$|R

Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found.

5000|$|In Great Britain, Linnaea borealis ssp. borealis {{is listed}} as [...] "nationally scarce", growing mainly in open pine {{woodlands}} in Scotland and northernmost England. Foresters consider this plant to be an indicator species of ancient woodlands, often found in association with <b>creeping</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses.</b> It is found in about 50 sites around the country, with most situated in the woods around the Cairngorms; the southernmost locations are four sites in Northumberland and one in County Durham. The sparseness of the sites {{is responsible for the}} continued decline of the plant in the country. In Scotland, 37% of L. borealis patches studied consisted of a single genotype, reproducing clonally vegetatively but not producing viable seed. This is a conservation concern because without viable seed, the species {{may not be able to}} re-populate restored habitat, and may not be able to adapt to climate change by establishing new populations.|$|R

W lipcu 2011 roku znaleziono nowe stanowisko tego gatunku w Bieszczadach Zachodnich, u podnóży Jeleniowatego. Liczebność populacji oszacowano na 5160 rozetek, a areał wynosił około 200 m^ 2. This paper {{reports a}} new site of <b>creeping</b> <b>lady’s</b> <b>tresses</b> Goodyera repens in the Western Bieszczady region. Goodyera repens is an {{endangered}} orchid species occurring mainly in coniferous forests in lowlands {{and in the}} upper subalpine zones. According to the Red List of Plants and Fungi in Poland, the species faces {{a high risk of}} extinction at isolated locations outside the main area of occurrence. The stand described in this paper is the only site of this species in the Bieszczady Mountains confirmed after 1980 and the southernmost in Poland. It covers ca. 200 m 2 and is well isolated from the surrounding forest. It is characterised by relatively low and loose undergrowth and dominance of several moss species over higher plant taxa. The estimated density of Goodyera repens reaches 25 rosettes per 1 m 2, which is relatively high. A relevé describing the local floral diversity was made...|$|R

50|$|The genus Spiranthes {{contains}} about forty species, {{most of which}} are from North America. Some species are found in Central and South America, in temperate and tropical Asia southward to Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, three species occur in the wild. Besides the autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> these are the summer <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> S. aestivalis, and the Irish <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> S. romanzoffiana, a mainly North American species that also occurs in Ireland and western Scotland. The autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> is easily distinguished because the two other species of previously have inflorescences that occur earlier during the year (May-July) from a living rosette, with lanceolate leaves rising at an angle and having cream-colored instead of greenish or greyish white flowers. The autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> also resembles the evergreen Goodyera repens (creeping lady's-tresses or dwarf rattlesnake plantain), which has a creeping rhizome rather than tubers. The inflorescence emerges from the centre of a rosette of ovate leaves with a pointed tip, and has striking perpendicular connective veins. The flowers are covered in long hairs that are often tipped with tiny droplets.|$|R

50|$|Autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> may {{be found}} on quite {{different}} substrates, from weathered chalk and limestone to sand and gravel in dunes and slightly acidic heathlands.

50|$|Spiranthes magnicamporum, {{commonly}} called the Great Plains <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> is {{a species of}} orchid that is native to North America. It is primarily native in the Great Plains, but there are outlying populations in the east in areas of former natural grassland, such as the Black Belt prairies of the Southeast. It is found in both fens and wet and dry prairies, often in calcareous soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{grassland}} {{is dominated}} by grasses such as upright brome, sheep's fescue, {{and there is little}} tor-grass. The latter makes the common different from others in the region. Herbs include rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil, salad burnet and wild thyme. Orchids are in abundance including autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> green-winged orchid and fragrant orchid, particularly in the quarry areas. There are scrub areas of hawthorn and there some trees such as ash.|$|R
50|$|In 52% of {{the plants}} the flowers are {{arranged}} counterclockwise, in 39% clockwise and in 9% {{of the plants}} the flowers are {{to one side of}} the inflorescence. The pollinators always land at bottom of the inflorescence and visit the flowers ever higher up. Most bumblebees have a strong preference for counterclockwise arrangement, fewer for clockwise. It seems that autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> responds to this preference by offering different inflorescence types and thus increases the chances of fertilization.|$|R
