40|$|A <b>controlled</b> <b>{{language}}</b> is {{a subset}} of a natural language with artificially restricted vocabulary, grammar, and style. Texts written in a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> are usually less complex and less ambiguous than those written in an uncontrolled language. The use of a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> therefore produces better results in machine translation. On the other hand, a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> reduces the power of expression and decreases the writing speed. In short, a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> brings out the maximum performance of machine translation systems {{at the cost of}} the burden on source text authors. So the controlled lan-guage approach is suitable for translation for dissemina-tion of information. And a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> becomes more beneficial when texts are translated into multiple target languages...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> checker for Greek {{that has been}} {{implemented}} using Ellogon, a generic text engineering platform. A <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> is a language with a restricted syntax, vocabulary and terminology that is typically applied to technical documents. The aim of using <b>controlled</b> <b>languages</b> in technical documentation is the production of texts with simple structure and restricted vocabulary that can be read and translated easier (Eijk, 1998; Vouros et al. 1997). Several software companies (e. g. Bull, IBM) {{as well as other}} companies (e. g. Caterpillar, General Motors, Boeing) are already using <b>controlled</b> <b>languages</b> during technical writing of their products. The restrictions imposed by the use of a <b>controlled</b> <b>language,</b> help to preserve uniformity in the writing style, especially in cases where authors tend to follow diverse writing approaches, and to reduce ambiguities in the resulting text. Using a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> makes translation more efficient and improves the quality of the translated version. <b>Controlled</b> <b>language</b> can also facilitate machine translation systems since the resources provided for the <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> (vocabulary, terminology and syntax rules) can be embedded into the machine translation system, improving its performance.

25|$|Commands in the <b>Control</b> <b>Language</b> (CL) are promptable {{using the}} {{keyboard}} F4 function key, and most provide cursor-sensitive {{help to make}} specifying command parameters simpler. All command names and parameter keywords are based upon uniform standardized and mostly 3-letter abbreviations for verbs and subjects, making for easy rendering and interpretation by the application developer, as opposed to other operating systems with often cryptic or inconsistent command names for related functions or command parameter switches. For instance, the parameter keyword to apply a text description to any object to be created or changed is spelled the same way for all such commands.|$|E
40|$|While human-oriented <b>controlled</b> <b>languages</b> {{developed}} and {{applied in the}} domain of technical documentation have received considerable attention, <b>language</b> <b>control</b> exerted in the process of legislative drafting has, until recently, gone relatively unnoticed by the <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> community. This paper considers existing legislative drafting guidelines from the perspective of <b>controlled</b> <b>language.</b> It presents the results of a qualitative comparison of the rule sets of four German-language legislative drafting guidelines from Austria, Germany and Switzerland with a representative collection of <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> rules published by the German Professional Association for Technical Communication.

The words allowed in the lexicon of a <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> usually have a high polysemy index in the standard language. This is evident especially as far as grammatical and non-technical words are concerned. In contrast, technical terms are much more often monosemic. Thus the observation of the “one token = one meaning” principle in the lexicon for the <b>controlled</b> <b>language</b> has a great effect on the decline of ambiguity.

500|$|A {{predominant}} {{theme of}} the dictator novel is power, which according literary critic Michael Valdez Moses, in his 2002 review of Feast of the Goat, {{is linked to the}} theme of dictatorship: [...] "The enduring power of the Latin American dictator novel had {{everything to do with the}} enduring power of Latin American dictators". As novels such as El Señor Presidente became more well-known, they were read as ambitious political statements, denouncing the authority of dictators in Latin America. As political statements, dictator novel authors challenged dictatorial power, creating a link between power and writing through the force wielded by their pen. For example, in Roa Bastos's I, The Supreme, the novel revolves around a central theme of language and the power inherent in all of its forms, a power that is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarría argues that: Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of Policarpo Patiño ..., [...] his constant worry about writing all stem from the fact that he has found and used the power implicit in language itself.

Conversely, Interlingua distinguishes singular nouns from plural nouns because all the control languages do.

2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages, for example, to generate a version of a program in COBOL using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of COBOL code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code.

2500|$|Making {{the command}} {{interpreter}} an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix.

Since the shell and OS commands were [...] "just another program", the user could choose (or even write) his own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes (pipelines) made a powerful programming paradigm (coroutines) widely available.

2500|$|A word can be {{potentially}} {{present in}} a language when a derivative is present, but the word itself is not. English proximity, for example, gives support to Interlingua proxime, meaning 'near, close'. This counts {{as long as one}} or more control languages actually have this basic root word, which the Romance languages all do. Potentiality also occurs when a concept is represented as a compound or derivative in a <b>control</b> <b>language,</b> the morphemes that make it up are themselves international, and the combination adequately conveys the meaning of the larger word. An example is Italian fiammifero (lit. flamebearer), meaning [...] "match, lucifer", which leads to Interlingua flammifero, or [...] "match". This word is thus said to be potentially present in the other languages although they may represent the meaning with a single morpheme.|$|E
