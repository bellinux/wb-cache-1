Niacinamide has anti-inflammatory properties and is able to decrease the transfer of melanosomes. Objective. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of topical niacinamide versus hydroquinone (HQ) in melasma patients. Patients and Methods. Twenty-seven melasma patients were randomized to receive for eight weeks 4 % niacinamide cream {{on one side of the}} face, and 4 % HQ cream on the other. Sunscreen was applied along the observation period. They were assessed by noninvasive techniques for the evaluation of skin color, as well as subjective scales and histological sections initially and after the treatment with niacinamide. Results.

However, good to excellent improvement was observed with niacinamide in 44 % of patients, compared to 55 % with HQ. Niacinamide reduced importantly the mast cell infiltrate and showed improvement of solar elastosis in melasma skin. Side effects were present in 18 % with niacinamide versus 29 % with HQ. Conclusion.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze and compare the print quality by offset printing process on uncoated paper for matching the quality on par with ISO 12647 standards. A standard test form that contains different control strips for densitometric and <b>colorimetric</b> <b>measuring</b> has been used to define the optical density and color difference of the main process ink colors like cyan, magenta, yellow and black while printed on four-color Heidelberg CD 102 sheet-fed offset printing press. The results are important from scientific and practical point of view. By applying the regression analysis methods, the correlation between the optical density deviations ΔD from the optimal values and color difference ΔEab represented by the following regression model of Quadratic equation: ΔEab = a + bΔD + cΔD 2 (y = a + bx + cx 2) has been ascertained.

30|$|The {{correction}} of spatial non-uniformity of illumination should be implemented and/or specified using {{images of a}} uniform card (normally but not necessarily white) for each spectral band. The noise level should also be estimated by imaging with the system using the same physical setup but optically occluded. Some systems have a significant degree of scattered light and its magnitude should be estimated. Chromatic aberrations should be avoided {{as much as possible}} as they introduce wavelength-dependent image distortions that are difficult to correct by post-processing, i.e. variable misregistration and defocusing in different spectral bands. Using apochromatic optics will minimize the associated problems. The effects of the non-uniform spectral sensitivity of the sensor and its impact on signal-to-noise ratio should be taken into account. Data from the camera manufacturer or in-house calibration can be used to compensate for this effect. If the system employs different exposure times for different wavelengths this should be specified. We suggest that the image processing procedures should include ‘sanity checks’ at key points along the processing chain, for example to check on the tonal linearity of the data by using a neutral scale with multiple shades of grey from black to white, and to compare the reconstructed reflectance spectra against spectrophotometer reference measurements, including <b>colorimetric</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|R

40|$|The human {{visual system}} shows a {{relatively}} greater response to low spatial frequencies of chromatic spatial modulation than to luminance spatial modulation [1]. However, previous work [2, 3] {{has shown that}} this differential sensitivity to low spatial frequencies is not reflected in any differential luminance and chromatic content of general natural scenes. This {{is contrary to the}} prevailing assumption that the spatial properties of human vision ought to reflect the structure of natural scenes [4 – 6]. Now, <b>colorimetric</b> <b>measures</b> of scenes suggest that red-green (and perhaps blue-yellow) color discrimination in primates is particularly suited to the encoding of specific scenes: reddish or yellowish objects on a background of leaves [7 – 10]. We therefore ask whether the spatial, as well as chromatic, properties of such scenes are matched to the different spatial-encoding properties of color and luminance modulation in human vision. We show that the spatiochromatic properties of a wide class of scenes, which contain reddish objects (e. g., fruit) on a background of leaves, correspond well to the properties of the red-green (but not blue-yellow) systems in human vision, at viewing distances commensurate with typical grasping distance. This implies that the red-green system is particularly suited to encoding both the spatial and the chromatic structure of such scenes...|$|R

The three dominant factors producing color - light source, color sample, and observer - are described in detail. The standardized color spaces are shown and related color values are applied to characteristic color qualities of absorption as well as of effect colorants. The fundamentals of spectrometric and <b>colorimetric</b> <b>measuring</b> techniques together with specific applications are described. Theoretical models for radiative transfer in transparent, translucent, and opaque layers are detailed; the two, three, and multi-flux approximations are presented {{for the first time in}} a coherent formalism. These methods constitute the fundamentals not only for the important classical methods, but also modern methods of recipe prediction applicable to all known colorants. The text is supplied with 52 tables, more than 200 partially colored illustrations, an appendix, and a detailed bibliography. This work is recommended particularly for physicists, chemists, and engineers in color industry and related fields of research, development, production, and processing; this work provides the fundamentals over the widespread physical properties and applications of absorption and effect colorants and is suitable for both the beginner and experienced developer.

Calibration set of 10 production batches of finely grinded cooked sausage with food colorants added was manufactured in industrial conditions as follows: one control batch and 9 products with various quantities of added food colorants: E 120 (3. 4, 7. 5 and 12. 5 mg/kg), E 124 (5. 0, 15. 0, 25. 0 mg/kg) and E 129 (5. 0, 15. 0, 25. 0 mg/kg). The estimation of the added food colorants was assessed by measuring L*, a*, b* parameters of cross-section. The quantification of food colorants was achieved by HPLC-PDA. Food colorants were extracted from meat products using Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE). Quantification of food colorants was achieved in the range from 1 to 100 mg / kg, and recovery values were from 76. 15 % to 107. 04 %, for E 120, from 97. 61 % to 101. 03 %, for E 124 and from 99. 91 % to 101. 67 %, for E 129. Correlation of the results obtained using HPLC and <b>colorimetric</b> <b>measuring</b> data was assessed by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The results from colorimetric and chromatographic determinations in four experimental batches (three batches with different quantities of food colorants and one control batch) were used for calibration. Coefficients of determination (R 2) for linear models in experimental batches were 0. 954, for E 124, 0. 987, for E 120 and 0. 993, for E 129. Correlation functions of food colorant quantities and corresponding L*a*b* values were established.

40|$|Three {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of chloramines in water were compared using pH-buffered nanopure water and natural organic matter (NOM) solutions. We investigated whether the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) colorimetric method and/or an adapted indophenol method (Hach MonochlorF) are suitable for determining the concentration of monochloramine in drinking water. Membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS) {{was used as a}} reference analysis method to determine the different chloramine species in water. All methods measured monochloramine accurately in Nanopure water, but the DPD <b>colorimetric</b> method <b>measured</b> higher residuals (inorganic and organic chloramines) than MonochlorF or MIMS when in the presence of NOM due to organic chloramines. The indophenol method (MonochlorF) accurately detected only monochloramine and not other chloramine forms. Overall, the monochloramine concentration measured by MonochlorF was comparable with the MIMS results. A combined chlorine residual approach by the DPD colorimetric method does not differentiate between monochloramine and organic chloramines. Therefore, DPD colorimetric methods can overestimate disinfection efficacy in chloraminated water systems because of interference from organic chloramines that have no or poor bactericidal ability. Compared with the DPD colorimetric method, MonochlorF is a better choice for chloraminated water systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the relation between}} the art and science of colour perception and how computational procedures, which mimic our visual system, have been developed to advance digital imaging techniques for the enhancement of colour and image quality in digital photography and art. How to describe and measure colour is a problematic activity, for colour scientists, designers and artists alike. Furthermore, {{there is a difference between}} how the radiometry of colour is measured and how the appearance of colour is perceived. For contemporary colour science, there is a requirement to accurately measure and specify a colour. However when looking at art, at photographs and at real life situations, attempts to define what we ‘see’ are more complex. For example, if two colours are placed side by side, the eye might perceive modifications to the intensity of one colour when compared to another, and their <b>colorimetric</b> <b>measures</b> might not predict or correlate with the appearance. The experiments undertaken by Edwin Land in the 1950 s and the Retinex theory of colour vision (1964), links with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s experiments (Zur Farbenlehre, 1808). They can be regarded as examples that bridge the gap between biology, physics and art. Edwin Land is better known for his invention of the instant Polaroid film and camera. Moreover, he was interested in the human visual perception system, how colour is perceived in relation to its context and through his experiments developed the Retinex theory of colour vision (1964). Land and McCann’s Retinex (1971), starting with analogue electronics and quickly expanding to digital imagery, used a new approach based on computational algorithms that has made it possible and practical to manipulate images based on spatial methods of image enhancement, that has led to brighter and more colourful photographic images. (McCann, 2005 and 2008). Goethe’s interest in human perception as presented in his Farbenlehre (Eastlake, 1840) attempted to record his many observations on colour phenomena. One of his experiments with a prism investigated how fringes of colours appeared and changed according to different black and white patterns; the position of the edges revealed not just spectral colours but their complementary colours. Although separated by over 100 years, Goethe’s experiments in colour phenomena and perception correspond with Edwin Land’s theory of the human colour perception and his psychophysical experiments undertaken into human colour constancy and colour in context. Through their very different experiments, they attempted to gain a deeper understanding of physical vs. perceptual colour, and how the brain elaborates the physical signal in order to enhance the extraction of visual information – what appears in our brain and what lies in front of us.
