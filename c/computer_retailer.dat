500|$|Before Phantasmagoria was released, CompUSA, the nation's largest {{discount}} <b>computer</b> <b>retailer,</b> notified Sierra {{it would}} not stock the game. The company did not comment on specific reasons for their decision except for a written statement from chief operating officer Hal Compton: [...] "Software comes out all the time. Some we buy, some we don't. This one we chose not to." [...] Analysts believed CompUSA objected to the realistic violence in the game. Lee S. Isgur of Jefferies & Co., a global investment bank that followed the computer game industry, said CompUSA's decision probably would not harm overall sales of the game, {{and that it could}} in fact help it generate publicity. He added that [...] "It's probably one of the bloodiest games ever." [...] Likewise, Vincent Turzo of Jefferies & Co. said, [...] "When you say you're not going to carry something, of course the consumers rush to the stores to see what it's all about." [...] Roberta Williams said of CompUSA's announcement: [...] "I'm disappointed that they decided to make a stand with my product." [...] Some smaller retailers also decided not to stock Phantasmagoria, but others like Walmart continued to carry it.|$|E

This paper documents the survey results of computer and network security support provided to consumers by retailers in Perth, Western Australia between 2011 and 2012.

40|$|Despite the {{significant}} contribution to socio-economic development by SMEs (small and medium enterprises), their failure rate is very high in South Africa. Adoption and implementation of market orientation has been identified by various scholars {{as a means to}} mitigate SME failure in the highly competitive environments they operate in. This study investigated the factors influencing market orientation in SME <b>computer</b> <b>retailers</b> in King Williams Town and East London, South Africa. The objectives of the study were to investigate whether owner/manager involvement of had an influence on market orientation in SME <b>computer</b> <b>retailers,</b> to establish whether organisational systems and interdepartmental dynamics {{had an impact on the}} customer focused culture as well as investigate whether competitive intensity influenced the SME <b>computer</b> <b>retailers</b> to be market focused. Both primary and secondary data sources were used in this study. A quantitative research design was used in conducting this research. Simple random sampling, a probability sampling technique was used to select a sample of 104 from the sample frame of 141 registered SME <b>computer</b> <b>retailers.</b> The survey method, by way of a selfadministered questionnaire was used to collect primary data. The statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) as statistical software was used to analyse data. The Chi-square test, Pearson correlation, the t-test, and descriptive statistics were used to analyse data. The findings of this research found that there are factors influencing market orientation in SME <b>computer</b> <b>retailers,</b> such as owner/manager involvement. Competitive intensity was found to influence SME <b>computer</b> <b>retailers</b> to be market focused. It was also found that organisational systems and interdepartmental dynamics did not impact on the customer focused culture. The findings of this research showed that SME owner/managers hold the key to shaping an organisation‟s values and culture orientation therefore in order to be market orientated, they need pass on a clear message to the lower levels of the organisation. The careful implementation of organisational systems and interdepartmental dynamics that encourage market orientation as well as constant matching and monitoring of competitors was recommended to enable SMEs to be market orientated and in turn improve their business performance and success...|$|R

40|$|When an {{influential}} farmer who sells computers to his neighbours publicly describes {{the internet as}} 2 ̆ 7 the biggest pain 2 ̆ 7 for farmers and rural <b>computer</b> <b>retailers,</b> then it indicates that all is not well with the local rural internet service. The expanding {{use of the internet}} is exposing weaknesses in the rural telephone system, limitations in rural computer support services and a need {{for a wide range of}} training. This paper identifies the access and support problems experienced by a selection of early internet adopters in rural southern Queensland. Surveys and discussions were conducted with over 200 people who attended internet training events at Dalby and Applethorpe in southern Queensland in 1997. They perceived internet access to be costly and an often difficult and complex process. Existing ISPs and local computer support services had limited capabilities to cope with the complexity of factors needed to get local internet access to work consistently for different customers. Despite the promises of the internet, accessing it can be a major frustration for farmers and their computer suppliers. Better training and support services will be needed to expand rural internet use. The economic viability of rural internet services may be questionable unless the complex of social and technical constraints that early internet users are facing is not resolved...|$|R
